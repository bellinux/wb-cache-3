50|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of karyogamy is fusion of the two haploid nuclei. The first step in this process is {{the movement of the}} two pronuclei toward each other, which occurs directly after plasmogamy. Each pronucleus has a spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> that is embedded in the nuclear envelope and serves as an attachment point for microtubules. Microtubules, an important fiber-like component of the cytoskeleton, emerge at the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body.</b> The attachment point to the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> marks the minus end, and the plus end extends into the cytoplasm. The plus end has normal roles in mitotic division, but during nuclear congression, the plus ends are redirected. The microtubule plus ends attach to the opposite pronucleus, resulting in the pulling of the two pronuclei toward each other.|$|E
40|$|The tinA gene of Aspergillus nidulans encodes {{a protein}} that {{interacts with the}} NIMA mitotic protein kinase in a cell cycle-specific manner. Highly similar {{proteins}} are encoded in Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus fumigatus. TINA and NIMA preferentially interact in interphase and larger forms of TINA are generated during mitosis. Localization studies indicate that TINA is specifically localized to the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies</b> only during mitosis in a microtubule-dependent manner. Deletion of tinA alone is not lethal but displays synthetic lethality {{in combination with the}} anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome mutation bimE 7. At the bimE 7 metaphase arrest point, lack of TINA enhanced the nucleation of bundles of cytoplasmic microtubules from the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies.</b> These microtubules interacted to form spindles joined in series via astral microtubules as revealed by live cell imaging. Because TINA is modified and localizes to the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies</b> at mitosis, and lack of TINA causes enhanced production of cytoplasmic microtubules at metaphase arrest, we suggest TINA is involved in negative regulation of the astral microtubule organizing capacity of the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies</b> during metaphase...|$|R

50|$|Merging of {{the nuclear}} {{envelopes}} of the pi occurs in three steps: fusion of the outer membrane, fusion of the inner membrane, and fusion of the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies.</b> In yeast, {{several members of the}} Kar family of proteins, as well as a protamine, are required for the fusion of nuclear membranes. The protamine Prm3 is located on the outer surface of each nuclear membrane, and is required for the fusion of the outer membrane. The exact mechanism is not known. Kar5, a kinesin-like protein, is necessary to expand the distance between the outer and inner membranes in a phenomenon known as bridge expansion. Kar8 and Kar2 are thought to be necessary to the fusing of the inner membranes.As described above, the reorganization of accessory and motor proteins during pronuclear migration also serves to orient the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies</b> in the correct direction for efficient nuclear congression. Nuclear congression can still take place without this pre-orientation of spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies,</b> but it is slower.

40|$|Mutations in the ESP 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupt normal cell-cycle {{control and}} cause many cells in a mutant {{population}} to accumulate extra spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies.</b> To determine {{the stage at}} which the esp 1 gene product becomes essential for normal cell-cycle progression, synchronous cultures of ESP 1 mutant cells {{were exposed to the}} nonpermissive temperature for various periods of time. The mutant cells retained viability until the onset of mitosis, when their viability dropped markedly. Examination of these cells by fluorescence and electron microscopy showed the first detectable defect to be a structural failure in the spindle. Additionally, flow cytometric analysis of DNA content demonstrated that massive chromosome missegregation accompanied this failure of spindle function. Cytokinesis occurred despite the aberrant nuclear division, which often resulted in segregation of both spindle poles to the same cell. At later times, the missegregated spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies</b> entered a new cycle of duplication, thereby leading to the accumulation of extra spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies</b> within a single nucleus.

50|$|In {{the budding}} yeast, initial cell cycle entry is {{controlled}} by two regulatory complexes, SBF (SCB-binding factor) and MBF (MCB-binding factor). These two complexes control G1/S gene transcription; however, they are normally inactive. SBF is inhibited by the protein Whi5; however, when phosphorylated by Cln3-Cdk1, Whi5 is ejected from the nucleus, allowing for transcription of the G1/S regulon, which includes the G1/S cyclins Cln1,2. G1/S cyclin-Cdk1 activity leads to preparation for S phase entry (e.g., duplication of centromeres or the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body),</b> and {{a rise in the}} S cyclins (Clb5,6 in S. cerevisiae).

Oocytes treated with drugs that suppress microtubule dynamics exhibit spindles that are reoriented more vertically to the cortex than untreated controls.

50|$|Microtubule {{movement}} is mediated {{by a family}} of motor proteins known as kinesins, such as Kar3 in yeast.

Other proteins, such as Kar9 and Bim1 in yeast, attach to the plus end of the microtubules. They are activated by pheromone signals to attach to the shmoo tip. A shmoo is a projection of the cellular membrane which is the site of initial cell fusion in plasmogamy. After plasmogamy, the microtubule plus ends continue to grow towards the opposite pronucleus. It is thought that the growing plus end of the microtubule attaches directly to the motor protein of the opposite pronucleus, triggering a reorganization of the proteins at the half-bridge. The force necessary for migration occurs directly in response to this interaction.|$|E

50|$|The main central plaque {{component}} is coiled-coil protein Spc42p (for spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> component) {{also found to}} be a part of satellite, that forms a core crystal of SPB. The Spc42p protein is involved in initiation of SPB assembly and its duplication. The Spc42p associates with Spc110p and Spc29p, two other essential coiled-coil proteins that localize to the nuclear face of the SPB. Spc110 localizes to the central plaque and is thought to bind to Spc29p and calmodulin (Cmd1p). The role of Spc110p is a spacer molecule between the central and inner plaque and γ-tubilin complex binding protein. The essential function of calmodulin is at the SPB where it has been proposed to regulate binding of Spc110p to Spc29p. Spc29 forms in the central plaque a repeating structure. Spc98p and Spc97p are two similar yeast γ -tubulin (Tub4p) binding proteins required for microtubule nucleation. Spc98p, Spc97p and Tub4p are found at the inner and outer plaques of SPB and are involved in microtubules organization. Spc42 faces the cytoplasm and binds to coiled-coil Cnm67p (chaotic nuclear migration). Cnm67p forms dimers and functions as a spacer between IL2 and IL1. Cnm67 binds to the outer plaque protein Nud1p, a SPB protein required for exit from mitosis. Another coiled-coil protein, Spc72p, is also found in the outer plaque. Spc72p associates with Nud1p and to components of the γ-tubulin complex.|$|E

For most of the time taken by nuclear division the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>bodies</b> face each other squarely across the nuclear space but early in mitosis they briefly appear twisted out of alignment with each other, thereby imparting a sigmoidal shape to the bundle of spindle microtubules extending between them. This configur-ation is interpreted as indicating active participation of the spindle in the initial elongation of the dividing nucleus. It is proposed that mitosis is accompanied by the shortening of chromosomal microtubules simultaneously with the elongation of the central pole-to-pole bundle of microtubules of the intranuclear spindle.

The synthetic lethality between spo 7 Δ and mps 3 mutants was suppressed by deletion of specific nucleoporin genes. In fact, these gene deletions bypassed the requirement for Mps 3 p entirely, suggesting that under certain conditions spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> duplication can occur via an Mps 3 p-independent pathway. These data point to an antagonistic relationship between nuclear pore complexes and the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body.</b> We propose a model whereby nuclear pore complexes either compete with the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> for insertion into the nuclear membrane or affect spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> duplication by altering the nuclear envelope environment...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 The precise {{regulation}} and coordination of the mitotic spindle {{is vital for}} accurate chromosomal segregation within a dividing cell. The centrosome is the microtubule organizing center of the cell, responsible for nucleating and organizing the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. In yeast, the centrosome functional equivalent is called the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body.</b> The studies presented here aimed to understand how microtubules are nucleated at the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> and also studied the {{regulation and}} mechanical strength of the yeast spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> in vitro. In yeast, the γ-tubulin small complex, a highly conserved heterotetramer essential for microtubule nucleation, is composed of two copies of Tub 4, and one copy each of Spc 97 and Spc 98. In this study, a comprehensive mutagenesis technique coupled with high-throughput sequencing was used to identify regions of Spc 97 and Spc 98 that were essential {{for the formation of}} the γ-tubulin small complex and mutations that influenced the organization of the mitotic spindle. Regions essential for structure and function of the complex were mapped onto the protein sequence for both Spc 97 and Spc 98 and temperature sensitive mutants identified by the mutagenic screen were isolated and their unique nucleation phenotypes characterized. Improvements were made to historical spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> purification methods to facilitate a variety of in vitro biochemical and biophysical assays that had previously been hindered by technological constraints. Higher spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> yields, purity, and reproducibility enabled a re-evaluation of the yeast spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> cell cycle phosphoproteome. High confidence phosphorylation assignments were collected and compared to previously published data sets to reduce the ambiguity in the phosphoproteome data set while also expanding the data set to analyze the novel phosphorylation profile of the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> in G 1 /S. In vivo characterization of the high confidence phosphorylation sites revealed a combination of phosphorylation events in Spc 97 that were essential for cell viability. The adaptability of the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> purification methods also allowed for the purification of genetic mutants of the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body,</b> which were studied by biophysical assays. The strength of the microtubule attachment to the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> was probed by a laser trapping technique to determine how mutations in spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body</b> component Spc 110 affected the physical integrity of the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body.</b> It was shown that mutations in Spc 110 decreased the force at which the microtubule was pulled from the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>body,</b> providing mechanical evidence for in vivo phenotypes of mitotic spindle failure.
