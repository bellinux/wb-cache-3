40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the motion of diamond grains on the material removal rate and surface roughness in the lapping of Mn-Zn polycrystalline ferrite using a Sn lapping plate and 0. 3 μm diamond abrasives. The diamond grains can be classified into fixed and loose grains. The grains fixed to a lapping plate were confirmed by SEM and AFM observations. Among many experimental parameters, the change <b>of</b> the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> fine <b>grooves</b> on a lapping plate formed by the facing operation has a significant effect on the removal rate. This agrees well with the calculated number of loose grains under various <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> <b>groove.</b> The average removal rate with fixed and loose grains was found to be about 2. 7 times higher than that with only fixed grains. These results indicate that during lapping, the material is mainly removed by loose grains. It is evident from AFM images that the lapped surface with material removed by fixed grains differs very much from that with material removed simultaneously by fixed and loose grains...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{straightforward}} method to realize a wettability-controlled stainless steel surface via wire electrical discharge machining. Samples of AISI {{304 stainless steel}} were prepared, having various depth <b>of</b> <b>groove,</b> while width and <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> <b>groove</b> were set to be 500 mu m and 600 mu m. Wetting properties of the fabricated samples were quantified by measuring static contact angle of deionized water and silicone oil, and sliding angle of water droplets. Mechanical robustness test was conducted by comparing static contact angle of water and silicone oil before and after 1000 cycles of abrasion. In order to propose potential applications, we demonstrate oil-water separation and polymer molding for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|The larger storage {{capacity}} of a DVD-R compared to a CD-R is achieved through smaller pit size and smaller track <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>groove</b> spiral which guides the laser beam. Consequently, more pits can be written on the same physical sized disc. In order to write smaller pits onto the recording dye layer, a red laser beam with a wavelength of 640 nm (for general use recordable DVD, versus a wavelength of 780 nm for CD-R) is {{used in conjunction with}} a higher numerical aperture lens. Because of this shorter wavelength, DVDs use different dyes from CDs to properly absorb this wavelength.|$|R
50|$|The system {{appeared}} in Chrysler automobiles from 1956 to 1959 (1956-1958 model years). Records {{for the system}} were manufactured exclusively by Columbia Special Products, and could hold roughly 45 minutes of music or an hour of speech per side.

The recording surface extended to an unusually small diameter of 2+1/4 inch mm, which constrained the label to 1+1/2 inch mm for long-playing titles, but demonstration discs with brief contents not requiring an extended playing time were manufactured with standard 3 inch (76 mm) labels.|$|R

The position-sensitive structure on the implanted p(+) -contact {{can be made}} smaller than 100 mum by photolithography followed by plasma etching <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> to separate the position elements. By modifying this technique position-sensitive structures on a thin (similar to 30 mum) Li-diffused contact were created. Areas of 50 mm x 50 mm were divided into 50 or 100 strips with a <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> 1 mm or 500 mum, respectively. The strips were separated by similar to 35 -mum-deep and similar to 50 -mum-wide <b>grooves.</b> Measurements <b>of</b> the electrical resistance <b>of</b> the <b>grooves</b> and reverse current of the strips are presented. Charge splitting on the adjacent strips shows practically no charge loss through the groove. Small pixel effects are demonstrated on a Li-diffused contact (100 strips with the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> 500 mum) and on the first double-sided Si(Li) detector (50 x 50 strips with a <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> 1 mm).

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate impact {{dynamics of}} a microliter water droplet on a hydrophobic microgrooved surface. The surface is fabricated using photolithography and high-speed visualization is employed {{to record the}} time-varying droplet shapes in transverse as well as longitudinal direction. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grooved</b> surface and Weber number on droplet dynamics and impact outcome are studied. At low pitch and Weber number, the maximum droplet spreading {{is found to be}} greater in the longitudinal direction than the transverse direction to the grooves. The preferential spreading inversely scales with the pitch at a given Weber number. In this case, the outcome is no bouncing (NB); however, this changes at larger pitch or Weber number. Under these conditions, the following outcomes are obtained as function <b>of</b> the <b>pitch</b> and Weber number - droplet completely bounces off the surface (CB), bouncing occurs with droplet breakup (BDB) or no bouncing due to Cassie to Wenzel wetting transition (NBW). In BDB and NBW, the liquid penetrates the grooves partially or completely beneath the droplet due to the wetting transition. The former results in droplet breakup alongside bouncing while the latter suppresses the bouncing. These outcomes are demarcated on Weber number - dimensionless pitch plane and the proposed regime map suggests the existence of a critical Weber number or pitch for the transition from one regime to the other. CB and BDB are quantified by plotting coefficient of restitution of the bouncing droplet and volume of daughter droplet left on the surface, respectively. The critical Weber number needed for the transition from CB to BDB is estimated using an existing mathematical model and is compared with the measurements. The comparison is good and provides insights in mechanism of the liquid penetration into the grooves...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we have {{successfully}} fabricated electrospun polystyrene (PS) nanofibers having {{a diameter of}} 326 [*]±[*] 50  nm with a parallel grooved texture using a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). We discovered that solvent system, solution concentration, and relative humidity were the three key factors to the formation <b>of</b> <b>grooved</b> texture and the diameter of nanofibers. We demonstrated that grooved nanofibers with desired properties (e.g., different numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves,</b> widths between two adjacent <b>grooves,</b> and depths <b>of</b> <b>grooves)</b> could be electrospun under certain conditions. When THF/DMF ratio was higher than 2 : 1, the formation mechanism <b>of</b> single <b>grooved</b> texture should {{be attributed to the}} formation of voids on the jet surface at the early stage of electrospinning and subsequent elongation and solidification of the voids into a line surface structure. When THF/DMF ratio was 1 : 1, the formation mechanism <b>of</b> <b>grooved</b> texture should be ascribed to the formation of wrinkled surface on the jet surface at the early stage of electrospinning and subsequent elongation into a grooved texture. Such findings can serve as guidelines for the preparation <b>of</b> <b>grooved</b> nanofibers with desired secondary morphology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{pressure}} {{distribution in}} a flat spiral groove thrust bearing obtained from a straightforward solution of the Reynolds equation includes subatmospheric pressure in part <b>of</b> the <b>grooved</b> area. This is masked in the common theory {{based on the assumption}} of an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>grooves.</b> Furthermore, the negative contribution to the load capacity from this area is usually small, which may explain why the presence of subatmospheric pressure has not been given much attention in connectionwith these bearings. Subatmospheric pressure is, however, necessary for liquid-lubricated flat spiral <b>groove</b> thrust bearings <b>of</b> conventional design to work at all at low numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves,</b> which in turn requires a non-zero cavitation pressure. Cavitation within individual grooves implies non-linearity in, for example, the relation between load capacity and rotational speed of the bearing and limits the obtainable load capacity. This is more pronounced and important to consider at low numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> (wide grooves) than at high numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> (narrow grooves), {{and it is difficult to}} determine for what number <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> that reliable prediction of bearing performance can be expected. It depends on the actual value of the cavitation pressure and other parameters that are usually unknown or difficult to account for. To avoid this disadvantage a modified design of liquid-lubricated flat spiral groove thrust bearings is suggested...|$|R
