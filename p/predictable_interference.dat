50|$|While {{traditional}} scholars {{explain this}} Ketuyu Rebellion as a typically barbarian reaction modern historians are more cautious. Both the Chinese Liao expert Shu Fen and the Japanese Matsui Hitoshi {{are inclined to}} think that Chinese lenient policy encouraged Ketuyu's arrogance.In contrast, Xu Elian-Qian supports the theory that Chinese interferences in Khitan internal changes caused the aggression to Ketuyu's reactions. That may be true for the conflict of 720 and the aggressive Chinese behaviour. But this opinion does not explain the Chinese appeasement policy in 725 where the Chinese let Ketuyu kill the Khitan king and enthrone a new one. When Ketuyu was personally mistreated, in Chang'an in 730, this resentment led him to choose the larger of consequence of diplomatic opposition by turning his submission to the Turks. This was predictably understood by Chang'an as a first magnitude treason {{which could not be}} tolerated and lead to the ensuing five years of war to recapture them. Shu and Matsui do not see this Chinese reaction as an aggressive interference but rather as a <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> caused by Ketuyu's arrogant reaction to the recent lenient policy.|$|E
40|$|Predictable inter-vehicle {{communication}} reliability is a {{basis for}} the paradigm shift from the traditional singlevehicle-oriented safety and efficiency control to networked vehicle control. The lack of <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> control in existing mechanisms of inter-vehicle communications, however, makes them incapable of ensuring predictable communication reliability. For <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> control, we propose the Cyber-Physical Scheduling (CPS) framework that leverages the PRK interference model and addresses the challenges of vehicle mobility to PRK-based scheduling. In particular, CPS leverage physical locations of vehicles to define the gPRK interference model, a geometric approximation of the PRK model, for effective interference relation estimation, and CPS leverages cyber-physical structures of vehicle traffic flows (particularly, spatiotemporal interference correlation as well as macro- and micro-scopic vehicle dynamics) for effective use of the gPRK model. Through experimental analysis with high-fidelity ns- 3 and SUMO simulation, we observe that CPS enables predictable reliability while achieving high throughput and low delay in communication. To the best of our knowledge, CPS is the first field deployable method that ensures <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> control and thus reliability in inter-vehicle communications.

40|$|Using a dual-target {{identification}} task during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), {{we examined}} facilitation and interference effects exerted by emotional stimuli. Emotionally arousing first targets (T 1 s) were encoded with higher accuracy than neutral T 1 s. At the same time, {{identification of a}} second neutral target (T 2) was impaired reflecting a failure of disengaging attention from arousing T 1 s. Similar interference was triggered by arousing filler stimuli that were not voluntarily searched for in the RSVP stream (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, we showed that interference is reduced (though facilitation for arousing T 1 s is maintained) when the second task itself involves variations in emotional arousal. Vice versa, when arousal associated with the T 2 stimulus was <b>predictable,</b> <b>interference</b> recurred (Experiment 4). Our findings indicate that the perceived emotional intensity of a stimulus is a determinant of successful identification during RSVP: Encoding of arousing stimuli is reliably facilitated. Interference effects with subsequent processing arise independently and are strongly modulated by the overall task context and specific processing strategies...|$|E
30|$|The second {{algorithm}} is the virtual sub-band algorithm (VSA), which enforces strict power constraints on each beam by requiring all beams to be switched {{on all the}} time (with power values given by the associated control). This has the advantage of making the <b>interference</b> <b>predictable</b> (assuming known power values). However, it leaves only limited freedom for the actual scheduler, whose task is reduced to user selection for each beam. Since a beam is always turned on, it can be treated as an independent resource for scheduling, just like a ‘virtual’ sub-band (⇒ virtual sub-band algorithm).|$|R

This is more efficient than satisfying these requirements separately. We give algorithms for obtaining optimal encodings, and present a practical class of codes called boundary shift codes.

40|$|In {{cellular}} wireless networks where {{users have}} independent fading channels, throughput for delay tolerant applications {{has been greatly}} increased on the downlink by using opportunistic schedulers at the base station. These schedulers exploit the multiuser diversity inherent in cellular systems. An interesting question is how opportunistic schedulers will provide Quality of Service(QoS) guarantees for a mix of data traffic and traffic from delay-sensitive multimedia applications. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, we completely characterize the scheduled rate, delay and packet service times experienced by mobile users in a packet switched cellular wireless system in terms of a configurable base station scheduler metric. The metric used has a general form, combining an estimate of a mobile user's channel quality with the scheduling delay experienced by the user. In addition to quantifying the scheduler performance, our analysis highlights the inherent trade-off between system throughput and the delay experienced by mobile users with opportunistic scheduling. We also use this analysis to study the effect of prioritized voice users on data users in a cellular wireless system with delay constrained opportunistic scheduling. Our statistical analysis of the forward link is validated by extensive simulations of a system architecture based on the CDMA 1 xEV-DO system. The increase in data traffic from mobiles to the base station has led to a growing interest in a scheduled reverse link in the 1 xEV-DO system. We address the reverse link scheduling problem in a multi-cell scenario with interference constraints both within and outside the cell. This approach leads to a co-operative scheduling algorithm where each base station in a cellular network maximizes the sum of mobile data transmission rates subject to linear constraints on (1) the maximum received power for individual mobiles(2) the total interference caused by scheduled mobiles to (a) traffic and control channels of other mobiles within the cell and (b) mobiles in neighboring cells. Simulations of the reverse link structure based on the 1 xEV-D 0 system highlight the distinct advantages of this algorithm in ensuring <b>predictable</b> inter-cell <b>interference</b> and higher aggregate cell throughputs...|$|R
40|$|The key to understanding, {{and perhaps}} more {{importantly}} predicting, the detailed properties of materials and surfaces is an accurate model of the atomic structure of the surface. Everything from the flow of current through a transistor in an integrated circuit, to {{the function of the}} catalyst in a car’s catalytic converter depends on the atomic structure of the surface under consideration. Determination of the structures of surfaces on an atomic scale is carried out through several experimental methods. In the case of crystal surfaces, diffraction methods are frequently employed. These methods exploit the long-range periodicity of a crystal and the <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> of scattered waves due to this periodicity to detect the atomic structure of the material. In these techniques the intensities of the scattered radiation (electromagnetic or particle) are measured although it is in the relative phases of the scattered waves where much of the structural information is contained.

40|$|One {{goal in the}} {{development}} of future cellular systems is to increase performance. Channel dependent scheduling can possibly contribute to a performance enhancement. It requires channel qualityinformation and uplink channel knowledge is often incomplete. This master thesis work compares channel dependent scheduling and channel independent scheduling for a Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access-based uplink in time domain and time and frequencydomain assuming continuous channel quality information updates. It also evaluates different methods for providing channel quality information by investigating how the limited channel knowledge they supply affects the performance of channel dependent scheduling. Single-cell simulations with perfect channel knowledge indicate small gains for channel dependent scheduling. Large gains are seen when performing frequency and time domain scheduling instead of only time domain scheduling. Limited channel knowledge causes performance loss for channel dependent scheduling. The performance is only slightly decreased if a method with sufficiently frequent providing of channel quality information updates is applied. More realistic multi-cell simulations show large gains for channel dependent scheduling. It is possible that these results are influenced by link adaptation and scheduling problems due to non <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> when performing dynamic scheduling. In the comparison between channel dependent and channel independent scheduling the channel dependent scheduling can benefit {{from the fact that the}} selected channel dependent scheduling algorithms result in a more static scheduling than the selected channel independent scheduling algorithms do...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of propagating spin waves in micron-sized metallic ferromagnetic structures {{has been the}} subject of theoretical and experimental studies [1 – 3] due to their potential application in microwave signal processing and spin-wave logic devices [6, 10], but also due to the possibility to address basic physical phenomena related to the spin transfer torque [11, 12] and the interaction of spin waves with topological objects like domain walls [13 – 15, 19]. In all experimental studies the understanding of the excitation and propagation of spin waves is of vital importance, especially for the exploration of next-generation logic circuits which would use the phase and amplitude of the spin waves as an information carrier [6, 7, 10]. As the processing of data in these devices is performed by the interference of the different input waves, the ability of the spin waves to form stable and <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> patterns is of crucial importance. Consequently, several numerical studies [4, 8] were dedicated to the interference of spin waves in microstructures but the experimental proofs are still limited (see e. g. [21]). In this report we present the experimental observation of interfering spin waves in micron-sized waveguides of Ni 81 Fe 19 (see Fig. 1 a) for detailed sample design). We find that the coherence length is at least as long as the achieved propagation distance of the locally excited spin waves...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud {{providers}} offer tenants elastic {{computing resources}} {{in the form of}} virtual machine (VM) instances to run their jobs. Recently, providing predictable performance (i. e., performance guarantee) for tenant applications is becoming increasingly compelling in IaaS clouds. However, the hardware heterogeneity and performance interference across the same type of cloud VM instances can bring substantial performance variation to tenant applications, which inevitably stops the tenants from moving their performance-sensitive applications to the IaaS cloud. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes Heifer, a Heterogeneity and interference-aware VM provisioning framework for tenant applications, by focusing on MapReduce as a representative cloud application. It predicts the performance of MapReduce applications by designing a lightweight performance model using the online-measured resource utilization and capturing VM interference. Based on such a performance model, Heifer provisions the VM instances of the good-performing hardware type (i. e., the hardware that achieves the best application performance) to achieve predictable performance for tenant applications, by explicitly exploring the hardware heterogeneity and capturing VM interference. With extensive prototype experiments in our local private cloud and a real-world public cloud (i. e., Microsoft Azure) as well as complementary large-scale simulations, we demonstrate that Heifer can guarantee the job performance while saving the job budget for tenants. Moreover, our evaluation results show that Heifer can improve the job throughput of cloud datacenters, such that the revenue of cloud providers can be increased, thereby achieving a win-win situation between providers and tenants.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} of new {{functionalities}} in modern embedded real-time systems has led chip makers {{to produce the}} modern multi-core platforms. This trend also increased the need for robust and efficient mixed-criticality systems that need to share the same hardware platform. Hardware virtualization established as a de-facto solution to realize such systems, aiming at guaranteeing time and security requirements. This thesis addresse the problem of providing spatial and temporal isolation between execution domains in a hypervisor running on an ARM multicore platform. The goal is to achieve <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> among domains without relying on any information on their behavior and/or configuration, thus enabling the execution of time-sensitive (and possibly safety-critical) guests that are resilient to misbehaviors, cyber attacks, or excessive demand of computational resources that may affect less critical domains. For instance, the proposed design solution allows the integration of a real-time operating system with a general purpose operating system (e. g., Linux), which today is a common need in many industrial fields. Isolation is achieved by carefully managing the two primary shared hardware resources of today's multicore platforms: the last level cache (LLC) and the DRAM memory controller. The XVISOR open-source hypervisor and the ARM Cortex A 7 platform {{have been used as}} reference systems {{for the purpose of this}} work. Spatial partitioning on the LLC has been implemented by means of cache coloring, which allows reserving a given portion of cache memory to each domain, thus avoiding mutual cache evictions by design. In this work, cache coloring has been tightly integrated with the ARM virtualization extensions (ARM-VE) to deal with the memory virtualization capabilities offered by a two-stage memory management unit (MMU) architecture. Temporal isolation on the DRAM controller has been implemented by realizing a memory bandwidth reservation mechanism, which allows reserving (and contextually limiting) a given number of memory accesses across a periodic time window. The reservation mechanism leverages performance counters and specific interrupt signals available on various ARM platforms and has been integrated with the scheduling logic of XVISOR when managing the execution of the virtual CPUs. An extensive experimental evaluation has been performed on the Raspberry Pi 2 board, showing the effectiveness of the implemented solutions on a case-study composed of multiple Linux guests running state-of-the-art benchmarks. In particular, both cache coloring and memory reservation proved to ensure a strong isolation among domains, with a significant improvement on worst-case execution times due to the limited (or null) contention delays introduced by such shared resources. No relevant paybacks in terms of run-time overhead have been observed. The results of this thesis received considerable attention by the XVISOR community and are going to be integrated in a next release of the hypervisor...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{cancelling}} {{the acoustic}} noise by generating an anti-noise signal is very fascinating, and was first proposed by P. Lueg in 1936. In feedforward {{active noise control}} (ANC) systems, the anti-noise signal is generated {{with the help of}} reference and error microphones, an adaptive filtered-x-LMS (FxLMS) algorithm based ANC filter, and an electro-acoustic path named as the secondary path. For stable operation of ANC systems, the FxLMS algorithm needs an estimate of the secondary path. The anti-noise signal generated by the loudspeaker (part of secondary path) causes interference with the reference microphone signal. This interference is due to the presence of electro-acoustic path, named as feedback path, between the loudspeaker and the reference microphone. It is required to neutralize the effect of this feedback path, and hence an estimate of the feedback path is required. For online modeling of the secondary and feedback paths, an additional auxiliary noise is injected. This auxiliary noise contributes to the residual error, and thus degrades the noise-reduction-performance (NRP) of ANC system. In order to improve the NRP, a gain scheduling strategy is used to vary the variance of the injected auxiliary noise. The purpose of the gain scheduling is that when the model estimates of the secondary and the feedback paths are far from the actual unknown paths, auxiliary noise with large variance is injected. Once the model estimates are closer to the actual unknown paths, the variance of auxiliary noise is reduced to a small value. In this way, on one hand the gain scheduling can help us to achieve the required model estimates of secondary and feedback paths, {{and on the other hand}} to improve the NRP at the steady-state. In this thesis, we discuss the two most important issues, i. e., 1) online secondary path modeling (OSPM), and 2) online feedback path modeling and neutralization (FBPMN) with gain scheduling. In chapter 1, the basic underlying physical principle and configurations of active noise control (ANC) systems are explained. The application of the basic building block of an ANC system i. e. An adaptive filter, in different system identification scenarios is discussed. The most popular adaptive algorithm for ANC system, i. e., FxLMS algorithm is derived for the general secondary path. A brief overview is given for the two fundamental issues in ANC systems, i. e., 1) OSPM and 2) online FBPMN. The use of optimal excitation signal, i. e., Perfect sweep signals for system identification is described. In chapter 2, the existing methods for OSPM without gain scheduling, where the auxiliary noise with fixed variance is used in all operating conditions, are discussed. In this chapter a simplified structure for OSPM with the modified FxLMS (MFxLMS) adaptive algorithm is proposed. The advantage of the simplified structure is that it reduces the computational complexity of the MFxLMS algorithm based OSPM without having any compromise on the performance of ANC system. In chapter 3, the existing methods for OSPM with gain scheduling are discussed. The drawbacks with the existing gain scheduling strategies are highlighted, and some new gain scheduling strategies are proposed to improve the modeling accuracy of SPM filter and the NRP of an ANC system. In existing methods, the gain is varied based on the power of residual error signal which carries information only about the convergence status of ANC system. In the Proposed methods the gain is varied based on the power of error signal of SPM filter. This is more desirable way of controlling the gain because the power of error signal of SPM filter carries information about the convergence status of both the ANC system and the SPM filter. The performance comparison is carried out through the simulation results. In chapter 4, the second most important issue associated with the feedforward configuration of ANC system, i. e., the issue of online FBPMN is deal with. In the first part, the existing methods for online FBPMN without gain scheduling are discussed. A new structure is proposed for online FBPMN without gain scheduling. The performance of the existing methods is compare with the proposed method through the simulation results. In the new structure the good features from the existing structures are combined together. The predictor is used in the new structure to remove the <b>predictable</b> <b>interference</b> term from the error signal of adaptive FBPMN filter. In addition to this, the action of FBPM filter and the FBPN filter is combined into a single FBPMN filter. The advantage of the new structure over the existing structures is that it can better neutralize the effect of feedback coupling on the input signal of ANC filter, thus improves the convergence of ANC system. In the second part, a gain scheduling strategy is proposed to improve the NRP of ANC system. In addition to this, a self-tuned ANP scheduling strategy with matching step-size for FBPMN filter is also proposed that requires no tuning parameters and further improves the NRP of ANC systems. In chapter 5, the concluding remarks and some future research directions are given. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E
