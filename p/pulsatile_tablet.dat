40|$|Amoxicillin is a {{commonly}} used antibiotic {{which has a}} short half-life in human. The frequent administration of amoxicillin is often required to keep the plasma drug level in an effective range. The short dosing interval of amoxicillin could also cause some side effects and drug resistance, and impair its therapeutic efficacy and patients' compliance. Therefore, a three-pulse release tablet of amoxicillin is desired to generate sustained release in vivo, and thus to avoid the above mentioned disadvantages. The pulsatile release tablet consists of three pulsatile components: one immediate-release granule and two delayed release pellets, all containing amoxicillin. The preparation of a pulsatile release tablet of amoxicillin mainly includes wet granulation craft, extrusion/spheronization craft, pellet coating craft, mixing craft, tablet compression craft and film coating craft. Box-Behnken design, Scanning Electron Microscope and in vitro drug release test were used to help the optimization of formulations. A crossover pharmacokinetic study was performed to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of our in-house <b>pulsatile</b> <b>tablet</b> with that of commercial immediate release tablet. The pharmacokinetic profile of this pulse formulation was simulated by physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model {{with the help of}} Simcyp®. Single factor experiments identify four important factors of the formulation, namely, coating weight of Eudragit L 30 D- 55 (X 1), coating weight of AQOAT AS-HF (X 2), the extrusion screen aperture (X 3) and compression forces (X 4). The interrelations of the four factors were uncovered by a Box-Behnken design to help to determine the optimal formulation. The immediate-release granule, two delayed release pellets, together with other excipients, namely, Avicel PH 102, colloidal silicon dioxide, polyplasdone and magnesium stearate were mixed, and compressed into tablets, which was subsequently coated with Opadry® film to produce <b>pulsatile</b> <b>tablet</b> of amoxicillin. In vitro release study firstly indicated a three-pulse release profile of the tablet. Later the pulse tablet was found to generate the sustained release of amoxicillin in beagle dogs. Furthermore, the Simcyp® software was used to simulate the in vivo concentration time curve model of the three-pulse release tablet for amoxicillin in both human and beagle dog. The prediction by PBPK model nicely fitted the observation in human and beagle dog. This study has demonstrated the interrelation of factors affecting the pulsatile formulation of amoxicillin using a Box-Behnken design. The three-pulse release tablets of amoxicillin were proven to generate pulsatile release in vitro and sustained release in vivo. This formulation was also found to extend the effective plasma concentration in human compared to the tablet of immediate release based on the simulation data by PBPK modeling. This study provides an example of using PBPK to guide the development of pulsatile dosage forms...|$|E

Core tablets containing theophylline were coated with two consecutive layers, an inner swelling layer and an outer rupturable coating layer. The effect of formulation variables such as molecular weight of outer rupturable coating layer, type and amount of swelling layer, weight gain of coating film and influence of paddle speed on drug release were investigated. The drug release from the <b>pulsatile</b> <b>tablets</b> exhibited an initial lag period, followed by a stage of rapid drug release. The optimal level of swelling layer (crospovidone) to achieve a fast and complete release was 20 % w/w. The results indicated that lag time was prolonged with the increased weight gain of coating film. Also no significant difference in the drug release was observed for different rotational speeds.

40|$|Acebrophylline is a {{bronchodilator}} with mucosecrytolytic and antiinflammatory activity. It is used {{to treat}} the bronchial asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. This work {{is based on the}} formulation and optimization of time dependant <b>pulsatile</b> release <b>tablets</b> of Acebrophylline having adequate mechanical strength of tablet and proper drug release of <b>tablet.</b> <b>Pulsatile</b> drug delivery system has an advantage as delivers the drug at right place, right time and right quantity. The crucial aspect in the formulation of pulsatile drug delivery system is to release the drug as pulse after a lag time has to be designed {{in such a way that}} rapid and complete drug release follows after lag time. Present work conceptualizes a specific technology, based on pulsatile principles to develop drug delivery system, intended for chronotherapy in bronchial asthma. This approach will be achieved by using a programmed delivery of acebrophylline. In this work rapid pulse to pulsatile drug delivery system can be achieved through immediate release tablet with good mechanical strength and proper disintegration. Lag time in pulsatile drug delivery system can be maintained by using coating with time responsive polymer having good mechanical strength. In this study immediate release tablet can be prepared by using two super disintegrants as Cross carmellose sodium and Cross-povidone to give rapid pulse of drug. The lag time of pulsatile drug delivery system can be maintained by coating using extended release polymer as HPMC E 50 (Methocel E 50).

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at the {{development}} of gastroretentive floating <b>pulsatile</b> release <b>tablets</b> (FPRTs) of lercanidipine HCl to enhance the bioavailability and treat early morning surge in blood pressure. Immediate release core tablets containing lercanidipine HCl were prepared and optimized core tablets were compression-coated using buoyant layer containing polyethylene oxide (PEO) WSR coagulant, sodium bicarbonate, and directly compressible lactose. FPRTs were evaluated for various in vitro physicochemical parameters, drug-excipient compatibility, buoyancy, swelling, and release studies. The optimized FPRTs were tested in vivo in New Zealand white rabbits for buoyancy and pharmacokinetics. DoE optimization of data revealed FPRTs containing PEO (20 %[*]w/w) with coat weight 480 [*]mg were promising systems exhibiting good floating behavior and lag time in drug release. Abdominal X-ray imaging of rabbits after oral administration of the tablets, confirmed the floating behavior and lag time. A quadratic model was suggested for release at 7 th and 12 th[*]h and a linear model was suggested for release lag time.

40|$|In {{majority}} of individuals blood pressure {{rises in the}} early morning hours, which lead to serious cardiovascular complications. Formulation of pulsatile system makes it possible to deliver drug at definite period of time when symptoms of the disease condition are most critical. The purpose of the present work was to develop <b>pulsatile</b> release <b>tablet</b> of losartan potassium for chronotherapy in hypertension. The prepared system consisted of a core tablet coated with versatile and safe hydrophilic cellulosic ethers such as, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and sodium carboxy methylcellulose to produce burst release after predetermined lag time. Various formulation factors were studied through series of test and in vitro dissolution study. It was found that core tablets containing superdisintegrant failed to produce burst drug release pattern while effervescent agent was able to do so. Results also reveal that coating composition and coating level affects lag time. Formulation containing effervescent agent in core and coated with 200 mg hydroxypropyl cellulose provide lag time of 4. 5 h with 73 % drug release in 6 h that followed a sigmoidal release pattern. These values were close to the desired objective of producing lag time of 5 - 6 h followed by fast drug release. This approach can thus provide a useful means for timed release of losartan and is helpful for patients with morning surge...|$|R
