Upon invocation {{by all of the}} deities, the sacred Turiya Tirtha river appeared and Brahma bathed in her waters to cleanse his sin of incest.

Favored species include sugar maple, red maple, silver maple, magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years. Despite its preference for hardwoods, {{it has been reported}} growing on rare instances on coniferous wood. An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to <b>pick</b> <b>it.</b> Variety microspora is known from Venezuela, while V.bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo.|$|E
5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E

5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} season, Munnerlyn {{moved up to}} {{starting}} right cornerback after Richard Marshall was not re-signed.
