This region is famous as the producer of at least half of North America 2 ̆ 7 s waterfowl and an unknown, but large, proportion of other prairie-dwelling marsh and aquatic birds. The wetlands described here lie in relatively small, shallaw basins that vary greatly in their ability to maintain surface water, and in their water chemistry, which varies from fresh to hypersaline. These wetlands occur {{in a wide variety of}} hydrological settings, in an area where annual and seasonal precipitation varies greatly in form and amount. Thus the presence of surface water in these wetlands is largely unpredictable. Superimposed on these phenomena are the effects of a variety of land uses, including <b>pasture,</b> <b>cultivation,</b> mechanical forage removal, idle conditions and burning.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluated the precipitation characteristics (depth, I 30 and erosivity) and their effects on sediment production in three watersheds under different managements of land use 35 - year regenerating Caatinga (RC), thinned Caatinga (TC), which underwent thinning of trees with diameter smaller than 10 cm; and deforested Caatinga (followed by burning and pasture) (DC). The experimente was conducted in the central, tropical semiarid region of the State of Ceará, Brazil. The precipitation events, surface runoff and sediment production were monitored from 2010 to 2015. The precipitation characteristics were subjected to Pearson's correlation at 1 and 5 % of significance and the events that produced sediments in each watershed were hierarchically grouped by hierarchical cluster analysis technique. Two hundred precipitation events were recorded, with 23 (RC), 18 (TC) and 43 (DC) events producing sediments. The use of thinning (TC) decreased the sediment production by 53. 5 %, while the deforestation, burn and <b>pasture</b> <b>cultivation</b> (DC) increased soil losses by 14 %, compared with the RC.

The objective {{of this study is}} to analyse the effects of slash and burn of vegetation followed by grass cultivation for grazing, on the hydrological {{and sediment}}ological behaviour at different spatial scales in a semiarid region in Brazil. Rainfall, runoff and soil loss were measured during three years (total of 116 rainfall-runoff events) at three spatial scales: 1 m 2 and 20 m 2 plots and 2. 8 ha watershed. During the first year (2009) the native dry tropical forest/Caatinga vegetation was maintained, whereas on the following years (2010 and 2011) the original vegetation was cleared using slash and burn techniques to grow pasture (Andropogon gayanus Kunt). Annual runoff coefficient is highest at the 20 m 2 plot among the investigated scales. Runoff presented the same trend in all years. Sediment yield was strongly influenced by the land cover. Slash, burn and <b>pasture</b> <b>cultivation</b> strongly impacted sediment yield: the first two events after the land cover change yielded roughly ten times more sediment than similar events in the years with native cover and after grass development.

Social conflict arises among landholders with different preferences for ecosystem services and land-use practices in agricultural frontiers of the Argentine Dry Chaco. We explored policy and management options by assessing the actual and potential outcomes of alternative land-use systems and scenarios. We first constructed the efficiency frontier for avian habitat and agricultural productivity to analyze the combinations of ecosystem services {{that can be achieved}} under different land-use intensities. A nonlinear, concave efficiency frontier indicated opportunities to achieve large gains for production with small losses for conservation, for instance, by transitioning from low- to intermediate-intensity systems. Second, we projected production and conservation outcomes, which can be achieved through the implementation of five alternative policy options. The land sharing with conservation scenario, 70 % of the landscape covered by intermediate-intensity systems and 30 % by undisturbed forests, yielded the higher combination of avian habitat and agricultural productivity. Third, we constructed indifference curves of three landholder groups, i. e., preproductivist, multifunctional, and productivist, by assessing their intentions (proxies for preferences) to conserve and convert remnant forests in their landholdings. Multifunctional landholders showed balanced preferences for conserving and converting forests in their landholdings, and maintaining intermediate-intensity systems. A general willingness to conserve forests coexisted in preproductivist landholders with the intention to clear some portions of the landholding and intensify landuse, indicating the potential of an endogenously motivated transition toward a multifunctional regime. Such transition may increase their productivity by 35 - 65 % without compromising avian habitat. Productivist landholders showed a strong inclination toward converting forests for <b>pasture</b> <b>cultivation,</b> despite the observation that they can increase their conservation outcomes by 30 - 50 % without significantly reducing productivity by transitioning toward a multifunctional regime. Promoting this transition will require exogenous incentives and regulations tailored to the behavior of this landholder group...|$|E
40|$|Conversion of forested {{lands to}} agriculture, {{including}} cultivation and pasture {{has been linked}} to land degradation, including soil compaction, reduced soil fertility and increased salinity hazard. The Queensland Government is currently providing incentives for landholders to plant ex-pasture and cropping areas with hardwood plantations. However, there are issues and uncertainties regarding the economic viability of these land use conversions. Carbon credits resulting from additional carbon (C) sequestration achieved in the plantations are now recognised under the Kyoto Protocol, but the nature of the carbon trading scheme that will apply is still unclear, as Australia has not ratified the Protocol. This study compared the total soil C under native scrub (subtropical dry vine forest), grazed <b>pasture,</b> <b>cultivation</b> and spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subspecies variegata) forest on the Red Ferrosol soils of the Kingaroy region in southeast Queensland (SEQ). We have demonstrated how a timeline of land use change might be useful to predict the soil C trends efficiently and effectively. Cumulative soil C (including surface litter and particulate organic matter) to 1. 2 t m- 2 dry soil ranged from 72 t ha- 1 at the cultivated site to 281 t ha- 1 under the mature spotted gum forest. The estimated annual rates of soil C loss under cultivation in last 55 years (1950 - 2005) was 2. 1 % and the estimated annual rate of soil C gain in pasture in last 23 years (1983 - 2005) was 1. 1 %. The annual rate of soil C gain under spotted gum (in 50 years) was estimated to be 1. 4 %. Therefore there is considerable potential for spotted gum plantations to sequester soil C when planted on ex-agricultural land in SEQ...|$|E
40|$|Windbreaks {{are common}} {{features}} in flat agricultural landscapes around the world. The reduction in wind speed afforded by windbreaks is dictated by their porosity, location, height, and {{distance from the}} windbreak. The reduction in wind speeds not only reduces potential wind erosion; it also reduces crop evapotranspiration (ET) and provides shelter for livestock and crops. In the Canterbury plains of New Zealand there are over 300, 000 km of windbreaks which were first implemented as a soil conservation strategy to reduce wind erosion of prime agricultural land. Agriculture in the region has since changed to irrigated <b>pasture</b> <b>cultivation</b> for dairy production and windbreaks are being cut down or reduced to heights of 2 m to allow for large scale centre-pivot irrigation schemes. Although soil erosion {{is no longer a}} major concern due to permanent pasture cover, irrigation water is sourced from limited supplies of ground and surface water and thus the effects of wind on irrigation losses due to spray drift and increased ET are of significant concern. The impact of reducing windbreaks needs to be understood in terms of water resources use. Experimental and theoretical work was conducted to quantify the reduction in wind speeds by windbreaks and in spray evaporation losses. A temporal and spatial model was also developed and validated to quantify the impact of single and multiple windbreaks on irrigation water losses. Initial modelling results show that for hot windy dry conditions in Canterbury, ET can increase by up to 1. 4 mm/day when windbreaks are reduced to 2 m in height and on average wind days ET can increase by up to 0. 5 mm/day. ET can be reduced by up to 30 % in the windbreak leeward zone relative to ET in areas not protected by windbreaks. Wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity all had a considerable impact on spray evaporation losses, but the extent is determined by the droplet size. Estimated losses range from only 0. 07 % to 67 % for 5 and 0. 2 mm droplet sizes respectively. Preliminary measurements of typical irrigation spray nozzles with a range of drop sizes show losses of up to 30 % under high wind conditions. Potential reduction in ground and surface water resources use for irrigation can be significant if windbreaks are maintained by using irrigation systems that can be adapted to work within windbreaks...|$|E

Multi-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data between 1984 and 1992 was examined in a 94 370 -ha area of active deforestation to map land cover change. The Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation was used to enhance the contrast between forest, cleared areas, and regrowth. TC images were stacked into a composite multi-date TC and used in a principal components (PC) transformation to identify change components. In addition, consecutive TC image pairs were differenced and stacked into a composite multi-date differenced image. A maximum likelihood classification of each image composite was compared for identification of land cover change. The multi-date TC composite classification had the best accuracy of 78. 1 % (kappa). By 1984, only 5 % of the study area had been cleared, but by 1992, 11 % of the area had been deforested, primarily for pasture and 7 % lost due to hydroelectric dam flooding. Finally, discrimination of <b>pasture</b> versus <b>cultivation</b> was improved due to the ability to detect land under sustained clearing opened to land exhibiting regrowth with infrequent clearing...|$|R
