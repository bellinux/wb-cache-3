50|$|A {{standing}} wheelchair is {{one that}} supports the user in a nearly standing position.

40|$|Recent {{research}} studies have identified {{that use of}} large amplitudes of <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> as a pressure management strategy used by adults who use wheelchairs and {{are at risk of}} developing pressure ulcers, was low. While the reason for low use was not identified, a lack of fit between using large amplitudes of tilt and daily life function was speculated as a main reason across studies. Using a post-positivist grounded theory approach, this study explored how <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> was used in daily life particularly for managing sitting pressures, from the perspectives of five people experienced with using <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> and six therapists who prescribe <b>power</b> <b>tilt.</b> Data were collected from two in-depth semi-structured interviews and a journal that tracked the context of tilt occurrences throughout each of three days. Theoretical saturation was reached at five and six participants respectively. Data were analyzed in separate groups and then combined using a constant comparative approach. The analysis resulted in the generation of a substantive theory from which the process of using <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> in the context of daily life can be understood. The abstract, cognitive nature of the process specific to using <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> for pressure management differed from the tacit and tangible nature of the process for all other daily life uses of <b>power</b> <b>tilt.</b> Contextual elements were identified which affected the use of large amplitudes of tilt such as fear of tipping over, social image and lack of functionality. The critical influence of knowledge related to using tilt for pressure management is highlighted including potential implications for clinical practice. The theory scheme offers a preliminary avenue for examining the transactive relationships of person, environment, technology and occupation that comprise daily life, influencing how <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> is used. The substantive theory and its associated concepts contribute to the wheelchair technology field, addressing the identified knowledge gap specific to advancing the understanding of how power tilts, and potentially other wheelchair technologies, are integrated in daily life occupations. The substantive theory is preliminary, requiring further research however; potential is demonstrated to also inform the understanding of the person-environment-occupation relationship in the discipline of occupational science...|$|E

40|$|Background and Rationale: The {{decision}} {{to engage in}} an occupation is influenced by choice and control over the decision {{as well as the}} meaning attributed to engaging in the occupation. This grounded theory study explored this decision making process for people who use <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> wheelchairs, particularly the influence of using tilt to address physical needs, which arise during occupational engagement. For people who use <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> wheelchairs, the spontaneous reaction of moving their bodies in response to physical needs such as discomfort, poor postural alignment or pressure, can be enabled through the <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> feature. Using <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> to move their body is a means {{to reduce the risk of}} developing secondary health issues such as pressure ulcers which subsequently can reduce engagement in occupations. However, current research literature found that people who use <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> do so inconsistently and infrequently throughout the day. Purpose: Current research did not explore the reasons for low use of <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> but alluded to the presence of tension between engaging in daily occupations and using <b>power</b> <b>tilt.</b> Applying an occupational lens, this grounded theory research study aimed to explore this tension. Methods: Using a constant comparative approach, the perspectives of 5 people who use <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> wheelchairs and 6 therapists who prescribed this technology were gathered through multiple interviews and a 3 day journal. This iterative approach to data collection and analysis enabled the exploration of the process by which addressing physical needs were integrated with engagement in daily occupations. Results: The substantive theory generated from this study elucidates the complexity of occupational engagement across the course of the day particularly as engagement is challenged by competing needs. Personal meaning placed on engaging in the occupation in the context at that point in time, shaped the decisions to prioritize occupation over physical needs, to modify occupations so as to accommodate physical needs or to interrupt, stop or change occupations in order to address physical needs. Conclusion: This substantive theory advances the understanding of occupational engagement by blending occupational and bio-medical perspectives. The theory elucidates the powerful influence context, choice, control, and attribution of meaning to an occupation have on the process of deciding to engage or remain engaged in an occupation when competing physical needs arise. 3 Key words: Meaningfulness; Occupational engagement; Grounded theor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Spectral {{characteristics}} of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process were theoretically investigated for step-index silica optical fibers with various GeO 2 concentrations. Optimal-fiber lengths and germanium concentration, {{where the first}} Stokes power reaches maximum, were calculated at various pump power levels for application in Raman amplifiers. Based on this analysis, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a new channel-equalizing technique to simultaneously compensate Raman-induced crosstalk and amplify wavelength-division-mul-tiplexing (WDM) signals using a discrete Raman amplifier in the 1. 5 - m range. As a further application of SRS in germanosilicate glass fibers, we introduce an all-optical variable attenuator for channel equalization {{that could be used}} in dynamic optical <b>power</b> <b>tilt</b> control in WDM systems.
