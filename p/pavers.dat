Despite having several original medieval wall paintings, the largest addition {{was the creation of}} the medieval mural by artist Margot Noyes. To create the impression of an austere country church, Victorian stone flags were replaced with brick <b>pavers</b> for the duration of filming and the original wall paintings covered up.

Gunfights, hangings, funerals, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the Great Depression, and an outbreak of diphtheria in the 1890s are among the events represented.

5|$|The {{furniture}} store Haskins, which originated in Shepton Mallet in 1938, has its principal showroom in the High Street within Haskins Retail Centre, {{which also includes}} {{a number of others}} shops including Aldi supermarket, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home, <b>Pavers</b> Shoes and an outlet clothing store. Retail jobs in the town increased in number in 2006–7 when a new shopping development, including a large Tesco supermarket, a clothes store and other retailers, was constructed on a site just south of the town centre, which had once been a factory making Clarks shoes and later Doc Martens boots. This development attracted national media attention when protesters occupied the site to try to prevent the felling of an avenue of trees dating back to the 19th century. It has also divided opinion in the town, between those who hoped it would help to revitalise the town, and others who feared that local traders would be unable to compete, leading to a further decline of Shepton Mallet's High Street. There is also the Mulberry Factory Shop located on Kilver Street, near to the former Mulberry headquarters.|$|E

40|$|The {{presently}} <b>paver</b> {{block is}} used in various applications like in street road and other construction places. Also {{we can say that}} it is partial replacement of concrete pavement. <b>Paver</b> block has low cost maintenance and easily replace with a newer one at the time of breakage. For improving Abrasion Resistance and Flexural Strength of <b>paver</b> block this study is necessary. In this study addition of polypropylene fibers in <b>paver</b> block to show the change in the Abrasion Resistance and Flexural Strength of <b>paver</b> blocks with compare to standard <b>paver</b> block and reduces the maintenance cost of <b>paver</b> block. Also it'shelpful to improve the life span of <b>paver</b> block. In this paper represent the results of the concrete <b>paver</b> block with the mix proportion of 1 : 3 (Cement: dolomite powder) and polypropylene fibre with the different percentage rate in the top layer of <b>paver</b> block and 1 : 1 : 2 : 3. 75 (Cement: Fine aggregate: Semi Grit: Quarry dust) in the bottom layer of <b>paver</b> block.

40|$|Abstract—Green <b>paver</b> blocks is an {{ecofriendly}} {{method of}} making concrete <b>paver</b> block using geopolymer concrete. <b>Paver</b> blocks {{have been in}} use since thousands of years. Due to rapid infrastructure development cement concrete {{is the second most}} consumed commodity on earth today. Portland cement generates large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) which is responsible for global warming since it is a greenhouse gas. Environmental responsibility has initiated research in sustainability and ecofriendly methods for infrastructure development. The other great problem today is disposal of solid waste. Coal fired thermal power plants generate solid waste in the form of fly ash and pond ash. Disposal of these wastes is a major engineering challenge today with more stringent environmental laws. Today research has combined sustainability with waste management leading to a wonderful product called geopolymer concrete. This paper reports on the use of geopolymer concrete in precast concrete <b>paver</b> blocks and compares the performance with the commercial available OPC <b>paver</b> blocks of the same mix proportions. The mix design with a target strength of 47 MPa was developed to create <b>paver</b> blocks suitable for highways. The tests were done and the results tabulated.

25|$|For many years, {{the immense}} Austin J. Tobin Plaza was often beset by brisk winds {{at ground level}} owing to the Venturi effect between the two towers.

5000|$|Fifteen {{years after}} writing the {{original}} rough draft, while <b>Paver</b> was hiking by herself in southern California, a large female black bear with two cubs {{walked onto the}} trail she was following. <b>Paver</b> was aware that brown bears are at their most dangerous when they have cubs, and any sudden movement might cause the bear to attack. <b>Paver</b> began singing [...] "Danny Boy" [...] to the bear {{in an effort to}} show she meant no harm. The bear approached <b>Paver,</b> swaying its {{head from side to side}} and smelling her. She began backing up very slowly until the bear was out of sight, and she then fled the scene. Several years later, while looking through a pile of old notes, she stumbled upon the rough draft she had written in 1980. She felt the story was missing something, and her mind raced to the memory of her encounter with the bear, and the plot of Wolf Brother unfolded before her. <b>Paver</b> began researching the timeline of her story, and she travelled to northern Finland to research how the people in her book would have lived nearly six thousand years ago. After hours in the library and much travel, <b>Paver</b> began writing the book. Wolf Brother was published in September 2004, and shortly after the book's publication <b>Paver</b> began work on the next book in the series.|$|R
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous <b>pavers</b> individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate <b>pavers</b> can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E
