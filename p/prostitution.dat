5|$|In {{classical}} Athens, female <b>prostitution</b> was legal, albeit disreputable, and <b>prostitution</b> was taxed.|$|E
5|$|Falle's pimp {{kept her}} falsely imprisoned and trafficked {{her across the}} country. He married her and {{tortured}} her, breaking several of her bones and burning her body. In order {{to cope with the}} trauma of <b>prostitution</b> and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine and almost died. Eventually, she got out of <b>prostitution</b> and, with her mother's support, went through drug rehabilitation, finished high school, and eventually received a diploma in Wife Assault and Child Advocacy from George Brown College.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views of}} {{pornography}} range from condemnation of pornography {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Feminists' views on <b>prostitution</b> vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of <b>prostitution</b> and sex work.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} <b>prostitution</b> at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave <b>prostitution.</b> Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to <b>prostitution.</b> By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in <b>prostitution</b> in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in <b>prostitution</b> tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal <b>prostitution</b> in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced <b>prostitution</b> around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public <b>prostitution</b> in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into <b>prostitution</b> to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
5|$|Rishi Kapoor as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. He runs a meat {{business}} and simultaneously deals in drugs and <b>prostitution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who used drugs with their drug counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in <b>prostitution,</b> which she later said was why it took her so long to exit <b>prostitution.</b> While engaging in <b>prostitution,</b> Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in <b>prostitution,</b> Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E
5|$|At a party, Bruce Wayne meets Debra Kane, a {{caseworker}} with Child Protective Services. He asks to {{join her}} while she visits clients. She agrees and shows him the varying degrees of child abuse she encounters {{in the course of}} her job. Wanting to understand the factors behind child abuse, Bruce, as Batman, breaks into Hellgate Prison and talks with an informant who points him to a child pornography and <b>prostitution</b> ring. Bruce's butler Alfred Pennyworth reveals that Bruce's mother, Martha Wayne, had been secretly investigating a similar child <b>prostitution</b> ring, and that the sex traffickers ordered the murders of Bruce's parents in order to silence her.|$|E
5|$|Before privatisation, the King's Cross {{area had}} a {{reputation}} for run-down buildings and <b>prostitution</b> services in front of the main entrance. A major clean-up took place during the 1990s and the station's atmosphere was much improved {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
5|$|Friedman also {{supported}} libertarian policies such as legalization {{of drugs and}} <b>prostitution.</b> During 2005, Friedman and more than 500 other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Kidd was {{the uncle}} of filmmaker and {{political}} activist, Robert Greenwald. His older brother was Harold Greenwald, a prominent psychotherapist and best-selling {{author of the}} 1958 book The Call Girl, who was {{an expert in the}} study of <b>prostitution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rudhirándha (wells of blood): Wrestlers or boxers {{who commit}} {{violence}} for entertainment, fishermen, followers of bastards, arsonists, poisoners, informants, fortune-tellers, traitors, {{those who have}} coitus on sacred taboo days and those who live off their wives' <b>prostitution</b> are cast here.|$|E
5|$|The party {{opposed the}} 2016 {{criminalisation}} {{of the use}} of <b>prostitution</b> in France, {{on the grounds that it}} would negatively impact the safety of sex workers.|$|E
5|$|The show {{contains}} many adult themes, including, gay {{men in the}} United States military, <b>prostitution,</b> bullying {{and the effects of}} war. As a result of these themes, the show is recommended for children aged 13 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling and <b>prostitution</b> in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. <b>Prostitution,</b> which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the social status of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to work outside the home. Communist rule also brought {{about the end of}} practices such as foot binding, child marriages, <b>prostitution,</b> and arranged marriages. China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E
5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling and <b>prostitution</b> were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that supplies and communication {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|E
5|$|He {{passed laws}} to protect prostitutes from {{exploitation}} {{and women from}} being forced into <b>prostitution.</b> Rapists were treated severely. Further, by his policies: women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse; if a woman was widowed, her dowry should be returned; and a husband could not take on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Ruby Garrett, {{the last}} madam of the Dumas, {{was convicted of}} federal tax evasion and served six months in prison. The brothel was closed soon after, but not before a robbery took place there. When it closed, it was the longest {{operating}} brothel in the United States, having operated for 92 years, long after <b>prostitution</b> was outlawed.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, The New York Times Book Review {{published}} a lengthy letter of hers {{in which she}} describes the origins of her deeply felt hatred of <b>prostitution</b> and pornography ("mass-produced, technologized prostitution") as her history of being violently inspected by prison doctors, and battered by her first husband and numerous other men.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} <b>prostitution</b> at Streetlight Support Services, and counselled {{more than 800}} women in the subsequent decade, 97% of whom wrote on their intake surveys {{that they wanted to}} exit the sex industry. In order to make this statistic more widely known, Falle founded Sex Trade 101. She began offering training for police and partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit. Falle {{was one of the main}} proponents of Member of Parliament (MP) Joy Smith's private member's bill, Bill C-268, which was passed in June 2010 as An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years), and she helped the Canadian government formulate their appeal of the decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bedford v. Canada to strike down various <b>prostitution</b> laws. Falle advocates adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which would decriminalize the selling of sex and criminalize the purchasing of sex.|$|E
5|$|In December 1984, the Taiwan Aboriginal People's Movement was {{launched}} {{when a group}} of aboriginal political activists, aided by the progressive Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT), established the Alliance of Taiwan Aborigines (ATA, or yuan chuan hui) to highlight the problems experienced by indigenous communities all over Taiwan, including: <b>prostitution,</b> economic disparity, land rights and official discrimination in the form of naming rights.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008 {{a series}} of police raids in gay bathhouses and at gay meeting spots in Beijing have {{resulted}} in arrests and bathhouse closures. This included raids on two branches of the Oasis bathhouses, known {{to be the most}} popular in Beijing. In 2000, police arrested 37 men in a Guangzhou gay spa on charges of <b>prostitution.</b> Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{psychological}} trauma of <b>prostitution</b> and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine. Within two years, she was spending $500 per night on cocaine. Her drug use resulted in delusions and caused her to become schizophrenic, and subsequently distrustful of those around her, fearing that people were coming to take away her drugs.|$|E
5|$|London {{had several}} streets named Gropecunt Lane {{including}} one in the parishes of St Pancras, Soper Lane and St Mary Colechurch, between Bordhawelane (bordello) and Puppekirty Lane (poke skirt) near present-day Cheapside. First recorded in 1279 as Gropecontelane and Groppecountelane, {{it was part of}} a collection of streets which appears to have survived as a small island of <b>prostitution</b> outside Southwark, where such activities were normally confined during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residents}} {{moved away}} from Bow Street after the theatre {{was established in the}} early 18th century. Life in the street declined and became known for pornography and <b>prostitution.</b> The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No.2 during this time, and by 1740 the street held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues were looking to buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered that James Robinson, lessee to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson's legal team accused the Commissioner's surveyor of being prejudiced against <b>prostitution.</b> The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area's reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested the street should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance itself from the reputation Bow Street had acquired.|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle (born 1973) is a Canadian {{professor}} at Humber College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada who was forcibly prostituted from {{the ages of}} 15 to 27 and now opposes <b>prostitution</b> in Canada. Falle {{grew up in a}} middle-class home and, when her parents divorced, her new single-parent home became unsafe, and Falle ran away from home. At the age of 15, Falle became involved in the sex industry in Calgary, Alberta.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prostitution</b> is {{considered}} sinful {{for both the}} prostitute and the customer; it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and harming society. The gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes who are forced into the act by destitution, blackmail or social pressure.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 crime drama film Mona Lisa is set around King's Cross. At the time, the downmarket and seedy area {{surrounding}} the station, coupled with urban decay, {{made it an}} ideal location. Subsequent early 1990s tabloid coverage of crime and <b>prostitution</b> around King's Cross referred back to the film.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, <b>prostitution</b> and, especially, rape. Chastity {{for those who are}} not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E
5|$|The League also {{succeeded in}} {{reducing}} the death rate of workers constructing the Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 percent. Records were kept to control slavery, <b>prostitution,</b> and the trafficking of women and children. Partly {{as a result of}} pressure brought by the League of Nations, Afghanistan abolished slavery in 1923, Iraq in 1924, Nepal in 1926, Transjordan and Persia in 1929, Bahrain in 1937, and Ethiopia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Velvet Underground & Nico is {{the debut}} album by American rock band the Velvet Underground, {{released}} in March 1967 by Verve Records. Accompanied by vocalist Nico, {{the album was}} recorded in 1966 while the group were featured on Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia event tour, which gained attention for its experimental performance sensibilities and controversial lyrical topics, including drug abuse, <b>prostitution,</b> sadomasochism and sexual deviancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{second is}} that of drug use and {{whether it should be}} legalised or decriminalised, {{provided}} on prescription to registered addicts, or penalised more harshly. High numbers (95% according to the Home Office) of street prostitutes in the United Kingdom have a history of substance abuse, and <b>prostitution</b> is one means of funding addiction, known to have been used by all five of the victims.|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of <b>prostitution.</b> A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian , and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Josephine fought child <b>prostitution</b> with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|Whitman's work {{breaks the}} {{boundaries}} of poetic form and is generally prose-like. He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry, including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris. He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including <b>prostitution.</b> He is often labeled {{as the father of}} free verse, though he did not invent it.|$|E
5|$|As most Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents, {{they seek}} a living through ad-hoc various {{industries such as}} the construction, recycling and <b>prostitution</b> industries or as street pedlars. Vietnamese that live along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong rivers are subsistence fishermen. A sizeable number of these stateless Vietnamese consisted of migrants that came to Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 during the UNTAC administration. The majority of Vietnamese still {{live below the poverty}} line, although {{a very small number of}} Vietnamese are represented in the Cambodian business sector. One example is Sok Kong, the head of the business conglomerate Sokimex which owns state concessionaires in the country's petroleum, tourism and entrepot industries.|$|E
