40|$|There {{are three}} reading {{activities}} {{that should be}} done by the teacher in teaching reading comprehension, namely, <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity,</b> whilst reading activity and post reading activity. Unfortunately, not all of the teachers administer those three reading activities in teaching reading comprehension. Most of the teachers only administer whilst reading and post reading activities, as it is stated by Lucida in her thesis. On the other hands, many experts say that <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> is important to be done as <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> can activate the students’ prior knowledge which is relevant to understand the incoming information. Moreover, <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> can provide knowledge that the reader lack. Therefore, administering <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> in teaching reading comprehension will help the students to understand the text better, easier and faster. Automatically, if the students consider that reading is an enjoyful thing to do, they will encourage of read more. Unconsciousely, it supports the objective of teaching English at SMA, providing students will a reading ability. It is beneficial to start the teaching of reading comprehension through <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity,</b> but in fact some of the teachers still ignore it. Therefore, this study tries to find out the advantage of starting the teaching of reading comprehension through <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity.</b> It is hoped by knowing the advantages of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> the teachers will realize that <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> is important to be done in teaching reading comprehension. Therefore, they will not ignore <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> in teaching reading. Moreover, to strengthen the idea that <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> is important in teaching reading, it feels necessary to find out the application of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> in teaching reading comprehension. After knowing the application of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity,</b> it is more realize that <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> is important to be done. This thesis is limited to a library study which only discusses the importance of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> done in a reading class. In discussing the techniques of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity,</b> she discusses three pre-reading techniques, namely, pictorial context, vocabulary pre-teaching and pre-questioning. Since this thesis concerns with the teaching of reading comprehension at the SMA, it is important to hear in mind that the students have known how to read {{in the sense that they}} have known how to decode written symbols. It is also supposed that the students have mastered the basic grammar and vocabulary needed, since they have got these things at the SMP. Remembering that this thesis is devoted to teach reading comprehension at SMA, the examples chosen taken from SMA English text book which are approved to be used by Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan. In this thesis the writer starts to discuss the understanding of reading comprehension which is related to her topics. The understanding of reading comprehension which is adopted in this thesis is also influenced by schema theory, so that schema theory is also discussed. After knowing the understanding of reading comprehension adopted in this thesis and schema theory, she discussed <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity.</b> Then she comes to discuss the application of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> by presenting three pre-reading techniques, namely pictorial context, vocabulary pre-teaching and prequestioning. Further, she tries to find get the advantages and disadvantages of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> in teaching reading comprehension (in order to make the idea that <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> is important to be done in teaching comprehension becomes clearer). Finally, she conclude this study and tries to give some suggestions concerning this study which might be helpful for the teaching of reading comprehension at the SMA and also her fellow teacher candidates...|$|E
40|$|Every {{people has}} {{many ways to}} develop his knowledge. One {{possibility}} {{to do it is}} by reading. Many people read for enjoyment; for example, read novels, magazines, newspapers, etc. When they have to read for a specific purpose, they often find difficulties in understanding the next. It might be because they are not familiar with certain words used in the text, or with the context set forth as the background. According to several scientist pictures can visualise many words which are important in the reading text. In Indonesia, for beginners at Junior High School learning to read in English involves a completely new set of habits. They have to learn new words and structures which are different from those for Indonesian language {{in order to understand the}} reading passage well. It is the duty of English teachers to help the students to become accustomed to the new language. The teachers should present the material of which level of difficulties and topic are suitable for their students in such an interesting way so that the students can grasp the ideas presented in the text. During her PPL at SMP “Santa Clara” the writer observed that the students cannot understand the reading passages well. She assumed that the way the teacher presented the material was uninteresting. It was so monotonous that the students became bored and felt that reading in English was difficult. Based on that experience the writer tried to use a technique which can be used to attract the students attention in <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity.</b> Before presenting the material the writer showed some pictures which are related to the reading text. It was obvious that the students paid more attention and became more active in responding to the instruction. In order to verity this assumption, the writer conducted and experiment dealing with the technique used in <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity.</b> In the experiment she used pictures to introduce the reading text to the students. The accessible population of this study was the second year students of SMP Kepanjen 1 Surabaya. The writer used two classes out of the six classes as the sample. As the experimental group, group A, she took class II E, and as the control one, group B she took class II F. The experimental group was the group given a special treatment; they were given some pictures in <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity.</b> The control group was the group which were not given any pictures in <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity.</b> The analysis of the experiment showed that the scores of group A, the experimental group, were higher than those of group B, the control one. The data obtained showed that the development of the gain of the students given pictures in the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> was constant, while the development of the students who were not given any pictures was not constant. The findings of the present study indicates that picture facilitate comprehension. They are therefore can be used in <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity,</b> The pictures selected, however, should be relevant to the passages to be taught. The pictures used should also be simple, clear, and relevant. Relevant pictures introduced before presenting the text make them accustomed to anticipating pictures.

This {{study investigated}} (a) {{the effects of}} the timing of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> on students’ reading comprehension when they were conducted either one day before reading a text or immediately before reading a text, and (b) the students’ attitudes to the effectiveness of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> with respect to their timing. Two preintermediate and two intermediate classes participated in the study. The study used a within-subjects design in which all four classes acted as their own control and experimental groups since they all received both treatments in two weeks. During the two-week study, two texts were used (Text A and B). The <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> used for each group of students were the same (class discussion-brainstorming, vocabulary matching and video watching). In {{the first week of the}} experiment, treatment group A both in the pre-intermediate level and the intermediate level, was given prereading activities one day before reading text A, and treatment group B in both levels, was given <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> immediately before reading text A. In the second week, treatment group A was given the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> immediately before reading text B, and treatment group B was given the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> one day before reading text B. After each treatment, the students were asked to write a summary in their L 1 about the texts they had read, as a post-test. Following the treatment, the self-reports of eight randomly chosen participant students in the form of post-treatment semi-structured interviews, were taken to explore their attitudes towards the timing of the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities.</b> The data analysis showed that when <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> were done immediately before reading a text, the students performed better in their post-tests than when the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> were done one day before reading a text. The study also revealed that effective timing of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> might be more important for lower level students when a text is difficult. The analysis of the interviews demonstrated that the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> that the study used were effective for students’ comprehension; the attitudes of the students about the timing of the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> were mixed. The interviews also revealed students’ different reactions to variations in teaching methods. It was speculated that their different preferences were due to their different learning styles.

The entire reading teachers realize this, therefore, they always conduct a kind of <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> which is question before reading to activate students' schemata on the topic discussed. However, this <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> is not sufficient in activating students' schemata, yet providing them with vocabulary knowledge before they read the text. ln this study, the writer suggested to use vocabulary before reading instead of question before reading in the <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity.</b> Furthermore, this experimental study was the conducted to see the effect of vocabulary before reading and question before reading on the students reading comprehension achievement. The {{purpose of the study}} was to find out the answer of a question: "Is there any significant difference between the reading comprehension achievement of the students taught using vocabulary before reading and those taught using question before reading?" The hypothesis was then put forward. There is a significant difference between the reading comprehension achievement of the students taught using vocabulary before reading and those taught using question before reading. A quasi experimental study in intact classes was then carried out. By having the students of the third grade of SMPK St. Agnes year 2005 / 2006 as the sample, the writer conducted a pretest-posttest two groups design in this study. The test used was in the form of multiple choice comprehension questions, consisted of 30 numbers. The result of the post-test was then analyzed by using t-test formula to see whether there is any significant difference between the reading comprehension achievement of the students taught using vocabulary before reading and those taught using question before reading. The data analysis revealed that vocabulary before reading gave better effect on the students' reading comprehension achievement. A further analysis on the students ability in answering different kinds of comprehension question was then conducted. The result of this analysis also supported that vocabulary before reading gave better effect on the students' ability in answering different kinds of comprehension questions.

The research was conducted in one of the foundation universities in Ankara, Turkey in the fall term of 2015 - 2016 academic year. It was designed as an action research study to improve the efficiency of reading lessons in the institution, and two existing B level prep classes were taken as experimental (n: 19) and control groups (n: 14). In both groups, related vocabulary was introduced prior to giving multiple choice reading test consisting of ten questions, but in the experimental group the learners were also exposed to metacognitive strategies (Socratic circle and shape shifting) as <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities.</b> Then, an interview study was conducted with 3 randomly selected students from the experimental group to learn how they felt during these activities. The data collected from the reading comprehension text was analyzed statistically and the results showed that the experimental group students slightly outperformed the control group students. This research concludes that significant results can be attained if metacognitive strategies as <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> are integrated more frequently into reading lessons...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of a pre-reading expository writing task on {{comprehension}} of expository text. It was undertaken in order to ascertain the usefulness of writing as a <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> in the development of schema theoretic reading teaching strategies. The theoretical position of the study was that writing before reading would activate prior knowledge in the form of content and structure in the working memory of the reader and thereby enhance reading comprehension. The sample, comprised selected from a small, of 51 year 6 / 7 students, school in the outskirts of was the metropolitan area. These students were systematically allocated to one of three equivalent groups on the basis of standardised reading comprehension test results. The experiment followed a three group, post-test only design, with two control groups and one experimental. The experimental group participated in a 20 minute writing activity on the topic of animal conservation. One control group participated in a writing activity on the topic of 2 ̆ 2 television”, while the other control participated iq maths activities, i. e., they did not write, At the conclusion of this 20 minute session, all groups read a text about animal conservation then completed a probe question comprehension test containing explicit and inferential questions relating to the text. The results of the short answer test were quantified in two sections, i. e., responses to explicit questions and responses to inferential questions, and the results were analysed by one way analysis of variance...|$|E
40|$|This study mainly {{aimed at}} finding out the {{implementation}} of blended learning using Edmodoin teaching reading comprehension, the effect of blended learning using Edmodo in improving students’ reading comprehension abilities and finding out students’ attitude to {{the implementation of}} it. Involved in this study were two classes of first graders which were divided into experimental and control groups where merely experimental group that got additional online class in Edmodo. This study revealed that blended learning using Edmodo was implemented in the eight reading comprehension meetings. The whole sessions consist of: 1. Introduction to the course, 2. Finding main ideas, identifying supporting detail and visualizing, 3. summarizing, 4. inferring, predicting, and concluding, 5. Vocabulary knowledge for effective reading skill, 6. Facts and opinion; and 7. Comparing and contrasting. Of all eight sessions, each session used two different classes. The <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> and post-reading activity were taught in Edmodo, whereas the while-reading activity was taught in face-to-face class. Data from statistic computation also proves that blended learning using Edmodo was able to help the learners in enhancing their comprehension. The result of the t-test computation (independent sample test) exhibited {{a significant difference between the}} experimental group who was treated using face-to-face class and Edmodo (Virtual Online Class) and the control group who was treated using conventional face-to-face method in which the thetobtwas higher than tcrit (6. 425 > 2. 000) with the effect size was r =. 80049658. The data from questionnaire demonstrated that the students showed positive attitude toward the implementation of blended learning using Edmodo in teaching reading comprehension and the total mean of the students’ attitude was 3. 91.

40|$|Reading is one activity, which {{demands the}} reader or {{students}} {{to comprehend the}} writer idea through a text. Unfortunately, many students have difficulty to master reading skill. One of the causes is they are lack of vocabularies. Because of this, they cannot comprehend the text. Therefore, teaching reading using word in list is needed by students to get the way to comprehend the text. It has some strengths and weaknesses. The strengths {{can be used as}} the references, and the weaknesses can be avoided by using another technique. The purposes of this research can be formulated as: (1) to know the process of teaching English using word in list. (2) to know the strengths of teaching English by using word in list, and (3) to know the weaknesses of teaching English by using word in list. The design of this research was descriptive qualitative. The subject of this study was the English teacher of SMK Widjaya-Ngoro Jombang who taught accounting class. There was only one teaher who taught Accounting class. He is Hanafi Munadi S. Pd. To collect the data, the writer used two kinds of instruments: interview and non-participants' observations. The result of this research would be written in the form of narrative writing. The research fording showed several processes of teaching reading using word in list. In <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> the teacher tried to stimulate students by giving explanation about word in list. Besides, the teacher gave a text to measure the student's background knowledge. In whilst-reading activity, the students had to read the text. In this part, the teacher asked the students to read silently. In addition, the students had to find the difficult words and the important points of the text. The last, they had to reread and understand the text. In post-reading activity, the teacher asked students to practice all of the words {{in front of the class}} without bringing the note. Besides, the teacher corrected the student's pronunciation. Other activities were the students had to reread the reading text, and write summary from the text. Finally, the teacher closed the class by reviewing the lesson. There were some strengths and weaknesses of teaching English using word in list. The strengths were the students understood word meaning and word form easily. Besides, it improved the student's vocabulary in learning, and could stimulate students to understand the content of the text. The last, the students can create sentences and story easily. On the other hand, it had some weaknesses. The students could not reconstruct the meaning of the whole paragraph, and difficult to reconstruct the words into sentences or paragraphs...|$|E
40|$|In {{most cases}} {{a common problem}} {{students}} experience in reading classes is {{the feeling that they}} know absolutely nothing about the subject they are reading about. However, this feeling may be more complex than generally thought. The problem may not be the lack of background knowledge, but rather the failure to activate that knowledge. For Ringler and Weber (1984), <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> provide a reader with necessary background to organize activity and to comprehend the material. These experiences involve understanding the purpose(s) for reading and building a knowledge base necessary for dealing with content and the structure of the material. Ringler and Weber also note that <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activities</b> elicit prior knowledge, build background, and serve to focus attention. Wallace (1992) argues that in order to interact efficiently with the text, the second language reader needs access to content as well as context. In other words, second language readers will need to draw on appropriate schematic knowledge to reach satisfactory interpretation of the text.

The uee {{of prior}} knowledge while {{reading in the}} first language has been a primary focus for second languase researchers and educators. It is claimed that if a learner can build a bridge between what he already knows about the world and what {{is presented in the}} passage comprciiensiovn will be archieved. According to Carrel and Eisterhoid (1987), this use of prior knowledge lias been formalized as "schema theory". Schema theory explains that ci text does not carry moaning by itself, it only provides directions as to how readers sliould retrieve meaning from their pri. ir knowledge- Miuiy studies have been conducted on the effect of prior knowledge. However, almost all of these studies are carried out in ESL settings. This i'. tudy aims at providing insight into EFL learners use of their prior knowledge to comprehend information from a passage written in a foreign language. The main question investigated in this stuviy was whether a itivating EFL readers' prior knowledge by a <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> affects their recall of a text and whether this activation has an effect {{over a longer period of}} time. To acquire an answer to this question, 20 native Turkish subjects from Bilkent University in Ankiira were chosen and divided into an experimental and a control gr-oup. Both groups took a pro test which measured theii prior knowledge about a topic. Then, the experimental group subjects were provided with a pre reading activity. An Anticipation the findings concluded that there was no relationship between EFL subjects' prior knowledge and their comprehension of a text. Therefore, activating prior knowledge did not significantly increase subjects' retelling of the text. These conclusions contradict the findings of past studies on the effect of prior knowledge on reading comprehension. However, according to one of the latest studies on bilingual readers' use of background knowledge in learning from a text. Roller and Matambo (1992) found that bilingual readers used prior knowledge to improve comprehension of some passages, but not others. Characteristics of passages seemed to override the influence of prior knowledge. This selective use of prior knowledge has important implications for future research on prior knowledge and the EFL reader. It is difficult to make generalizations with the findings of the current research because of its limitations. Nevertheless, the conclusions of the experiment should be of interest to EFL teachers, teacher trainers and curriculum developers. Elmas, Belgi...|$|E

No. 58430490 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAROUSEL BRAINSTORMING IN TEACHING READING COMPREHENSION: A CASE STUDY OF THE FIRST GRADE STUDENTS OF MAN 3 KOTA CIREBON In {{learning}} to read, {{the foreign language}} learners naturally have a big challenge for comprehending written text. They do not use any strategies {{to help them understand}} the text as they are unable to connect their background knowledge with the text. They read it just because the teacher ordered so and they also consider reading only as sounding out words. This difficulty can be erased by giving them activity that is able to engage them before reading. Reading is a complex activity including both perception and thought. It is also consisting two related processes: word recognition and comprehension. Readers naturally use background knowledge, vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, experience with text and other strategies to help them understand written text. Carousel brainstorming is a strategy that requires students to access background knowledge by thinking about subtopics within a broader topic. The purpose of this activity is to activate students' prior knowledge of a topic or topics through movement and conversation. This research was conducted through qualitative methodology. This approach is used in order to gain deeper insight to the implementation of Carousel Brainstorming as <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity</b> in teaching reading comprehension. The aims of this research is to know the implementation of Carousel Brainstorming in teaching reading comprehension, to identify the contribution of the technique to students‟ reading comprehension, and also to find out {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using the technique. All the finding data are compared with the literature of Carousel Brainstorming and teaching reading comprehension. The finding of this research shows that the technique was implemented appropriately as the students were so excited with this activity. This finding is also strength by the students‟ expression towards the activity. The students feel burnt up and engaged to the text and they are able to connect their background knowledge with the text although some of the brainstorming answers develop to other points. As result of this research, Carousel Brainstorming is an easy technique that used to activate background knowledge of the students before reading the text. It gives contributions for students in activating and connecting their background knowledge with the text. The advantages of using this technique are that students can actively think and connecting their background knowledge with the text. The disadvantages of using this technique include some results of Carousel Brainstorming that may develop to other point...|$|E

Sarjana Thesis. English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Nany Soengkono M, SS, M. Pd. Keywords: Effectiveness, Vocabulary, Short Story. Vocabulary is {{an important}} component of language proficiency and it is influence how the learners listen, speak, read and write. Without having an extensive vocabulary the learners will be difficult to understand English. Related to teaching vocabulary, to the students of X-MIA 3 MAN 2 Tulungagung, the students are lack of mastering vocabulary because they had difficulties to memorize vocabularies and understand their meaning. Common errors are found when the students asked to fulfill incomplete sentences and arrange words in sentences. Because of that case, the researcher was interested in using one of good media {{that can be used in}} teaching vocabulary, which is short story. In teaching vocabulary by using short story, the students did three main activities. Those are <b>pre-reading</b> <b>activity,</b> while-reading activity and post reading activity. This study attempted to answer the following research question: (1) How is the students’ vocabulary achievement before being taught by using short story? (2) How is the students’ vocabulary achievement after being taught by using short story? (3) Is there any significant difference score of the students’ vocabulary achievement before and after being taught by using short story? In carrying this research, the researcher formulated the objectives of the study as follow: (1) To know the students’ vocabulary achievement before being taught by using short story (2) To know the students’ vocabulary achievement after being taught by using Short Story. (3) To know whether there is any significant difference score of students’ vocabulary achievement before and after being taught by using short story. The research method used in this research is pre experimental design because there is no control group. This research used quantitative approach with one group pre-test and post-test design. It is intended to find out any significant different on the student’s vocabulary achievement before and after being taught using short story. The population of this research was all students of tenth grade at MAN 2 Tulungagung that consists of nine classes. The sample of this research is the students of X-MIA 3 which consist of 38 students that are selected by using purposive sampling. Meanwhile, the research instrument used in this research was test, they are pre-test and post-test. The data collected through pre-test and post-test were analyzed by using Paired Sample T test with SPSS 16. 0. The result showed that different of mean score of students’ vocabulary before being taught using short story was 57. 50. Meanwhile, the mean score of students’ vocabulary after being taught using short story was 73. 03. The result of counting score using T-test showed that significant value (0, 000) < significant level (0. 05), the result of calculation indicated that Ha was accepted and Ho was rejected.
