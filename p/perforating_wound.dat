40|$|In {{ballistic}} wounds {{the tissue}} {{along the path}} of the projectile experiences transient displacements resulting in {{what is known as the}} temporary wound cavity. The motion of the tissue caused by the formation of the temporary cavity gives rise to a low pressure pull that sucks air and airborne debris into the wound. The latter could be a significant mechanism for bacterial and particulate contamination of projectile wounds that should be explored in detail since it can lead to infection or delayed wound healing. In order to better understand the flow of air into the temporary cavity and how it relates to particulate entry into the wound, a methodology to visualize the air flow into <b>perforating</b> projectile <b>wounds</b> was proposed and explored using an extremity surrogate. The proposed approach was only intended for qualitative observations and comparisons and was implemented in a very rudimentary fashion to determine its usefulness.

Another reason for this case report was the intensive pain associated with the existing foreign body in the orbit. A male, 54 years old, had a <b>perforating</b> <b>wound</b> of the eyeball caused by a metal foreign body, which stayed in the orbit close to the scierai wall. X-ray and echographic examinations of the orbit were not conclusive regarding the question whether this foreign body was situated within or outside the eyeball. Only CT imaging showed that foreign body produced a double perforation of the eyeball and was externally close to the sciera. Foreign body was extracted by tran-sconjunctival anterior orbitotomy through the inferior fornix, using the electromagnetic probe. Since the first day of injury and up to the eighth day, the patient had intensive deep orbital pain, which was alleviated only partially by analgetics. It could not be explained by secondary glaucoma because IOP was normal or by an inflammatory process, or in any other way. Only the extraction of foreign body from the orbit led to the complete relief of pain. We believe that the pain was caused by compression of foreign body to some of scierai sensory nerves. X-ray and echographic examinations of the orbit are not always a reliable proof in the proper evaluation whether foreign body is within or outside the eyeball in the orbit. Precise diagnosis can be made only by CT imaging. The pain in the orbit may be caused by compression of foreign body to sensory nerves...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the use of BioCornea, a fish scale-derived {{collagen}} matrix for sealing full-thickness corneal perforations in mini-pigs. Two series of experiments were carried out in 8 Lan-Yu and 3 Göttingen mini-pigs, respectively. A 2 mm central full thickness corneal perforation was made with surgical scissors and 2 mm trephines. The perforations were sealed immediately by suturing BioCornea to the wounded cornea. The conditions of each patched cornea were followed-up daily for 3 or 4 days. Status of operated eyes was assessed with slit lamp examination or optical coherence tomography (OCT). Animals were sacrificed after the study period and the corneas operated were fixated for histological examination. Both OCT imaging and handheld slit lamp observations indicated that a stable ocular integrity of the perforated corneas was maintained, showing no leakage of aqueous humor, normal depth of anterior chamber and only mild swelling of the wounded cornea. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the patched cornea showed no epithelial ingrowths to the <b>perforated</b> <b>wounds</b> and no severe leucocyte infiltration of the stroma.

40|$|In {{patients}} {{suffering from}} severe recent ocular trauma {{it is important}} to know the extent of the retinal damage before assessing the possible recovery of visual function. Ophthal-moscopic examination of the fundus is often impossible because of opacities of the ocular media caused by the trauma. In such cases the electroretinogram (ERG) is of value in assessing the state of the retina, but very few electrophysiological investigations have so far been published on such cases. This is probably because there are various technical difficulties in recording the ERG in these patients. An attempt has been made in our laboratory to overcome these difficulties. The present paper analyses the ERGs recorded in 6 I eyes in which severe and recent (less than 2 months) trauma had rendered the fundus invisible. In nineteen eyes the first record ofthe ERG was made during the first 5 days after the trauma, and in the rest between the sixth and the sixtieth day.

40|$|In {{the past}} 20 years, {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in the incidence of head injuries caused by gunshot wounds.  Penetrating brain injury is a traumatic brain injury caused by high-velocity projectiles or low-velocity sharp objects. A wound in which the projectile breaches the cranium but does not exit is referred as a penetrating wound, and an injury in which the projectile passes entirely through the head, leaving both entrance  and exit wounds, is referred to as a <b>perforating</b> <b>wound.</b> A large number of these patients who survive their initial wounding will nevertheless expire shortly after admission to the hospital. Until the introduction of aseptic surgery {{in the last quarter of}} the nineteenth century, penetrating missile injuries of the brain were almost universally fatal. We have learned a great deal about gunshot wounds and their management from military experience gained during times of war, when a large number of firearm-related casualties are treated in a short period of time. Newly designed protective body armor has reduced the incidence of penetrating brain injuries significantly. Many of the victims in the vicinity of a cased explosive or an improvised explosive device will incur injuries by fragments. Blast injury is a common mechanism of traumatic brain injury among soldiers serving in war zone. Each war has had different lessons to teach. World War I for example, proved the efficacy of vigorous surgical intervention. During World War II, the importance of initial dural repair and antibiotic medication was first, debated, then acknowledged, and finally, universally accepted. The incidence of blast-induced traumatic brain injury has increased substantially in recent military conflicts. Blast-induced neurotrauma is the term given to describe an injury to the brain that occurs after exposure to a blast. Resent conflict has exposed military personnel to sophisticated explosive devices generating blast overpressure that results in secondary cellular and molecular insults to the brain parenchyma akin to diffuse brain injury. In soldiers with varying amounts of body armor, the pattern is quite different. What had previously been fatal penetrating brain injuries now become treatable brain injuries as a consequence of secondary damping of energy by the helmet. Traumatic brain injury is not prevented by a protective helmet. High- and low-frequency blast waves disrupt the blood-brain barrier and produce massive brain swelling in a very short time, thereby necessitating urgent decompressive craniectomy, and when low in energy, such blast waves may result in cytoskeletal and diffuse axonal injury that leads to neurodegeneration. Penetrating traumatic brain injury is typically identified and treated immediately mild traumatic brain injury may be missed, particularly in the presence of other more obvious injuries. In recent years {{there has been an}} apparent paradigm shift of scientific interest in long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury and its contribution to posttraumatic stress disorder. The introduction of Guidelines for the Management of Penetrating Brain Injury has revolutionized the medical and surgical management of penetrating brain injury during the last decade. There has been a paradigm shift toward a less aggressive debridement of deep seated fragments and a more aggressive antibiotics prophylaxis in an effort to improve outcomes. ...|$|E

Trobe and Keeney (1974) reported three cases of traumatic aniridia all of which were accompanied by <b>perforating</b> <b>wounds</b> involving the cornea. This is a report of a case of traumatic cyclo-dialysis with extrusion of most of the iris through a scleral perforation. Case report A 25 -year-old White female agricultural worker was admitted to the ophthalmic department of the Barzilai Medical Centre, Ashkelon, after an injury to her left eye caused by a screwdriver (Figure). The injury had been accidentally self-inflicted two hours earlier as she had been trying to repair a tubing of metal in the cow-shed. The visual acuity in the right eye was 6 / 6, and examination of that eye including the fundus revealed nothing abnormal. The visual acuity in the left eye was hand movements with good perception of light. The upper lid was swollen with ecchymoses and abrasions of the skin. There was conjunctival injection. On the medial side about 4 mm from the limbus, a brown oval mass could be seen under the abraded conjunctiva. The cornea was clear and did not show any signs of per-foration. The anterior chamber was filled with blood and it was impossible to see any further details. The eye was hypotonic, tension by Schiotz tonometry was 5 - 5 /I 6. It was decided to proceed with exploration of the ocular injury under general anaesthesia. An operation was performed on the day of admission. On exposure of the sclera medially, a mass of soft brown tissue was seen within the scleral wound which extended along a course roughly parallel to the limbus from 7. 0 o'clock 3 mm from the limbus to io. o o'clock 9 mm from the limbus.

40|$|Background: It {{is still}} {{a matter of debate}} whether delayed primary closure (DPC) of {{contaminated}} abdominal incisions reduces surgical site infections compared with a primary closure (PC). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the optimal method of wound closure for patients with perforated appendicitis. Methods: A total of 70 patients with perforated appendicitis were included. They were randomized to have their surgical incisions (skin and subcutaneous tissue) either PC or left open with Betadine-soaked gauze packing for DPC on the fifth postoperative day or later if the wound conditions were inappropriate for closure. A wound was considered infected if pus discharged from the incision site. The main outcome measures were the incidence of wound infection and the length of hospital stay (LOS). Results: In the entire series, wound infection developed after incision closure in 21. 4 % of the patients. The PC group had a higher incidence of wound infection (38. 9 % vs. 2. 9 %, p< 0. 001) and longer LOS (8. 4 days vs. 6. 3 days, p= 0. 038).

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{management}} of head-injured patients admitted to emergency departments is not standardized. METHODS The authors performed {{a retrospective analysis}} of 10, 000 head-injured patients admitted to the Emergency Department of our hospital in a 21 -month period and, {{on the basis of}} a statistical correlation between each clinical parameter (symptoms and signs upon arrival at the hospital or risk factors) and the presence of intracranial lesions, they propose a practical protocol in an attempt to avoid the overuse of radiologic examinations and yet identify patients with possible life-threatening complications. RESULTS On the basis of this correlation the patients have been divided into four groups, In the first group (called group alpha) are patients with: no history of loss of consciousness, no vomiting or amnesia, a normal neurologic examination, and minimal if any subgaleal swelling. They can be released into the care of relatives who are given a special instruction sheet (X rays unnecessary). No patient in group alpha had complications of any kind. The second group (group beta) is made up of patients with at least one of the following features: transient loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, a single episode of vomiting or significant subgaleal swelling. They undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan and if this is normal, only a short period of observation is needed. If CT scan is not available, the skull is X rayed and, if this X ray is negative, the patient is sent home with the warning sheet after an observation period. If a fracture is found, CT scan should be performed promptly. No patient in group beta with normal skull X rays developed intracranial lesions. The third group (group gamma) contains patients with at least one of the following symptoms: impaired consciousness, repeated episodes of vomiting, neurologic deficits, otorrhagia, otorrhea, rhinorrea, signs of basal skull fracture, seizures, penetrating or <b>perforating</b> <b>wounds,</b> lack of cooperation for varying reasons, patients who have undergone previous intracranial operations or been affected by coagulopathy or submitted to anticoagulant therapy, and finally, epileptic or alcoholic patients. They receive a CT scan immediately and, if necessary, again prior to discharge. Six patients in group gamma with GCS = 15 upon admission were operated on for intracranial hematoma. The fourth group (group delta) is composed of comatose patients. Immediately following resuscitation maneuvers and prior to any surgical intervention, they undergo a CT scan. A linear association between the severity groups and the presence of intracranial lesions has been demonstrated.

Eight months later, the patient was rehospitalized due to an implantation iris cyst and traumatic cataract. The cyst was excised, the extracapsular cataract extraction was done and the anterior chamber lens was implanted. Postoperative visual acuity was normal. Three years later, the patient presented for a follow-up examination, with the cyst filled up again, occupying two thirds of the anterior chamber. This time, the cyst was completely excised, all fibrous remnants of the secondary cataract were removed, and the iridoplasty was necessary due to large iris coloboma.

Patients were dividedinto two groups as follows: Lapp(−), n = 32; Lapp(+), n = 32. Patient demographics were not statisticallydifferent and antibiotic protocols were identical. ResultsIn the Lapp(−) group, the appendix was perforated in seven patients (21. 9 %) and not perfo-rated in 25 patients (78. 1 %). In the Lapp(+) group, the appendix was perforated in nine patients (28. 1 %) and not perforated in 23 patients (71. 9 %).

In addition, Barker had been violated with foreign objects which had extensively distended his rectum. At 4 p.m. the same day, a 15-year-old named Russell Rugh was abducted from a bus stop in Garden Grove. Rugh was bound, beaten and strangled to death after an estimated eight hours of captivity before his body was discarded alongside that of Glenn Barker in Cleveland National Forest. The youths' nude bodies were found on March 23.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} Lapprotector™, a {{protective}} film and ring device for protectingwounds, can prevent wound infection after open appendectomy. Methods: We performed open appendectomy on 64 patients between 2004 and 2006. In September 2005, we started using Lapprotector™ {{to protect the}} site of incision (McBurney's point). Patients were dividedinto two groups as follows: Lapp(−), n = 32; Lapp(+), n = 32. Patient demographics were not statisticallydifferent and antibiotic protocols were identical. Results: In the Lapp(−) group, the appendix was perforated in seven patients (21. 9 %) and not perfo-rated in 25 patients (78. 1 %). In the Lapp(+) group, the appendix was perforated in nine patients (28. 1 %) and not perforated in 23 patients (71. 9 %). For <b>perforated</b> cases, incisional <b>wound</b> infection was seen in three out of seven patients (42. 9 %) in the Lapp(−) group and in no patient (0 %) in the Lapp(+) group, a significant difference (p < 0. 05, χ 2 test). For nonperforated cases, wound infection was seen in {{only one out of}} 25 patients (4. 0 %) in the Lapp(−) group. Conclusion: We recommend using Lapprotector™ to prevent incisional wound infection in patientsrequiring open appendectomy, especially in cases where the appendix is perforated...|$|R
50|$|Ten {{days after}} Bonin had been {{released}} from custody, on March 14, he abducted and killed an 18-year-old Van Nuys youth named Ronald Gatlin. Gatlin was abducted shortly after he had left a friend's home. He was beaten, sodomized and suffered several deep, <b>perforating</b> ice pick <b>wounds</b> to the ear and neck before being strangled with a ligature. Gatlin's body, bound hand and foot, was found the following day {{in the city of}} Duarte.

40|$|Introduction. Trophic ulcers are {{a common}} health problem, and there are {{numerous}} treatment methods. Irreversible damage in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia with long-term ulcer existence make standard autotransplantation inneffective. Skin grafts are often complicated by partial or complete rejection of skin flaps. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the feasibility of using transplanted cultivated allogenic fibroblasts on the backing of a cellularless xenogenic fabric for wound healing. Methods. Transplantation of cultured embryonic fibroblasts on a backing of xenogenic tissue was used in the complex treatment of trophic ulcers for stimulation of regenerative processes. Decellularization xenogenic film was previously held. Then allogenic fibroblasts were cultivated on the surface of collagen-elastin matrix. Since 2013, we treated 12 patients with giant ulcers caused by the following: lymphedema (2 patients), vascular disease (3 patients), diabetes (2 patients), after injury (4 patients), and radiation ulcer (1 patient). Dimensions of ulcers were from 150 to 600 cm 2. Duration of the lower limb ulcers ranged from 8 months to 10 years. For a number of years, all patients were on a complex therapy, which had not resulted in healing wounds. During the operation when excision of granulation tissue was performed, plastic <b>wounds</b> <b>perforated</b> with the ratio 1 : 2 autoskin. Xenogenic fabric with cultured fibroblasts was applied on top. In this case, xenogenic film protected the skin from drying, created optimal microclimate, and cultured fibroblasts stimulating regeneration and improving engraftment. Results. The first redress was held on the fifth day. In all cases, the results of engraftment skin grafts achieved maximum possible (100 %) and optimal (90 %). Complete epithelialization of the cell perforation was seen in five patients on the fifth day and three on seventh day after skin plastics. Average period of inpatient treatment was 20. 7 days. All patients were discharged with healed wounds. Conclusion. Thus, the treatment of trophic ulcers can be successfully solved using advances in biotechnology. Transplantation of cultivated allogenic fibroblasts on a backing of cellularless xenogenic fabric shows good clinical results due to the stimulation of regenerative processes and creates the optimum environment for autotransplants.  </div...|$|R
