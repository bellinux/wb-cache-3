These facilities {{are capable of}} large <b>production</b> <b>volumes,</b> often {{hundreds of millions of}} ICs per day. This capacity is shared across many IC companies, so ramping <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> of specific ICs, or in this case specific MEMS oscillators, is a function of allocating standard production equipment. Conversely, quartz oscillator factories are single-function in nature, so that ramping production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|E

25|$|Abyei is {{situated}} within the Muglad Basin, a large rift basin which contains {{a number of}} hydrocarbon accumulations. Oil exploration was undertaken in Sudan in the 1970s and 1980s. A period of significant investment in Sudan’s oil industry occurred in the 1990s and Abyei became a target for this investment. By 2003 Abyei contributed more than one quarter of Sudan’s total crude oil output. <b>Production</b> <b>volumes</b> have since declined and reports suggest that Abyei’s reserves are nearing depletion. An important oil pipeline, the Greater Nile Oil Pipeline, travels through the Abyei area from the Heglig and Unity oil fields to Port Sudan on the Red Sea via Khartoum. The pipeline is vital to Sudan’s oil exports which have boomed since the pipeline commenced operation in 1999.|$|E

50|$|We {{note that}} the {{productivity}} model reports a 1.4% productivity growth from the same production data. The difference (1.4% versus 1.5%) {{is caused by the}} different <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> used in the models. In the productivity model the input volume is used as a <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> measure giving the growth rate 1.063. In this case productivity is defined as follows: output volume per one unit of input volume. In the growth accounting model the output volume is used as a <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> measure giving the growth rate 1.078. In this case productivity is defined as follows: input consumption per one unit of output volume. The case can be verified easily with the aid of productivity model using output as a <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|R

25|$|While the Hawker Fury offered better performance, lower <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> {{made it more}} {{expensive}} and therefore it remained available only in small numbers, so when a fighter version of the Hart was suggested, the Air Ministry selected the type as an interim fighter until higher-performance fighters could be bought in larger numbers. The new fighter variant added a second Vickers machine gun, while the coaming of the rear cockpit was angled to give a better field of fire, and a supercharged Kestrel IS engine was fitted. Evaluation of an initial batch of six aircraft, known as Hart Fighters by one flight of 23 Squadron during 1931 was successful, and larger orders followed for the fighter Hart, {{now known as the}} Hawker Demon. The Demon's first flight was on 10 February 1933.|$|E

The FCX Clarity also has an advantage over gas-electric hybrids in {{that it does not}} use an internal combustion engine to propel itself. Like a gas-electric hybrid, it uses a lithium ion battery to assist the fuel cell during acceleration and capture energy through regenerative braking, thus improving fuel efficiency. The lack of hydrogen filling stations throughout developed countries will keep <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> low. Honda will release the vehicle in groups of 150. California is the only U.S. market with infrastructure for fueling such a vehicle, though the number of stations is still limited. Building more stations is expensive, as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) granted $6.8million for four H2 fueling stations, costing $1.7million USD each.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963 Fairchild's analog IC lineup, {{designed}} to military specifications, {{consisted of three}} amplifier circuits. Fairchild engineers before Widlar designed analog ICs like conventional circuits built with discrete devices. They had already realized the severe limitations of early planar process, which made this approach impractical, but had not proposed working alternatives (active loads and active current sources {{had yet to be}} invented). When the original schematic required resistor values that were too low or too high for planar process, the designers employed external nichrome thin film resistors. The resulting hybrid ICs performed poorly and were prohibitively expensive. Fairchild's R chief Gordon Moore directed the company to favor digital integrated circuits, which were relatively robust and promised high <b>production</b> <b>volumes.</b> Widlar opposed this strategy and held digital electronics in low esteem: [...] "every idiot can count to one".
