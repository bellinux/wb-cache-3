25|$|In June 2011 {{work was}} {{completed}} on a $6.2 million remodeling of the 58-year-old terminal building. The City of Sioux City received {{federal and state}} funds that picked up 78 percent of the $6.2 million cost to renovate the terminal building. The city received a Federal Aviation Administration grant for the new <b>passenger</b> <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> plus $3.97 million in federal stimulus funds and a state Airport Vertical Infrastructure grant. The city's share was $1.4 million, which was about {{twice as much as}} originally estimated caused construction problems due to termite and drainage damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport site}} was {{developed}} in 1928-30. A terminal building was built in 1940. Scheduled airline service was initially provided by Moose Jaw-based Prairie Airways (in 1938) and then Trans-Canada Air Lines (in 1939). A new terminal building was erected in 1960. Major renovations to this terminal building were conducted in 1983-86. A $24-million expansion started in January 2004, increasing its capacity to 1.2 million passengers per year. The first stage of the expansion included {{the expansion of the}} terminal and includes a larger post-security holding room, another <b>passenger</b> <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> an expansion to the international arrivals area and more baggage carousels. The first phase was completed in August 2005.|$|E

50|$|In 2013 the Airport began {{construction}} on a 2-story 67,000 sf replacement passenger terminal building. The new terminal will feature <b>passenger</b> <b>loading</b> <b>bridges,</b> new concessions, expanded passenger areas and space for additional airlines. This {{is part of}} the Airport's $50M Terminal Area Redevelopment Program. The new terminal was topped off on June 10, 2014 and officially opened on August 19, 2015.|$|R

50|$|Work {{began in}} August 2011 {{upgrading}} the passenger screening facilities at airport. The checkpoint expansion {{will consist of}} the addition of three new screening lanes as well as improvements to the airport's infrastructure. The TSA will supply the new screening equipment for the expanded area. The expansion also includes development of a Federal Inspection Services station. Under this project, equipment will include additional <b>passenger</b> <b>loading</b> <b>bridges</b> and gates, new technological upgrades, baggage carousel improvements, added retail space and improved check-in capabilities.|$|R
50|$|The main {{passenger}} terminal {{consists of three}} interconnected buildings totaling approximately 220000 ft2 m2. The central building consists of just under 120000 ft2 m2 of space while the western and eastern wings occupy slightly more than 50000 ft2 m2 each. The apron fronting the {{passenger terminal}} has ten aircraft parking positions, each able to accommodate a Boeing 747. Only eight of the positions are usable; two are used to provide eleven helicopter parking positions and there are just seven <b>passenger</b> <b>loading</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The airport has {{recently}} undergone renovations {{which include a}} new 110000 sq ft terminal building with room for expansion, which was completed in 2009 and designed by CSHQA and The Abell Architectural Group Inc. [...] The new terminal has an observation deck on the second floor, a restaurant for screened and unscreened <b>passengers,</b> and second-story <b>loading</b> <b>bridges.</b> Now that the terminal is complete, there is a main concourse, and two open air concourses. A new control tower was completed in late 2008; the $3.6 million, 100 ft tower uses a state-of-the-art geothermal system to heat and cool the building.|$|R
50|$|On October 27, 2009, {{during the}} evening commute, the steel {{crossbeam}} and two steel tie rods repaired over Labor Day weekend snapped off the Bay Bridge's eastern section {{and fell to the}} upper deck. The cause may have been due to metal-on-metal vibration from bridge traffic and wind gusts of up to 55 mph causing failure of one rod, which broke off, which then led to the metal section crashing down. Three vehicles were either struck by or hit the fallen debris, though there were no injuries. On November 1, Caltrans announced that the bridge would probably stay closed at least through the morning commute of Monday, November 2, after repairs performed during the weekend failed a stress test on Sunday. BART and the Golden Gate Ferry systems added supplemental service to accommodate the increased <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> during the <b>bridge</b> closure. The bridge reopened to traffic on November 2, 2009.|$|R
50|$|Specific to a {{stage house}} using a {{counterweight}} system, the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> or <b>loading</b> gallery, is a catwalk vertically positioned below the headlock beam, {{and above the}} fly gallery. The <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> is used to add or remove counterweights from arbors. The floor of the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> is also typically used as a storage area for uncommitted counterweights that are available for loading onto counterweight arbors. Stage houses with especially tall fly towers, or double-purchase systems, may have two <b>loading</b> <b>bridges,</b> one stacked over the other to facilitate the loading of relatively tall arbors.|$|R
30|$|As Fig.  2 shows, if a bus {{operator}} {{wants to}} control the bus comfort level around slightly uncomfortable (CP =  5) or more, the maximum average <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> should be 0.7, because when the average <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> factor exceeds 0.7, despite the average in-vehicle time lowering to 10  min, the CP value remains at less than 5. When the average in-vehicle time is 40  min, the average <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> should be less than 0.36; otherwise, the CP value will be less than 5 and passengers may feel worse than slightly uncomfortable.|$|R
50|$|By using a {{retractable}} tunnel design, <b>loading</b> <b>bridges</b> may retract {{and extend}} varying lengths. Some airports use fixed walkways to effectively extend {{the reach of}} a <b>loading</b> <b>bridge.</b> The fixed walkway extends out from the terminal building and connects to the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> rotunda. Occasionally, fixed bridges lead to multiple <b>loading</b> <b>bridges.</b> There are some jetways (such as several older bridges on the north terminal at Edmonton International Airport) that sit directly on the ground, as opposed to supports. These jetways are often used by small airlines or airplanes that are sometimes too low for conventional jetways (such as the Dash 8 and CRJ).|$|R
40|$|Airline {{industry}} has been growing at an outstanding rate with an annual growth rate about 6 % worldwide in <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> for the past decade. Airport transport industry around the globe has faced extreme challenge of handling high volumes of passengers especially in Asia due to the economy growth {{and most of them}} are already operating at 80 % - 90 % of their capacity in the recent year. The major clients – the airlines for the airport are also facing enormous pressure from the passengers to provide good services starting from the airport. Currently, the airport is using a fixed <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> of Y% for all the airlines to predict the passenger flows for departure flights. The airport operations departments are also using it a guide to do the resource planning such as check-in counters to be opened and manpower required to man these counters. However, from the initial analysis, we have identified that the <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> varied largely due to factors such as type of airlines (Full cost carrier verse low cost carrier), aircraft type, destinations etc. In this paper, we are going to analyze the <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> from the past historical pattern and develop a predictive model using decision tree (DT) to forecast the <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> based on certain criteria. The model is being tested against the actual data given for a particular month and the root mean square error of 3 %- 12 % is observed for all the airlines at the airport. It shows the usefulness of the model in the real-world to predict the <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> which will be useful to do the resource planning at the airport for day to day planning. Finally, a simulation model has been developed using the predicted <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> as an input to compute the optimal number of check-in counters required to meet the service level agreement...|$|R

30|$|In sum, {{although}} the extant literature on comfort is extensive, it largely {{concentrates on the}} influence of <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> on comfort levels. More specifically, research attention devoted to in-vehicle time, which may also influence passengers’ comfort perception, is limited, especially in the context of quantity measurements. Although there are other factors affecting bus comfort (Eboli and Mazzulla 2007; Shek and Chan 2008), this study focuses on <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> and in-vehicle time.|$|R

5000|$|A {{crush load}} is {{a level of}} <b>passenger</b> <b>loading</b> in a {{transport}} vehicle which is so high that passengers are [...] "crushed" [...] against one another. It represents an extreme form of <b>passenger</b> <b>loading,</b> and normally considered to be representative of a system with serious capacity limitations. Crush loads result from too many passengers within a vehicle designed for a much smaller number. Crush loaded trains or buses are so heavily loaded that for most passengers physical contact with several other nearby passengers is impossible to avoid.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{stochastic}} {{analysis of}} transit segment hourly <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> factor variation for transit capacity {{and quality of}} service (QoS) analysis using Automatic Fare Collection data for a premium radial bus route in Brisbane, Australia. It compares stochastic analysis to traditional peak hour factor (PHF) analysis to gain further insight into variability of transit route segments’ <b>passenger</b> <b>loading</b> during a study hour. It demonstrates that hourly design load factor is a useful method of modeling a route segment’s capacity and QoS time history across the study weekday. This analysis method is readily adaptable to different <b>passenger</b> <b>load</b> standards by adjusting design percentile, reflecting either a more relaxed or more stringent condition. This paper also considers hourly coefficient of variation of load factor as a capacity and QoS assessment measure, in particular through its relationships with hourly average and design load factors. Smaller value reflects uniform <b>passenger</b> <b>loading,</b> which is generally indicative of well dispersed passenger boarding demands and good schedule maintenance. Conversely, higher value may be indicative of pulsed or uneven passenger boarding demands, poor schedule maintenance, and/or bus bunching. An assessment table based on hourly coefficient of variation of load factor is developed and applied to this case study. Inferences are drawn for a selection of study hours across the weekday studied...|$|R
