5|$|After {{arriving}} in Ohio, Hensley {{returned to his}} personal ministry and held services in the area. Because he was illiterate, Bertha would read <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> the Bible during services, after which Hensley would deliver a sermon on a theme drawn from the verses. He also frequently preached {{on the topic of}} faith healing during this period. He remained in Ohio for several years, divorcing Amanda in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Although the game's story diverges {{in several}} places and {{features}} a completely different protagonist, several levels mirror <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> Lovecraft's novella The Shadow over Innsmouth. It also contains elements of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game's campaign Escape from Innsmouth, such as the Marsh Refinery raid. A major sub-plot {{of the game is}} inspired by Lovecraft's novella The Shadow Out of Time.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Swisher co-authored History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present with West Virginia {{historian}} Hu Maxwell. The {{book was}} the first comprehensive history of Hampshire County ever compiled. He composed a collection of poetry and short stories, Briar Blossoms, in 1899, and was the editor of The Ghourki, a literary journal of poetry, short stories, and aphorisms. In 1908, Swisher published Book of Harangues, a selection of <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> The Ghourki.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1879 Dmytro Leontovych was {{moved to a new}} parish located in the village Shershni where he would spend his childhood. Then in 1887 Leontovych was {{admitted}} to Nemyriv gymnasium. Due to financial problems a year later, however, his father transferred him to the Sharhorod Spiritual Beginners School, whose pupils received full financial support. At the school Leontovych mastered singing, and was able to freely read difficult <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> religious choral texts.|$|E
5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, describing it {{as a powerful}} work that has suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the similarity of <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The Small House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that some aspects of her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} Diolkos at Corinth, there is scant {{literary}} evidence {{for two more}} ship trackways by that name in antiquity, both in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius (c. 320–400AD) records two <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> his 1st centuryAD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria {{which may have been}} located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his trackway.|$|E
5|$|Later, Means and Black {{listen to}} McKenna reading {{a passage from}} the Bible. Afterwards, McKenna reveals that she knows {{a great deal about}} the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E

5|$|Numerous polemicists, such as Irish {{journalist}} Philip Graves in a 1921 {{article in}} The Times, and British academic Norman Cohn in his 1967 book Warrant for Genocide, have proven The Protocols {{to be both}} a hoax and a clear case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist Matvei Golovinski fabricated the text for Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire, {{as a work of}} counter-revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution, by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some <b>passages,</b> <b>from</b> The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a 19th-century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly.|$|E
5|$|Retiarii first {{appeared}} in the arena during the 1st century AD and had become standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century. The gladiator's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered the retiarius the lowliest (and most effeminate) of an already stigmatised (i.e. gladiators) class. <b>Passages</b> <b>from</b> the works of Juvenal, Seneca, and Suetonius suggest that those retiarii who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype (retiarii tunicati) who were not viewed as legitimate retiarii fighters but as arena clowns. Nevertheless, Roman artwork, graffiti, and grave markers include examples of specific net-men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers.|$|E
5|$|The {{sketches}} {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, possibly even earlier. The inner movements were sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form movements were only sketched up to the beginning of the recapitulation and in the coda. In the sketches, <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such evidence suggests that the last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. Furthermore, in the B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales were conceived at a later stage.|$|E

5|$|Two of David's best-known books {{focus on}} the cuisine of France: French Country Cooking (1951) and French Provincial Cooking (1960); France {{features}} prominently, though not exclusively, in another two: A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) and Summer Cooking (1955). She set the pattern for her books by grouping recipes by category, with sections linked by her chosen <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> relevant literature. In her first book, Mediterranean Food, David presented chapters on soups; eggs and luncheon dishes; fish; meat; substantial dishes; poultry and game; vegetables; cold food and salads; sweets; jams, chutneys and preserves; and sauces. She broadly followed this pattern in her next four books.|$|E
5|$|In April 1876 he {{returned}} to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 {{he returned}} home at Christmas {{for six months and}} took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E

5|$|In {{the realm}} of modern research, the late British {{biochemist}} and historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900–1995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources {{on the life of}} Su and his achievements known in his day. In 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower in a famous drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering. A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London. In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked for the Chinese Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's editing {{of works}} by The Five is significant. It was a {{practical}} extension of the collaborative atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s, when they heard each other's compositions in progress and worked on them together, and {{was an effort to}} save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely. This work included the completion of Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor, which Rimsky-Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin's death, and the orchestration of <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> César Cui's William Ratcliff for its first production in 1869. He also completely orchestrated the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Dargomyzhsky three times—in 1869–70, 1892 and 1902. While not a member of The Five himself, Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared their musical philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Schubert {{composed}} {{his three}} last sonatas in close succession; furthermore, {{he intended to}} publish them together as a set, as evident by the sonatas' titles. In support of this view that the sonatas are a single unity, pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas. He {{has argued that the}} sonatas complement each other in their different characters, and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same basic group of intervallic motifs. Moreover, each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements, and <b>passages</b> <b>from</b> one movement often reappear, usually transformed, in later movements. Most of these connections are too subtle to be detected during casual listening. In some cases, however, Schubert quotes a theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration, inserting it in structurally significant locations, creating an immediately audible allusion. Such explicit connections are related to the cyclic form, one of the musical forms associated with the Romantic period in music.|$|E
