5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil <b>Partnership</b> and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil <b>partnership</b> ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil <b>partnership</b> or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil <b>partnership</b> aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} of {{the first phase of}} a study conducted to investigate the factors that contribute to the success of <b>partnerships</b> between vocational education and training (VET) providers and community/industry, and the processes <b>partnerships</b> employ to produce quality learning outcomes for individuals and other stakeholders, including enterprises, industries and communities. This phase of the project maps the <b>partnerships</b> that have previously been researched or reported, using a meta-analysis methodology. The literature reviewed here is restricted to the period since 1995, and 117 <b>partnerships</b> from several sources were identified and analysed. The <b>partnerships</b> identified in this paper are analysed in terms of their status at the time of reporting in the literature. The review of Australian VET <b>partnerships</b> found that industry-provider <b>partnerships</b> were the most common. Industry-provider <b>partnerships</b> were predominant in urban areas, while in rural areas community-industry-provider <b>partnerships</b> were most common. This rural/urban divide was also reflected in different purposes of the <b>partnerships.</b> While urban <b>partnerships</b> were most frequently concerned with industry development, rural <b>partnerships</b> were most frequently concerned with regional development through education and training. Measures of success were found to be determined primarily by stakeholders of <b>partnerships,</b> generally by comparing outcomes with goals and objectives. The most frequently reported outcomes were community development, access and equity and collaboration between stakeholders. The {{findings of}} this paper raise several questions about <b>partnerships</b> and quality training outcomes. Further investigation is required to determine what measures (other than customer satisfaction) should be used to evaluate quality of training outcomes. <br /...|$|R

Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an {{assistant}} in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in Bournemouth where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who {{had been born in}} Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During {{the first decade of the}} 20thcentury, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the <b>partnership</b> was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into <b>partnership</b> with E.J.Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester.

40|$|In this article, we {{move away}} from the case study {{approach}} dominant in the literature on <b>partnerships</b> and explore the emergence of networks of <b>partnerships.</b> Taking the global cocoa sector as our research setting, we examine 55 <b>partnerships</b> to analyse the linkages between them, their evolution over time, as well as the simultaneous occurrence of cooperation and competition. We discover that the <b>partnerships</b> are connected to each other through overlapping memberships of organizations and increasingly also through institutional linkages. The linkages between the <b>partnerships</b> channel the flow of resources and thereby reinforce the capacity of individual <b>partnerships.</b> A meta-governance organization, which steers and coordinates the broader sustainability efforts of the cocoa industry, enhances the impact of the linkages. Our analysis shows that <b>partnerships</b> should be studied not only as autonomous entities but also as networks of <b>partnerships...</b>|$|R
