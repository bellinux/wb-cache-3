40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this thesis is that a considerable proportion of students around the world attend school in inadequate facilities, which is detrimental for the students’ learning outcome. The overall objective in this thesis {{is to develop a}} methodology, with a novel approach to involve teachers, to generate a valuable basis for decisions regarding design and improvement of physical school environment, based on the expressed needs for a specific school, municipality, or district as well as evidence from existing research. Three studies have been conducted to fulfil the objective: (1) a systematic literature review and development of a theoretical model for analysing the role of the physical environment in schools; (2) semi structured interviews with teachers to get their conceptions of the physical school environment; (3) a stated <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> with experimental design as an online survey. Wordings from the transcripts from the interview study were used when designing the survey form. The aim of the stated <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> was to examine the usability of the method when applied in this new context of physical school environment. The result is the methodology with a mixed method chain where the first step involves a broad investigation of the specific circumstances and conceptions for the specific school, municipality, or district. The second step is to use the developed theoretical model and results from the literature study to analyse the results from the first step and transform them in to a format that fits the design of a stated <b>preference</b> <b>study.</b> The final step is a refined version of the procedure of the performed stated <b>preference</b> <b>study...</b>|$|E

Our objectives were to conduct a systematic review of stated <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> for cancer screening, identify gaps in the literature, and determine which types of research should be conducted in the future. MethodsWe considered all studies in the PubMed database through May 2005 that measured utility-based stated preferences for cancer screening using contingent valuation or conjoint analysis. We abstracted data on 1) study characteristics and 2) study results and policy implications. ResultsWe found eight (of 84 identified) <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> for cancer screening. The most commonly studied cancer was breast cancer, and the most commonly used method was contingent valuation. We found no studies for prostate cancer or physician <b>preferences.</b> <b>Studies</b> demonstrated that although individuals are able to state their preferences for cancer screening, they do not weigh test benefits and harms, and a significant percentage would choose to have no screening at all. Several studies found that test accuracy and reduction in mortality risk were important for determining <b>preferences.</b> ConclusionFew <b>studies</b> of cancer screening preferences exist. The available studies examine only a few types of cancer and do not explore practice and policy implications in depth. The results of this review will be useful in identifying the focus of future research, identifying which screening methods may be more preferred to increase use of the programs, and developing interventions and policies that could facilitate informed and shared decision making for screening...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to calculate economic values for pork quality traits for use in genetic selection. The method considers the normal variability of pork quality traits within a herd or population. The parameters required for this method are the mean, standard deviation, and range of the quality trait within the herd or population, {{and the relationship of}} the level of the quality trait with price received for pork at the consumer level. The method was applied to results from a consumer <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> of quality traits of pork loin that was conducted by the National Pork Producers Council. Resulting economic values of percentage of lipid (lipid%), Instron score, and ultimate pH were $. 9112, $-. 4040, and $-. 3469, respectively, per kilogram of loin per unit increase in the trait. Results indicate that efforts to increase lipid% and to decrease Instron score can result in extra revenues for swine production.

The ingredient cost of topical preparations is typically more than oral preparations, but could save costs because they have fewer adverse effects. A cost–utility study is needed to decide on their comparative cost effectiveness. Methods. We recruited 585 people aged ≥ 50 yrs with knee pain; 282 participated in a randomized controlled trial and 303 in a patient <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> from 26 MRC General Practice Research Framework practices in the UK. They received advice to preferentially use topical or oral NSAIDs for knee pain. We calculated the comparative cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from both a National Health Service (NHS) and a societal perspective over 12 and 24 months. Results. Compared with the topical route, oral NSAIDs cost the NHS £ 191 and £ 72 more over 1 yr in the randomized trial and <b>preference</b> <b>study,</b> respectively. The cost per QALY, from an NHS perspective, was in the range of £ 9000 –£ 12 000 in the randomized trial.

In the second 14 day test period small groups of five caged birds, where each bird was randomly taken from a different diet in period 1, were exposed continuously to one of ten possible pairs of diet combinations. Dietary treatment in the first period had a significant effect on body weight, but did not alter the variance within a group of birds.

40|$|ACL- 3 International audienceMany stated <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> report framing {{effects in}} {{responses}} to valuation questions. Framing in stated <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> occurs when respondents use irrelevant {{information contained in}} the question to help them value the good. This may occur because respondents are uncertain or do not hold well-formed preferences for the good in question. We investigate if respondent certainty explains framing effects in a contingent valuation study, using data from a double bounded dichotomous elicitation format and a follow-up certainty question. We investigate if respondent certainty influences anchoring and the shift effect. We find evidence that the anchoring effect is stronger for respondents who are less certain about their response to the contingent valuation question compared to respondents who are very certain. However, the shift effect is significant and negative only for respondents who are very certain. Our results indicate that certain respondents are more consistent with the predictions of rational behaviour than uncertain respondents...|$|R

In recent years, the number, scope, and quality of valuation studies have increased dramatically. Revealed <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> of wage compensation for occupational risks, on which analysts have primarily relied, have benefited from improved data and statistical methods. Stated preference research has improved methodologically and expanded dramatically. Studies are now available for several health conditions associated with environmental causes, and researchers have explored many issues concerning the validity of the estimates. With the growing numbers of both types of studies, several meta-analyses have become available that provide insight into the results of both methods. Challenges remain, including better understanding of the persistently smaller estimates from stated preference than from wage differential studies and of how valuation depends on the individual’s age, health status, and characteristics of the illnesses most frequently associated with environmental causes. value of a statistical life, mortality risk reduction, hedonic wage <b>studies,</b> stated <b>preference</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R

Our automated method consists of vessel segmentation, vessel registration, corresponding vessel branch matching, vessel quality measure (VQM) estimation, and automatic selection of best branches based on VQM. For every branch, the VQM was calculated as the average radial gradient. An observer <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> was conducted to visually compare the quality of the selected vessels. 167 corresponding branch pairs were evaluated by two radiologists.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 This paper applies a {{meta-analysis}} to investigate variation in {{willingness to pay}} estimates that arise {{from the use of}} different commodity descriptions in stated preference valuation surveys. To maintain commodity consistency, the data set for this meta-analysis is composed of willingness to pay estimates from contingent valuation, conjoint analysis, and choice experiment studies valuing water quality change in surface water bodies in the United States. The analysis uses an ordinary least squares regression with a cluster command to correct for potential correlation between observations drawn from the same study. The primary contribution of this study is the identification of systematic variation across stated <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> resulting from changes in how the environmental commodity is presented and defined.

The foresight of market reactions {{can lead to a}} competitive advantage. Market share losses can be minimized (and market share gains maximized) with the knowledge obtained from primary marketing research involving a stated <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> to examine consumer behaviour. Before launching a new product or providing a service, discrete choice analysis can empower strategic planners, managers and marketers with a tool which aids in optimizing products and services for a potential market with the end of maximizing sales and services. Discrete choice analysis is a tool to understand human choice behaviour. It is employed for statistical inference on a model of choice behaviour from data obtained by sampling from a population of decision makers. This thesis gives an overview of the basic concepts of conjoint analysis which addresses discrete choice analysis for strategic product and service planning.

40|$|Abstract Background For {{women who}} have a {{caesarean}} section in their preceding pregnancy, two care policies for birth are considered standard: planned vaginal birth and planned elective repeat caesarean. Currently available information about the {{benefits and harms of}} both forms of care are derived from retrospective and prospective cohort studies. There have been no randomised trials, and recognising the deficiencies in the literature, there have been calls for methodologically rigorous studies to assess maternal and infant health outcomes associated with both care policies. The aims of our study are to assess in women with a previous caesarean birth, who are eligible in the subsequent pregnancy for a vaginal birth, whether a policy of planned vaginal birth after caesarean compared with a policy of planned repeat caesarean affects the risk of serious complications for the woman and her infant. Methods/Design Design: Multicentred patient <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> and a randomised clinical trial. Inclusion Criteria: Women with a single prior caesarean presenting in their next pregnancy with a single, live fetus in cephalic presentation, who have reached 37 weeks gestation, and who do not have a contraindication to a planned VBAC. Trial Entry & Randomisation: Eligible women will be given an information sheet during pregnancy, and will be recruited to the study from 37 weeks gestation after an obstetrician has confirmed eligibility for a planned vaginal birth. Written informed consent will be obtained. Women who consent to the patient <b>preference</b> <b>study</b> will be allocated their preference for either planned VBAC or planned, elective repeat caesarean. Women who consent to the randomised trial will be randomly allocated to either the planned vaginal birth after caesarean or planned elective repeat caesarean group. Treatment Groups: Women in the planned vaginal birth group will await spontaneous onset of labour whilst appropriate. Women in the elective repeat caesarean group will have this scheduled for between 38 and 40 weeks. Primary Study Outcome: Serious adverse infant outcome (death or serious morbidity).

40|$|Stated <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> are {{increasingly}} employed {{to estimate the}} value of attributes of European agrarian landscapes and changes therein. Despite the vast amount of case <b>studies,</b> <b>preferences</b> for landscape attributes are context specific, which inhibits cross-case comparison and up-scaling. In this study, we address this problem by applying a meta-analysis of stated <b>preference</b> <b>studies</b> that focus on attributes of European agrarian landscapes (n = 345). The main objective {{of this study is}} to identify generic preferences for particular types of landscape attributes across case studies. In addition, landscape context variables that explain preference heterogeneity between different cases that address similar landscape attributes are identified. We find that landscape attributes that describe mosaic land cover, historic buildings or the presence of livestock generally receive the highest stated preferences across cases. Furthermore, we find relations between preferences for particular attributes and context variables – such as population density and GDP per capita – using a meta-regression analysis. The results of the present study provide the first cross-disciplinary and cross-case evidence on relations between preferences for landscape attributes and socio-economic and landscape context conditions.

By combining revealed and stated preference data, some of the studies have obtained enough independent variation in variables to disentangle effects of cost, time, and reliability, while still grounding the results in real behavior. Both sets of studies find {{that the value of}} time saved on the morning commute is quite high (between $ 20 and $ 40 per hour) when based on revealed behavior, and less than half that amount when based on hypothetical behavior. When satisfactorily identified, reliability is also valued quite highly.
