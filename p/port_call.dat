Her maiden voyage revealed more problems; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first <b>port</b> <b>call</b> the captain purchased electric fans with his own money and the electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar. The copper rings for sealing the portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E

5|$|Sailing via the longer, but safer {{southern}} route, {{on the way}} to the Middle East {{the convoy}} carrying the Australians made a <b>port</b> <b>call</b> at Durban, South Africa. While there, the battalion marched through the city under arms on 13 December 1940, before re-embarking. Disembarking in Alexandria, Egypt, on 31 December 1940, the battalion went into camp at Ikingi Maryut with 33 officers and 707 men. In February 1941, the battalion was transferred once more, as the 18th Brigade was reassigned to the 7th Division. Around the same time, the brigade was reduced to only three infantry battalions as part of an Army-wide re-organization, and the 2/11th Battalion was transferred to the 19th Brigade. With the 7th Division the battalion fought its first major engagement of the war on 21 March 1941, when it led the 18th Brigade's assault on the Italian fortress at Giarabub, which was held by about 1,500 Italians. Advancing from Siwa in Egypt, the battalion, supported by elements of the 2/10th and 2/12th Battalions, attacked from the south across marshland, while cavalry from the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment feigned an attack against the strongest point of the fortress. Amidst a sandstorm that limited visibility, heavy fighting ensued and the garrison surrendered at around 2:00pm; 250 Italians were killed, while 1,300 were taken as prisoners of war. A total of 17 Australians were killed and 77 were wounded, with the majority of these being men from the 2/9th Battalion. Afterwards, the battalion was sent to Ikingi Maryut and the following month the 2/9th was transported to Tobruk by road and sea to reinforce the garrison there as German forces surrounded the strategic port in an effort to capture it. The 2/9th would remain in there for the next five months as Tobruk fell under siege.|$|E

40|$|The Cruise Itinerary Schedule Design (CISD) problem {{determines the}} optimal {{sequence}} {{of a given}} set of <b>ports</b> of <b>call</b> (a <b>port</b> of <b>call</b> is an intermediate stop in a cruise itinerary) and the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> of <b>call</b> {{in order to maximize}} the monetary value of the utility at <b>ports</b> of <b>call</b> minus the fuel cost. To solve this problem, in view of the practical observations that most cruise itineraries do not have many <b>ports</b> of <b>call,</b> we first enumerate all sequences of <b>ports</b> of <b>call</b> and then optimize the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> of <b>call</b> by developing a dynamic programming approach. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose effective bounds on the monetary value of each sequence of <b>ports</b> of <b>call,</b> eliminating non-optimal sequences without invoking the dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results showthat, first, using the bounds on the profit of each sequence of <b>ports</b> of <b>call</b> considerably improves the computational efficiency; second, the total profit of the cruise itinerary is sensitive to the fuel price and hence an accurate estimation of the fuel price is highly desirable; third, the optimal sequence of <b>ports</b> of <b>call</b> is not necessarily the sequencewith the shortest voyage distance, especially when the ports do not have a natural geographic sequence.

On 15 November 1911, Reina Regente was present in Gibraltar for a <b>port</b> <b>call</b> made by George V during his trip to India. Spain remained neutral during World War I, and Reina Regentes service during the conflict was uneventful compared to her foreign contemporaries.

25|$|On 26 March, urgent orders {{interrupted}} her employment schedule {{once again and}} sent her to a holding area just east of Crete {{in response to an}} intensification of the situation in Lebanon. For the first few weeks she steamed squares in the ocean while rehearsing contingency plans for a possible evacuation of Americans from Beirut. Despite the passage of time, the Lebanese political scene remained volatile; so the squadron moved to a deep water anchorage outside Crete's territorial waters. April and May came and went without any real change, except that, late in May, the squadron got underway and steamed closer to Lebanon. Finally, after 69 days at sea, a lull in the fighting coupled with negotiations in progress allowed Barnstable County to proceed to Naples for a scheduled <b>port</b> <b>call.</b> The visit lasted from 1 to 4 June, and, then the squadron left for an amphibious exercise conducted at Carboneras, Spain.
