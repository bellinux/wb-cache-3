25|$|Moore's {{connection}} with the poem has been questioned by Professor Donald Foster, who used textual content analysis and external evidence to argue that Moore {{could not have been}} the author. Foster believes that Major Henry Livingston, Jr., a New Yorker with Dutch and Scottish roots, should be considered the chief candidate for authorship, a view long espoused by the Livingston family. Livingston was distantly related to Moore's wife. Foster's claim, however, has been countered by document dealer and historian Seth Kaller, who once owned one of Moore's original manuscripts of the poem. Kaller has offered a <b>point-by-point</b> <b>rebuttal</b> of both Foster's linguistic analysis and external findings, buttressed by the work of autograph expert James Lowe and Dr. Joe Nickell, author of Pen, Ink and Evidence.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a <b>point-by-point</b> <b>rebuttal</b> here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E

Between 2008 and 2012, Wikipedia articles on medical and scientific fields such as pathology, toxicology, oncology, pharmaceuticals, and psychiatry were compared to professional and peer reviewed sources and it was found that Wikipedia's depth and coverage were of a high standard.|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to a deluge of counter-points and demands for an apology, Dresser ran a second column in which he offered 7 <b>point-by-point</b> <b>rebuttals</b> to the letters from ABATE members. Among the objections were that Dresser was unfairly perpetuating a stereotype of rowdy, irresponsibly-drunk bikers, and that due to this negative stereotype, the ABATE chapter had been turned down by more than 40 taverns before they found one to accept them. Members {{also said that the}} Founding Fathers of the United States also met in taverns to plan the revolution. Dresser was also criticized for emphasizing the helmet law issue, when in fact Maryland ABATE had made increased penalties for right-of-way violators a top legislative priority, and had assisted handicapped people in getting disabled parking permit license plates. In {{response to}} readers who emphasized the freedom of choice argument against helmet laws, Dresser replied that, [...] "Freedom is a much-abused word. There are essential freedoms -- free speech, free press, habeas corpus, religion, the ballot, to name a few -- that are worth fighting for. Then there's simply foolish behavior we're used to getting away with." ...|$|R
2500|$|The January 2002 {{issue of}} Scientific American contained, {{under the heading}} [...] "Misleading Math about the Earth", a set of essays by several scientists, which claim that Lomborg and The Skeptical Environmentalist {{misrepresent}} both scientific evidence and scientific opinion. [...] The magazine then refused Lomborg's request to print a lengthy <b>point-by-point</b> <b>rebuttal</b> in his own defence, {{on the grounds that}} the 32 pages would have taken a disproportionate share of the month's installment. Scientific American allowed Lomborg a one-page defense in the May 2002 edition, and then attempted to remove Lomborg's publication of his complete response online, citing a copyright violation. After receiving much criticism, the magazine published his complete rebuttal on its website, along with the counter rebuttals of John Rennie and John P. Holdren.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{rare case}} of open dissent within the {{movement}} over {{the substance of}} creation science, Answers in Genesis (AiG) published a 2002 position paper titled: [...] "Arguments we think creationists should NOT use". [...] After Hovind issued a <b>point-by-point</b> <b>rebuttal,</b> Carl Wieland, Ken Ham, and Jonathan Sarfati of AiG wrote that the claims made by Hovind were [...] "fraudulent" [...] and contained [...] "mistakes in facts and logic which do the creationist cause no good." [...] In particular, AiG criticized Hovind for [...] "persistently us discredited or false arguments" [...] as well as [...] "fraudulent claims" [...] from Ron Wyatt, and described one of Hovind's claims as [...] "self-refuting". Rancorous disagreements resulted in AiG splitting into U.S. and Australian chapters in 2005. The Australian branch, renamed Creation Ministries International (CMI), maintained content critical of Hovind on their website, while the U.S. branch, led by Ken Ham, removed it.

All these statements are false and were declared as such in an official and authoritative statement issued by the Vatican in l’Osservatore Romano on October 13."

2500|$|When Halvorssen was in prison, {{officials}} in Miami distanced the DEA from Halvorssen {{and stated that}} his drug information was considered unreliable. The head of that office {{at the time was}} Tom V. Cash. [...] Cash, ultimately was involved in covering up the fraud of convicted criminal Allen Stanford of Stanford Bank and had to resign in disgrace from his job at Kroll Associates for both protecting Stanford's reputation and for investigating U.S. Senate investigators rooting out corruption[...] [...] One of those investigated by Cash was Jonathan Winer of the office of John Kerry. [...] Winer had worked closely with Halvorssen in the 1990s. [...] Kroll, coincidentally, is also the firm that was hired by the banks Halvorssen had been investigating for money laundering: Banco Latino. When Halvorssen was in prison, Tom V. Cash had stated that Halvorssen had [...] "unusual ties to and knowledge of drug traffickers"; the DEA said it [...] "refused to deal with him, citing as reasons 'duplicity and manipulation.'" [...] Halvorssen denied working with Florida agencies, and human rights advocates who knew him said that, considering his involvement in the fight against narcotrafficking, the accusations were not unexpected. Meanwhile, Senate investigators like Jonathan Winer and the New York District Attorney continued to stand by Halvorssen. Another critic of Halvorssen was opinion columnist Manuel Malaver, who published a weekly opinion column in Venezuelan media, in his book La DEA contra la Guardia Nacional de Venezuela claims that Halvorssen was part of parallel underworld of rogue police officers that became involved in a conspiracy to destabilize the government of Ramón J. Velásquez in association with a group of powerful adversaries against the possible presidency of Rafael Caldera or Andrés Velásquez. Presidential elections were scheduled in December 1993 after the impeachment of President Perez in May 1993. Halvorssen publicly responded to Malaver in a 3,500 word <b>point-by-point</b> <b>rebuttal.</b> Halvorssen referred to Malaver as acting in bad faith, malicious, and violating journalistic ethics: [...] "Lamentable, shameful, and cowardly." [...] Malaver's accusations, in his book, contain opinions and provide no statements of fact about the accusations he makes against Halvorssen.|$|E
