40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an intelligent gripper (IPA gripper) with a consumer available <b>pre-touch</b> {{system that can}} be used for detecting and grasping an unknown object. The paper also proposes a method of using indirect force control with object movement as feedback, named OMFG (Object Motion Focused Grasping). Together with OMFG and the <b>pre-touch</b> system, the gripper can detect and prevent slippage. During the course of this master thesis an iterative design methodology has been used to develop a design. The design has been tested with quantitative and qualitative experiments to verify the quality of the IPA gripper and to validate the hypothesis of this master thesis...|$|E

Our framework {{consists of three}} components: (1) an active <b>pre-touch</b> strategy to efficiently explore unknown workspaces; (2) an active tactile learning method to learn about unknown objects based on their physical properties (surface texture, stiffness, and thermal conductivity) by selecting the most informative tactile exploratory action {{to apply to the}} object, so that the robot can efficiently distinguish between objects with a small number of actions. (3) an active tactile transfer learning algorithm to enable the robotic system to exploit its prior tactile knowledge to learn about new unknown objects with a few training samples or even one (one-shot tactile learning). Our proposed framework was evaluated using a robotic arm equipped with multimodal artificial skin. The robot with the active <b>pre-touch</b> method reduced the uncertainty of the workspace up to 30 % and 70 % compared to uniform and random strategies respectively. By means of the active tactile learning algorithm, the robot used 50 % fewer exploratory actions than the baseline methods to achieve the same learning accuracy. Taking advantage of the prior tactile knowledge, the robot can discriminate among new unknown objects using only one training sample with a recognition accuracy 10 % (15 %) higher than the active tac-tile learning method (the uniform method) without knowledge transfer. Furthermore, the experimental results show that our proposed active tactile transfer learning method is robust against transferring negative prior tactile knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Parietal and premotor cortices of the macaque monkey contain {{distinct}} {{populations of}} neurons which, {{in addition to}} their motor discharge, are also activated by visual stimulation. Among these visuomotor neurons, a population of grasping neurons located in the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) shows discharge modulation when the own hand is visible during object grasping. Given the dense connections between AIP and inferior frontal regions, we aimed at investigating whether two hand-related frontal areas, ventral premotor area F 5 and primary motor cortex (area F 1), contain neurons with similar properties. Two macaques were involved in a grasping task executed in various light/dark conditions in which the to-be-grasped object was kept visible by a dim retro-illumination. Approximately 62 % of F 5 and 55 % of F 1 motor neurons showed light/dark modulations. To better isolate the effect of hand-related visual input, we introduced two further conditions characterized by kinematic features similar to the dark condition. The scene was briefly illuminated (i) during hand preshaping (<b>pre-touch</b> flash, PT-flash) and (ii) at hand-object contact (touch flash, T-flash). Approximately 48 % of F 5 and 44 % of F 1 motor neurons showed a flash-related modulation. Considering flash-modulated neurons in the two flash conditions, ∼ 40 % from F 5 and ∼ 52 % from F 1 showed stronger activity in PT- than T-flash (PT-flash-dominant), whereas ∼ 60 % from F 5 and ∼ 48 % from F 1 showed stronger activity in T- than PT-flash (T-flash-dominant). Furthermore, F 5, but not F 1, flash-dominant neurons were characterized by a higher peak and mean discharge in the preferred flash condition as compared to light and dark conditions. Still considering F 5, the distribution of the time of peak discharge was similar in light and preferred flash conditions. This study shows that the frontal cortex contains neurons, previously classified as motor neurons, which are sensitive to the observation of meaningful phases of the own grasping action. We conclude by discussing the possible functional role of these populations...|$|E
