40|$|Detection of emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), an {{invasive}} forest pest, {{is difficult}} in low density populations warranting continual development of various trapping techniques and protocols. Understanding and <b>predicting</b> <b>landing</b> behavior of A. planipennis may {{assist in the}} further development of trapping techniques and improvement of trapping protocols for widespread survey programs in North America. Three multiple regression models were developed using ash tree vigor and crown light exposure to <b>predict</b> the <b>landing</b> behavior of A. planipennis. These models were then used to <b>predict</b> the <b>landing</b> density of A. planipennis at separate sites and in separate years. Successful prediction of A. planipennis capture density at the test sites was limited. Even though the multiple regression models were not effective at <b>predicting</b> <b>landing</b> behavior of A. planipennis, tree characteristics were used to predict the likelihood of A. planipennis <b>landing.</b> Trees <b>predicted</b> as having high likelihood of landing had 3. 5 times as many A. planipennis adults/m 2 on stem traps than trees predicted as having low likelihood of landing. While the landing density of A. planipennis may not be efficiently predicted, the utility of these predictions {{may be in the}} form of identifying trees with a high likelihood of A. planipennis landing. Those high likelihood trees may assist in improving existing detection programs and techniques in North American forests...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{models for}} <b>predicting</b> <b>land</b> {{subsidence}} due to fluid withdrawal require the correct evaluation of representative mechanical {{properties of the}} deforming porous medium. One such property is the vertical uniaxial compressibility cM which is obtained through either lab oedometer tests or in situ measurements, and typically exhibits a marked scattering. The present communication addresses {{the influence of the}} cM uncertainty for the <b>predicted</b> <b>land</b> settlement using a stochastic approach where cM is regarded as a random variable. A compressibility law, characterized by a log-normal distribution with depth-dependent mean and constant variance, is implemented into a Finite Element poroelastic model and used in a preliminary study based on the Monte Carlo method. The results show how the cM variance affects the reliability of the expected land subsidence and point out the impact of the cM uncertainty on the quality of prediction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} validation of the Australian Land Erodibility Model (AUSLEM), designed to <b>predict</b> <b>land</b> susceptibility to wind erosion in western Queensland, Australia. The model operates at a 5 5 km spatial resolution on a daily time-step with inputs of grass and tree cover, soil moisture, soil texture and surficial stone cover. The system was implemented to <b>predict</b> <b>land</b> erodibility, i. e. susceptibility to wind erosion, for the period 1980 - 1990. Model performance was evaluated using cross-correlation analyses to compare trajectories of mean annual land erodibility at selected locations with trends in wind speed and observational records of dust events and a Dust Storm Index (DSI). The validation was conducted at four spatial length scales from 25 to 150 km using windows to represent potential dust source areas centered on and positioned around eight meteorological stations within the study area. The <b>predicted</b> <b>land</b> erodibility had strong correlations with dust-event frequencies at half of the stations. Poor correlations at the other stations were linked to {{the inability of the}} model to account for temporal changes in soil erodibility, and comparing trends in the land erodibility of regions with dust events whose source areas lie outside the regions of interest. The model agreement with dust-event frequency trends was found to vary across spatial scales and was highly dependent on land type characteristics around the stations and on the types of dust events used for validation.

40|$|Satellite {{remote sensing}} and {{geographic}} information system (GIS) have been widely applied in identifying and analyzing land use and land cover change. In this study, aerial photos and MSS, TM and ETM + images of Isfahan and its environs were used to provide maps of land cover for 1955, 1972, 1990 and 2001. A hybrid method was used for image classification: a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification. Cellular automata filter facilities and Markov model were used together in a CAMarkov model for <b>predicting</b> <b>land</b> cover maps. To study {{the accuracy of the}} predicted maps and validation of the CAMarkov model, three methods were used: a calculating agreement and disagreement table, a chisquared goodnessoffit test and an error matrix.
