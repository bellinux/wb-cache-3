5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a <b>protein</b> <b>molecule</b> from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E

25|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where genetic {{information}} in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates {{the formation of a}} polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional <b>protein</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|E

25|$|Antithrombin (AT) {{is a small}} <b>protein</b> <b>molecule</b> that inactivates several enzymes of the {{coagulation}} system. Antithrombin is a glycoprotein {{produced by}} the liver and consists of 432 amino acids.

A single glycosylation site remains consistently un-occupied in the minor form of antithrombin, β-antithrombin. Its activity is increased manyfold by the anticoagulant drug heparin, which enhances the binding of antithrombin to factor IIa (Thrombin) and factor Xa.|$|E

NCBI cBLAST predicted structural similarity between the QSER1 protein and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) RNA Polymerase II A chain. The two regions of similarity occur between amino acids 56-194 and 322-546. This first region (56-194) is a regulatory region in both the human and yeast RNA Polymerase II containing multiple repeats of the sequence YSPTSPSYS. Phosphorylation of serine residues in this region regulates progression through the steps of gene transcription. A 3D structure was provided for this region. The structurally similar region is on {{the exterior of the}} <b>protein</b> <b>molecule</b> and forms part of the DNA binding cleft.|$|E
25|$|Physics-based energy {{calculations}} aim {{to capture}} the interatomic interactions that are physically responsible for protein stability in solution, especially van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. These calculations are performed using a molecular mechanics force field; proteins are normally too large even for semi-empirical quantum mechanics-based calculations. The use of these methods {{is based on the}} energy landscape hypothesis of protein folding, which predicts that a protein's native state is also its energy minimum. Such methods usually employ implicit solvation, which provides a continuous approximation of a solvent bath for a single <b>protein</b> <b>molecule</b> without necessitating the explicit representation of individual solvent molecules. A force field specifically constructed for model assessment is known as the Effective Force Field (EFF) and is based on atomic parameters from CHARMM.|$|E

50|$|When {{a surface}} {{is exposed to}} a multi-protein solution, {{adsorption}} of certain <b>protein</b> <b>molecules</b> are favored over the others. <b>Protein</b> <b>molecules</b> approaching the surface compete for binding sites. In multi-protein system attraction between molecules can occur, whereas in single-protein solutions intermolecular repulsive interactions dominate. In addition, there is a time-dependent protein spreading, where <b>protein</b> <b>molecules</b> initially make contact with minimal binding sites on the surface. With the increase in protein's residence time on the surface, the protein may unfold for interaction with additional binding sites. This results in a time-dependent increase in the contact points between protein and surface. This further makes desorption less likely.|$|R
25|$|Cell nucleus: A cell's {{information}} center, {{the cell}} nucleus {{is the most}} conspicuous organelle found in a eukaryotic cell. It houses the cell's chromosomes, and {{is the place where}} almost all DNA replication and RNA synthesis (transcription) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, DNA is transcribed, or copied into a special RNA, called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific <b>protein</b> <b>molecule.</b> The nucleolus is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|Proteins are {{structural}} materials {{in much of}} the animal body (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each <b>protein</b> <b>molecule</b> is composed of amino acids, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an incomplete protein source lacks {{one or more of the}} essential amino acids.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{innovation}} within NMR spectroscopy has been {{within the field}} of protein NMR spectroscopy, an important technique in structural biology. A common goal of these investigations is to obtain high resolution 3-dimensional structures of the protein, similar to what can be achieved by X-ray crystallography. In contrast to X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy is usually limited to proteins smaller than 35 kDa, although larger structures have been solved. NMR spectroscopy is often the only way to obtain high resolution information on partially or wholly intrinsically unstructured proteins. It is now a common tool for the determination of Conformation Activity Relationships where the structure before and after interaction with, for example, a drug candidate is compared to its known biochemical activity. Proteins are orders of magnitude larger than the small organic molecules discussed earlier in this article, but the basic NMR techniques and some NMR theory also applies. Because of the much higher number of atoms present in a <b>protein</b> <b>molecule</b> in comparison with a small organic compound, the basic 1D spectra become crowded with overlapping signals to an extent where direct spectral analysis becomes untenable. Therefore, multidimensional (2, 3 or 4D) experiments have been devised to deal with this problem. To facilitate these experiments, it is desirable to isotopically label the protein with 13C and 15N because the predominant naturally occurring isotope 12C is not NMR-active and the nuclear quadrupole moment of the predominant naturally occurring 14N isotope prevents high resolution information from being obtained from this nitrogen isotope. The most important method used for structure determination of proteins utilizes NOE experiments to measure distances between atoms within the molecule. Subsequently, the distances obtained are used to generate a 3D structure of the molecule by solving a distance geometry problem. NMR {{can also be used to}} obtain information on the dynamics and conformational flexibility of different regions of a protein.|$|E

This provides relevant information for controlled uptake and release applications of such systems. The mobility of Alexa- 488 labelled lysozyme inside the microgel is measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). CLSM images show that the <b>protein</b> <b>molecules</b> distribute quite homogeneously over the microgel particles. By fitting the FRAP data with a model based on exchange between bleached and unbleached <b>protein</b> <b>molecules</b> inside the gel, we identified several protein fractions of different mobility. Increasing the salt concentration (NaCl) or the pH causes a shift in the distribution towards the more mobile fractions. This is consistent with earlier uptake and release measurements, which showed that the binding affinity decreases with increasing salt concentration and pH. At low protein concentrations, at which the microgel is not saturated with protein, the mobility of the bound <b>protein</b> <b>molecules</b> is more restricted than at protein concentrations where the uptake is complete. This is attributed to binding of the <b>protein</b> <b>molecules</b> to multiple binding sites.
