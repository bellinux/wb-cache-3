Micro-tubular fuel cells exploit advances in the art of proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells. The main advantage of the micro-tubular fuel cells over the plate-and-frame fuel cells would be higher power densities: Whereas the mass and volume power densities of low-pressure hydrogen-and-oxygen-fuel plate-and-frame fuel cells designed to operate in the targeted power range are typically less than 0. 1 W/g and 0. 1 kW/L, micro-tubular fuel cells are expected to reach power densities much greater than 1 W/g and 1 kW/L. Because of their higher power densities, micro-tubular fuel cells would be better for <b>powering</b> <b>portable</b> equipment, and would be better suited to applications in which there are requirements for modularity to simplify maintenance or to facilitate scaling to higher power levels. The development of PEMFCs has conventionally focused on producing large stacks of cells that operate at typical power levels > 5 kW. The usual approach taken to developing lower-power PEMFCs for applications like those listed above has been to simply shrink the basic plate-and-frame configuration to smaller dimensions. A conventional plate-and-frame fuel cell contains a membrane/electrode assembly {{in the form of a}} flat membrane with electrodes of the same active area bonded to both faces. In order to provide reactants to both electrodes, bipolar plates that contain flow passages are placed on both electrodes. The mass and volume overhead of the bipolar plates amounts to about 75 percent of the total mass and volume of a fuel-cell stack. Removing these bipolar plates in the micro-tubular fuel cell significantly increases the power density...|$|R

The new revision shall harmonize ISO 20643 Mechanical vibration - Hand-held and hand-guided machinery - Principles {{for evaluation of}} vibration emission which, among others, requires measurements in three directions and declared values related to the upper quartile of real-use vibration. To get the most suitable test method, a round robin test was made for evaluation of the two test methods proposed by the ad-hoc group working with this standard revision. Methods Seven laboratories measured the vibration from four grinders of different sizes, with and without autobalancing units. The laboratories come from universities, health & safety laboratories and grinder manufacturers. Two measurement methods are evaluated with respect to repeatability and reproducibility: 1. Grinding on a well-defined mild steel bar with depressed center wheels according to detailed test instructions. The test sequence starts and ends with 10 seconds of running the grinder in the air, when measuring the unbalance contribution to the vibration coming from the unbalance of the grinding wheel. Between these runs the average vibration during 60 seconds of grinding is measured. Three operators do five grinding tests per grinder. 2. Measurements using an aluminum unbalance disc {{similar to the one}} defined in ISO 8662 - 4. Each operator runs the grinder four times, between each run the unbalance is moved 180 degrees to avoid variations caused by the play between the test wheel and the spindle. The averaging time is 10 seconds. Each grinder is tested by three operators. Repeatability is the spread within a lab between operators and over short time period for one machine and reproducibility is the spread between laboratories and over longer time periods for one machine. Instrumentation and transducer location are chosen according to ISO 8662 - 4 and circulated test instructions. Results Both the repeatability and reproducibility is poor for the real grinding test, see figure 1. The coefficient of variation for repeatability is approximately 40 % higher for the grinding test and the coefficient of reproducibility is 60 % higher for the grinding test than for the unbalance disc test...|$|R
