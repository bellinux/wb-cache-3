500|$|This {{technological}} modernization in the Brazilian Navy was not {{matched by}} social change, and {{tensions between the}} Brazilian Navy's officer core versus the regular crewmembers kindled much unrest. A quote from the Baron of Rio Branco, the esteemed politician and <b>professional</b> <b>diplomat,</b> shows one {{of the sources of}} tension: [...] "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless lumpen, without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos." [...] Racial differences in the Brazilian Navy would have been immediately apparent to an observer at the time: the officers in charge of the ship were nearly all white, while the crews were heavily black or, to a lesser extent, mulatto. The visual differences belied deeper distinctions: darker-skinned crewmen, who {{by the time of the}} revolt would have been older slaves freed under the Lei Áurea (or sons born free under the 1871 Law of the Free Womb), were almost universally less educated than their white overseers.|$|E
500|$|The writing style {{reflects}} the author's intent {{to use the}} text for a lecture series. The narration addresses the audience while guiding it through explanations of the issues and anecdotal illustrations. Lewis' charismatic, eloquent, and energetic oration style {{is reflected in the}} writing. The tone has been described as loud and persuasive. One reviewer called it [...] "vintage Lewis – incisive criticism leavened with high-blown rhetoric". The book focuses more upon real-world human experiences, rather than numbers and statistics, in discussing the effect of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the world's response. Lewis' eyewitness accounts are candid and vivid. For example, he recounts tours of hospitals and schools as he explains the dire straits of national health and education sectors, and he describes meetings with diplomats and staff from the UN, World Bank, and IMF as he explains their effect on foreign aid policies. The book is written from an idealistic perspective and, despite the anger and underlying sense of guilt, Lewis remains optimistic. While he was a <b>professional</b> <b>diplomat,</b> his memoir-style reflections on specific people, such as Michel Camdessus, Carol Bellamy, and Thabo Mbeki were called undiplomatic. Despite the book's undiplomatic style, Lewis retained his post as a UN Special Envoy until the term completed in December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday, 7 November 1938, he {{purchased}} a revolver {{and a box of}} bullets, then went to the German embassy and asked to see an embassy official. After he was taken to the office of Ernst vom Rath, Grynszpan fired five bullets at Vom Rath, two of which hit him in the abdomen. Vom Rath was a <b>professional</b> <b>diplomat</b> with the Foreign Office who expressed anti-Nazi sympathies, largely based on the Nazis' treatment of the Jews, and was under Gestapo investigation for being politically unreliable. Grynszpan made no attempt to escape the French police and freely confessed to the shooting. In his pocket, he carried a postcard to his parents with the message, [...] "May God forgive me ... I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In theory, the {{conclusion}} of the Tientsin Accord should have resolved the confrontation over Tonkin between France and China. [...] Fournier was not a <b>professional</b> <b>diplomat,</b> however, and the agreement contained several loose ends. [...] Crucially, it failed to explicitly state a deadline for the Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin. [...] The French asserted that the troop withdrawal was to take place immediately, while the Chinese argued that the withdrawal was contingent upon {{the conclusion}} of the comprehensive treaty. [...] In fact, the Chinese stance was an ex post facto rationalisation, designed to justify their unwillingness or inability to put the terms of the accord into effect. [...] The accord was extremely unpopular in China, and provoked an immediate backlash. [...] The war party called for Li Hung-chang's impeachment, and his political opponents intrigued to have orders sent to the Chinese troops in Tonkin to hold their positions.|$|E

5000|$|Diplomacy {{is the art}} and {{practice}} of conducting negotiations between representatives of states. It usually refers to international diplomacy, the conduct of international relations through the intercession of <b>professional</b> <b>diplomats</b> with regard to {{a full range of}} topical issues. International treaties are usually negotiated by diplomats prior to endorsement by national politicians. David Stevenson reports that by 1900 the term [...] "diplomats" [...] also covered diplomatic services, consular services and foreign ministry officials.|$|R

50|$|In reality, most diplomats are {{representatives of}} nations with a {{tradition}} of professional civil service, {{and are expected to}} obey regulations governing their behaviour and they suffer severe disciplinary action if they flout local laws. In many nations, a <b>professional</b> <b>diplomat's</b> career may be compromised if they (or members of their family) disobey the local authorities or cause serious embarrassment, and such cases are, at any rate, a violation of the spirit of the Vienna Conventions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{revision}} of unequal treaties, forced on Japan in the 1850s and 60s, became a top priority. The Meiji leaders also sketched {{a new vision}} for a modernized Japan's leadership role in Asia, but they realized that this role required that Japan develop its national strength, cultivate nationalism among the population, and carefully craft policies toward potential enemies. No longer could Westerners be seen as [...] "barbarians," [...] for example. In time, Japan formed a corps of <b>professional</b> <b>diplomats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Until 1969, {{relations}} were informally maintained through Soviet and Spanish embassies in France.

25|$|Another {{factor that}} aided Ribbentrop's rise was Hitler's {{distrust}} of, and disdain for, Germany's <b>professional</b> <b>diplomats.</b> He suspected {{that they did}} not entirely support his revolution. But the Foreign Office diplomats loyally served the government and rarely gave Hitler grounds for criticism. The Foreign Office diplomats were ultra-nationalist, authoritarian, and anti-Semitic. As a result, there was enough overlap in values between the two groups to allow most of them to work comfortably for the Nazis. Nonetheless, Hitler never quite trusted the Foreign Office and was on the lookout for someone to carry out his foreign-policy goals.|$|R
