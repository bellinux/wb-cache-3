5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E

Turkey has the highest documented rate in the world, with 1 in 2,600 births, while countries such as Finland and Japan have extremely low rates with fewer than one case of PKU in 100,000 births. A 1987 study from Slovakia reports a Roma population with an extremely high incidence of PKU (one case in 40 births) due to extensive inbreeding.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{workplace}} policies that can alleviate {{the burden of}} work–family balance for many middle-class families. Some options in family-friendly workplaces include providing paid leave or options for reduced hours. Workplaces are realizing that employees with well balanced family and work lives are actually valuable to firms: workplace childcare assistance can increase productivity and morale among employees, as well as lessen turnover, accidents, and absenteeism. Childcare options for working parents can be key in workplace satisfaction. Workplace supports such as personal time off, paid leave, on-site or nearby childcare, financial assistance for childcare, and other family-friendly policies are Western European workplace norms that could solve the work–family balance <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

25|$|Employers {{can also}} be bullies. Bad {{employers}} use bullying strategically to rid the workplace of good employees to avoid a legal obligation, such as paying unemployment compensation or a worker’s compensation claim. Employers also use bullying tactics to drive out employees who demand legal pay or overtime or assert a legal right to organize collectively. The {{most common type of}} complaint filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission involves retaliation, where an employer harasses or bullies an employee for objecting to illegal discrimination. Patricia Barnes, author of Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees & Psychopaths in the Workplace, argues that employers that bully are a critical but often overlooked aspect of the <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
25|$|As {{this program}} {{got under way}} it became painfully evident that in the 1930s most states lacked any kind of {{comprehensive}} plans for state park systems. In 1941 the Service published its first comprehensive report, A Study of the Park and Recreation <b>Problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, a careful review of the whole problem of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by World War II, Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of Mission 66, and a second comprehensive report was published in 1964 entitled Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan. Numerous land planning studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{insuring}} negligence in supervising organizations, or wrongful {{acts and}} misrepresentation in financial statements is controversial {{due to its}} effect on accountability, otherwise known as the moral hazard <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, corporate boards have a [...] "duty of care", but if personal financial consequences for violating that duty of care are lacking, the boards may not perform proper due diligence.

In 1968, Hopper teamed with Peter Fonda, Terry Southern and Jack Nicholson to make Easy Rider, which premiered in July 1969. With the release of True Grit a month earlier, Hopper had starring roles in two major box office films that summer. Hopper won wide acclaim as the director for his improvisational methods and innovative editing for Easy Rider. The production was plagued by creative differences and personal acrimony between Fonda and Hopper, the dissolution of Hopper's marriage to Hayward, his unwillingness to leave the editor's desk and his accelerating abuse of drugs and alcohol. Hopper said of Easy Rider: [...] "The cocaine <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States is really because of me. There was no cocaine before Easy Rider on the street.
