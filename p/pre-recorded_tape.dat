5|$|In 1993, Sinatra {{returned}} to Capitol Records and {{the recording studio}} for Duets, which became his best-selling album. The album and its sequel, Duets II, released the following year, would see Sinatra remake his classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their vocals to a <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
5|$|Turner only {{learned that}} Stacey was Archie's killer {{half an hour}} before the episode aired, in a bid by the {{production}} team to maintain the storyline's secrecy. 51 EastEnders cast members appeared in the episode, with several expressing trepidation about performing live prior to the broadcast. Cast members had two weeks to rehearse the episode, with one rehearsal filmed in case of any serious problems during transmission. When Turner fell ill with the flu on the day of broadcast, it was feared the producers may have needed to use the <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tape,</b> but in the event she recovered enough to appear.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Sylvester {{became a}} partner of Megatone Records. That year he also brought out his second album with the company, Call Me, {{but it was}} not a {{commercial}} success. Four songs from the album were released as singles, although only [...] "Trouble in Paradise" [...] entered the top 20 of the U.S. dance charts; Sylvester later related that the song was his [...] "AIDS message to San Francisco." [...] Sylvester was emotionally moved by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and began helping out at the Rita Rockett Lounge for patients of the disease at the San Francisco General Hospital as well as performing at various benefit concerts to raise money and awareness to combat the spread of the disease. In February 1984 he also performed a [...] "One Night Only" [...] retrospective of his work at the prestigious Castro Theatre. Sylvester still toured both domestically and in Europe, although he found that demand for his performances was decreasing, and that he was now playing to smaller venues and singing to a <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tape</b> rather than to a live band as he had in the late 1970s.|$|E

5000|$|The overture's {{two main}} themes {{are based on}} [...] "The Grand Old Party" [...] and [...] "Rehearse!" [...] from the failed musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, which ran for only seven {{performances}} on Broadway. Mid-way into the work, a <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tape</b> of political speeches plays over an orchestral vamp. The <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tape</b> features the voices of Bernstein, Michael Wager, Adolph Green, and Patrick O'Neal giving the political speeches. [...] Cheering crowd noises are also used.

50|$|Ironically for {{a company}} whose legacy is a product that aims to stop people copying videos, Dwight Cavendish Developments’ main product range {{for nearly two decades}} was a series of {{equipment}} for professional video duplication houses. Before the advent of DVD, <b>pre-recorded</b> VHS <b>tapes</b> were usually manufactured by recording the signal onto each tape individually, using large banks of professional (or sometimes domestic) VCRs. Dwight Cavendish Developments sold equipment to run such systems, including distribution amplifiers, and systems to control large banks of VCRs. The company also promoted a quality control system, to automatically check for faults on the <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tapes,</b> though it is not clear if this system was ever used widely.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{episodes of}} the series were {{released}} on <b>pre-recorded</b> VHS <b>tapes</b> by DiC's Toon Times Video subsidiary.|$|R
50|$|This {{system was}} {{extended}} to domestic tape decks, and so slower speeds as they were adopted tended to be exactly half the previous slowest speed. <b>Pre-recorded</b> <b>tapes</b> were mostly 71⁄2 ips, with a few at 33⁄4 ips. Message tapes transmitted by post and call logging tapes were commonly recorded at 17⁄8 ips or even 15⁄16 ips. The most common reel-to-reel speed of 71⁄2 ips is approximately 19 cm/s.|$|R

5000|$|After the war, {{he decided}} not to reform his band, and turned to compering on the BBC Light Programme in such shows as [...] "Record Roundup", which ran from 1948 to 1977.

50|$|La Tourangelle is {{an hour-long}} piece that premiered in 1975, in a {{performance}} broadcast by CBC Radio. Anhalt has labeled the work “A Musical Tableau,” which was composed for an orchestra of 16 players, five singer-narrators, and <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tapes</b> for five operators. This particular piece deals with the pursuit of God and meaning, making it a piece with a powerful message. Anhalt chose to base the work {{on one of the}} earliest French women to have settled in Canada, Marie de l’Incarnation.|$|R

50|$|The Avco Cartrivision system, a {{combination}} television set and VCR from Cartridge Television Inc. that sold for US$1,350, {{was the first}} videocassette recorder to have <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tapes</b> of popular movies available for rent. Like the Philips VCR format, the square Cartrivision cassette had the two reels of half-inch tape mounted {{on top of each}} other, but it could record up to 114 minutes, using an early form of video format that recorded every other video field and played it back three times.|$|R
25|$|The new series, Supercar, (1960–61) {{was created}} by Anderson and Reg Hill and marked several {{important}} advances for APF. Sylvia Anderson took on a larger role and became {{a partner in the}} company. The series was also the official debut of Supermarionation, the electronic system that made the marionettes more lifelike and convincing on screen. The system used the audio signal from <b>pre-recorded</b> <b>tapes</b> of the actors' voices to trigger solenoids installed in the heads of the puppets, making their lips move in synchronisation with the voices of the actors, and actresses.|$|R
50|$|A {{market for}} <b>pre-recorded</b> VHS <b>tapes</b> has continued, and some online {{retailers}} such as Amazon still sell new and used pre-recorded VHS cassettes of {{movies and television}} programs. None of the major Hollywood studios generally issue releases on VHS. The last film {{to be released in}} the VHS format in the United States, other than as part of special marketing promotions, was A History of Violence in 2006. In 2008, Distribution Video Audio Inc., the last major American supplier of <b>pre-recorded</b> VHS <b>tapes,</b> shipped its final truckload of tapes to stores in America.|$|R
