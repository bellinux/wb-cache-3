Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife. He said that The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects that you have to decide which format to use each week. He compared it to Awake, saying, then, [...] "What makes an Awake episode?" [...] "Pilot" [...] was written by Killen, and directed by David Slade.|$|E

Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my countrymen now love best to hear is the rattle of arms and the ring of the rifle.

They have marched <b>past</b> <b>my</b> prison windows {{to let me know}} that there are ten thousand fighting men in Dublin— 'felons' in heart and soul. I thank God for it. The game is afoot, at last.

2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak.

(23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

2500|$|Like a Prayer {{was named}} after the {{influence}} of Catholicism on Madonna's early {{life as well as}} her struggles with religion; [...] "The theme of Catholicism runs rampant", she said. [...] "It's me struggling with the mystery and magic that surrounds it. My own Catholicism is in constant upheaval." [...] Recording sessions took place from September 1988 to January 1989. On January 27, 1989, a press release from The Albany Herald said the album would include [...] "a number of hot dance tracks" [...] but noted, [...] "much of the material [...] is of a personal tone." [...] The singer described it as a collection of songs [...] "about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family. [...] It's taken a lot of guts to do this". She also said that it would be her [...] "most different" [...] work to date; [...] "It was a real coming-of-age record for me emotionally, I had {{to do a lot of}} soul-searching, and I think it is a reflection of that [...] I didn't try to candy-coat anything or make it more palatable for mass consumption, I wrote what I felt". She told Rolling Stone magazine [...] "In the <b>past,</b> <b>my</b> records tended to be a reflection of current influences. This album is more about past musical influences". She chose to collaborate with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, with whom she had collaborated on her previous studio album True Blue (1986) and the soundtrack Who's That Girl (1987). Both Bray and Leonard wanted to bring their unique style to the project, and they developed completely different music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. According to the singer, Leonard was also facing emotional turmoil; [...] "I was working with Pat, who was also in a very dark state of mind, and we worked in a very isolated place in the Valley". On January 6, 1989, following a nullified divorce filing in late 1987 and several publicized fights, one of which led to a 60-day prison term, Madonna and Sean Penn filed for divorce. [...] This incident inspired the song [...] "Till Death Do Us Part". The rest of the songs were written within two weeks; with [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Cherish" [...] and [...] "Spanish Eyes" [...] being written the first week. According to Leonard, [...] "we wrote a song a day, and we didn't change them. And oftentimes the vocal that she did was the lead vocal, we didn't even change the lead vocal. That was it. She sang it. It was done".|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an improved model of global digital palaeo-plate boundaries and plate motion to describe the distribution and history of plates since the Late Jurassic. From this history we computed net lithospheric rotation (NR) through time confirming the so-called westward drift, but only for the past 30 Myr. The NR has significantly smaller magnitudes (0. 13 °/My, <b>past</b> 5 <b>My)</b> than for some other plate models; it averages to 0. 11 ± 0. 03 °/My for the <b>past</b> 50 <b>My</b> with a small but systematic increase toward the present. The westward drift, seen only for the <b>past</b> 30 <b>My,</b> is attributed to the increased dominance of a steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate. NR shows peaks with time but only an Early Tertiary peak of 0. 33 °/My (when the Indian plate was undergoing the largest known acceleration/deceleration) can be interpreted with some confidence. We find a linear decreasing trend in net rotation over the <b>past</b> 150 <b>My,</b> but attribute this trend to increasing reconstruction uncertainties back in time, as subduction consumed {{more than half of}} the oceanic crust since the Jurassic. After removing a linear time-trend, we find a NR average of about 0. 12 °/My for the <b>past</b> 150 <b>My...</b>|$|R
