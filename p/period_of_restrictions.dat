40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} timing (from 3 — 8 weeks of age) and {{duration}} (3 — 5 weeks) of re-stricted feeding on compensatory growth of broilers were studied using alternating <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> 24 hr feeding and 24 hr non-feeding. Feed consumption, gain, and feed conversion were determined weekly {{on an individual}} basis from 3 — 8 weeks of age. The method of restricting feed access re-stricted consumption to approximately 85 % of non-restricted controls when imposed for one, two, or three weeks duration, but restriction for four or five weeks was less effective in restricting consumption. Body weight gains during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> were generally decreased in pro-portion to that of feed consumption so that feed conversion ratios were similar to controls. The effects of restricted feeding on consumption, gain, and conversion for the 3 — 8 week per-iod were in general not different for the various timing <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> subgroups. Very little evi-dence of compensatory growth for the period following the removal <b>of</b> feed <b>restriction</b> was ob-served. The eight-week body weights of males were significantly reduced from that of control levels with as little as one week <b>of</b> <b>restriction.</b> The body weights of females were not as severely affected during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> or at eight weeks. Although feed consumption for the 3 — 8 week period was reduced as much as 10 %, the feed conversion ratio was higher for all restricted groups than for controls. These results indicate that if feed consumption of broilers is significantly depres-sed for as little as one week at any time over the 3 — 8 week age period, weight gain will be signifi-cantly depressed with a significant decrease in efficiency of feed utilization and lower final body weights...|$|R
40|$|Background – Compensatory growth (or {{catch up}} growth) is the greater than normal growth {{of an animal}} {{following}} a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> nutritional <b>restriction.</b> In grazing animals, compensatory growth responses are commonly observed due to variations in seasonal conditions and hence pasture supply and quality. Diets of intensively housed animals can also be manipulated to include short <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> nutritional <b>restriction</b> to achieve changes in the body composition of the carcass. In humans catch up growth may occur during infancy / early childhood in children born small for gestational age due to fetal undernutrition. Catch-up growth can influence ultimate body muscularity and fatness and in humans at least be associated with detrimental metabolic and health effects during later adult life. Review – Compensatory growth responses in pigs can occur following a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> dietary <b>restriction,</b> although the degree of catch up growth can vary. In some cases the animals can fully compensate such {{that they are the}} same weight at the same slaughter age as their non-restricted counterparts, while in other cases they do not reach the same final weight. There is some evidence that restricting protein intake for a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time during the weaner phase (similar to human infant) may result in an increase in protein deposition and decrease in fat deposition during later growth. During a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>restriction,</b> both protein and lipid deposition rates are reduced, although the rate of lean tissue deposition is reduced to a greater degree (1). During realimentation the ratio of lipid to protein deposition has also been shown to decrease (1). This reduction in lipid deposition during the realimentation perio...|$|R

40|$|Sleep loss alters {{both the}} {{concentration}} and activity of {{various aspects of}} the immune system. These alterations lead to increased susceptibility to infection and the progression of pathologies such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.

This work reviewed literature that measured the effects <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> sleep <b>restriction</b> upon both cortisol and catecholamine concentrations within human subjects. Furthermore, studies which measured the effects of sleep loss upon these hormone levels and the associated changes in immune parameters were included.

The three years which followed the Resumption of Cash Payments Act 1819 were marked by a fall in the prices of nearly all commodities. An opinion gained ground that the fall was due to a contraction of the currency which was assumed to result from the return to cash payments. To combat this view was the task to which Tooke applied himself in his earliest work, Thoughts and Details on the High and Low Prices of the last Thirty Years (1823), and the same line of argument is pursued in his Considerations on the State of the Currency (1826), and in a Letter to Lord Grenville (1829). He entered on a detailed examination of the causes which might affect prices, and claimed to establish the conclusion that the variations, both during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> and after the resumption, were due to circumstances directly connected with the commodities themselves, and not to alterations in the quantity of money.|$|R

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 49 - 54. In the Arckaringa Basin, {{organic carbon}} (OC) {{enrichment}} within the Permo-Carboniferous Stuart Range Formation occurred within syn-sedimentary fault troughs that were scoured by glaciers. This enrichment was facilitated by sytematic variations in water chemistry within these troughs identifying <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> and open water exchange with {{the ocean to}} the south. The U-shaped morphology {{of some of these}} troughs apparent in seismic profiles along with the presence of lonestones, dropstones, and feldspathic, angular sediment identifies a cold palaeoclimate depositional setting that is unusual for the organic enrichments of up to 12 % total organic carbon (TOC). It is hypothesised that episodic restriction within these fjord-like troughs led to cyclical variations in sulphur concentration within the water column, driving sulfurization reactions that preserved organic matter in discreet laminae. Abundant pyrite (up to 20 wt%) and the distribution of organosulphur compounds with TOC supports this hypothesis. Cyclical oxygenation of bottom waters and alkalinity from OM mineralisation by bacterial sulphate reducers resulted in the formation of manganese carbonate (kutnohorite) during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> ventilation.

Seventy-two Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (mean calving date, 12 February) were randomly assigned post-calving across two PGSH treatments (n = 36) : 2. 7 cm (severe; S 1) and 3. 5 cm (moderate; M 1), which were applied from 10 February to 18 April (period 1; P 1). This {{was followed by a}} carryover period (period 2; P 2) during which cows were randomly reassigned within their P 1 treatment across two further PGSH (n = 18) : 3. 5 cm (severe, SS and MS) and 4. 5 cm (moderate, SM and MM) until 30 October. Decreasing PGSH from 3. 5 to 2. 7 cm significantly decreased milk (- 2. 3 kg/cow per day), protein (- 95 g/day), fat (- 143 g/day) and lactose (- 109 g/day) yields, milk protein (- 1. 2 g/kg) and fat (- 2. 2 g/kg) concentrations and grass dry matter intake (GDMI; - 1. 7 kg dry matter/cow per day). The severe PGSH was associated with a lower bodyweight (BW) at the end of P 1. There was no carryover effect of P 1 PGSH on subsequent milk or milk solids yields in P 2, but PGSH had a significant carryover effect on milk fat and lactose concentrations. Animals severely restricted at pasture in early spring had a higher BW and slightly higher body condition score in later lactation when compared with M 1 animals. During P 2, increasing PGSH from 3. 5 to 4. 5 cm increased milk and milk solids yield as a result of greater GDMI and resulted in higher mean BW and end BW. This study indicates that following a 10 -week <b>period</b> <b>of</b> feed <b>restriction,</b> subsequent dairy cow cumulative milk production is unaffected. However, the substantial loss in milk solid yield that occurred during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> is not recovered...|$|R
40|$|The {{meat and}} eating quality {{characteristics}} of 627 crossbred lamb progeny from 20 Poll Dorset sires were studied. The sires were selected {{on the basis}} of Australian sheep breeding values (ASBVs) for postweaning growth (PWWT), depth of loin muscle (PEMD) and subcutaneous fat (PFAT). Lambs were either weaned at 20 - or 30 -kg liveweight and then within each of these groups held at their weaning weight for 55 days or fully fed, giving four treatment groups. Restricted lambs were realimentated subsequent to the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> feed <b>restriction</b> and the lambs within each treatment group were slaughtered when their mean liveweight reached 45 kg. Shear force of the M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LL) decreased with temperature at pH 6. 0, increased with LL ultimate pH and decreased as sarcomere length increased. Within LL aged for 5 days there was no difference between (P > 0. 05) between treatments for shear force. There was a treatment effect on M. semimembranosus (SM) shear force, such that for a sire having an average ASBV PWWT of 9. 34, topsides from lambs early weaned and restricted had significantly (P < 0. 05) lower values. Further within these same lambs, i. e. early weaned and restricted, as the sire ASBV PWWT increased there was a significant (P < 0. 001) reduction in shear force. There was a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in sensory tenderness as the sire ASBV PFAT increased and across the range of ASBV PFAT this represented a change in sensory tenderness of four points. Overall liking increased with an increase in the temperature at pH 6. 0 (P < 0. 05) with a coefficient of 0. 43 ± 0. 19. There was a significant (P < 0. 05) interaction between feeding level and the sire ASBV PFAT, such that for restricted fed lambs overall liking increased as the ASBV PFAT increased (coefficient 2. 80 ± 0. 89) after adjusting for temperature at pH 6. 0, but this is not the case for fully feed lambs (coefficient - 0. 01 ± 0. 89). Subtle interactions between sire ASBVs and growth path suggest that the impact <b>of</b> a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> and refeeding on meat and eating quality will be meditated by the sire genetics...|$|R
