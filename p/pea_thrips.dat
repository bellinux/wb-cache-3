50|$|Kakothrips pisivorus, or the <b>pea</b> <b>thrips,</b> is {{a species}} of thrips native to Europe which lives in the flowers of peas and other legumes causing damage to the pods inside as they are developing.|$|E
40|$|The Fabaceae species Lathyrus tuberosus, Vicia {{species and}} Coronilla varia, {{all of which}} have an {{extended}} flowering period, provide the larvae food and shelter long enough for the <b>pea</b> <b>thrips</b> Kakothrips pisivorus to complete its development, and to have two generations yearly. Although flowers of pea cultivars also confer suitable conditions for egg laying, their flowering period is rather short. Therefore, the larvae are forced to move to developing pea pods in damaging numbers, resulting in the development of only one generation yearly on pea. However, specimens of K. pisivorus are able to colonize pea cultivars that have a similar phenology as Lathyrus tuberosus. Here we show that Hungarian <b>pea</b> <b>thrips</b> populations having either one or two generations are genetically identical...|$|E
50|$|The <b>pea</b> <b>thrip</b> is a brown insect 2 mm {{in length}} with {{two pairs of}} {{feathery}} wings and yellowy legs. It feeds on the fruit of many legumes, including the pea plant, from which it takes its name. These thrips are generally identified by {{the damage done to}} pea pods as their larvae eat them.|$|R
40|$|Thrips (Thysanoptera) {{and their}} predators were {{investigated}} from 2005 – 2007 {{on a wide}} range of vegetables grown mostly in the winter period in Çukurova region of Turkey. A total of 2989 adult thrips and 406 thrips larvae were extracted from the vegetables. The adults belonged to 14 thrips species of which Melanthrips spp. were the most dominant species. The dominance of the commonly found pests Thrips tabaci and Frankliniella occidentalis differed greatly. F. occidentalis was the predominant thrips infesting broad bean, lettuce and parsley, while T. tabaci was more abundant on leek, onion and <b>pea.</b> The most <b>thrips</b> were collected from flowers or heads of vegetables in early spring. Numbers of predatory insects dwelling on the sampled vegetables were lower in comparison to total numbers of thrips obtained in the years 2006 and 2007. Of the predators, the hemipteran generalists Orius laevigatus and O. niger were the most prevalent and high numbers of them were recorded often on flowers of broad bean in winter. Further investigations should be planned to understand clearly the predatory habit of Melanthrips...|$|R
