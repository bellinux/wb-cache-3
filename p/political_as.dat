5|$|As a boy, Truman was {{interested}} in music, reading, war, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close. As president, he solicited <b>political</b> <b>as</b> well as personal advice from her. He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen. Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.|$|E
5|$|Following the Wehrmacht's {{victory at}} Operation Market Garden, Hitler decided {{to launch a}} last-ditch {{offensive}} in the West aiming to catch the Anglosphere forces by surprise, {{with the objective of}} retaking Antwerp, striking the seam between the British and Americans that leads to <b>political</b> <b>as</b> well as military disharmony between the Allies, isolate the 21st Army Group, thereby allowing their encirclement and destruction before the American leadership (particularly the political leadership) could react and erasing the enemy ground threat to the Ruhr.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, Espanyol {{started a}} counter-petition against autonomy, which {{at that time}} had become a {{pertinent}} issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less <b>political,</b> <b>as</b> Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced <b>political</b> <b>as</b> well as military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians {{were unwilling to}} stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in {{an extension of the}} Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|A keep (from the Middle English kype) {{is a type}} of {{fortified}} tower built within castles {{during the}} Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed {{a key part of the}} motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. Stone keeps carried considerable <b>political</b> <b>as</b> well as military importance and could take up to a decade to build.|$|E

5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was <b>political,</b> <b>as</b> the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of religion, the regime of Northumberland {{followed}} the same policy as that of Somerset, supporting an increasingly vigorous programme of reform. Although Edward VI's practical influence on government was limited, his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory; his succession was managed by the reforming faction, who continued in power throughout his reign. The man Edward trusted most, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one that—while rejecting papal supremacy—remained essentially Catholic, to one that was institutionally Protestant. The confiscation of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under Edward—notably with {{the dissolution of the}} chantries—to the great monetary advantage of the crown and the new owners of the seized property. Church reform was therefore as much a <b>political</b> <b>as</b> a religious policy under Edward VI. By the end of his reign, the church had been financially ruined, with much of the property of the bishops transferred into lay hands.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Eorpwald's life or of his short reign, as little {{documentary}} evidence about the East Anglian kingdom has survived. The primary source for Eorpwald is the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in the 8th century. Soon after becoming king, Eorpwald received Christian teaching and was baptised in 627 or 632. Soon after his conversion {{he was killed by}} Ricberht, a pagan noble, who may have succeeded him and ruled for three years. The motive for Eorpwald's assassination was probably <b>political</b> <b>as</b> well as religious. He was the first early English king to suffer death as a consequence of his Christian faith and was subsequently venerated by the Church as a saint and martyr.|$|E

Kate is then employed as a receptionist at the police station, but later attacks Rachel after she is provoked. Kate tenders her resignation, but John manages to convince her to remain at the police station. The pair later reconcile. DS Luke French works with John to take down drugs baron Neculai Stenga.

25|$|Many Medinans {{converted}} {{to the faith}} of the Meccan immigrants, particularly pagan and polytheist tribes, but there were fewer Jewish converts. The Jews rejected Muhammad's claim to prophethood, and further argued that some passages in the Qur'an contradicted the Torah. Their opposition was due to <b>political</b> <b>as</b> well as religious reasons, as many Jews in Medina had close links with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, who was partial to the Jews and would have been Medina's prince if not for Muhammad's arrival.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} {{denominations}} of Islam are the Sunni and Shia sects.

Sunnis believe that the true political successor of the Prophet according to the Sunnah should be selected based on ٍShura (consultation), as was done at the Saqifah which selected Abu Bakr, Muhammad's father-in-law, to be Muhammad's political but not his religious successor. Shia, on the other hand, believe that Muhammad designated his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib as his true <b>political</b> <b>as</b> well as religious successor.|$|E
25|$|Rape is theorized to be a {{reproductive}} {{strategy that}} facilitates {{the propagation of}} the rapist's progency.

The sociobiological theories of rape are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, <b>political,</b> <b>as</b> well as scientific grounds.|$|E
