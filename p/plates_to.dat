5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out from the gate to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises. Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid. In contrast, baleen whales have evolved baleen <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> filter feed plankton and small fish from the water.|$|E
5|$|Some 2010 {{structural}} {{comparisons of}} Stegosaurus <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> Alligator osteoderms {{seem to support}} {{the conclusion that the}} potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of Stegosaurus definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,> since its closest relatives, such as Kentrosaurus, had more low surface area spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> absorb radiation from the sun.|$|E
5|$|Although Smith had {{previously}} refused {{to show the}} <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer {{that they would be}} allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden plates by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According to Smith, the angel Moroni took back the plates once Smith finished using them.|$|E
50|$|Most of Australasia {{lies on the}} {{southern}} portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, flanked by the Indian Ocean {{to the west and}} the Southern Ocean to the south. Peripheral territories lie on the Eurasian <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, the Philippine <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the north, and in the Pacific Ocean - including numerous marginal seas - atop the Pacific <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the north and east.|$|R
50|$|The Niuafo'ou Plate {{is a small}} {{tectonic plate}} located west of the islands of Tonga. This plate is {{sandwiched}} between the Pacific <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the north, the very unstable Tonga <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> {{the east and the}} Australian <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the west. It is primarily surrounded by convergent boundaries. This plate is riddled with active faults thus making the area extremely earthquake prone.|$|R
50|$|The Iranian <b>Plate</b> {{is thought}} <b>to</b> {{underlie}} Iran and Afghanistan, {{and parts of}} Pakistan and Iraq. It is compressed between the Arabian <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> {{the south and the}} Eurasian <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the north. This compression is likely a cause for the very mountainous terrain of the area including the Zagros Mountains.|$|R
5|$|Although supernovae are {{relatively}} rare events, occurring on average about once every 50 {{years in the}} Milky Way, observations of distant galaxies allowed supernovae to be discovered and examined more frequently. The first supernova detection patrol was begun by Zwicky in 1933. He was joined by Josef J. Johnson from Caltech in 1936. Using a 45-cm Schmidt telescope at Palomar observatory, they discovered twelve new supernovae within three years by comparing new photographic <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> reference images of extragalactic regions.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
5|$|During {{assembly}} of Collins bow section in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: the steel alloy {{used for the}} hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding, but had not made this clear; delays in delivering the steel <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> Kockums resulted in rushed work and a resulting drop in quality. Kockums engineers proposed that the section be kept in Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted as-is, with repairs attempted at ASC during full {{assembly of}} the first boat.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the {{overlying}} ectoderm secretes {{bone morphogenetic protein}} (BMP). This induces {{the roof}} <b>plate</b> <b>to</b> begin to secrete BMP, which will induce the alar <b>plate</b> <b>to</b> develop sensory neurons. The alar plate and the basal plate are separated by the sulcus limitans.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a triple}} {{junction}} of three ridges between the Kula <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the north, the Pacific <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> {{the west and}} the Farallon <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the east. The Kula Plate was subducted under the North American Plate at a relatively steep angle, so that the Canadian Rockies are primarily composed of thrusted sedimentary sheets with relatively little contribution of continental uplift, while the American Rockies are characterized by significant continental uplift in response to the shallow subduction of the Farallon Plate.|$|R
50|$|The Indian Plate is {{currently}} moving north-east at 5 cm per year, while the Eurasian Plate is moving north at only 2 cm per year. This {{is causing the}} Eurasian <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> deform, and the Indian <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> compress {{at a rate of}} 4 mm per year.|$|R
5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> express abstraction.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda <b>Plates.</b> <b>To</b> the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{said that}} the angel {{returned}} the <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> him in September, 1828. In April 1829, he met Oliver Cowdery, who replaced Harris as his scribe, and resumed dictation. They worked full time on the manuscript between April and early June 1829, and then moved to Fayette, New York, where they continued {{to work at the}} home of Cowdery's friend, Peter Whitmer. When the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism, Smith and Cowdery baptized each other. Dictation was completed around July 1, 1829.|$|E

50|$|The {{eastern side}} is a {{boundary}} with the North American <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the north and a boundary with the Philippine Sea <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the south, and possibly with the Okhotsk Plate and the Amurian Plate. The southerly {{side is a}} boundary with the African <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the west, the Arabian Plate {{in the middle and}} the Indo-Australian <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the east. The westerly side is a divergent boundary with the North American Plate forming the northernmost part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is straddled by Iceland. All of the volcanic eruptions in Iceland, such as the 1973 eruption of Eldfell, the 1783 eruption of Laki, and the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, are caused by the North American and the Eurasian plates moving apart, which is a result of divergent plate boundary forces.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>Plate,</b> <b>to</b> {{the west}} of the fault, is moving in a {{northwest}} direction while the North American <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the east is moving toward the southwest, but relatively southeast under the influence of plate tectonics. The rate of slippage averages about 33 to 37 mm a year across California.|$|R
5|$|The {{pilot and}} gunner/radio {{operator}} sat in tandem, {{back to back}} in a single pressurized cockpit, protected by armour <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> their front and rear, {{as well as by}} a bulletproof windscreen, seated on ejection seats. The aircraft was intended to use Klimov VK-1 engines, a derivative of the Rolls-Royce Nene II, but the engine was still under development, so less powerful Kuznetsov RD-45s were substituted instead. The aircraft carried a Toryii-1 radar for use by the gunner/radio operator.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|These ore bodies {{formed in}} {{different}} places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E
50|$|The Macquarie Fault Zone {{is a major}} right lateral-moving {{transform}} fault along the seafloor of the south Pacific Ocean which runs from New Zealand southwestward to the Macquarie Triple Junction.

5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted {{back and forth between}} views of each of the <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came to {{assemble}} and publish the story in book form, Hergé decided to divide it into two volumes and to give them each a new title; the first half, which is set in Egypt, Arabia, and India, he titled Cigars of the Pharaoh, while the second half, set in China, became The Blue Lotus. Cigars {{was the first of the}} Adventures published by Casterman, with whom Hergé had signed a contract in late 1933, although much to his annoyance, they delayed publication until the autumn of 1934, after the culmination of the summer holidays. In 1936, they successfully requested that he produce several colour <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> be inserted into the reprint of the book.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} with the prior two Adventures, Wallez {{organised}} a publicity stunt to mark the culmination of Tintin in America, in which an actor portraying Tintin arrived in Brussels. It proved the most popular yet. In 1932, the series was collected and published in a single volume by Les Éditions de Petit Vingtième, coinciding with their publication of the first collected volume of Quick and Flupke. A second edition was produced in France by Éditions Ogéo-Cœurs-Vaillants in 1934, while that same year Casterman published an edition, the first of The Adventures of Tintin that they released. In 1936, Casterman asked Hergé to add several new colour <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> a reprint of Tintin in America, which he agreed to. They also asked him to replace the cover with one depicting a car chase, but he refused.|$|E
50|$|This shallow {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} a seismically active zone near the coast of central Mexico. The earthquake occurred near the juncture of three tectonic plates: the North American <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, the Rivera <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, and the Cocos <b>Plate</b> <b>to</b> the south. Both the Rivera Plate and the Cocos Plate are being subsumed beneath the North American Plate. The slower subducting Rivera Plate is moving northwest at about 2 cm per year relative to the North American Plate and the faster Cocos plate is moving in a similar direction {{at a rate of}} about 4.5 cm per year.|$|R
