40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of {{reciprocating}} motion in no beam supported mining machines, putting energy saving as a starting point in Coal Bed Methane (CBM) exploitation, this paper designs a completely non-circular gear automatic reversing vertical drainage machine based on the theory of non-circular gear transmission. In the field of CBM exploitation, the use of non-circular gears is an attempt at an innovation. First of all, according to the working conditions of the pump and use requirements, a scheme is established whereby the one-way rotary motion of the motor is changed into reciprocating motion so that it could drive the oil <b>pumping</b> <b>rod</b> to achieve the upper and lower mining. Secondly, this paper has designed a new type non-circular gear reversing box as the core component to replace the traditional four beam linkage mechanism and also provides elaborate calculations. Finally, the movement simulation of the non-circular gear reversing gear system is completed. Comparing the motion simulation results with the theoretical ones, the correctness of our theoretical analysis can be verified. Compared with the traditional devices, the new coal seam gas drainage machine model design has nearly 11 % higher efficiency, which has obvious energy saving effects and reduces the cost of mining coal seam gas...|$|E

50|$|In 1776, {{the first}} engines were {{installed}} {{and working in}} commercial enterprises. These first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> {{at the bottom of}} the shaft. The design was commercially successful, and for the next five years Watt was very busy installing more engines, mostly in Cornwall for pumping water out of mines.|$|R
50|$|Pumping {{engines of}} this vintage used a {{vertical}} <b>pump</b> <b>rod,</b> with a bucket pump {{at the bottom}} of the shaft. This could lift water from an appreciable depth, developed for the needs of Cornish tin mining, but they had only low delivery pressure at the top of the shaft. The engine was thus placed near to where the water was to be delivered, rather than its source.|$|R
50|$|The piston was {{attached}} by a chain {{to a large}} pivoted beam. When the piston pulled the beam, {{the other side of}} the beam was pulled upward. This end {{was attached}} to a rod that pulled on a series of conventional pump handles in the mine. At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} this device were from {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century in the silver mining area of the Harz mountains, Germany, where they were driven by cranks connected to water wheels, although bucket hoists ("Hakenkunst") using the same method of operation had been used in Swedish iron mines since the 17th century. They appear to have evolved from an informal modification to the beam pumps, where the miners used spikes stuck into the wooden <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> to get themselves carried up the shaft. As beam pumps were universal in deep mines, it was a then simple development to make proper platforms to carry the miners. The first formal engine was installed in 1833 at a mine at Clausthal, Lower Saxony, where inspector Wilhelm Albert and manager Georg Dörell (1793–1854) fastened foot platforms and hand-holds to adjacent, reciprocating <b>pump</b> <b>rods,</b> using a waterwheel-driven pump put out of use when a new drainage adit was made at a lower level.

30|$|Sucker <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> is a {{traditional}} and widely used method of artificial lifting in the world’s oil industry. In recent years, on the one hand, as the natural energy has been depleted and working fluid level is going down, most of old oilfields in the late development stage need deep pumping techniques to increase oil production; on the other hand, deep reservoirs are gradually being developed. For example, the average reservoir depth in Tahe oilfield of Northwest China is more than 6000  m. With the complex geological conditions and bad fluid properties, the working fluid level is very low and rapidly dropping to the limit depth of conventional sucker <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system. The limit depth mainly depends on the polished rod load which increases with the pump depth. However, high polished rod load is disadvantageous to the whole system and even tends to exceed the operating range of the pumping unit. At present, aiming at the problem about how to reduce the polished rod load in the deep sucker <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> wells, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed. They are side-flow <b>pump,</b> <b>rod</b> load reducer, fiberglass–steel sucker <b>rod</b> and deep <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump.|$|R
50|$|Early {{immigrants}} to the New World brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe. On US farms, particularly on the Great Plains, wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouse). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854. Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts. Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity. Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.|$|R

50|$|The flatrods (Feldgestänge) {{themselves}} {{were used to}} transfer power over greater distances between the main engine and the <b>pump</b> <b>rods.</b> Iron collars (Kunstringe) were fitted onto the wheel axles, connecting pipes (Ansetzröhren) and metal sleeves (Ansteckkielen) as well as {{certain parts of the}} wooden flatrods. The actual rods (Kunststangen) were long squared timbers that transmitted the power horizontally or at an incline. They had articulated iron joints (Kunstschlösser or Stangenschlösser) that were designed such that they could be interleaved into one another and secured with bolts or screws.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cause of}} the {{fracture}} in the beam was attributed to overload from the <b>pump</b> <b>rod</b> system to which {{one end of the}} beam was attached. However, on the Sunday before the disaster pumping was stopped and the beam raised off its bearing to enable new bearing brasses to be put in. This was a common procedure for engines of this class, after four years of work the originals had worn. As the beam was being replaced it fell from its supporting jacks and [...] "fell with great force into its bearings".|$|R

The end through which gas enters the ram depends on which barb in the 4-way is linked with the center barb.|$|R

50|$|The flatrod system {{dates to}} the period before the {{invention}} of the steam engine and electricity. Using flatrods it was possible to operate man engines and pumping systems, even though the water wheel in question had a rotary, not a reciprocal, motion. So that the rods could be made to move in a reciprocal fashion, a change of direction had to be achieved by means of specially shaped components. The components of the system that were mounted in the mining shaft were called shaft <b>rods</b> (Schachtgestänge) or <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> (Hubgestänge). Systems mounted in drift mines were called drift rods (Streckengestänge).|$|R

50|$|Most house-built engines were early beam engines. A 'bob wall' in {{the engine}} house {{supported}} the pivot axle of the beam or 'bob'. This wall could be an internal wall, with {{both ends of the}} beam inside the house, but it was commonly the end wall of the house and so the beam projected to the outside. For a heavy beam, the bob wall was required to be extremely substantial. Early engines were used for pumping mines or wells, so as well as the weight of the beam, the house had to also support the weight of the long <b>pump</b> <b>rod,</b> reaching down to the depths of the mine.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the frame, {{the water}} wheels and the beams {{were made of}} wood, but in 1835, Franz Höss, the royal master of pumps, {{replaced}} them by metal ones. The installation now is cast iron, the headraces and water boxes are made of copper, the <b>pumping</b> <b>rods</b> are wrought iron and the cylinders are brass with a diameter of 29 cm and a stroke length of 55 cm. As in the other pumping installations, the pistons have leather envelopes which are kept wet by small water pipes. The staggered action of the beams and pumps is clearly visible and a glance on the fountain proves the water pressure to be almost constant.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the flatrods was to {{transfer}} {{the power of the}} motive engine over greater distances to the <b>pump</b> <b>rods</b> in the shaft. This was necessary if the motive engine could not be mounted above or immediately next to the mine shaft. A flatrod system had the disadvantage that there were additional efficiency losses due to the greater masses that had to be moved. The reciprocal motion in the joints (Schlösser) of the interconnected flatrods lead to lifting losses of from 25 to 50 percent. In addition the construction of flatrods required additional timber. This was very maintenance-intensive due to the effects of weathering and it needed additional staff to inspect and maintain the flatrods.|$|R

5000|$|In {{previous}} engines {{built by}} Newcomen and Watt, the piston pulled {{one end of}} the walking beam downwards during the power stroke using a chain, and the weight of the pump pulled {{the other end of the}} beam downwards during the recovery stroke using a second chain, the alternating forces producing the rocking motion of the beam. In Watt's new double-acting engine, the piston produced power on both the upward and downward strokes, so a chain could not be used to transmit the force to the beam. Watt designed the parallel motion to transmit force in both directions whilst keeping the piston rod vertical. He called it [...] "parallel motion" [...] because both the piston and the <b>pump</b> <b>rod</b> were required to move vertically, parallel to one another.|$|R
