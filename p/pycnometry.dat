40|$|Nanopowder density, {{as well as}} compact density, is due {{to powder}} {{particle}} size, different in their values, compared to micron powders. Also, the technique used for density determination induces large mutual value discrepancies. Scanning electron micrographs of as received powder are presented as an illustration of the shape and size of powder particles and agglomerates. The density of the loose powder pretreated differently was determined using mercury porosimetry and He <b>pycnometry.</b> The methods used for determining the apparent density of the compacts were <b>pycnometry</b> with water as the wetting liquid, mercury porosimetry and also a new approach {{using a combination of}} mercury <b>pycnometry</b> along with nitrogen adsorption.

Until recently, {{absolute density}} was determined using water or another liquid, which {{was expected to}} fill the pores in the sample and then removing their volume from measurement. The gas (He) displacement <b>pycnometry</b> system, Accupyc™ II 1340 by Micromeritics is much more accurate and easier to use. It is faster than liquid-based techniques because the gases fill the pore spaces easily, quickly, and thoroughly.|$|E

40|$|Air filled {{porosity}} (AFP) is {{a crucial}} factor in composting to guarantee aerobic conditions inside the composting matrix. Among the different methods proposed to measure AFP in composting processes, air <b>pycnometry</b> {{is defined as the}} most adequate. There is a lack of a standard methodology for air <b>pycnometry</b> utilization for AFP determination in heterogeneous samples as those from composting materials. Air pycnometers currently used for this purpose are custom made instruments operating under different conditions (sample volume, initial pressure, etc.). All factors affecting air <b>pycnometry</b> accuracy in the composting process are related to the proper maintenance and handling of the air pycnometer and the composting sample. In this study, AFP measurements have been performed in more than 50 samples {{of a wide range of}} composting materials using two different custom made pycnometers, one of them coupled to a composting reactor allowing in situ AFP measurement. While temperature variation during AFP measurement has been discarded as an error source, the determination of the sample volume has been found to be a significant factor affecting the air filled porosity calculation. Regarding the initial pressure to use, a compromise between accuracy and practicality has to be established for each pycnometer design as AFP values obtained with diverse initial pressures (from 200 to 500 kPa gauge pressure) were found to present no statistical differences. An initial pressure in the range of 300 - 500 kPa (gauge pressure) is recommended. In conclusion, there is a need for a standard methodology for AFP determination or prediction at industrial scale. A complete procedure for air filled porosity determination by air <b>pycnometry</b> is also presented in this work...|$|E
40|$|An {{existing}} technique, helium <b>pycnometry,</b> {{has been}} adapted for {{the measurement of}} specific gravities of lunar samples, where surface areas are low (less than 1 sq m/g) and crushing the sample to a fine powder is highly undesirable. The technique is superior to typical liquid immersion methods, {{in that it is}} noncontaminating and, where vuggy or porous samples are concerned, should provide a more accurate (higher) absolute density value. The experimental helium <b>pycnometry</b> measurements have been compared in three instances for two rocks with values calculated from a normative mineral composition. The comparison appears good, however, where differences occur, the direct experimental technique appears to provide the better value and to be capable of indicating density variations within a single rock sample...|$|E

40|$|This {{petrographic}} {{method was}} specifically developed {{to study the}} mineralogy and microstructure behaviour of two clayey materials, the Callovo-oxfordian argilite and the compacted MX 80 bentonite, after alkaline solution percolation. The objective is the quantitative measurement of mineralogical and microstructural evolutions, including porosity. It is a multi-scale investigation from centimetric samples to microsites on thin sections. Usually, the petrography is based on (1) optical microscope and SEM observations, and (2) on the identification of phases by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), infra – red spectrometry (IR) and micro-analyses. In situ porosity measurements, on thin sections, are mainly based on analysis of SEM images digitized from back scattered electron observations. The multi-scale investigation on the Callovo-oxfordian argilite and on the bentonite need complementary investigations on centimetric test pieces as:- He <b>pycnometry</b> on dried samples {{in order to measure}} the solid volumes, real density of solides and the connectivity state of the medium,- Hg <b>pycnometry</b> on saturated samples in order to measure the apparent density of the material.

40|$|International audienceThe {{porosity}} {{characterization of}} poorly consolidated sediments or soils {{is a key}} factor in understanding fluid flow and geochemical processes in surface and subsurface environments. However, porosity quantification is a challenging task due to the low cohesion of the extracted sample. In this study, we proposed and assessed a method combining X-ray computed micro-tomography (μCT) and He-gas <b>pycnometry</b> for the measurement of connected porosity in unconsolidated subsurface sands. The principle is based on the calculation of the total sample volume from reconstructed μCT volume and the measurement of the solid volume from He-gas <b>pycnometry.</b> Disaggregation of the sample may occur during handling and is taken into account by correcting the μCT volume using image processing. The measurements obtained for reference consolidated sandstone were compared with those obtained from water absorption under vacuum. The use of such non-destructive techniques offers the advantage of preserving loose sample structure. Moreover, it is a rapid and simple method that requires no sample preparation and could be easily implemented as routine analysi...|$|E

40|$|The {{complementary}} use of thermogravimetry and <b>pycnometry</b> {{is demonstrated}} {{to expand the}} toolbox for experimental micropore analysis < 1 nm. Thermogravimetry is employed to assess the uptake of water, methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol and cyclohexane vapors in microporous structures at room temperature and derive quantitative micropore volumes and minimum pore entrance sizes together with qualitative information on surface chemistries. <b>Pycnometry</b> is employed to measure the uptake and adsorption of helium, argon and nitrogen gas in microporous structures at room temperature and derive semi-quantitative surface-to-volume ratios, surface areas and micropore cavity sizes and qualitative information on the surface chemistries. The method is validated and calibrated by applying it {{to a series of}} zeolites with known micropore structures. The results are compared with data from conventional N 2 adsorption at − 196 °C and CO 2 adsorption at 0 °C. Main advantages of the demonstrated method are that diffusion limitations due to cryogenic temperatures are eliminated, adsorption is studied with non-polar gases, micropore cavity sizes are probed separate from micropore entrances and data can be interpreted in a straightforward fashion without requiring theoretical models on molecular behavior. Micropores < 1 nm can thus be analyzed with increased accuracy as compared to conventional adsorption isotherm analysis...|$|E

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license[URL] change in the carbonaceous skeleton of nanoporous carbons during their activation has received limited attention, unlike its counterpart process in the presence of an inert atmosphere. Here we adopt a multi-method approach to elucidate this change in a poly(furfuryl alcohol) -derived carbon activated using cyclic application of oxygen saturation at 250 °C before its removal (with carbon) at 800 °C in argon. The methods used include helium <b>pycnometry,</b> synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and associated radial distribution function (RDF) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and, uniquely, electron energy-loss spectroscopy spectrum-imaging (EELS-SI), electron nanodiffraction and fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM). Helium <b>pycnometry</b> indicates the solid skeleton of the carbon densifies during activation from 78 % to 93 % of graphite. RDF analysis, EELS-SI, and FEM all suggest this densification comes through an in-plane growth of sp 2 carbon out to the medium range without commensurate increase in order normal to the plane. This process could be termed ‘graphenization’. The exact way in which this process occurs is not clear, but TEM images of the carbon before and after activation suggest it may come through removal of the more reactive carbon, breaking constraining cross-links and creating space that allows the remaining carbon material to migrate in an annealing-like process...|$|E

Our helium adsorption procedure extends the previous works by Gumma and Talu [1] to determine the impenetrable solid volume of the adsorbent, which in standard helium <b>pycnometry</b> is determined under the assumption that helium does not adsorb at room temperature. Our results confirm helium adsorption on these solids is small, but not zero: equilibrium helium adsorption capacities measured at 3500 kPa and 303 K were 0. 067 mmolig on Escott, 0. 085 mmol/g on 3 A, 0. 096 mmol/g on 4 A and 0. 089 mmol/g on 3 K- 172. The specific solid volumes determined by the Gumma and Talu method were 10 - 15 % larger than the specific solid volumes measured by standard helium <b>pycnometry,</b> and this error can result in uncertainties of 2. 6 - 28 % in the equilibrium adsorption capacities of CO 2 and N- 2 measured at high pressures. The uncertainties were largest for N- 2 on the Escott zeolite, which had the lowest equilibrium adsorption capacity for N- 2. These results support the need to consider helium adsorption in the characterisation of adsorbents with narrow pore sizes, especially for adsorption processes that involve helium separations at low temperatures and/or high pressures.
