In many cases the plug area {{will be difficult to}} reach, and using a mallet to perform maintenance or replacement will be nearly impossible without special facilities for partial or complete removal of the engine. Specialized copper or rubber replacement plugs are available which can be expanded by using a wrench when access is a problem, though engine removal may still be required in some cases.|$|E
50|$|In eukaryotes, genomic DNA {{is highly}} {{compacted}} {{in order to}} be able to fit it into the nucleus. This is accomplished by winding the DNA around protein octamers called histones, which has consequences for the <b>physical</b> <b>accessibility</b> of parts of the genome at any given time. Significant portions are silenced through histone modifications, and thus are inaccessible to the polymerases or their cofactors. The highest level of transcription regulation occurs through the rearrangement of histones in order to expose or sequester genes, because these processes have the ability to render entire regions of a chromosome inaccessible such as what occurs in imprinting.|$|E

As is true for most mass transit systems, much of the Boston subway and commuter rail lines were built before wheelchair access was a requirement. The Boston system underwent significant expansion in the 1980s and 1990s, and all the new facilities are ADA compliant. The MBTA has also refurbished many stations, and these too are accessible. More improvements are in progress or expected as part of planned construction.|$|E

The advantages of this technology include: lower patient dose and increased image quality because the X-rays are always pulsed, and no deterioration of the image quality over time.

Data were collected through focus groups, analyzed by the method of interpretation of meanings, considering Rosenstocks model of health beliefs as a reference framework. Data revealed two themes: Occupational safety and Interpersonal Relationship. We identified several barriers that interfere in matters of safety and personal protective equipment, such as communication, work overload, <b>physical</b> structure, <b>accessibility</b> of protective equipment and organizational and management aspects.

In 1907, the [...] "Matilda Ziegler Magazine for the Blind" [...] was founded to give people without sight access to selected articles from print periodicals. This general-interest magazine originally was published both in braille and New York Point, an embossed writing system no longer in use. The magazine's founder, Mrs. William Ziegler, was the mother of a blind son and an heiress who solely funded the publication. Her endowment continues to provide for free distribution of the [...] "Ziegler," [...] as it is known.|$|E
50|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a {{civil rights}} law passed in 1990 that prohibits {{discrimination}} and ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to the opportunities and benefits available to the wider American population. Institutions that violate {{the requirements of the}} ADA enter consent decrees typically resulting in a payment from the corporation to those wronged, which may serve to discourage future discrimination, in addition to a change in policy to avoid future payouts. Examples of altered practices {{through the use of a}} decree have included restructuring building property or the removal of barriers to allow for <b>physical</b> <b>accessibility</b> for all persons, providing supplemental communication tools such as sign language interpreters for those that are hard of hearing, and eliminating discriminatory practices against those that have a disability.|$|E
5000|$|Physical {{environment}} {{may be a}} large determinant in one's ability to access ladders of success or even basic sustenance. Professor of urban planning Rob Imrie concluded that most spaces contain surmountable physical barriers that unintentionally create an “apartheid by design,” whereby individuals with disabilities are excluded from areas because of the inaccessible layout of these spaces. This [...] "apartheid" [...] has been seen by some, such as the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council, as especially concerning with regard to public transportation, education and health facilities, and perhaps most relevantly places of employment. Physical barriers are also commonly found in the home, with those in poverty more likely to occupy tighter spaces inaccessible to wheelchairs. Beyond <b>physical</b> <b>accessibility,</b> other potential excluding agents include a lack of Braille, sign language and shortage of audio tape availability {{for those who are}} blind and deaf.|$|E
5000|$|In {{important}} romantic relationships, attachment {{refers to}} strong emotional bonding {{and the feeling}} of being secure. To maintain the security feelings, individuals stay in a comfortable range of proximity to their partner. Under certain circumstances, even separation due to planned travel evokes concerns of the partner’s inaccessibility. This inaccessibility may be associated with anxiety, loneliness, and yearning for the partner. Through psychological (e.g., internal representation), symbolic (e.g., pictures), or <b>physical</b> proximity gaining <b>accessibility,</b> individuals calm down and restore security.|$|R

50|$|Generally, <b>physical</b> <b>accessibility</b> {{to basic}} schools is commendable. This is {{especially}} {{so at the}} primary level where virtually every community has a Kindergarten (KG) and a primary school. In 2009, there were seventy public primary schools and twenty-two private primary schools in the municipality. Children from communities {{that do not have}} primary schools do not walk more than 3 km to access a facility. The number of junior high schools (JHS) however does not equal the number of primary schools in the municipality. In 2010, there were forty public junior high schools and ten private junior high schools. This partly contributed to a high drop-out rate at the JHS level as pupils had to commute over longer distances to access a facility. For instance, JHS pupils from Akete and Nyinamponaase walked a distance of 7 km everyday to attend JHS in Wenchi and Tromeso respectively in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Mainstreaming is {{typically}} limited to putting {{a person with}} a disability next to typical people in the usually quite vague and unspecific hope that each will adapt to and learn about the other. Inclusion, while acknowledging the value of mainstreaming as a tool, argues that this is not enough: the whole of society, its <b>physical</b> <b>accessibility,</b> and its social attitudes, they say, should exist with universal design in mind, thus ending physical marginalization of all kinds by ending the idea that a body that is different is incapable of self-management, physical attractiveness, and so on. This all-encompassing practice, its advocates argue, ensures that people of differing abilities visibly and palpably belong to, are engaged in, and are actively connected to the goals and objectives of the whole wider society, as opposed to being a [...] "novelty" [...] that 'normal' people might be afraid to ask direct questions of.|$|E
50|$|The true {{accessibility}} of mountaineering {{is found in}} {{a combination of factors}} that can be divided into typical destination accessibility and real (<b>physical)</b> <b>accessibility.</b> These two groups have then been subdivided into elements related to transport links and in situ services (in the case of destination accessibility) and to factors covering the social, economic, weather and psychophysical environments, as well as the presence of mountaineering activities (in the case of real accessibility). Destination accessibility is defined as the ability to provide appropriate access for visitors into a destination and also ensure all necessary services facilitating a convenient stay. Destination accessibility must be understood as the combination of: transport links factors, in situ services factors. While the factors that influence mountaineering destination accessibility (transport links and in situ services) are not much different from any other excursion, real accessibility factors are. Real accessibility may be dependent (in a positive or negative way) upon social factors, economic factors, weather factors, psychophysical factors, carrying capacity factors.|$|E
