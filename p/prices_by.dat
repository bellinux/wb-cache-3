5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries.

5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high <b>prices</b> <b>by</b> unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{pervasive}} discrepancy among the pricing schemes of data services, this paper investigates {{the selection of}} pricing metrics (variables) and the corresponding pricing plans. We construct a stylized model in which a monopoly data services seller faces heterogeneous consumers whose utilities depend on the usage and the connection speed. We examine three options for the seller to conduct the second-degree (indirect) <b>price</b> discrimination: <b>by</b> minutes, by giga bytes (Gigs), and by mega bytes per second (Mbps). We show that the after-sales self-selection behaviors {{have a significant impact}} on the seller's profitability, and it leads to a first-order influence on the pricing metric selection. We prove that either <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Gigs or <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Mbps can be optimal. <b>Pricing</b> <b>by</b> Gigs can dominate the <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Mbps even if the consumer's utility is more sensitive in changes in the connection speed. We also find that when incorporating the bandwidth costs or congestion costs, <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> Mbps becomes more attractive as it allows the seller to directly control the congestion effect. These findings may help practitioners to develop their own pricing plans and pricing metrics selection...|$|R

5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental <b>prices.</b> <b>By</b> the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising <b>prices</b> <b>by</b> delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon {{responded to}} the {{economic}} crisis by declaring a four-day banking holiday to begin on March 1, 1933. He twice extended the holiday, which finally ended on March 18.

At {{the end of the}} 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit. Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds.|$|E

40|$|A {{substantial}} applications {{literature on}} <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> arbitrage has effectively restricted information to that arising solely from securities markets; return distributions are then governed solely <b>by</b> past <b>prices.</b> We reconsider <b>pricing</b> <b>by</b> arbitrage in markets rendered incomplete by arbitrary information, which, moreover, may influence required returns. We show that contingent claims depending solely on securities' normalized price histories are <b>priced</b> <b>by</b> arbitrage if {{and only if}} all risk-adjusted probabilities agree upon the law of primitive securities' normalized prices. We show how existing diffusion-based results can be preserved, and resolve an issue relating to Merton's (1973) stochastic interest rate model. Copyright Blackwell Publishers 1998. ...|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities <b>prices</b> <b>by</b> the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{took control of}} deciding how much the prices should rise in a year, {{as long as the}} subsidy cuts on gasoline and other refined products, natural gas, electricity, water, food (sugar, rice, cooking oil and bread), health and education are between $10 and 20 billion dollars annually. Estimates indicate that the government has to increase existing <b>prices</b> <b>by</b> an average of 2.5 times to achieve the lower target and by 4 times for the maximum target. According to the IMF, Iranians can expect the first price hike to lift energy product prices between four and 20 times previous levels, with prices surging even higher eventually.|$|E

Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated that this {{had nothing to do with}} the elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase <b>prices</b> <b>by</b> 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tail, which since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK1 billion in 1999, totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed NOK 3 billion.|$|E

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect <b>prices</b> <b>by</b> effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E

5|$|The Lexus LS {{marked the}} first {{successful}} entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena, a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model, Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales, and in 2000, the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market. Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features. In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods, and dropped competing U.S. base <b>prices</b> <b>by</b> nearly 10 percent. To rival the LS 400, extra features were rushed for {{the launch of the}} 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140), causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz's chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter. Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, and Chrysler. When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods. Industry publications noted the LS 400's precise panel gaps, and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests. The LS 430's interior noise level was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quiet.|$|E
