5|$|Aberrations in <b>prenatal</b> {{development}} {{can result in}} various forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause congenital hypothyroidism, and if untreated {{this can lead to}} cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Belief in <b>prenatal</b> fetal awareness, mental {{communication}} {{between mother and}} unborn child, and emotional attachment of child to mother as a <b>prenatal</b> phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (not based on attachment theory), which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E
5|$|Environmental factors {{associated}} {{with the development of}} schizophrenia include the living environment, drug use, and <b>prenatal</b> stressors.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine. <b>Prenatal</b> cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain. This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. Therefore, in models of <b>prenatal</b> cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} the first {{functional}} organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis. This early start is crucial for subsequent embryonic and <b>prenatal</b> development.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{the village}} has a health {{facility}} which {{is connected to}} that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, family planning consultations, and <b>prenatal</b> information. A maternity hospital was founded in 1991 which is decorated with a fresco by Malang Badji, {{one of the most}} famous artists in the region.|$|E
5|$|In addition, in at-risk pregnancies {{due to an}} {{affected}} male partner, non-invasive <b>prenatal</b> diagnosis can {{be performed}} by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in a blood sample taken from the mother (via venipuncture) between six and twelve weeks of pregnancy. It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage (excepting via needle contamination).|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a <b>prenatal</b> diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. <b>Prenatal</b> testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{an internship}} {{and a trip}} abroad for postgraduate studies, DeLee was ready {{to set up a}} medical practice by the age of 25. Noting that obstetric care in Chicago was often inadequate, he opened a clinic on Chicago's Maxwell Street after consulting with the noted social worker Jane Addams. Early on, DeLee provided <b>prenatal</b> care to the neighborhood's women, but the babies were delivered by midwives in the area. Over time, hundreds of women began having their babies delivered by DeLee.|$|E
5|$|Conventional <b>prenatal</b> {{tests for}} {{chromosomal}} abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Danner is {{a fictional}} {{character}} and the protagonist of Philip Wylie's 1930 novel Gladiator. Born in the late 19th century with superhuman abilities via <b>prenatal</b> chemical experimentation, Danner tries to use his powers for good, making him a precursor of the superhero. However, Danner grows disillusioned with his inability to find a permanent outlet for his great strength, and dies frustrated.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct <b>prenatal</b> development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a <b>prenatal</b> genetic test for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand depending on which allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular Diagnostics.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by <b>prenatal</b> screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to <b>prenatal</b> screening and abortions. The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting. It {{is the cause of}} 8% of all congenital disorders.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} mineral, including to <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal development. Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people {{in the developing world}} and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} human health {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning {{as a result of}} consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where <b>prenatal</b> exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E
25|$|As {{a method}} of <b>prenatal</b> diagnosis, {{cell-free}} fetal DNA techniques share the same ethical and practical issues, such as the possibility of <b>prenatal</b> sex discernment and sex selection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prenatal</b> diagnosis. If {{both parents}} are {{identified}} as carriers, <b>prenatal</b> genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), {{the most common form}} of <b>prenatal</b> diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prenatal</b> {{testing is}} {{possible}} if a disease-causing mutation is identified in an affected family member; however, <b>prenatal</b> testing for typically adult-onset disorders is uncommon and requires careful genetic counseling.|$|E
25|$|The aim of good <b>prenatal</b> care is prevention, early identification, and {{treatment}} of any medical complications. A basic <b>prenatal</b> visit consists of measurement of blood pressure, fundal height, weight and fetal heart rate, checking for symptoms of labor, and guidance for what to expect next.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have looked}} at, {{and some have}} even optimized, {{protocols}} for testing for various issues, including non-compatible RhD factors, sex determination for X-linked genetic disorders and testing for single gene disorders. Current studies are now looking at determining aneuploidies in the developing fetus. These protocols can be done earlier than the current <b>prenatal</b> testing methods, and have no risk of spontaneous abortion, unlike current <b>prenatal</b> testing methods. Non-invasive <b>prenatal</b> diagnosis (NIPD) and Non-invasive <b>prenatal</b> testing (NIPT) have been implemented in the UK {{and parts of the}} US; it has clear benefits above the standard tests of chorionic villi sample (CVS), amniocentesis, and other techniques which have procedure-related miscarriage risks of about 1 in 100 pregnancies and 1 in 200 pregnancies, respectively.|$|E
25|$|No Risk: Confirmed {{absence of}} <b>prenatal</b> alcohol exposure.|$|E
25|$|Referral for {{counseling}} in a <b>prenatal</b> genetics clinic to discuss {{risks to the}} pregnancy (advanced maternal age, teratogen exposure, family history of a genetic disease), test results (abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound), and/or options for <b>prenatal</b> diagnosis (typically amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling).|$|E
25|$|Economically, for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis, when {{comparing}} {{preimplantation genetic diagnosis}} (PGD) with natural conception (NC) followed by <b>prenatal</b> testing and abortion of affected pregnancies, PGD provides net economic benefits up to a maternal age around 40 years, after which NC, <b>prenatal</b> testing, and abortion have higher economic benefit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prenatal</b> alcohol {{exposure}} {{is determined by}} interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), <b>prenatal</b> health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), chemical dependency treatment records (if applicable), or other reliable sources.|$|E
25|$|When {{structural}} or neurological impairments are not observed, {{all four}} diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to <b>prenatal</b> alcohol exposure {{to be assessed}} in terms of functional impairments. Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to <b>prenatal</b> alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, {{often referred to as}} developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to <b>prenatal</b> alcohol exposure and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such, so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.|$|E

25|$|There is {{research}} {{evidence that}} the digit ratio {{of the length of}} the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to <b>prenatal</b> testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high <b>prenatal</b> testosterone and low <b>prenatal</b> estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} takes account of infant mortality but not <b>prenatal</b> mortality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prenatal</b> cocaine {{exposure}} {{is associated with}} premature birth, birth defects and attention deficit disorder.|$|E
25|$|Severe <b>prenatal</b> {{deficiency}} of GH, as occurs in congenital hypopituitarism, has {{little effect on}} fetal growth. However, <b>prenatal</b> and congenital deficiency can {{reduce the size of}} a male's penis, especially when gonadotropins are also deficient. Besides micropenis in males, additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include hypoglycemia and exaggerated jaundice (both direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia).|$|E
25|$|Baba Hari Dass {{agreed to}} mentor his {{pregnant}} student Jeannine Parvati through {{a course of}} <b>prenatal</b> Yoga. During that time she continued practicing asanas and authored <b>Prenatal</b> Yoga & Natural Childbirth, published in 1974. As {{the daughter of a}} First Nation father (Ute tribe) and as a longtime student of Baba Hari Dass, Jeannine Parvati Baker's midwifery philosophy was one of earth-based values and non-harming principles.|$|E
25|$|Mary Help of the Sick Mission Hospital now has 121 beds, and {{provides}} affordable <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal care, nutritional education, child immunization, and family planning. The hospital gives <b>prenatal</b> care, including lab work, blood tests, and examinations for 200 women each day. The facility {{also has a}} special-care nursery for newborn babies. The hospital serves to educate nurses and midwives. Over 66 students are trained each year.|$|E
