50|$|One {{particular}} type of digital system uses a photostimulable phosphor plate (aka PSP - Phosphor Plate) {{in place of the}} film. After X-ray exposure the <b>plate</b> (<b>sheet)</b> is placed in a special scanner where the latent formed image is retrieved point by point and digitized, using a laser light scanning. The digitized images are stored and displayed on the computer screen. This method is in between old film based technology and the current direct digital imaging technology. It is similar to the film process because it involves the same image support handling and differs because the chemical development process is replaced by the scanning process. This is not much faster than film processing and the resolution and sensitivity performances are contested. However it has the clear advantage of being able to fit with any existing equipment without any modification because it replaces just the existing film.|$|E

Validation of simple methods for estimating energy and protein intakes in hospital wards are rarely reported in the literature. The aim was to validate a <b>plate</b> diagram <b>sheet</b> for estimation of energy and protein intakes of patients by comparison with weighed food records. Subjects were inpatients at the Cardio Thoracic ward, Landspitali National University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland (N =  73). The ward personnel used a <b>plate</b> diagram <b>sheet</b> to record the proportion (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 100 %) of meals consumed by each subjects, for three days. Weighed food records where used as a reference method. On average the <b>plate</b> diagram <b>sheet</b> overestimated energy intake by 45  kcal/day (1119  ±  353  kcal/day versus 1074  ±  360  kcal/day, p =  0. 008).
