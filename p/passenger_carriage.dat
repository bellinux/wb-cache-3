5|$|With through running {{between the}} lines in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage.</b> As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 two new {{passenger}} carriages, each accommodating 40 passengers, {{were bought}} by the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company from the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works {{as part of the}} programme of improvements in anticipation of the extension to Oxford. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage.</b> Following the takeover of the O by the MR, goods services were operated by a fleet of five eight-wheeled carriages built in 1865–66. Two cattle wagons were added to the line's stock in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|After the 1899 {{transfer}} {{of services to}} the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> on the line; unlike other stations on the line, the platform height at Wood Siding was not raised {{at this time to}} accommodate the new carriage. From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 {{transfer of}} services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Mining {{started on}} 7 July 1910, {{with the first}} ore train being run on 13 July. The first shipload left Kirkenes on 11 October, but SS Bengal sank with the first shipment. In 1911, the system {{exported}} 330,000 tonnes of ore. The railway was also used for transporting workers, with trains running from the towns to the plants {{in the morning and}} returning after the working day was over. Prior to private cars becoming common, the railway operated a <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> on the trains between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn—allowing free travel. The railway has never had any scheduled or public transport of passengers, but the company's concession specifies that the authorities could at a later date require the company to operate public passenger services under specified conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the {{railroad}} from Portland to Astoria cut into the <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> business of the Telephone, so that on June 2, 1898, Telephone carried only 75 passengers, yet this was the largest number since rail operations had commenced.|$|E

25|$|South East Asian LCC AirAsia {{plans to}} {{establish}} a new budget airline in Vietnam in a joint venture with Vietnamese partners, AirAsia announced in a statement to the Malaysia Stock Exchange on 31 March 2017. The new Vietnamese LCC is expected to commence its operations by early 2018. The company said that the new joint venture has been signed by its wholly owned subsidiary AirAsia Investment Limited (AAIL) with Vietnam’s Gumin Company Limited (Gumin), a businessman Tran Trong Kien and Hai Au Aviation Joint Stock Company (JV Co) on 30 March 2017. Gumin will own around 69.99% of the new LCC, AirAsia will have 30% and Tran will own the rest. According to AirAsia, the new venture will need investments of VND 1 trillion ($44 million), and the Kuala Lumpur-based company will contribute 30% of that after raising internal funding. AirAsia said that Vietnam’s geographical location provides the foundation and support for the joint venture’s plans to operate domestic and international underserved routes focusing primarily in providing connectivity domestically into key cities in Vietnam as well as internationally to ASEAN, China, Korea and Japan from 3 major hubs namely Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi and Da Nang. Vietnam is also the 5th largest aviation market in South East Asia after Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. It was the fastest growing aviation market both in the world and in South East Asia in 2015 and 2016. In terms of <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> (domestic and international), Vietnam’s air travel <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> in 2016 was 52 million, with its growth dwarfing its ASEAN peers’, charting approximately 28% year-over-year growth in 2016 vis-à-vis its ASEAN peer’s average growth of approximately 10%. Vietnam’s domestic and international market has also doubled in size since 2013 and 2011 respectively. Domestic passenger growth in 2016 was approximately 25% while international growth was over 30%. With the plan, AirAsia will enter the competitive market of airlines’ industry in Vietnam and challenge the current LCC players – VietJet and Jetstar Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} train was the 16:45 from Cleethorpes to Manchester {{consisting of a}} brake van, three passenger carriages and a rear guard's van. The goods train which had left Grimsby {{earlier in the day}} for Doncaster consisted of 44 waggons loaded with larch tree trunks, three trunks to a load secured with chains. The length of the trunks (up to 42ft) necessitated the close coupling of the waggons. The goods train was being shunted on a curve at low speed adjacent to the main line when 5 trucks derailed just as the {{passenger train}} approached. One truck toppled over; its load of timber projecting over the main line. The brake van 'was carried away {{with the exception of the}} offside and roof'. The next two carriages were 'clean swept away' above the floor level; the first compartment of the third <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> was also destroyed.|$|E
25|$|After {{being built}} in 1925–26 at the Hutt Workshops in Petone, the railcars {{were sent to the}} Greytown Branch in the Wairarapa for trials. The Greytown Branch was a short line that {{provided}} a link between the town of Greytown and the Wairarapa Line, which bypassed the town by some four kilometres. Services ran from Greytown to connect with services on the Wairarapa Line at the junction in Woodside, but they were woefully underpatronised; often, the steam locomotive working the service would pull just a guard's van and a single <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> carrying a handful of passengers. The costs to operate such a service meant that the line made a significant financial loss, but it was hoped that the small Model T Ford railcars would slash operating costs while providing a satisfactory service for the travellers who did use the line. Unfortunately, they did not prove as successful or as popular as hoped, so, after their trial period, steam-hauled carriage trains were reinstated for all services and the railcars were sent to work in Southland.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of an}} 1896 {{agreement}} by which the LSWR re-equipped the LNC {{in conjunction with the}} repositioning of the LNC's London terminus, the LNC demanded that the new passenger carriages to be supplied by the LSWR be [...] "of a quality and a character not inferior to [...] ordinary main line traffic". These new carriages were supplied late in the 19th century, probably in December 1899. They were all six-wheeled, and comprised two [...] passenger brake vans each containing three third class compartments, a baggage compartment and the guard's compartment; a [...] <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> divided into three first class and two second class compartments; and a [...] <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> divided into five third class compartments (also used as all second class).

500|$|Details of the {{carriages}} and wagons used in {{the very}} early years of the Tramway are uncertain. By 1879 the company operated a fleet of nine four-wheeled goods wagons, some with [...] and some with [...] high sides. All nine wagons were fitted with dumb buffers, and as a consequence did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. When it was necessary to run through traffic from the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway onto the Tramway via the Quainton Road turntable, appropriate wagons and trucks were hired from the GWR or London and North Western Railway. It is also known that a passenger tram carriage was owned by the Tramway by March 1873. This <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> seated 16–20 passengers and although it had been designed as a horse tram, was fitted with buffers allowing it to be used in trains. By 1878 (when it is recorded as being repaired) the company also owned a <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> divided into a third-class compartment, a second-class compartment and a luggage compartment.|$|E

The station was initially built with a single low wooden platform, primarily intended for loading and unloading freight. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall <b>passenger</b> <b>carriage</b> on the line; at this time, a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.|$|E

Several theories have been put forward regarding this state of affairs, the most plausible being that the more conservative members of the railway workforce at Brighton and the Railway Executive felt that the Leader was too revolutionary and were keen to maintain the status quo.|$|E
