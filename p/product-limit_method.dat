40|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{resistance of}} selected organisms to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin {{was defined as}} a MIC of ≥ 4 μg/ml. The dynamics of resistance were studied after single and sequential drug exposures: clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were utilized. After a single 48 -h exposure of a large inoculum to four times the initial MIC for the organism, the frequency of selection of resistant mutants of MSSA was greater for trovafloxacin than levofloxacin (P = 0. 008); for E. cloacae, the frequency was highest for ciprofloxacin and lowest for levofloxacin and trovafloxacin; for S. marcescens, the frequency was highest for trovafloxacin and lowest for ciprofloxacin (P = 0. 003). The results of serial passage experiments were analyzed both by the Kaplan-Meier <b>product-limited</b> <b>method</b> as well as by analysis of variance of mean inhibitory values. By both methods, MSSA and MRSA expressed mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin after fewer passages than were required for either levofloxacin or trovafloxacin. For the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, two general patterns emerged. Mutants resistant to trovafloxacin appeared sooner and reached higher mean MICs than did mutants resistant to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin appeared later and reached mean MICs lower than the MICs of the other two drugs studied. Even though individual strain variation occurred, the mean MICs were reproduced when the serial passage experiment was repeated using an identical panel of E. coli isolates. In summary, the dynamic selection of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria can be demonstrated in experiments that employ serial passage of bacteria in vitro...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the rehospitalization rates of patients discharged from the Institute of Psychiatry of the Hospital das Clínicas of the Universidade de São Paulo Medical School while being treated with haloperidol, risperidone or clozapine. METHOD: This is a naturalistic study designed to monitor rehospitalization rates for patients discharged on haloperidol (n = 43), risperidone (n = 22) or clozapine (n = 31). Time to readmission over the course of three years was measured by the <b>product-limit</b> (Kaplan-Meier) <b>method.</b> Risk factors associated with rehospitalizations were examined. RESULTS: At 36 months, remained in the community 74 % of the haloperidol-treated patients, 59 % of the risperidone-treated patients and 84 % of the clozapine-treated patients. The haloperidol group showed a higher proportion of women, a late age of onset and shorter length of illness than the other groups, whereas the opposite was observed in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the rehospitalization rates of patients taking clozapine are lower than the rate for patients treated with haloperidol and risperidone. However confounding variables such as gender distribution and age of onset represent limitations that should be taken into account for the interpretation of the results...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to define the {{relationship}} between left ventricular diastolic function and survival after renal revascularization. MethodsSeventy-six adult patients (49 women, 27 men; mean age: 63 ± 13 years) with preoperative echocardiography who underwent renal revascularization for atherosclerotic disease were identified. Diastolic function was estimated from the early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E), the atrial transmitral flow velocity (A), and the mitral annular tissue doppler velocity (e′). Patients were divided into two groups of diastolic dysfunction as either none/mild (E/A ≤ 0. 75, E/e′ 0. 75, E/e′ ≥ 10). Perioperative and follow-up mortality were determined from a prospective vascular database and the National Death Index. Descriptive statistics were calculated and postoperative survival was estimated by <b>product-limit</b> <b>methods.</b> Associations between preoperative factors, perioperative factors, and follow-up survival were examined using proportional hazards regression models. A forward stepwise variable selection procedure was used to select a “best” model to predict follow-up survival. ResultsSeventy-six patients were followed for an average of 41. 9 months after renal revascularization. Within this group, 47 of 76 patients (61. 8 %) were identified as having moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction had no apparent association with abnormal systolic function. The mean ejection fraction for those with moderate/severe diastolic dysfunction was 57. 7 % ± 11. 5 %. When comparing the moderate/severe and none/mild groupings of diastolic dysfunction, there was a significant difference in left ventricular mass index (151. 9 ± 48. 9 vs 125. 3 ± 31. 7; P =. 0087). There were five deaths in the perioperative period and 20 deaths on follow-up. Among perioperative survivors, hypertension was cured or improved in 82 % of the none/mild group and 53 % of the moderate/severe group (P =. 012). In multivariable analysis, none/mild diastolic dysfunction was significantly and independently associated with an improvement in blood pressure after revascularization (odds ratio [OR], 6. 2; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 4 - 28. 6; P =. 018). Ejection fraction was not associated with survival. After forward variable selection, moderate/severe diastolic dysfunction (hazard ratio [HR], 5. 8; 95 % CI 1. 4 - 25; P =. 018) was the only variable to demonstrate a significant and independent association with follow-up survival. ConclusionDiastolic dysfunction, but not systolic dysfunction, was frequent in patients with renovascular disease. Blood pressure response and follow-up survival after renal revascularization demonstrated significant and independent associations with diastolic function. Consideration of diastolic function should be included in the management of patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThis {{retrospective}} review {{describes the}} surgical management of renovascular disease in 25 consecutive {{children and adolescents}} with severe hypertension. MethodsPatients ≤ 21 years of age (mean age, 11. 6 ± 5. 4 years; 12 females, 13 males) underwent repair of 34 renal arteries (RAs), and their management forms {{the basis of this}} report. Early and late blood pressure responses were adjusted for gender, age, and height. RA repair was evaluated by angiography, renal duplex sonography (RDS) scanning, or both. Primary patency and survival were estimated by <b>product-limit</b> <b>methods.</b> ResultsThirty-four RAs among 32 kidneys were repaired. Bilateral renal RA disease to a solitary kidney was present in nine patients. RA lesions included dysplasia (44 %), RA hypoplasia (20 %), midaortic syndrome (12 %), RA aneurysm (12 %), dissection (8 %), and arteritis (4 %). All patients had severe hypertension (> 95 th percentile systolic or diastolic pressure adjusted for gender, age, and height). RA repair comprised 25 bypasses (73 %) consisting of 28 % saphenous vein, 60 % hypogastric artery, and 12 % polytetrafluoroethylene; 2 patch angioplasties (6 %), and 7 reimplantations (21 %). Branch RA exposure was required in 28 kidneys (88 %), and branch reconstruction was required in 61 %. Warm in situ repair was used in 53 %, in situ cold perfusion in 24 %, and ex vivo cold perfusion in 23 %. Of six bilateral RA repairs, one was staged and two patients are awaiting a staged repair. Combined aortic reconstruction was required in three patients. No unplanned nephrectomy was performed. There were no perioperative deaths. Hypertension was cured in 36 %, improved in 56 %, and failed in 8 % at mean follow-up of 46. 4 ± 7. 8 months. The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate increased from 82. 0 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 preoperatively to 98. 2 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 postoperatively. The postoperative patency of 30 RA reconstructions was evaluated by angiography, RDS scanning, or both. At mean follow-up of 32. 8 months (median, 21. 2 months), primary RA patency was 91 %. No failures were observed after 2 months follow-up. Estimated survival was 100 % at 60 months, with one death 9 years after surgery. ConclusionsRenovascular hypertension in children and adolescents was caused by a heterogeneous group of lesions. All patients had RA repair, with arterial autografts in most of the RA bypasses. Cold perfusion preservation was used in half of the complex branch RA repairs. These strategies provided 91 % primary patency at mean follow-up of 32. 8 months, with beneficial blood pressure response in 92 %. Surgical repair of clinically significant renovascular disease in children and adolescents is supported by these results...|$|R

The individual effect of clinical and exercise testing data on outcome was evaluated using Cox regression analysis with separate models for each group of variables. Model validation was performed using bootstrap adjusted by degree of optimism in estimates. Survival analysis was performed using a <b>product-limit</b> Kaplan-Meier <b>method.</b> During a 37 -month follow-up, 22 deaths and 40 nonfatal acute coronary syndromes occurred. After adjusting for confounding variables, age (hazard ratio 1. 62, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 14 to 2. 31 for interquartile difference), hypertension (hazard ratio 1. 74, 95 % CI 1. 04 to 2. 89), and SRI (hazard ratio 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 65 to 0. 86 for interquartile difference) were predictive of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Moreover, SRI increased the prognostic power of the model on top of clinical and exercise testing variables and provided significant discrimination of survival.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{treatment}} {{plan to be}} used in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis was devised and tested as a Phase II study. BACKGROUND: Peritoneal carcinomatosis from appendical or colorectal cancer has been regarded as a fatal clinical entity. Treatment protocols have not been reported previously. METHODS: The authors used cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy to treat 181 consecutive patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. There were 51 patients with colorectal cancer and 130 patients with appendiceal cancer. Mean follow-up is 24 months, with a range of 0 to 149 months. RESULTS: Clinical features that showed prognostic significance included appendiceal versus colorectal primary tumors (p = 0. 0001), grade 1 versus grades 2 and 3 histopathology (p = 0. 0003), complete versus incomplete cytoreductions (p = 0. 0001), lymph node-negative versus lymph node-positive primary tumors (p = 0. 0001), and volume of peritoneal carcinomatosis present preoperatively for colon cancer (p = 0. 0006). Features with no statistical prognostic significance included preoperative tumor volume for appendiceal cancer, age, sex, number of cycles of chemotherapy, operative time, complications, blood loss, and institution providing treatment. From these prognostic features, four prognostic groups were identified, and 3 -year survival was estimated by the <b>product-limit</b> survival <b>method.</b> Group I patients (n = 76) were those with grade 1 histology, no lymph node metastases, and complete cytoreductions (survival at 3 years = 99 %). Group II patients (n = 23) were those with grade 2 or 3 histology, no lymph node metastases, and complete cytoreductions (65 %).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of the Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) -gene polymorphism 434 (G > C) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and its association with tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia (TATE), demographic, clinical, and microscopic variables. Methods: The ECP genotypes of 165 healthy individuals and 157 OSCC patients were detected by PCR-RFLP analysis after cleavage of the amplified DNA sequence with enzyme PstI. TATE was obtained by morphometric analysis. Chi-square test or Fisher`s exact test was used to analyze the association of ECP-gene polymorphism 434 (G > C) with TATE, demographic, clinical, and microscopic variables in OSCC patients. Disease-free survival and overall survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier <b>product-limit</b> actuarial <b>method</b> and the comparison of the survival curves were performed using log rank test. Results: Most of healthy individuals (53. 33 %) and OSCC patients (57. 97 %) were heterozygous for the ECP 434 (G > C) polymorphism. Based on numerical differences, our results showed that OSCC patients with intense TATE and at least one C allele had a higher frequency of bilateral neck dissection, local recurrence, vascular embolization, involved resection margins, and postoperative radiotherapy. No statistically significant differences on survival rates were found in OSCC patients presenting different ECP 434 (G > C) genotypes. Conclusions: These results suggest a tendency towards a poor clinical outcome in OSCC patients with intense TATE and 434 GC/CC genotypes, probably due to an ECP genetic variant with altered cytotoxic activity.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{approaches}} of inferences on median failure times are considered and developed {{to compare the}} difference of median failure times between two groups of censored survival data. The first one is to generalize the Mood's median test - {{which is designed to}} deal with complete data - to censored survival data. To this end, two groups of censored survival data are pooled and then the estimated pooled median failure time is obtained from the <b>product-limit</b> <b>method.</b> A score is assigned for each observation to indicate the probability whether it survives after the pooled median failure time or not and for each group the scores are summed to summarize the number of observations whose survival time is larger than or equal to pooled median survival time, which results in a 2 x 2 contingency table with non-integer entries. Four 2 x 2 contingency tables with integer entries are then derived and a test statistic is defined as the weighted sum of the statistics from the four 2 x 2 contingency tables which is shown to be approximately distributed as chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom for large samples. The second approach is proposed to construct a 95 % confidence interval for the difference of median failure times between two groups of censored survival distributions. Since the median failure time is approximately normally distributed for large samples, the estimated median failure times for each group are obtained by <b>product-limit</b> <b>method</b> and their standard errors are computed through bootstrap samples from the original data. Theory of construction for 95 % confidence interval for the difference of median failure times is investigated for the standard normal distributions and it can be used for general normal distributions by translation and rescaling. Extensive numerical studies are carried out to test the appropriateness of the two approaches and the results show that the approaches developed in the thesis are easy to implement and the results are promising, compared to the results from published papers. The proposed methods will facilitate more accurate analysis of survival data under censoring, which are commonly collected from clinical studies that influence public health...|$|E

Thirty-three lesions were previously untreated, whereas 9 had undergone prior treatment (surgery, 6 lesions; radiotherapy, 1 lesion; or both, 2 lesions) and were treated for locally recurrent disease. All 3 patients who received prior radiotherapy had been treated at other institutions. Patients had minimum follow-up times as follows: 2 years, 40 patients (100 %); 5 years, 31 patients (78 %); 10 years, 21 patients (53 %); 15 years, 16 patients (40 %); 20 years, 9 patients (23 %); and 25 years, 2 patients (5 %).

40|$|To {{check the}} {{validity}} of a parametric model for survival data, a number of supremum-type tests have been proposed in the literature using Khmaladze's (1993, Ann. Statist. 18, 582 - 602) transformation of a test process. However, such a transformation is usually very complicated and lacks a clear interpretation. Information could also be lost through transformation. In this note, we propose a simulation-based supremum-type test directly from the original test process using an idea originally introduced by Lin et al. (1993, Biometrika 80, 557 - 572). The test is developed under the framework of Aalen's (1978, Ann.

Possible associations were analyzed using nonparametric survival methods and survival distributions were described using the <b>product-limit</b> (Kaplan Meier) <b>methods.</b> Regression analysis was used to estimate the correlation between pre- and postvaccination BVDV titers three years after vaccination. Evidence of exposure to BVDV prior to 14 months of age was demonstrated by serum-virus-neutralization titers greater than 1 : 4 for 97 % and {{greater than or equal to}} 1 : 128 for 67 % of the 72 heifers followed. No correlation was found for 38 pairs of prevaccination and postvaccination titers (p = 0. 76). The risk of being culled was high for heifers (n = 41) with very low (1 : 2 - 1 : 8) or very high (> or = 1 : 256) titers, but low for heifers (n = 31) with moderate (1 : 16 - 1 : 128) prevaccination titers (p = 0. 098). Risk of subsequent fetal loss was high for heifers (n = 30) with very low (1 : 2 - 1 : 16) or very high (> or = 1 : 256) prevaccination titers, compared to heifers (n = 24) with moderate (1 : 32 - 1 : 128) titers (p = 0. 084). These findings suggest that prevaccination exposure to BVDV eliciting either a very weak or a very strong serological response may contribute to subsequent reproductive inefficiency and an increased risk of culling...|$|R

All statistical analyses were performed by using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Chicago, Armonk, NY, USA).|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the possible value of chemotherapy {{in the treatment}} of craniofacial osteosarcoma (CFOS). In a systematic review, data of 201 patients (age, 36. 6 +/- 19. 0 years [mean +/- SD]) from 20 uncontrolled series on CFOS indexed in Medline and Excerpta Medica between 1974 and 1994 were pooled; 180 patients had undergone surgery. Various chemotherapy regimens had been given to 71 patients. Radiotherapy was used in 69 patients. All patients had data for overall survival, and 182 had data for disease-free survival analysis. Cumulative survival distributions were estimated by the <b>product-limit</b> <b>method,</b> and a multiple regression analysis was performed. Patients' overall and disease-free survival rates were significantly improved by treatment with chemotherapy. This was confirmed for patients with complete surgical removal, as well as for those with incomplete removal of tumor. In a proportional hazards model, complete surgical removal and chemotherapy were independent significant factors for overall and disease-free survival. The effect of radiotherapy was insignificant. No prognostic factors could be identified among age groups, sex, and subsites. Evidence exists that chemotherapy improves survival in CFOS. We advocate the adoption of the chemotherapy protocols used for OS of the long bones for CFO...|$|E
30|$|Patient’s {{race and}} tumor {{characteristics}} were compared across groups with the Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, as appropriate. Overall survival (OS) {{was defined as}} the time from initiation of chemotherapy or surgery to date of death due to any cause or date of last follow-up. Recurrence free-survival (RFS) was measured from the date of definitive surgery to the date of first documented recurrence (local or distant) or date of last follow-up. Patients who died before experiencing a disease recurrence were censored at their date of death in the analysis of RFS. Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier <b>product-limit</b> <b>method</b> and compared between groups using the log-rank statistic. Student’s t-test was used to calculate differences in cancer recurrence and mortality rates by stage and race. We fitted Cox proportional hazards models for each survival outcome to determine the simultaneous relationship of patient and tumor variables with each outcome. For each outcome, pCR and clinical stage achieved statistical significance by the likelihood ratio test and were included in the Cox model. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, version 4 software (La Jolla, CA). For all of the statistical tests, a two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This study {{analyses}} {{the factors}} affecting mobilisation and engraftment in autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation {{according to the}} number of CD 34 (+) re-infused. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 190 patients underwent mobilisation with G-CSF alone (n= 113) or in combination with chemotherapy (n= 77). A total of 116 patients (61 %) were autografted with 2 x 10 (6) CD 34 (+) cells/kg. Rates of granulocyte and platelet recovery were estimated using the <b>product-limit</b> <b>method</b> of Kaplan-Meier and compared using a log-rank test. The Cox regression model was used for the multivariate analysis of factors influencing engraftment. Differences between cohorts were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or Mann-Whitney tests, and multivariate analysis was performed using a stepwise lineal regression. RESULTS: Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was significantly longer with 2 x 10 (6) /CD 34 (+) /kg, the Cox model did not identify prognostic factors for haematopoietic recovery. CONCLUSION: Although mobilisation schedules and disease status influenced not only the yield of progenitor cells, but also the engraftment kinetics, the number of CD 34 (+) re-infused was the main predictor of haematopoietic recovery. While engraftment succeeded in most of the cases, the re-infusion of > 2 x 10 (6) /CD 34 (+) /kg resulted in significantly shorter recovery times...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{high number}} of uninvolved {{axillary}} nodes was found by some authors {{to be associated with}} poor survival in node-negative breast cancer. We searched for confirmation and extend the investigation to node-positive cases, using population data from the SEER Program. Patients selected were women aged 40 - 69 years, diagnosed 1988 - 1997, T 1 -T 2 breast cancer, undergoing axillary dissection with 4 - 35 nodes examined. Survivals were estimated by the <b>product-limit</b> <b>method</b> and were computed on pooled data. Results in node-negative patients (n= 37, 519) showed a 5 -year overall survival from 92 % (95 % confidence interval: 88 - 95 %) with 4 uninvolved nodes, to 93 % (87 - 98 %) with 34 uninvolved nodes. In node-positive patients (n= 16, 978), the 5 -year survival increased from 50 % (44 - 56 %) with 0 uninvolved nodes, to 91 % (82 - 100 %) with 30 uninvolved nodes. Survival graphs indicated an improvement or a plateau with higher number of uninvolved nodes. The graphs also suggested that the ratio of involved and uninvolved nodes might be correlated with survival. We conclude that {{there was no evidence of}} poor outcome associated with a {{high number of}} uninvolved nodes. The incidental finding that ratio-based characterization of node involvement might be a prognostic factor will be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Information {{regarding}} {{survival and}} cause-specific mortality of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) {{is vital to}} their management, especially in small or isolated populations. Between January 2003 and August 2005, we used radio telemetry to investigate survival and cause-specific mortality of 87 [44 male (24 adult and 20 juvenile) and 43 female (34 adult and 9 juvenile) ] wild turkeys in northern Indiana. We estimated annual and seasonal survival using the Kaplan-Meier <b>product-limit</b> <b>method.</b> Mean male and female annual survival estimates were 0. 257 and 0. 777, respectively. Annual survival estimates were different between sexes within years, but were homogenous within sexes between years. Survival estimates did not differ among seasons for either sex. However, differences in survival estimates between sexes were detected in the spring, fall and winter seasons. Hunter harvest (46. 2 % male mortality) and predation (33. 3 % female mortality) were the leading known causes of mortality {{for male and female}} wild turkeys, respectively. Predators (canids, birds and unknown mammals) were responsible for 28. 6 % of mortality for both sexes combined. Although predation on adult birds was not severe, high mortality of male turkeys in the form of legal spring harvest, in addition to other causes of mortality, warrants concern for small, exploited populations in highly fragmented landscapes like those of northern Indiana...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} locoregional immune responses and long-term survival in {{various types of}} cancer; few have focused on lung cancer. This {{study was designed to}} assess the prognostic value of immunomorphologic changes in locoregional lymph nodes in patients resected for bronchogenic carcinoma. In a retrospective analysis, immune responses in locoregional lymph nodes were studied histologically in 172 selected patients. Lymph node morphology was studied according to the system of Cottier et al. : sinus histiocytosis (SH) and paracortical lymphoid cell hyperplasia (PCA) were considered as a cellular immune response, and follicular hyperplasia of the cortical area (CA) as a humoral reaction. The survival rate was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier <b>product-limit</b> <b>method.</b> Log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazards model were used to determine statistical significance in univariate and multivariate survival analysis. 35. 5 % of the patients had no evident response in regional nodes; 19. 8 % had a marked cellular response; 11 % a marked humoral response; and 33. 7 % a mixed cellular-humoral response. A nodal cellular response improved long-term survival rates even in patients with regional node metastases. Multivariate analysis identified an independent variable as having high prognostic value: lymph node immunoreactivity. Lymph node immunoreactivity significantly influences long-term survival after curative surgery for lung cancer and may be useful in stratifying patients for prospective trials of adjuvant treatment including immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the prognostic factors related to the survival of patients with sarcomas of the jaw treated in the Dr. Eduardo Caceres Graziani National Institute for Neoplastic Diseases, Lima, Peru. Age, gender, delay in consultation, diagnostic delay, therapeutic delay, tumor size, tumor location, facial asymmetry, pain, treatment type, and histopathological diagnosis were all evaluated as possible prognostic factors that would influence survival in those with jaw sarcomas. In the analysis, the following was used: mortality tables, Kaplan-Meier's <b>product-limit</b> <b>method,</b> log-rank, and Breslow and Tarone-Ware tests; for the prognostic factors, Cox's Regression Model was used. The overall survival rate, with the patient being free from disease at two years, was 55 %, and that at five years was 45 %. In the independent analysis of the prognostic factors, four variables were statistically significant in influencing survival: gender (p = 0. 043), histopathologic diagnosis (p = 0. 019), tumor location (p = 0. 019), and treatment type (p = 0. 030). According to Cox's Regression Model for the multivariate analysis, statistically significant prognostic factors were: gender (p = 0. 086), tumor location (p = 0. 020), and treatment type (p = 0. 092). Thus, the variables of gender, tumor location, and treatment type were determined to be predictive factors for prognosis of survival...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{establish}} independent prognostic {{factors on}} a chromosomal basis in superficial bladder cancer, using a multicolour fluorescence {{in situ hybridisation}} (FISH) probe mix. Patients and methods: In 2002, voided urine from 75 consecutive patients (mean age 71. 7, range 52 – 93) years under follow-up for superficial urothelial cancer was studied prospectively. The patients were observed for a mean (standard deviation (SD)) period of 39. 3 (6. 8) months (range 27 – 58) until July 2005. A multicolour FISH on liquid-based voided urinary cytology was carried out on all patients. Univariate analysis, using a log rank test, {{was used to determine}} the prognostic relevance of a low-risk pattern and a high-risk pattern. Progression-free survival time was calculated from the date of first diagnosis to first recurrence or progression according to the Kaplan–Meier <b>product-limit</b> <b>method.</b> Results: One patient was lost to follow-up. 27 of the 74 remaining (36. 8 %) patients showed recurrent disease. In 9 (33. 3 %) patients with a low-risk pattern disease recurred after a mean (SD) observation time of 29. 7 (1. 9) months (range 8. 3 – 52. 3, median 30. 8 (12. 4)). 18 (66. 7 %) patients with a high-risk pattern developed recurrence within a mean (SD) of 17. 6 (2. 0) months (range 4 – 38. 8, median 16. 7 (11. 6)). The Kaplan–Meier curve for progression-free survival showed marked differences between the low-risk and the high-risk groups...|$|E
40|$|Regarding the {{causality}} of Japanese banking crisis, two views are popular: (i) slow and undirected financial deregulations in the 1980 s caused {{trouble for the}} banks in adjusting with the new environment, and (ii) banks shifted their business in SME market and real estate businesses aggressively {{in the era of}} protracted monetary easing in the mid 1980 s, that finally contributed to banking failures after the curbed down of asset prices. Instead of these two views, this paper shows that the continuous declining trend of banks profitability (e. g. ROA or ROE) from 1970 was a warning signal for banking crisis, which was just accelerated by the bubble burst. Without any shock (monetary or bubble phenomenon) during the later half of the 1980 s, it would take some more time to reach the crisis situation. The paper also highlights some potential causes of declining trend of banks profitability. For analysis, Kaplan-Meire’s <b>Product-Limit</b> <b>method</b> is applied to estimate the survival functions and cause-specific hazard rates for the Japanese banks, along with Cox’s Proportional Hazards Model is used to find the significance of regression coefficients. Again, Accelerated failure time model is used to see whether collapse of the bubble accelerated the failure of the banks. Moreover, cointegration test and Granger causality test have been performed to identify the long- term causality of banks’ declining profitability. The issue is not only important for the Japanese economy, but also instructive for other big Asian economies. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of a novel doxorubicin and carboplatin chemotherapy protocol {{for the treatment of}} dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma following limb amputation. Design Retrospective study. Procedure Dogs diagnosed with appendicular osteosarcoma, with no evidence of metastatic disease, treated with amputation and adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of two doses of doxorubicin given 14 days apart, followed by four doses of carboplatin at 3 -weekly intervals between September 2003 and December 2009 were identified from the medical records of Perth Veterinary Oncology. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities were assessed based on information in the medical records and recorded complete blood count results. The efficacy of the protocol was assessed by determining the median disease-free interval (DFI) and overall survival time (OST) using the Kaplan-Meier <b>product-limit</b> <b>method.</b> Results In total, 33 dogs met the inclusion criteria. The median DFI was 231. 5 days and the median OST was 247 days. With regard to haematological toxicity, 56 % of dogs had a grade 1 - 2 neutropenia recorded as their highest marrow toxicity and 9 % of dogs experienced a grade 3 - 4 neutropenia, all subsequent to doxorubicin administration. The highest gastrointestinal toxicity was grade 1 - 2 in 15 dogs (47 %) and 5 dogs (16 %) experienced grade 3 - 4 gastrointestinal toxicity. Conclusion This chemotherapy protocol did not result in a longer time to disease recurrence or OST in this population of dogs. Dual-agent protocols have failed to improve survival times and therefore we conclude that a single-agent protocol using carboplatin may be equally effective with less toxicity...|$|E
30|$|In a first step, we {{describe}} the transition from education to first stable job depending on the educational attainment. We approach this from an event history perspective. For a descriptive overview, we estimate failure functions using the Kaplan–Meier <b>product-limit</b> <b>method.</b> In the multivariate analyses of the transition from education to a first stable job, we apply Cox proportional hazards regression models (Blossfeld and Rohwer 2002; Cleves et al. 2010; Cox 1972). We chose an event history approach because {{it allows us to}} take right-censored cases into account and avoid bias caused by cases who were at risk for less than the defined observation period (48  months). We have no theoretical concerns about time dependency, which is introduced in this model as an unspecified baseline hazard rate. As our main interest is the direction and strength of the covariate effects on the event occurrence (not the search duration), the Cox model is appropriate. 7 We assume that individuals are available for the labour market as soon as they leave the educational system, so the start of the observation period is set accordingly. We observe that 192 dropouts enter vocational training after leaving higher education. As these individuals are unavailable for the labour market for at least 2  years, we define these cases as being ‘not at risk’ and set them to censored from the time the vocational training starts. We do not allow them to re-enter the risk set after graduation from vocational training. In the same way, we treated 639 individuals who are unavailable for the labour market for reasons of parental leave, military or voluntary service, sick-leave and non-tertiary education. In a second step, we select respondents who successfully entered the labour market and conduct ordinary least squares (OLS) models to analyse the occupational status of the first stable job.|$|E
