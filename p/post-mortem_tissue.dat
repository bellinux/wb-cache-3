40|$|Background Synapses are {{fundamental}} components of brain circuits and are disrupted in over 100 neurological and psychiatric diseases. The synapse proteome is physically organized into multiprotein complexes and polygenic mutations converge on postsynaptic complexes in schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability. Directly characterising human synapses and their multiprotein complexes from <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> {{is essential to}} understanding disease mechanisms. However, multiprotein complexes have not been directly isolated from human synapses and the feasibility of their isolation from <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> is unknown. Results Here we establish a screening assay and criteria to identify post-mortem brain samples containing well-preserved synapse proteomes, revealing that neocortex samples are best preserved. We also develop a rapid method for the isolation of synapse proteomes from human brain, allowing large numbers of post-mortem samples to be processed {{in a short time}} frame. We perform the first purification and proteomic mass spectrometry analysis of MAGUK Associated Signalling Complexes (MASC) from neurosurgical and <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> and find genetic evidence for their involvement in over seventy human brain diseases. Conclusions We have demonstrated that synaptic proteome integrity can be rapidly assessed from human post-mortem brain samples prior to its analysis with sophisticated proteomic methods. We have also shown that proteomics of synapse multiprotein complexes from well preserved <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> is possible, obtaining structures highly similar to those isolated from biopsy tissue. Finally we have shown that MASC from human synapses are involved with over seventy brain disorders. These findings should have wide application in understanding the synaptic basis of psychiatric and other mental disorders. ...|$|E

40|$|In <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> {{studies that}} compare {{regional}} brain biomarkers across different mental disorder diagnostic groups, subjects are often matched on several demographic characteristics and measured on additional covariates. The goal {{of our research}} is to integrate the results from these types of studies using two commonly used statistical discrimination techniques, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification trees based on the algorithm developed by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (BFOS), to identify the most discriminatory subset of biomarkers. Subject matching and covariate effects don't appear in the literature implementing these discriminatory methods {{in the analysis of}} <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> studies (e. g., Knable et al. 2001; Knable et al. 2002). Although there are methods that have been developed for LDA to account for covariate effects on the response or feature variables of interest, none of these methods addresses the fact that individuals may also be matched across several groups. One aspect of our research extends this work to handle group matching. To develop the theoretical foundations required to account for covariate effects in classification trees, we describe how to implement the BFOS algorithm, which is non-parametric and traditionally implemented in a data based setting, when the feature variables come from a known distribution. We then extend this algorithm to the case where the feature variables come from a known distribution, conditional on a covariate value. From this development, we carefully formulate a semi-parametric model for the conditional distribution of the feature variables that allows the use of the BFOS algorithm to construct a covariate adjusted tree based on one unique set of feature variables, in both a theoretical setting and in the context of training data. Finally, the tree construction procedure we develop using this conditional model is extended to handle group matching. Our adjustment methodology is successfully applied to a series of <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> studies conducted by Sweet et al.

Given {{the complexity of the}} polyamine system, quantification of the levels of the polyamines is an essential step in understanding the downstream effects of dysregulated gene expression. We developed a method using high-resolution capillary gas chromatography (GC) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) for quantitation of polyamines from <b>post-mortem</b> brain <b>tissue,</b> which allowed us to accurately measure spermidine and putrescine concentrations in <b>post-mortem</b> brain <b>tissues.</b> Using this method, we analyzed putrescine and spermidine levels in a total of 126 samples from Brodmann areas 4, 8 / 9, and 11, from 42 subjects, comprising 16 suicide completers with major depression, 13 non-depressed suicide completers, and 13 control subjects.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to further {{investigate}} the etiopathogenetic role of EHV- 2. The main goal was to exam the clinical relevance of EHV- 2 in the genesis of conjunctivitis and keratitis, tissue tropism and possible sites of latency in horses. Blood samples and swabs from 28 eye diseased test group animals and 28 healthy control group horses were taken twice within 4 - 5 weeks in the horse clinic of the Tierärztliche Hochschule Hanover. These samples were virologically investigated in the Institute of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universität Berlin. Furthermore, <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissues</b> from 20 naturally infected horses were analysed for EHV- 2. EHV- 2 was detected by various serological methods, nested PCR (nPCR) and co-cultivation in both the test and control group. A statistically significant correlation between infection and tested groups was not observed. Interestingly, EHV- 2 was detected in mules using the aforementioned methods, implicating that mules appear to be permissive for EHV- 2. The sampling of the eye {{was carried out in}} parallel with cotton wool swaps and Cytobrushes from the conjunctival fossa. In both groups EHV- 2 was detected significantly more often in the samples obtained by the Cytobrush. As a Cytobrush sample contains much more cell material than a cotton wool swab sample, {{it is likely that the}} higher frequency of EHV- 2 detection in Cytobrush samples indicates an intracellular virus load of the deeper stratums of the conjunctiva. Therefore, the conjunctiva might be a site of latency of EHV- 2. The fact that EHV- 2 was detected more frequently in Cytobrush samples from the conjunctival fossa than in PBMC, an already known site of latency, provides further evidence that the conjunctiva may be a site of latency. In <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissues,</b> EHV- 2 was found more often in mucous membrane (56 % of the conjunctiva, 2 / 2 noses) than in the lachrymal glands (31 %), the lung (24 %), nerve tissue (20 % of the trigeminal ganglia, 10 % of the optic nerves) and the aqueous fluid (0 %) via nPCR. These results demonstrate that EHV- 2 was detected most frequently in the conjunctiva of <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissues.</b> In tissues analysed from the lachrymal gland, nose and optic nerve, EHV- 2 was present only in conjunction with areas which were observed to have an EHV- 2 -positive conjunctiva. This suggests that the conjunctiva might act as a portal for EHV- 2, and that the virus spreads from the conjunctiva to other tissues. Another indicator for virus spread via the lacrimal-nose-channel was indicated by the fact that 75 % of horses with EHV- 2 -positive nose swabs were also positive for EHV- 2 in the eye swab sample. EHV- 2 was detected in a naturally-intrauterine-infected foetus, which was aborted during the eighth month of pregnancy. EHV- 2 was detected in the trigeminal ganglia of this foetus. Genetically differing EHV- 2 serovars were present in both swabs and in blood samples taken from the same horse simultaneously as well as in eye- and nose- and blood-samples taken from one animal at various time points. No genetic similarities were observed by using the described primers and restriction enzymes.

How aggregated tau leads to dementia remains enigmatic, although neuronal dysfunction and loss clearly contribute. We previously identified sut- 2 as a gene required for tau neurotoxicity in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of tauopathy. Here, we further explore the role of sut- 2 and show that overexpression of SUT- 2 protein enhances tau-induced neuronal dysfunction, neurotoxicity and accumulation of insoluble tau. We also explore the relationship between sut- 2 and its human homolog, mammalian SUT- 2 (MSUT 2) and find both proteins to be predominantly nuclear and localized to SC 35 -positive nuclear speckles. Using a cell culture model for the accumulation of pathological tau, we find that high tau levels lead to increased expression of MSUT 2 protein. We analyzed MSUT 2 protein in age-matched post-mortem brain samples from AD patients and observe a marked decrease in overall MSUT 2 levels in the temporal lobe of AD patients. Analysis of <b>post-mortem</b> <b>tissue</b> from AD cases shows a clear reduction in neuronal MSUT 2 levels in brain regions affected by tau pathology, but little change in regions lacking tau pathology. RNAi knockdown of MSUT 2 in cultured human cells overexpressing tau causes a marked decrease in tau aggregation.

Here we investigate the hypothesis that expression of the alternatively spliced N-terminal exons also differs between the two MAPT haplotypes. We performed allele-specific gene expression analysis on a H 1 /H 2 heterozygous human neuronal cell line model and 14 H 1 /H 2 heterozygous human <b>post-mortem</b> brain <b>tissues</b> from two brain regions. In both cell culture and <b>post-mortem</b> brain <b>tissue,</b> we show that the protective MAPT H 2 haplotype significantly expresses two-fold more 2 N (exons 2 + 3 +) MAPT transcripts than the disease-associated H 1 haplotype. We suggest that inclusion of exon 3 in MAPT transcripts may contribute to protecting H 2 carries from neurodegeneration...|$|R
5000|$|The {{chromosomal}} locus containing the small nucleolar RNA SNORD115 gene cluster has been duplicated in approximately 5% {{of individuals with}} autistic traits. [...] A mouse model engineered to have a duplication of the SNORD115 cluster displays autistic-like behaviour. A recent small study of <b>post-mortem</b> brain <b>tissue</b> demonstrated altered expression of long non-coding RNAs in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of autistic brains as compared to controls.|$|R
