Results similar to those previously recorded were obtained with treatment by a light Minerva <b>plaster</b> <b>collar,</b> or laminectomy, but the best results, 73 % sustained improvement, were obtained in 65 cases treated from an anterior approach, by Cloward's operation. Of 48 patients showing sustained improvement, 38 returned to, and remained at work. Cloward's operation was first undertaken at the beginning of the 10 year period, and was increasingly adopted as a primary procedure. It became evident that benefit from any treatment in cases with symptoms of long duration was likely to be limited, and the best results were in cases with less than a year's history who had Cloward's operation (86 % sustained improvement).
