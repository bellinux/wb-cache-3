40|$|A 4 x 4 bit {{parallel}} pipelined multiplier {{has been}} designed using the RSFQ technology. Simulations show that the circuit operates at a maximum frequency of 20 GHz (a minimum period of 50 ps) and has a latency delay of 671 ps. Circuit Design The multiplier circuit is a combinational circuit that implements partial product accumulation method. The multiplication of X (x 3 x 2 x 1 x 0) and Y (y 3 y 2 y 1 y 0) {{is shown in figure}} 1. Each of the ANDed terms is a partial product. The resulting product is obtained by adding the columns of partial products, propagating the carries from the right to the left. The partial product accumulation process is performed using <b>partial</b> <b>carry</b> lookahead method {{in order to reduce the}} propagation delay while maintaining the productivity.

40|$|A carry-free {{subtractive}} division {{algorithm is}} proposed in this paper. In the conventional subtractive divider, adders are used to find both quotient bit and <b>partial</b> remainder. <b>Carries</b> are usually generated in the addition operation, and it may take time to finish the operation, therefore, the carry propagation delay usually is a bottleneck of the conventional subtractive divider. In this paper, a carry-free scheme is proposed by using signed bit representation to represent both quotient and partial remainder. During the arithmetic operation, a special technique is used to decide the quotient bit, and the new partial remainder can be found further by a table lookup-like method. The signed bit format of the quotient can be converted by on-the-fly conversion to the binary representation. Based on this algorithm a 32 -b/ 32 -b divider is designed and implemented, and the simulation shows that the divider works well.

40|$|Many a {{concrete}} theorem of abstract algebra admits a short and elegant {{proof by contradiction}} but with Zorn's Lemma (ZL). A few of these theorems have recently turned out to follow in a direct and elementary way from the Principle of Open Induction distinguished by Raoult.

40|$|Partial {{connections}} are (singular) differential systems generalizing classical connections on principal bundles, yielding analogous decompositions for manifolds with nonfree group actions. Connection forms are interpreted as maps determining {{projections of the}} tangent bundle onto the partial connection; this approach eliminates many of the complications arising from the presence of isotropy. A connection form taking values in the dual of the Lie algebra is smooth even at singular points of the action, while analogs of the classical algebra-valued connection form are necessarily discontinuous at such points. The curvature of a partial connection form can be defined under mild technical hypotheses; the interpretation of curvature {{as a measure of}} the lack of involutivity of the (<b>partial)</b> connection <b>carries</b> over to this general setting.

We propose a probabilistic numerical algorithm based on dynamic programming, regression Monte Carlo methods, and stochastic filtering theory to compute the value function.
