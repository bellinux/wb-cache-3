This {{process can be}} used to study, for instance, the growth of a thin film, including calcium phosphate mineralization at the air-liquid interface, etching or cleaning of a sample. By in situ ellipsometry measurements it is possible to determine fundamental process parameters, such as, growth or etch rates, [...] variation of optical properties with time. In situ ellipsometry measurements require a number of additional considerations: The sample spot is usually not as easily accessible as for ex situ measurements outside the <b>process</b> <b>chamber.</b> Therefore, the mechanical setup has to be adjusted, which can include additional optical elements (mirrors, prisms, or lenses) for redirecting or focusing the light beam. Because the environmental conditions during the process can be harsh, the sensitive optical elements of the ellipsometry setup must be separated from the hot zone. In the simplest case this is done by optical view ports, though strain induced birefringence of the (glass-) windows has {{to be taken into account}} or minimized. Furthermore, the samples can be at elevated temperatures, which implies different optical properties compared to samples at room temperature. Despite all these problems, in situ ellipsometry becomes more and more important as process control technique for [...] thin film deposition and modification tools. In situ ellipsometers can be of single-wavelength or spectroscopic type. Spectroscopic in situ ellipsometers use multichannel detectors, for instance CCD detectors, which measure the ellipsometric parameters for all wavelengths in the studied spectral range simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|Sputtering {{may also}} be {{performed}} by remote generation of a high density plasma. The plasma is generated in a side chamber opening into the main <b>process</b> <b>chamber,</b> containing the target and the substrate to be coated. As the plasma is generated remotely, and not from the target itself (as in conventional magnetron sputtering), the ion current to the target is independent of the voltage applied to the target.|$|E
5000|$|The discs pass, {{one at a}} time, {{into the}} metaliser, a small chamber at {{approximately}} 10−3 Torr (130 mPa) vacuum. The process is called 'sputtering'. The metaliser contains a metal [...] "target" [...] — almost always an alloy of (mostly) aluminium and small amounts of other metals. There is a load-lock system (similar to an airlock) so the <b>process</b> <b>chamber</b> can be kept at high vacuum as the discs are exchanged. When the disc is rotated into the processing position by a swivel arm in the vacuum chamber, a small dose of argon gas is injected into the <b>process</b> <b>chamber</b> and a 700 volt DC electric current at up to 20 kW {{is applied to the}} target. This produces a plasma from the target, and the plasma vapor is deposited onto the disc; it is an anode - cathode transfer. The metal coats the data side of the disc (upper surface), covering the pit and lands. This metal layer is the reflective surface which can be seen on the reverse (non label side) of a CD. This thin layer of metal is subject to corrosion from various contaminants and so is protected by a thin layer of lacquer.|$|E

A federal grand jury indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury; Chambers admitted to the same offense but, as a cooperating government witness, was never charged. Although Hiss's indictment stemmed from the alleged espionage, he could not be tried for that crime because the statute of limitations had expired. After a mistrial due to a hung jury, Hiss was tried a second time. In January 1950, he was found guilty on both counts of perjury and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years. Hiss maintained his innocence until his death.|$|R

Cluster tools are machines where a number of <b>process</b> <b>chambers</b> are attached to a main frame containing a transport robot. In contrast to traditional single process tools it is possible to load cluster tools with more than one lot, even with lots from different products. As a consequence, the cycle time of a lot depends considerably on the lot type that is processed in parallel. Thus, the complexity of production planning and shop floor control is increased. The exact cycle time can usually only be assessed by simulation. To avoid time-consuming simulation runs we present several approaches on how to approximate the tool cycle time of lots...|$|R

A plasma etcher produces a plasma from a process gas, typically oxygen or a fluorine-bearing gas, using a high frequency electric field, typically 13.56 MHz. A silicon wafer is placed in the plasma etcher, and the air is evacuated from the <b>process</b> <b>chamber</b> using a system of vacuum pumps. Then a process gas is introduced at low pressure, and is excited into a plasma through dielectric breakdown.|$|E
50|$|The {{samples to}} be {{processed}} are contained in experiment cartridges, the SCAs, that consist of a leak-tight tube, crucible, sensors for process control, sample probe and cartridge foot (i.e. the mechanical and electrical interface to the <b>process</b> <b>chamber).</b> The MSL safety concept requires that experiment samples containing toxic compounds are contained in SCAs that support the detection of potential leaks. The volume between the experiment sample and the cartridge tube is filled with a pre-defined quantity of krypton, allowing leak detection by mass spectrometry.

The processing chamber provides an accurately controlled processing environment and measurement of microgravity levels. It can house several different Furnace Inserts. During the first batch of experiments the Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) is installed. Another furnace, the Solidification and Quenching Furnace (SQF) is already produced and waiting on ground for future operations. The FI can be moved with a dedicated drive mechanism, to process each sample according to requirements from the scientists. Processing normally takes place under vacuum.|$|E

50|$|Compared to 193i SADP, EUV SADP cost is {{dominated}} by the EUV tool exposure, while the 193i SAQP cost difference is from the added depositions and etches. The processing cost and yield loss at a lithographic tool is expected to be highest in the whole integrated process flow due to the need to move the wafer to specific locations at high speed. EUV further suffers from the shot noise limit, which forces the dose to increase going for successive nodes. On the other hand, depositions and etches process entire wafers at once, without the need for wafer stage motion in the <b>process</b> <b>chamber.</b> In fact, multiple layers may be added under the resist layer for anti-reflection or etch hard-mask purposes, just for conventional single exposure.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{monatomic}} {{oxygen plasma}} {{is created by}} exposing oxygen gas at a low pressure (O2) to high power radio waves, which ionise it. This process is done under vacuum {{in order to create}} a plasma. As the plasma is formed, many free radicals are created which could damage the wafer. Newer, smaller circuitry is increasingly susceptible to these particles. Originally, plasma was generated in the <b>process</b> <b>chamber,</b> but as the need to get rid of free radicals has increased, many machines now use a downstream plasma configuration, where plasma is formed remotely and the desired particles are channeled to the wafer. This allows electrically charged particles time to recombine before they reach the wafer surface, and prevents damage to the wafer surface.|$|E

30|$|The case is {{that the}} ambient in {{technological}} vessels such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) chambers is usually not as pure as in specially refined ones designed for surface studies. There are many sources of surface contaminants in the <b>process</b> <b>chambers</b> including materials of wafer heaters or evaporators of elements as well as foreign substances used for epitaxy and doping. In addition, owing to technological reasons, the temperature treatments applicable for device fabrication following the standard processes such as CMOS often cannot be as aggressive as those used for surface preparation in the basic experiments. Moreover, the commercially available technological equipment sometimes does not realize the wishful annealing of Si wafers at the temperature of ~ 1200 °C even if the early device-formation stage allows one to heat the wafer to such a high temperature. Nevertheless, the technologist should always be convinced that the entirely deoxidized and atomically clean Si surface is reliably and reproducibly obtained.|$|R

50|$|Advanced {{silicon etching}} (ASE) {{is a deep}} {{reactive}} ion etching (DRIE) technique to rapidly etch deep and high aspect ratio structures in silicon.ASE was pioneered by Surface Technology Systems Plc. (STS) in 1994 in the UK. STS has continued to develop this process with even greater etch rates while maintaining side wall roughness and selectivity.STS developed the switched process originally invented by Dr. Larmer at Bosch, Stuttgart.ASE consists in combining the fast etch rates achieved in an isotropic Si etch (usually making use of an SF6 plasma) with a deposition or passivation process (usually utilising a C4F8 plasma condensation process) by alternating the two process steps. This approach achieves the fastest etch rates while maintaining the ability to etch anisotropically, typically vertically in Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) applications.The ASE HRM is an evolution of the previous generations of ICP design, now incorporating a decoupled plasma source (patent pending). This decoupled source generates very high density plasma which is allowed to diffuse into a separate <b>process</b> <b>chamber.</b> Through careful chamber design, the excess ions that are detrimental to process control are reduced, leaving a uniform distribution of fluorine free-radicals at a higher density than that available from the conventional ICP sources. The higher fluorine free-radical density facilitates increased etch rates, typically over three times the etch rates achieved with the original Bosch process. Also, {{as a result of}} the reduction in the effect of localised depletion of these species, improved uniformity for many applications can be achieved.|$|E
