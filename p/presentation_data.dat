50|$|An {{unexpected}} {{result was}} that the real estate experts were convinced that the appraisers were determined to arrive at just compensation and the fair market value of development rights. The real estate appraiser used {{all of the information}} received from the experts and ultimately reduced this information into one appraisal report. The report included a before value, the real estate appraised value, an after value that was the pure farm appraisal (appraised as if the development rights were secured by the county) and then ultimately {{the difference between the two}} resulted in the value of the development rights. During the <b>presentation,</b> <b>data</b> showed that the potato blossoms in June on farms in Northern Massachusetts and in the Connecticut River Valley were the same size as those in Suffolk and further that they were picking strawberries at the same time. This information was gathered through physical inspection of the comparable farm properties in New York and adjacent states.|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} presentation system base is described. It offers mechanisms, tools, and ready-made {{parts for}} building user interfaces. A general user interface model underlies the base, {{organized around the}} concept of a presentation: a visible text or graphic for conveying information. Te base and model emphasize domain independence and style independence, to apply to the widest possible range of interfaces. The primitive presentation system model treats the interface as a system of processes maintaining a semantic relation between an application data base and a <b>presentation</b> <b>data</b> base, the symbolic screen description containing presentations. A presenter continually updates the <b>presentation</b> <b>data</b> base from the application data base. The user manipulates presentations with a presentation editor. A recognizer translates the user's presentation manipulation into application data base commands. The primitive presentation system can be extended to model more complex systems by attaching additional presentation systems. In order to illustrate the model's generality and descriptive capabilities, extended model structures for several existing user interfaces are discussed. The base provides support for building the application and <b>presentation</b> <b>data</b> bases, linked together into a single, uniform network, including descriptions of classes of objects as we as the objects themselves. The base provides an initial <b>presentation</b> <b>data</b> base network graphics to continually display it, and editing functions. A variety of tools and mechanisms help create and control presenters and recognizers. To demonstrate the base's utility, three interfaces to an operating system were constructed, embodying different styles: icons, menu, and graphical annotation...|$|E

40|$|I'm {{going to}} take you on a short stream-of-consciousness tour through a few of the most common and {{sometimes}} downright amusing problems that I see in my work as a <b>data</b> <b>presentation</b> consultant. This article is the second of a five-part series on the fundamentals of effective <b>data</b> <b>presentation.</b> If you produce reports that present data or manage people who do, these articles will offer you practical and clear advice. To make meaningful judgments about <b>data</b> <b>presentation</b> practices that don't work, we must start with clear principles about the purpose of <b>data</b> <b>presentation</b> and what identifies it when it does work. It really all boils down to one thing: communication. Any <b>presentation</b> of <b>data</b> that you prepare—whether in the form of tables or graphs or in some combination like a dashboard—is only successful to the degree that it communicates to your target audience what you intend for it to communicate. Did your message get through? Was the data understood, accurately and efficiently? It's all about the data. As the renowned expert in the visual display of information, Edward Tufte, so simply yet eloquently put it: "Above all else show the data. " Having established communication as the desired outcome, any <b>data</b> <b>presentation</b> practice that doesn't communicate effectively is a problem. Now let's start ou...|$|R

40|$|As web {{information}} systems tend to mature {{it has become}} increasingly important to have an engineered design of such systems. Hera is a design methodology that supports the development of web {{information systems}}. It is a model-driven method that distinguishes four steps: data retrieval (1), application model generation (2), application model instance generation (3), and <b>presentation</b> <b>data</b> generation (4). Data retrieval (1) populates the domain ontology (i. e. conceptual model) with data. In the application model generation (2), the navigational aspects of the application are specified in the navigation ontology (i. e. application model). Also, application models need to be adapted for different user/channel profiles. In the third step of the Hera method, i. e. the application model instance generation (3), the application model is populated with the retrieved data. The last step, i. e. the <b>presentation</b> <b>data</b> generation (4), considers the physical aspects of the presentation: the retrieved data wrapped in application logic is translated to different implementation platforms (e. g. HTML, WML, SMIL). Having in mind the advantage of web application interoperability we chose to implement an experimental prototype for the Hera method using RDF(S), the foundation of the Semantic Web...|$|E
