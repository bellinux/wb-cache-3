A total of 128 public accounting firms, which employed Universiti Utara Malaysia’s (UUM) students for the practicum programme were chosen as respondents. The findings reveal that there is no significant difference in recruiters’ attitude towards the desired characteristics. Secondly, written and verbal communication skills in English are the two most important characteristics demanded by recruiters. Attitude and personality traits are also ranked as highly important. Finally, it is found that firms with larger <b>size</b> of <b>professional</b> staff put more emphasis on outside interests and hobbies, accounting grade point average and the first five minutes of the interview. The findings help to conclude that all of the listed characteristics are important for entering the job market, regardless of the firms’ <b>professional</b> staff <b>size.</b> It can be said that accounting firms seek these characteristics while recruiting. Excellent English communication skills, personality and balance in both academic and co-curriculum activities are vital in ensuring that the graduates’ ability to enter the job market.

30|$|Among {{vocabulary}} <b>professionals,</b> vocabulary <b>size</b> or {{breadth of}} vocabulary {{has been proposed}} {{to be a strong}} candidate for constructing lexical competence. Said differently, the more TL words learners know, the higher lexical competence they have. Size of vocabulary has been found to play an essential role in TL reading. As Laufer ([1997]) puts it, based on previous research, “lexis was found to be the best predictor of success in reading, better than syntax or general reading ability” (p. 31). In addition to reading ability, Meara ([1996]) suggests that vocabulary size may also be a reliable predictor of other areas, saying that “All other things being equal, learners with big vocabularies are more proficient {{in a wide range of}} language skills than learners with small vocabularies” (p. 37). He goes on to argue that we now have an ample amount of evidence suggesting that “vocabulary skills make a significant contribution to almost all aspects of L 2 proficiency” (p. 37). The findings of a more recent study by Zareva et al. ([2005]) lend support to Meara in that some aspects of lexical competence (e.g., breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge) correlate with the proficiency of L 2 learners.|$|R
