50|$|In 1947, British {{zoologist}} Hugh B.

50|$|This novel {{battles with}} diverse {{situations}} including ethnic conflicts and birds. Both {{of these issues}} are given equal importance and veracity by the writer. Reflecting the writer's activities as a keen bird watcher, the <b>pied</b> <b>kingfishers,</b> hawks, eagle-owls, blue-faced malkohas, paradise flycatchers, hornbills, brown-headed barbets, hanging parrots, rose-ringed parakeets, lapwings are among the many birds mentioned in this novel. The plot of the novel centers around Captain Wasantha Ratnayake and a woman named Kamala Velaithan, {{who is a member}} of the LTTE Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), venturing through a dense and luscious Wilpattu forest in northern Sri Lanka. Kamala Velaithan volunteers to offer help to the Sri Lanka Army regarding the provision of some useful information. Kemala is handed over to Wasantha, who picks her up to take her in for questioning. Meanwhile, on the way to their destination, an ambush by an LTTE gang results in their driver and an Army lady dying in a hail of bullets. The two survivors, Kamala and Wasantha are forced into a mutually co-operative situation which later broadens and deepens to the extent that they find it hard to operate without each other. The novel focuses on the relationship which grows between these two people, who, at their first encounter with one another, were enemies. Together, they survive poachers, elephants and the extreme dangers of the jungle. These intense experiences, which force them into mutual co-operation, eventually evolve into an unexpected love affair. The story depicts them spending about 12 days together, each chapter of the novel intertwining with the others in unique forms of complementarity which serve to provide the novel with a richness of style in the progress and development of its plot. After they reach Colombo Army Headquarters, Kamala reveals to Wasantha that she had lied to him and that they are, in fact heading into a trap. But it was too late. The ending is tragic and the lovers end up being separated one from another. However, the film, though based on the novel, has a different ending.|$|R

25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that individuals provide more help to closer relatives. This phenomenon is known as kin discrimination. In their meta-analysis, researchers compiled data on kin selection as mediated by genetic relatedness in 18 species, including the western bluebird, <b>pied</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> Australian magpie, and dwarf mongoose. They found that different species exhibited varying degrees of kin discrimination, with the largest frequencies occurring {{among those who have}} the most to gain from cooperative interactions.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 143 species of fish, amphibians, birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been seen}} in the park and the number is expected to go up to 200 once the project is completed.

Crows, mynahs, blue rock pigeons and water paddybirds walk on the sand near the waterbodies. Non-poisonous snakes, soft and hard shell turtles, painted frogs and green pond frogs can also be seen in the park. The restoration has also improved the quality of water, which according to Central Pollution Control Board norms, is suitable for propagation of wildlife.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is {{the only}} member of the genus Ceryle.

A more recent suggestion is that the <b>pied</b> <b>kingfisher</b> and the American green kingfishers are derived from an Old World species, with the <b>pied</b> <b>kingfisher</b> or its ancestor losing the metallic colouration afterwards.|$|E
