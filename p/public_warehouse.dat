Although the Latin term {{is often used to}} refer to granaries, Roman horrea were used to store many other types of consumables; the giant Horrea Galbae in Rome were used not only to store grain but also olive oil, wine, foodstuffs, {{clothing}} and even marble. By the end of the imperial period, the city of Rome had nearly 300 horrea to supply its demands.

Mason formed a partnership with David Ross (1827–1908) a Scottish-born Fellow of the Institute of British Architects who was already resident. There now followed numerous projects and a series of changing partnerships. The one with Ross was dissolved early in 1863. Of numerous small commissions the Dunedin <b>Public</b> <b>Warehouse,</b> for William Dalrymple, now 386 Princes Street, is a more substantial example. A three story building in brick it has a vigorously modelled street front with emphatic quoining used to define the edges and apertures of the facade. Those around the windows rise to form round-topped columns. There are echoes here of the fenestration of the second Government House but the relative simplicity and strength of the Dunedin building shows the designer his own master again and possessed of a corresponding new confidence.|$|E

The amount of storage space available in the public horrea can be judged by the fact that when the emperor Septimius Severus died in 211 AD, he is said to have left the city's horrea stocked with enough food to supply Rome's million-strong population for seven years. Smaller (though similar) horrea were a standard feature of Roman towns, cities and forts throughout the empire; well-preserved examples of military horrea have been excavated on Hadrian's Wall in England, notably at the forts of Housesteads, Corbridge and South Shields.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the economic viability of the use of warehouse receipts for the storage of wheat and corn, based on the analysis of trends in product prices, storage costs in <b>public</b> <b>warehouses</b> and interest rate of loans against warehouse receipts. Agricultural producers are urged to sell grain at the harvest time when the price of agricultural products is usually lowest, mostly because of their needs for financial sources. Instead of selling products, farmers can store them in the <b>public</b> <b>warehouses</b> and use short-time financing by lending against warehouse receipt with usually lowest interest rate. In following months, farmers can sell products at higher price and repay short-term loan. This study showed that strategy of using <b>public</b> <b>warehouses</b> and postponing the sale of grains after harvest is profitable strategy for agricultural producers...|$|R
