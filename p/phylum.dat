5|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the <b>phylum</b> Nemertea is {{monophyletic}} (meaning that the <b>phylum</b> includes all and only descendants of one ancestor that was also a member of the <b>phylum).</b> The synapomorphies (trait shared by an ancestor and all its descendants, but not by other groups) include the eversible proboscis located in the rhynchocoel.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{comprise}} the largest <b>phylum</b> {{in the animal}} kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species.|$|E
5|$|Nemertea {{are named}} after the Greek sea-nymph Nemertes, one of the daughters of Nereus and Doris. Alternative names for the <b>phylum</b> have {{included}} Nemertini, Nemertinea, and Rhynchocoela. The Nemertodermatida are a separate <b>phylum,</b> whose closest relatives {{appear to be the}} Acoela.|$|E
5|$|Some {{researchers}} classify the extinct conulariids as cnidarians, {{while others}} propose that {{they form a}} completely separate <b>phylum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Neocallimastigomycota were earlier {{placed in}} the <b>phylum</b> Chytridomycota. Members of this small <b>phylum</b> are {{anaerobic}} organisms, living in the digestive system of larger herbivorous mammals and in other terrestrial and aquatic environments enriched in cellulose (e.g., domestic waste landfill sites). They lack mitochondria but contain hydrogenosomes of mitochondrial origin. As in the related chrytrids, neocallimastigomycetes form zoospores that are posteriorly uniflagellate or polyflagellate.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} {{claims that the}} {{relationship}} between eukaryotes and the archaeal <b>phylum</b> Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the <b>phylum</b> Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones, order Actiniaria, are {{classified}} in the <b>phylum</b> Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. Rodriguez et al. proposed a new classification for the Actiniaria based on extensive DNA results.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} <b>phylum</b> {{comes from}} Phoronis, {{one of the many}} names of the Ancient Egyptian goddess Isis. Phoronis is also the name of one of the two genera of Phoronids.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} cephalopod, echinoderm, and bivalve genera {{exhibited}} significant diminution after the K–Pg boundary. Most species of brachiopods, a small <b>phylum</b> of marine invertebrates, survived the K–Pg extinction event and diversified {{during the early}} Paleocene.|$|E
5|$|The <b>phylum</b> has two genera, with no {{class or}} order names. Zoologists {{have given the}} larvae, usually called an actinotroch, a {{separate}} genus name from the adults.|$|E
5|$|The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus, H.americanus and Nephrops norvegicus are hosts to {{the three}} known species of the animal <b>phylum</b> Cycliophora; the species on H.gammarus has not been described.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{classification}} is {{a critical}} component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): Domain, Kingdom, <b>Phylum,</b> Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on <b>phylum,</b> class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of <b>phylum</b> or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Corals are marine {{invertebrates}} {{in the class}} Anthozoa of <b>phylum</b> Cnidaria. They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} Anomalocaris, also from the Burgess Shale. Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods are not a single <b>phylum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizae, {{a form of}} mutualist {{symbiosis}} wherein fungal hyphae invade plant root {{cells and}} both species benefit from the resulting increased supply of nutrients. All known Glomeromycota species reproduce asexually. The symbiotic association between the Glomeromycota and plants is ancient, with evidence dating to 400 million years ago. Formerly part of the Zygomycota (commonly known as 'sugar' and 'pin' molds), the Glomeromycota were elevated to <b>phylum</b> status in 2001 and now replace the older <b>phylum</b> Zygomycota. Fungi that {{were placed in the}} Zygomycota are now being reassigned to the Glomeromycota, or the subphyla incertae sedis Mucoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina, the Zoopagomycotina and the Entomophthoromycotina. Some well-known examples of fungi formerly in the Zygomycota include black bread mold (Rhizopus stolonifer), and Pilobolus species, capable of ejecting spores several meters through the air. Medically relevant genera include Mucor, Rhizomucor, and Rhizopus.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine <b>phylum,</b> {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The <b>phylum</b> is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|Rotifers are a <b>phylum</b> of {{microscopic}} but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments. Although the Latin name rotifer means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms {{do not have}} any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and propulsion.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of hagfish in the <b>phylum</b> Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported {{the idea that}} the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group, the Cyclostomata, that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the <b>phylum</b> Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria do {{not have}} a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic {{material}} is typically a single circular bacterial chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The <b>phylum</b> Planctomycetes and candidate <b>phylum</b> Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the <b>phylum.</b> The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} <b>phylum</b> {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the <b>phylum</b> Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores form {{an animal}} <b>phylum</b> {{that is more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals). Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.|$|E
5|$|For a <b>phylum</b> with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the <b>phylum</b> Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, {{single-celled}} microorganisms, initially establish themselves in large vacuolated {{cells of the}} host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The infestation may proceed to the secretory cells of the same organ. The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile animals {{as belonging to}} the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic <b>phylum,</b> from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{has demonstrated that}} the Microsporidia, unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi (living within the tissue of another species). One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to <b>phylum</b> status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{differences}} {{should be regarded as}} pseudo-changes in the genetic code due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is common in mitochondria. In higher plants, it was thought that CGG encoded for tryptophan and not arginine; however, the codon in the processed RNA was discovered to be the UGG codon, consistent with the standard genetic code for tryptophan. Of note, the arthropod mitochondrial genetic code has undergone parallel evolution within a <b>phylum,</b> with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the <b>phylum</b> Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea, and of prokaryotes in general, is a rapidly moving and contentious field. Current classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors. These classifications {{rely heavily on}} the use of the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes to reveal relationships between organisms (molecular phylogenetics). Most of the culturable and well-investigated species of archaea are members of two main phyla, the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Other groups have been tentatively created. For example, the peculiar species Nanoarchaeum equitans, which was discovered in 2003, has been given its own <b>phylum,</b> the Nanoarchaeota. A new <b>phylum</b> Korarchaeota has also been proposed. It contains a small group of unusual thermophilic species that shares features of both of the main phyla, but is most closely related to the Crenarchaeota. Other recently detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups, such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms (ARMAN, comprising Micrarchaeota and Parvarchaeota), which were discovered in 2006 and are some of the smallest organisms known.|$|E
5|$|The foregut of the tammar wallaby {{contains}} {{species of}} bacteria {{belonging to the}} phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the <b>phylum</b> Proteobacteria, species of the family Succinivibrionaceae are the most abundant and a new species named WG–1 was discovered. WG–1 is a capnophilic bacterium. This has important environmental implications as the bacteria produces less methane than others and does not require CO2 to survive. Research suggests that this information {{could be used to}} reduce carbon production in livestock.|$|E
5|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that many factors helped trigger the Cambrian explosion, {{but there is}} no generally accepted consensus about the combination and the Cambrian explosion continues to be an area of controversy and research over why so rapid, why at the <b>phylum</b> level, why so many phyla then and none since, and even if the apparent fossil record is accurate.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this <b>phylum,</b> {{anthozoans}} {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{thorough}} examination of Opabinia in 1975 revealed its unusual features, {{it was thought}} to be unrelated to any known <b>phylum,</b> although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably Anomalocaris, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.|$|E
