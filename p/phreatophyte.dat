50|$|A <b>phreatophyte</b> is a deep-rooted {{plant that}} obtains a {{significant}} portion of the water that it needs from the phreatic zone (zone of saturation) or the capillary fringe above the phreatic zone. Phreatophytes are plants that are supplied with surface water and often have their roots constantly in touch with moisture.

They can usually be found along streams where there is a steady flow of surface or groundwater in areas where the water table is near the surface.|$|E
40|$|<b>Phreatophytes</b> are {{important}} to the overall hydrologic water budget, providing pathways from the uptake of groundwater with its nutrients and chemicals to subsequent discharge to the root zone through hydraulic lift and to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. An analytic mathematical model is developed to model groundwater uptake by individual plants and fields of plant communities and the regional hydrology of communities of fields. This model incorporates new plant functions developed through aid of Wirtinger calculus. Existing methodology for area-sinks is extended to fields of <b>phreatophytes,</b> and Bell polynomials are employed to extend existing numerical methods to calculate regional coefficients for area-sinks. This model is used to develop capture zones for individual <b>phreatophytes</b> and it is shown that the functional form of groundwater uptake impacts capture zone topology, with groundwater being extracted from greater depths when root water uptake is focused about a taproot. While individual plants siphon groundwater from near the phreatic surface, it is shown that communities of <b>phreatophytes</b> may tap groundwater from greater depths and lateral extent as capture zones pass beneath those of upgradient <b>phreatophytes.</b> Thus, biogeochemical pathways moving chemical inputs from aquifer to ecosystems are influenced by both the distribution of groundwater root uptake and the proximity of neighboring <b>phreatophytes.</b> This provides a computational platform to guide hypothesis testing and field instrumentation and interpretation of their data and to understand the function of <b>phreatophytes</b> in water and nutrient uptake across plant to regional scales...|$|R

40|$|Ecohydrology {{has been}} discovered, and embraced, {{as a new}} {{scientific}} discipline throughout the world. Several authors have stressed its importance to the progress of hydrology and ecology. However, {{there appears to be}} a wide range of ideas on which topics ecohydrology should include. We describe the history of ecohydrology and distinguish the different ecohydrologic schools. One of the roots of ecohydrology is based on the dependence of certain plants on groundwater, as was already recognized by Henry Philibert Gaspard Darcy. Oscar Edward Meinzer introduced the term ‘phreatophyte’ (Meinzer, 1923). He defined it as a plant that habitually obtains its water supply from the zone of saturation, either directly or through the capillary fringe. In the first half of the 20 th century plants hydrologists regularly used plants as indicators in groundwater investigations, especially in the semi-arid regions of the U. S. A. Here the relation between vegetation and groundwater availability is obvious. After the first half of the 20 th century hydrogeologists seemed to lose their interest in the use of <b>phreatophytes</b> in groundwater studies, but ecologists continued the study of their habitat requirements (Londo, 1988; Ellenberg, 1991). Recently the interest in <b>phreatophytes</b> in general was revived, following the interest in groundwater dependent ecosystems. In this paper, the ecohydrological schools are reviewed as well as the role of <b>phreatophytes</b> in ecohydrology and in assessment of groundwater dependent ecosystems. Case studies are used to demonstrate the benefits, limitations and complications of using <b>phreatophytes</b> in hydrological studies. Groundwater and particle tracking models, hydrochemistry and remote sensing are used to understand the distribution of plants and the composition of vegetation. These all contribute in understanding biodiversity and the functioning of groundwater dependent wetlands. In addition, <b>phreatophytes</b> may be helpful when designing groundwater models. In stable conditions, they reflect average long term hydrologic conditions, which can be assessed quite easily. It is argued that the well balanced use of ‘soft’ phreatophytic information can be complementary to ‘hard’ groundwater data and analysis techniques. This will result in a better understanding of groundwater dependent ecosystems. status: publishe...|$|R

Since the 1950 ’s, when the aquifer started to be pumped for irrigation, the region has seen steady declines of the groundwater table. These declines have reduced stream flow in the Arkansas and Cimarrron Rivers, and caused a redistribution of riparian <b>phreatophytes.</b> This thesis studies this redistribution of <b>phreatophytes,</b> and develops statistical relationships relating a <b>phreatophyte’s</b> location to depth to groundwater, increase in depth to groundwater, distance from a stream or river, and hydrologic soil group. Remote sensing was used to determine tree locations on predevelopment and post-development aerial photography. These locations were mapped using ArcGIS, and ArcAEM was used to model groundwater flow in six riparian regions taking root uptake into account. It was found that once the depth to groundwater becomes greater than about 3 m, tree population will decrease as depth to water increases. Trees were located within 700 m of the river. Areas with a dense tree population (> 10 % tree cover) occurred where the average depth to water ranged from 0. 24 - 1. 4 m. Areas with moderate tree density (5 - 10 % tree cover) corresponded to an average depth to water ranging from 2. 1 - 19 m. Areas with a low tree density (< 5 % tree cover) corresponded to an average depth to water ranging from 11 - 28 m. It was found that <b>phreatophytes</b> have a high likelihood of growing on hydrologic soil group A and a low likelihood of growing on hydrologic soil group B. The number of trees located on hydrologic soil group D was what would be statistically expected if tree location were independent of soil type.

40|$|Questions: Do the vegetation-specific {{patterns}} in the forelands of river oases of the Taklamakan Desert provide clues to {{the degree to which}} a vegetation type depends on unsaturated soil moisture, brought about by extensive floodings, or phreatic water? Location: Foreland of the Qira oasis on the southern rim of the Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Methods: A vegetation map was prepared using a SPOT satellite image and ground truthing. Measurements of soil water contents were obtained from a flooding experiment and transformed into water potentials. Sum excedance values were calculated as the percentage of days on which different thresholds of soil water potentials were transgressed. Groundwater depth was mapped by drilling 30 groundwater holes and extrapolating the distances to the whole study area. Results: The vegetation was characterized by only six dominant or codominant species: Alhagi sparsifolia, Karelinia caspia, Populus euphratica, Tamarix ramosissima, Calligonum caput-medusae and Phragmites australis. The vegetation patterns encountered lacked any linear features typical of <b>phreatophytes,</b> thus not allowing direct conclusions on the type of the sustaining water sources. Soil water potentials never transgressed a threshold of pF 5 (- 10 MPa) in horizons above the capillary fringe during periods without inundation, thus representing water not accessible for plants. Depth to the groundwater ranged between 2. 3 and 17. 5 m among plots and varied between 1. 7 and 8. 0 m within a plot owing to dune relief. The seven main vegetation types showed distinct niches of groundwater depths, corresponding to the observed concentric arrangement of vegetation types around the oasis. Conclusions: Inundation by flooding and unsaturated soil moisture are irrelevant for the foreland vegetation water supply. Although distances to the groundwater table can reach about 20 m, which is exceptionally large for <b>phreatophytes,</b> groundwater is the only water source for all vegetation types in the oasis foreland. In consequence, successful maintenance of oasis foreland vegetation will crucially depend on providing non-declining ground water tables...|$|R

This pattern varies with climate: herbaceous plants are grazed during greenup periods while the plants are in prereproductive to early reproductive stages, and shrubs are used more in dry seasons. Shrubs are browsed throughout the year, however. Most of a jackrabbit's body water is replaced by foraging water-rich vegetation.

40|$|Key message Despite {{high rates}} of root {{elongation}} during <b>phreatophyte</b> establishment once connection to groundwater has occurred and leaf area develops, seedlings demonstrate limited capacity for root elongation in response to groundwater decline. Abstract In a water-limited environment, rapid root elongation immediately after germination can be critical for a plant to reach deeper water sources such as a water table to avoid water deficit stress. However, once plants have accessed a water table, their continued survival may depend {{on their ability to}} adapt their root distribution to changes in the depth to a water table. In glasshouse experiments using two Banksia species with contrasting water requirements, we investigated (1) the rate of root elongation by young seedlings {{in the presence of a}} shallow water table, and (2) whole plant response to rapid water table decline using older seedlings that had established root contact with a water table. The results of the first experiment agree with the hypothesis that the facultative <b>phreatophyte,</b> B. attenuata, has a faster rate of root elongation than the obligate <b>phreatophyte,</b> B. littoralis. These differences are likely related to the contrasting habitat preferences of the two species. Older seedlings in the second experiment demonstrated a water-saving response to a declining water table, rapidly closing stomata to limit water loss. Additionally, roots did not elongate to follow the water table and plants were quickly disconnected from the saturated zone. For the two phreatophytic Banksia species, the capacity for rapid growth by young seedlings did not translate to an ability for established seedlings to adapt their root distribution to survive rapid water table decline...|$|E

In this study, a simple relationship between the average standard deviation of diurnal groundwater level fluctuations and the daily evapotranspiration over relatively short periods (days or weeks) was developed for estimating groundwater consumption by <b>phreatophytes</b> in arid/semiarid areas.

40|$|Aims We {{investigated}} {{the regulation of}} the water status in three predominant perennial C 3 <b>phreatophytes</b> (Alhagi sparsifolia, Populus euphratica, Tamarix ramosissima) at typical sites of their occurrence at the Southern fringe of the hyperarid Taklamakan Desert (north-west China). Methods In the foreland of the river oasis of Qira (Cele), we determined meteorological variables, plant biomass production, plant water potentials (psi(l)) and the water flux through the plants. We calculated the hydraulic conductance on the flow path from the soil to the leaves (k(SL)) and tested the effects of k(SL) psi(L) and the leaf-to-air difference in the partial pressure of water vapour (Delta w) on stomatal regulation using regression analyses. Important Findings Despite high values of plant water potential {{at the point of}} turgor loss, all plants sustained psi(L) at levels that were high enough to Maintain transpiration throughout the growing season. In A. sparsitolia, stomatal resistance (r(s); related to leaf area or leaf mass) was most closely correlated with k(SL);. whereas in P. euphratica, similar to 70 %, of the variation in r(s) was explained by Delta w. In T. ramosissima, leaf area-related r(s) was significantly correlated with psi(L) and k(SL). The regulation mechanisms are in accordance with the growth patterns and the Occurrence of the species in relation to their distance to the ground water...|$|R
40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is a {{significant}} component {{of the water and}} energy balance in wetlands and riparian zones, yet {{it is also one of}} the most challenging components to estimate. Diurnal water table fluctuations can be used to directly measure groundwater consumption by <b>phreatophytes,</b> which are often important contributors to the total ET in riparian systems. Although such methods are cost effective, significant uncertainties usually exist, and more accurate techniques continue to be developed. In this study we present a new ‘‘Fourier method’’ for calculating daily (and longer) groundwater ET consumption using a moving, multiday sine function to capture robust, diurnal water table fluctuations. The technique is tested and calibrated in Tamarix chinensis and Populus deltoids-dominated riparian areas in the Middle Rio Grande region of New Mexico and in a Phragmites australis-dominated riparian wetland in south-central Nebraska (using independent, energy balance estimates of ET). The results show that—at both field sites—the new Fourier technique performs significantly better than the commonly used White method, regardless of the length of the moving window that is employed. The Fourier method presented here provides a step toward increasing the accuracy of ET estimates from diurnal water table fluctuations. Guidelines are defined for applying the new and improved method in the most accurate fashion, based on groundwater hydrographs and solar radiation data (or theoretical clear-sky estimates) ...|$|R
