40|$|The {{embedded}} class processors {{found in}} commodity <b>palmtop</b> <b>computers</b> continue to become increasingly capable while retaining an energy-efficient footprint. <b>Palmtop</b> <b>computers</b> themselves, including smartphones and tablets, provide a {{small form factor}} system integrating wireless communication and non-volatile storage with these energy-efficient processors. Also, various wireless connectivity functions on mobile devices provide new opportunities in designing more flexible, smarter wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and utilizing the computation power {{in a way we}} could never imagine before. In this dissertation, I present a WSN concept for current and future generation tablet devices. My contributions include developments at the system level, architecture level, and collaborative design between different layers of the system. At the system level, I developed Ocelot, a grid-like computing environment for <b>palmtop</b> <b>computers</b> in place of traditional workstation or server class machines to compute highly parallel light to medium-weight tasks in an energy efficient manner. Additionally, I developed Lynx, a self-organizing wireless sensor network, which is a further step taken in exploiting the potential of <b>palmtop</b> <b>computers.</b> At the architecture level, to increase the storage capacity of future <b>palmtop</b> <b>computers,</b> I explore the use of a new storage class magnetic memory, Racetrack Memory (RM), throughout the memory hierarchy. Thus, I developed FusedCache, a naturally inclusive, dual-level private cache design for RM that provides fast uniform access at one level, and non-uniform access at the next, which allows RM to be effective as close to the processor as an L 1 cache. For higher levels of the memory hierarchy such as the last level cache, I propose a Multilane Racetrack Cache (MRC), an RM last level cache design utilizing lightweight compression combined with independent shifting. MRCs allow cache lines mapped to the same Racetrack structure to be accessed in parallel when compressed, mitigating potential shifting stalls in an RM cache. Finally, leveraging the lightweight compression from MRC and the need for efficient communication in Lynx, I present a cross-level design combining memory-level lightweight compression with network-level packet transfer, together with a technique called Source-Aware Layout Reorganization (SALR) to increase the compressibility of sensor data...|$|R

40|$|The {{portability}} of palmtop computers {{makes them}} an ideal platform to maintain communication between busy physicians and medical information systems. In our academic FHC (Family Health Center) {{we have developed}} software that runs on a <b>palmtop</b> <b>computer</b> allowing access to information in the HIS (Hospital Information System) and our FHC's AAMRS (Automated Ambulatory Medical Record System). The resident physicians who staff the hospital and the FHC are frequently at home or otherwise off-site where terminal access is not available. Using a Hewlett-Packard 95 LX <b>palmtop</b> <b>computer</b> as the base platform, custom software has been developed to access summary data on in-patients and out-patients. Data is downloaded into a database on a <b>palmtop</b> <b>computer</b> memory card. ASCII data from Medical Information Systems (MIS), {{is transformed into a}} database format readable on the palmtop. Our hospital MIS department transmits information daily on our in-patient service (20 - 30 patients). We also download, weekly, a patient summary on all of our active out-patients in our MUMPS-based AAMRS (2500 - 3000 patients). Each morning the resident in the Family Practice program updates his palmtop memory card at a central workstation. Palmtop computers with downloaded databases, can be valuable in care of patients when the physical or on-line chart is not easily accessible.

40|$|Palmtop {{computers}} {{provide a}} possible avenue for the convenient collection of subjective ratings from individuals {{outside of a}} fixed laboratory setting. One disadvantage of these computers is {{the small size of}} their display screens, which may reduce the resolution of responses available as compared with standard display screens. One plausible solution to this problem is to use a scale that expands contingent on an initial response made by the subject, so that the final response is made from a scale with finer resolution. To validate this approach, we compared taste intensity judgments of six sucrose solutions (0. 03, 0. 06, 0. 12, 0. 24, 0. 48, and 0. 96 M), using a labeled magnitude scale either presented in expandable form on a <b>palmtop</b> <b>computer</b> (Palm scale) or in conventional (nonexpandable) form on a standard 17 $ PC monitor (PC scale). Twenty-four subjects rated all six sucrose solutions thrice, using both scale types, the different scales being used on different days of testing. The scales led to very similar taste intensity ratings at all but the lowest concentration, which was rated less intense on the Palm scale. The Palm scale was used with slightly less precision than the PC scale for the weakest solution concentrations. In summary, the responses of the two scales were similar enough to validate the use of the expandable scale on the <b>palmtop</b> <b>computer</b> outside the laboratory setting.
