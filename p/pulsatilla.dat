2500|$|A {{number of}} rare or {{endangered}} species {{can be found}} in Põhja-Kõrvemaa, {{which is one of the}} main reasons behind the area's status as a nature reserve. It is home to large predators such as gray wolf, Eurasian lynx and brown bear. Small populations of European mink endured until the beginning of the 1990s, but are now disappeared, as in most of Estonia. [...] Protected bird species include black stork, golden eagle, capercaillie and common crane. Nineteen species of orchids {{can be found in}} Põhja-Kõrvemaa (for example, Goodyera repens and Platanthera bifolia), among other rare plants growing in the area are <b>Pulsatilla</b> patens, Sparganium angustifolium, Isoetes echinospora and Oxytropis sordida (the only place in Estonia where the plant is found).|$|E
40|$|In East Asian {{traditional}} medicine, <b>Pulsatillae</b> Radix (PR) {{is widely}} used to treat amoebic dysentery and renowned for its anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to confirm evidence regarding the potential therapeutic effect of PR on Crohn’s disease using a system network level based in silico approach. Study {{results showed that the}} compounds in PR are highly connected to Crohn’s disease related pathways, biological processes, and organs, and these findings were confirmed by compound-target network, target-pathway network, and gene ontology analysis. Most compounds in PR have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant effects, and we found that these compounds interact with multiple targets in a synergetic way. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of genes targeted by PR are elevated significantly in immunity-related organ tissues, small intestine, and colon. Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory and repair and immune system enhancing effects of PR might have therapeutic impact on Crohn’s disease...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} new and {{previously}} known data on insufficiently studied fauna of aphids living on flowering plants in Krasnoyarsk region, {{the main part}} of a vast geographical province named Central or Middle Siberia, depending on terminology used by authors of literature sources. From physical geography viewpoint, the surveyed territory belongs to the Yenisey river basin. Aphids are an ecologically and morphologically diverse group of insects included in 11 families of the suborder Aphidinea in insect fauna of Russian Federation and 25 families in the world’s fauna. Geographical location, dates of collection of aphid colonies are presented with identification of species-specific feeding preferences. First found in Siberia were Symydobius nanae, Euceraphis betulae, Cavariella cicutae, C. konoi, Uroleucon (Dactynotus) aeneum, U. giganteum, U. nigrocampalulae, U. trachelii, Aphis agrimoniae, A. coronillae, A. mongolica, A. neothalictri, A. pruni, A. pseudocomosa, A. <b>pulsatillae,</b> A. sambuci, A. (Debilisiphon) umbelliferarum. Collected for the first time from willow were Betacallis comes (normally feeds on birch and alder), B. quadrituberculata (common on birch), colonies of Metopeurum fuscoviride were first found on Achillea millefolium. Aphis craccivora was previously collected from plants of different families, but was never seen on Cruciferae (Capsella bursa­pastoris). Aphis frangulae was concidered to feed exclusively on buckthorn, however, it was found on Chamaenerion angustifolium. Judging on diversity of host species, some aphids may be more important for agriculture than it was previously thought. A general review of Krasnoyarsk Krai aphid fauna is suggested for the first time ever...|$|R
