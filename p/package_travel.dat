40|$|Europe has for a {{long time}} paid the great {{attention}} on the protection of the rights and interests of consumers which is shown in the field of tourism through the development of a series of decrees and laws to strict regulations on the liability of travel business operator in order to achieve the protection on the interests and the rights of the travel consumers. No matter The International Convention about the Travel Contract in Brussels or the European uniform directive on the tourism, all of them have focused on making the liability of travel business operator specific and strict, and its prominent feature is that the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> contract need not only to be responsible for the whole <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> product but also need to be charge of various single tourism services composed of the package tourism products no matter whether it is provided by the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers. The <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers can no longer free themselves from the liability like before with the reason that he is not the providers of the tourism service. So this can be seen as to conduct a comprehensive basis for the protection the rights and interests of tourism consumers and this spirit has been accepted by the EU member states in the following procession to adjust their national laws in accordance with EU directive. With this starting point it gradually forms a relatively complete system of the liability of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers through the ways such as the enactment of tourism law and accordingly added to a large number of lega l norms to adjust the liability of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers in the travel law and civil law. Although the individ ual EU member States develop their national travel laws in different patterns, but their starting point is the same - to provide a legal basis {{for the protection of the}} rights and interests of the travel consumer and constantly improve it. With regards to the level of protection has not been limited to the provided package tourism product itself; it also includes the ultimate goal of the package tour the spiritual enjoyment. Originally it was supported only in the judicial practice and later was incorpor ated into the formal legal provisions by some EU countries; today it has been accepted by more EU member states which expresses the advancement of the entire European region in the protection of the rights and interests of travel consumers and makes its l iability system of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers in the forefront of the world. Therefore, tracing the source of the European region in the first part is for the purpose to find the reasons and methods for China to learn from it well. Many countries and regions in Asia have inser ted the Europe's successful experience and theoretical learning into their own construction of the liability regime of <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers. They are engaged in the practice of the different legislative mode and content of the EU countries according to the characteristics themselves. Japan learning the model of French to develop their own independent travel Basic Law to adjust the liability of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers, China's Taiwan region in accordance with the German model set up a chapter about the travel contract in the civil law to regulate the liability of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers, and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China has also kept the case law model of British. Although they are different in the content and model, but they all find their own suitable patterns with the integration of its own characteristics forming their unique style in the course of learning and drawing on the European advanced theories. The detailed discussion about the construction of the liability system of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers of these Asian countries in the second part is for the purpose of exploring the absorbing process of these Asian countries and then gives rise to the thought: How can China find the appropriate model of their own country to form its liability system of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers in learning and drawing on the European experience. China's tourism industry developed rapidly after the reform and opening-up of 1978, but the problems associa ted with the development of tourism has gradually become apparent in tourism activity, in particular, the issue of the infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of tourists has bee paid attention by a vast number of legislators. Because the relevant laws and regulations in China are very imperfect, China has no travel Basic Law adjusting the liability of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers, and in contract law, the travel contract is still taken as a nameless contract, and it can only be applicable to the genera l principles of Civil Law, Contract Law, and Consumer Protection law which leads to the court often make different decisions under the different legal basis for the same or similar cases about the travel contract and which makes the interests rights of tourists can not be protected reasonably and effectively and seriously impede the healthy development of the tourism industry. Therefore, the third part of the article is mainly from two aspects, theory and practice, to discuss China's current legislative status and shortcomings and the breakthrough of judicial practice for the laws about the liability system of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers. The study on the liability system of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers has {{for a long}} time been a rather weak area in the domestic legal research. It is not coordinate with the booming tourism market of China and is not incompatible with an orderly, sound and legal environment after China enters into the WTO under the international standards. Speeding up the construction of the liability system of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers in China is not only related to the healthy development of the entire tourism industry, but also affects the protection of the rights and interests of the entire consumer groups. So it plays an important role in socio-economic development of China. In all, the advanced theories and models of the Europe, particularly Italy as well as the learning process in various Asian countries has given us a good example. China has developed into a big tourism country, because tourism becomes an integral part of Chinese living, the various relationships causes by tourism have been throughout the whole of society, the tourism legislation should be a social legislation and its adjustment scope is the entire community, rather than a particular industry, therefore, in order to regulate the liability of the <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> organizers, we must firstly establish a sound tourism legislative system in China and at the same time we must also see that China has its own historical and cultural traditions. In such background how to find a model suitable for China is still firstly considered in the tourism legislation. But anyway, the protection of the rights and interests of tourism consumers and the protection of the rights and interests of consumers as a whole is our persistent goal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background People {{travelling}} abroad tend {{to increase}} their use of alcohol and other drugs. In the present study we describe organized party activities in connection with young tourists' drinking, and the differences between young people travelling with and without organized party activities. Methods We conducted ethnographic observations and a cross-sectional survey in Sunny Beach, Bulgaria. Results The behaviour of the guides from two travel agencies strongly promoted heavy drinking, but discouraged illicit drug use. Even after controlling for several potential confounders, young people who travelled with such "party <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> agencies" {{were more likely to}} drink 12 or more units when going out. In univariate analyses, they {{were also more likely to}} get into fights, but were not more likely to seek medical assistance or medical assistance for an accident or an alcohol-related problem. After controlling for confounders, the association between type of travel agency and getting into fights was no longer significant. Short-term consequences of drinking in the holiday resort did not differ between party package travellers and ordinary package travellers. Conclusion There may be a small impact of party package travels on young people's drinking. Strategies could be developed used to minimise the harm associated with both party <b>package</b> <b>travel</b> and other kinds of travel where heavy substance use is likely to occur. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{internet}} has revolutionized <b>travel</b> <b>packaging,</b> {{in terms of}} both <b>travel</b> <b>package</b> development and distribution. Although tour packages are still assembled and sold in the traditional fashion by tour operators, customers who use the web have access not only to assembled tour products, but also to an array of travel-element bundles. These offers take various forms, depending on the approach of the many suppliers and intermediaries who sell directly to customers via the internet. <b>Packaging</b> <b>travel</b> elements benefits suppliers by reducing the price transparency created by the internet, because the prices of those individual travel elements are bundled and therefore difficult for the package buyer to discern. Moreover, with the growth of online communities, suppliers can observe consumers 2 ̆ 7 stated desires for travel and make proposals for <b>travel</b> <b>packages,</b> rather than wait for consumers to search out the packagers. A notable development is consumers 2 ̆ 7 creation of their own packages in real time, based on changes in vendors 2 ̆ 7 inventories and revenue management pricing.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} addressed by the EU Directive on <b>Package</b> <b>Travel</b> (1990) is that of travellers who find themselves stranded in their holiday destination when their tour operator suddenly goes bankrupt. The recent insolvency of Austrian and German tour operators illustrates the relevance of this question. This paper argues that travellers should be protected against the risk of insolvency of tour operators. The paper sets out the reasons for this, the various ways of insolvency protection, and {{the implementation of the}} <b>Package</b> <b>Travel</b> Directive. It then sets out what is secured by the guarantee, the obligations of the organizer and retailer, the cross-border implications, the possibility to choose freely the means of security, guarantee funds, insurance and social security, bonds and guarantees, trusts, and EC implications. It is argued that Member States should provide a higher standard of protection than the minimum standard of the Directive. A traveller should be entitled to compensation not only for immaterial damage but also for pure economic loss, such as the higher costs of an equivalent trip. The paper also argues that refund of prepayments should not be limited to the period before the trip has started. The traveller should also be reimbursed for extra costs incurred if he decides to stay at his destination. Finally, a traveller should be entitled {{to take care of his}} own repatriation, should he wish to do so.
