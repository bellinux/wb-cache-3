5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the top three locks at Woolsthorpe in the 1990s, a 10-mile (16-km) section from the A1 to Redmile will be completed once the bottom four locks of the flight are restored. The rebuilding of locks 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of locks restored to five, and approximately one quarter of the canal has been restored to navigable standard. Much improvement of the towpath has also taken place, and access to it is <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> most of the bridges.|$|E
5|$|In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger {{expedition}}. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, {{an advance}} party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road {{through the woods}} and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.|$|E

5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

5|$|Between 1158–1162, {{a series}} of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm {{resulted}} in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sivas, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship. Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do {{as part of his}} treaty obligations, Manuel decided {{that it was time to}} deal with the Turks once and for all. Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium (Konya). Manuel's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> Iconium.|$|E
5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sukhoi {{developed}} {{an updated version}} of the Su-33; flight trials began in October 2010. This modernised Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy. Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful (132kN, 29,800lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> the time due to funding constraints. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles.|$|E

5|$|Shoot 'em ups are a subgenre of shooter game, in turn a type {{of action}} game. These games are usually viewed from a {{top-down}} or side-view perspective, and players must use ranged weapons to take action at a distance. The player's avatar is typically a vehicle under constant attack. Thus, the player's goal is to shoot as quickly as <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> anything that moves or threatens him. In some games, the player's character can withstand some damage; in others, a single hit will result in his destruction. The main skills required in shoot 'em ups are fast reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns. Some games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and the player has to memorise their patterns to survive. These games belong {{to one of the}} fastest-paced video game genres.|$|E
5|$|There are 22 {{stations}} in the Copenhagen Metro, a driverless rapid transit system serving Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Tårnby in Denmark. Nine of these metro stations are underground, twelve are elevated, and one is street-level. Christianshavn Station offers transfer between the system's two metro lines (M1 and M2), which share track between Vanløse and Christianshavn stations. From Christianshavn, M1 branches south traveling to Vestamager Station, while M2 heads southeast to Lufthavnen Station, which serves Copenhagen Airport. Flintholm, Nørreport and Vanløse stations offer transfer to the S-train, the city's other rapid transit system which the Copenhagen Metro was built to supplement. Transfer from the Copenhagen Metro to regional trains is <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> Lufthavnen, Nørreport and Ørestad stations. The City Circle Line, which is under construction and {{scheduled to open in}} 2019, is planned to have 17 stations, with transfer between the current and new lines at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv stations. The new lines will have a stop at Copenhagen Central Station (København H), the largest train station in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Transfer to the Kolsås-, Røa- and Holmenkoll Line is {{available}} at Majorstuen; transfer to the Lamberseter, Østensjø- and Furuset Line {{is available}} at Tøyen and transfer to the Grorud Line {{is available at}} Carl Berners plass. Transfer to Oslo Central Station, which serves all trains in Eastern Norway, is available at Jernbanetorget. Most west-bound trains can also be reached at Nationaltheatret, and trains along the Gjøvik line {{can be reached at}} Grefsen Station, that is close, but not adjacent, to Storo. The Oslo Tramway can be reached from several stations. In the city centre, transfer to all lines is <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> Jernbanetorget; all lines but no. 12 can also be reached at either Stortinget or Nationaltheatret. Lines 11, 12 and 19 all terminate at Majorstuen; lines 17 and 18 run via Forskningsparken; lines 11, 12 and 13 can be reached at Storo; and line 17 runs past Carl Berners plass.|$|E

5|$|When fielding, Barnes {{stationed}} {{himself as}} close to the bat as <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> either forward short-leg or point. The report of the tour in the 1949 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, stated that Barnes's fielding was as important a factor as his batting in The Invincibles success: Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler running up, but equally important {{was the fact that the}} knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction. The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not <b>possible</b> <b>at</b> the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{recovery}} in A Storm of Swords (2000), Tyrion finds {{that he has}} lost most of his nose, and a returned Tywin has assumed the position of Hand himself. Tyrion is appointed Master of Coin, the treasurer, {{as a reward for}} his successful leadership. After learning of a Tyrell plot to claim Winterfell through marriage to Sansa, Tywin forces Tyrion to marry her instead. Sympathetic to Sansa's situation, Tyrion leaves their marriage unconsummated, despite his father's orders to conceive a child with her as soon as <b>possible.</b> <b>At</b> the celebration of his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Joffrey is poisoned. Cersei promptly accuses Tyrion, who is arrested. His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict. He is heartbroken to find that even Shae has turned against him. In his grief, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, to which Cersei responds by naming the virtually unbeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Oberyn Martell agrees to fight for Tyrion but dies in the attempt. Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon to await his execution. Jaime frees him with the help of Varys, eventually confessing his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha. Furious, Tyrion swears revenge on his family for a lifetime of cruelty and lies to Jaime that he did murder Joffrey. Before escaping the palace, Tyrion goes to confront his father, and finds Shae in Tywin's bed. After strangling her in a rage, Tyrion murders Tywin as well when he speaks ill of Tysha, and flees Westeros.|$|E
