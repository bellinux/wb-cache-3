40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} {{of resistance to}} post-emergence herbicides in Lolium spp. (ryegrass species) has complicated weed management in cereals. Ensuring good pre-emergence control is therefore increasingly important to protect yields. <b>Prosulfocarb</b> is a broad spectrum thiocarbamate herbicide that kills plants by disrupting the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids. This is the first report of resistance to <b>prosulfocarb</b> in Lolium species from farm sites and glasshouse selection. The recurrent selection process with <b>prosulfocarb</b> applied pre-emergence at its maximum labelled rate (4, 000 gai/ha) on a susceptible Lolium multiflorum Lam. population showed that the {{evolution of}} resistance due to repetitive use was possible but slow. Over three generations, it resulted in modicum levels of resistance which were not significant at practical field rates. For the last progeny obtained, {{there was no evidence}} of either cross-resistance or increased sensitivity to an herbicide under-development with a mode of action similar to <b>prosulfocarb</b> (RF 50 = 0. 99, 95 % CI = 0. 77 - 1. 27). Likewise, high and increasing levels of non-target-site based resistance to clodinafop-propargyl did not result in cross-resistance to <b>prosulfocarb.</b> <b>Prosulfocarb</b> exerted low levels of negative cross-resistance on LL 1781, SS 1999, GG 2078 and RR 2088, four different ACCase mutant L. multiflorum sublines (average RF 50 = 0. 67). In order to control susceptible and resistant populations in winter cereals, <b>prosulfocarb</b> was mixed with diflufenican, metribuzin, pyroxasulfone and the formulated mixture {iodosulfuron:mesosulfuron}. Over the 86 mixtures tested, 11 showed a high potential. <b>Prosulfocarb</b> + diflufenican at 2, 400 + 32 gai/ha presented interesting levels of synergism (+ 20 points on average). A non-random survey in 34 farm sites from England showed that most Lolium samples (80 %) were sensitive or only partially resistant to <b>prosulfocarb.</b> However, <b>prosulfocarb</b> efficacy was lower where other herbicides had been used intensively.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRL for the active substance <b>prosulfocarb</b> in fennel. In order to accommodate the intended use of <b>prosulfocarb,</b> the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRL from the limit of quantification 0. 05 mg/kg to proposed MRL 1. 5 mg/kg. The EMS drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA on 24 May 2012. According to EFSA the data are not sufficient to recommend a MRL for fennel since the metabolism of <b>prosulfocarb</b> in primary crops is not adequately addressed.

40|$|Three {{populations of}} {{silky bent grass}} (Apera spica-venti L.) were tested – one that is {{susceptible}} and two that are resistant to sulfonylureas. This study assessed the efficacy of control by different herbicides in a pot experiment and estimated the molecular status of resistance to sulfonylureas in analysed populations {{and its effect on}} the efficacy of different chemical treatments. The three most effective herbicide rotation schemes were: 1) chlorsulfuron + isoproturon, ethametsulfuron + metazachlor + quinmerac, chlorsulfuron + isoproturon; 2) <b>prosulfocarb</b> + diflufenican, ethametsulfuron + quizalofop-p-ethyl, <b>prosulfocarb</b> + diflufenican; 3) diflufenican + flufenacet, quizalofop-p-ethyl, diflufenican + flufenacet. In most cases it was more difficult to destroy 100 % of the resistant population from Modgarby where the majority of plants had no mutation in the als gene. In the resistant population from Babin there were significantly more individuals with mutation in the als gene, therefore exhibiting target-site resistance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBarrage fishponds may {{represent}} a significant surface water area in some French regions. Knowledge on their effect on water resources is therefore necessary {{for the development of}} appropriate water quality management plans at the regional scale. Although there is much information on the nutrient removal capacity of these water bodies, little {{attention has been paid to}} other agricultural contaminants such as pesticides. The present paper reports the results of a 1 -year field monitoring of pesticide concentrations and water flows measured upstream and downstream from a fishpond in North East France to evaluate its capacity in reducing pesticide loads. Among the 42 active substances that had been applied on the fishpond's catchment, seven pesticides (five herbicides, two fungicides) were studied. The highest concentration in the inflow to the pond was 26. 5 mu g/L (MCPA), while the highest concentration in pond outflow was 0. 54 mu g/L (<b>prosulfocarb).</b> Removal rates of dissolved pesticides in the fishpond ranged from 0 - 8 % (<b>prosulfocarb)</b> to 100 % (clopyralid). Although not primarily designed for the treatment of diffuse sources of pesticides, the studied fishpond had the potential to do so...|$|E
40|$|SYD 11720 H is a new, {{selective}} herbicide developed by Syngenta agro for grass weed and dicot control in winter cereals. It is formulated as suspoemulsion with 604, 5 g active ingredient per liter and contains the active ingredients <b>Prosulfocarb</b> (600 g/L) and Pyroxsulam (4, 5 g/L), {{as well as}} the safener Cloquintocet-mexyl (4, 5 g/L). SYD applied 11720 H with a rate of 4. 0 L/ha in combination with an additive in order to stabilize the efficacy under adverse conditions. The essential innovation of SYD 11720 H is the combination of a primarily soil-active (<b>Prosulfocarb)</b> and leaf-active (Pyroxsulam) active ingredient. This allows a longer application window or a previous application regardless of weather conditions. The product has no carry over limitations and allows the full flexibility in recropping. The major benefit which is of particular importance is the good efficacy against winter annual grass weeds and dicotyledonous species. The registration is requested for the post-emergence application use in autumn in winter wheat, winter rye, and winter triticale from the 1 -leaf growth stage (BBCH 11) to beginning of tillering (BBCH 21) of the crop...|$|E
40|$|Alopecurus myosuroides and Apera spica-venti are {{the most}} {{important}} grass weeds in German cereal cropping systems. Both species show increasing resistance problems with herbicide resistant biotypes in many regions. In many cases, non target-site resistance (TSR) mechanism can be detected. In these biotypes resistance is assumingly based on non target-site-mechanisms (NTSR) and an enhanced metabolism might be responsible in the first place. Resistance in A. spica-venti biotypes can also be found against pre-emergence herbicides like diflufenican and pendimethalin. However, untill now no resistance in A. spica-venti against the active ingredients flurtamone, flufenacet and <b>prosulfocarb</b> could be detected. A. myosuroides biotypes also frequently show NTSR mechanisms. Resistance patterns are variable and predictions about the efficacy of one herbicide cannot be made based on the knowledge of the effects of another ingredient even within the same mode of action group. The resistance patterns of different A. myosuroides biotypes and crosses indicate a complex, polygenetic control of NTSR mechanisms...|$|E

Dominant species of weed flora in Sidi El Aidi site were: Bromus rigidus, Lolium rigidum and Avena sterilis. Dominant species of weed flora in Ouled Said site were: Avena sterilis, Centaurea diluta and Papaver rhoeas. The obtained results showed that “Pyroxsulam” and “Mesosulfuron Sodium + Iodosulfuron sodium” gavethe best efficacy on rip gut brome. <b>Prosulfocarb</b> provided excellent control of ryegrass but no effect on ripgut brome or wild oat. Broadleaf herbicides provided moderate to good control. “Mesosulfuron Sodium +Iodosulfuron sodium” need to be completed with an broadleaf herbicide in case centaurea diluta is present. “Pyroxsulam” need to be tank mixed with a broadleaf herbicide to widen its weeds spectrum.

40|$|Outdoor aquatic ditch mesocosms {{were treated}} {{with a range of}} {{pesticides}} to simulate various spray drift rates resulting from a typical crop protection program used in the cultivation of potatoes in The Netherlands. The main experimental aims of the present study were to provide information on the fate and ecological effects of drift of the pesticides into surface water and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} drift-reduction measures in mitigating risks. The pesticides selected and the dosage, frequency, and timing of application were based on normal agricultural practices in the potato crop. Applications of <b>prosulfocarb,</b> metribuzin (both herbicides), lambda-cyhalothrin (insecticide), chlorothalonil, and fluazinam (both fungicides) were made in the sequence typical of the spray calendar for potatoes. A total of 15 treatments with the various compounds were made by spray application to the water surface at 0. 2 %, 1 %, and 5 % of the recommended label rates. Chemical fate and effects on ecosystem function and structure (phytoplankton, zooplankton, chlorophyll-¿, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, breakdown of plant litter) were investigated. To interpret the observed effects, treatment concentrations were also expressed in toxic units (TU), which describe the relative toxicity of the compounds with standard toxicity test organisms (Daphnia and algae). After treatment, each compound disappeared from the water phase within 2 d, with the exception of <b>prosulfocarb,</b> for which 50 % dissipation time (DT 50) values ranged between 6 and 7 d. At the 5 % treatment level, an exposure peak of 0. 9 TUalgae was observed, which resulted in short-term responses of pH, oxygen, and phytoplankton. At the 5 % treatment level, exposure concentrations also exceeded 0. 1 TUDaphnia, and this resulted in long-term effects on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, some of which did not fully recover by the end of the present study. At the 1 % treatment level, only slight transient effects were observed on a limited number of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate species and on pH. At the 0. 2 % level, no consistent treatment-related effects were observed. Most of the observed effects were consistent with the results from higher-tier and mesocosm studies with the individual compounds. Multi and repeated stress played a small role within the applied pesticide package, because of rapid dissipation of most substances and the absence of many simultaneous applications. This suggests that risk assessments based on the individual compounds would in this case have been sufficiently protective for their uses in a crop protection progra...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{regulatory}} {{risk assessment}} of pesticides requires {{the assessment of}} exposure of aquatic ecosystems in small surface waters adjacent to agricultural fields. This exposure is predicted using simulation models, for which an important input parameter is the degradation rate in water. In regulatory dossiers, the decline rate in water from outdoor mesocosms is often available, but this rate encompasses more processes than degradation. Therefore, a procedure was designed for estimating the degradation rate in water that was suitable for mesocosm studies with limited datasets, e. g. datasets lacking site-specific sorption coefficients and relevant sediment properties. The procedure, based upon inverse modelling with TOXSWA, has been tested on a dataset for <b>prosulfocarb</b> in stagnant ditches. Results A degradation half-life in the ditch water of 2. 9 days (20 °C) was found. This short half-life was to a significant extent accounted for by biodegradation rather than hydrolysis or photolysis. This half-life was considerably shorter than the half-life in the water layer of two laboratory water–sediment system experiments. Conclusion The estimation procedure resulted in a unique half-life for the degradation rate in water. Such outdoor mesocosm studies seem to be better suited to assessing the degradation rate in water in ditches than the conventional water–sediment studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Two {{separate}} greenhouse {{experiments were}} conducted in the greenhouse facilities of the Iranian Plant Protection Research Institute, Tehran, to study the efficacy of some herbicides to control of resistant and susceptible P. minor and P. paradoxa biotypes. In each experiment, resistant and susceptible biotypes were treated separately by 19 herbicide treatments. Treatments included 10 ACCase inhibitors, 6 Acetolactate Synthase (ALS) inhibitors, <b>prosulfocarb,</b> flamprop-M-isopropyl, isoproturon plus diflufenican and a non-sprayed control. To evaluate the effects of treatments, different characteristics including percent damage based on EWRC scores at 15 and 30 days after spraying, percentage of survived plants after spraying relative to before spraying, and percentage of dry weight and wet weight of individual plants relative to control were studied. Results showed that the susceptible biotypes of P. minor were best controlled by clodinafop propargyl and pinoxaden at 450 ml/ha while pinoxaden at 450 ml/ha and cycloxydim were best options {{for control of the}} resistant biotype. Among ALS inhibitors, iodosulfuron plus mesosulfuron could control susceptible and resistant biotypes of P. minor very effectively and semi-satisfactory, respectively. Iodosulfuron plus mesosulfuron and sulfosulfuron plus metsulfuron could remarkably reduce the wet weight of individual plants compared to control so that the plants were not damaging any more. Among other herbicides, isoproturon plus diflufenican could control the susceptible and resistant biotypes semi-satisfactory and very effectively, respectively.

40|$|Smooth barley is {{an annual}} weed species that is infesting crops and {{pastures}} in South Australia. Complicating control options {{is the presence}} of herbicide-resistant biotypes. A field trial was conducted to identify alternative herbicides for the management of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in field pea. Preplant (PP) soil applications of pyroxasulfone; <b>prosulfocarb</b> plus S-metolachlor; dimethenamid-P; propyzamide; trifluralin alone or with triallate or with diuron; or imazamox applied POST were evaluated for their effectiveness and crop safety. Propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, or imazamox applied POST provided a high level of smooth barley control, did not cause any crop injury, and increased field pea grain or forage yield compared with the nontreated. Furthermore, propyzamide or pyroxasulfone reduced panicle density and seed production in smooth barley, whereas the effectiveness of POST imazamox varied over the two seasons. Dimethenamid-P reduced the impact of smooth barley on field pea yield, but cause stunting, and was less effective than propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, and imazamox in reducing smooth barley seed production. Negative relationship between field pea yield and smooth barley panicle density indicated that smooth barley is highly competitive in field pea crops and can cause large yield losses. The results of this investigation suggest that propyzamide or pyroxasulfone applied PP and imazamox applied POST could be used effectively in the field for the management of ACCase-inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in South Australia.

40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} occurrence {{of resistance to}} Apera spica-venti, especially to ALS inhibitors and partially to ACCase inhibitors has been reported for the new federal states, too. The dominance of winter wheat and winter rape in crop rotations associated with a unilateral application of herbicides has increased the selection pressure. In order to counter further spread of herbicide resistance, the right choice of the mode of action of the herbicide or herbicide combination and highly efficacious herbicide treatments are the methods of choice, of course {{in addition to the}} agronomic aspects, such as sowing date and crop rotation. The research determined how and to what extent dicotyledonous weeds are associated with loose silkybentgrass. Based on the results, single herbicides or herbicide tank mixes were tested to achieve the expected level of control. As a result, treatments which have achieved very high level of control against A. spica-venti and the most common dicotyledonous weeds can be recommended. A total of 191 trial sites have been included in the analysis of A. spica-venti. Using the HRAC-classification of herbicides used, groups were formed which might contribute to solving problems specifically linked to the detected resistance situation of the site. In the autumn, flufenacet-containing herbicides, such as Malibu (flufenacet, pendimethalin), Herold SC (flufenacet, diflufenican), Bacara Forte (flufenacet, flurtamone, diflufenican), Carmina 640 (chlortoluron, diflufenican) and Fenikan (isoproturon, diflufenican) demonstrated high efficiency against A. spica-venti. Combinations of herbicides with the HRAC classification of N and E provide further opportunities for the implementation of anti-resistance management strategies, such as Sumimax + Ciral (flumioxazin + metsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron) or Boxer (<b>prosulfocarb)</b> + Diflanil 500 SC (diflufenican) or Beflex (beflubutamid). When applied in spring, significant differences concerning the efficiency and robustness of sulfonylureas for the control of A. spica-venti were observed...|$|E
40|$|In autumn 2009 and 2010, {{black-grass}} {{samples from}} different regions in Germany were sown {{into a field}} near Münster. The sandy soil of the field was free of black-grass seeds until the sowing date. The aim of the trial was to compare the fitness and resistance value of different black-grass populations under outdoor conditions. Particularly the impact of pre-emergence herbicides was of interest. Different efficiency factors of CADOU SC® (flufenacet) against the tested black-grass populations were observed. The disparities {{in the level of}} control were even greater under the use of STOMP AQUA® (pendimethalin), BOXER® (<b>prosulfocarb)</b> and ARELON TOP® (isoproturon). A hundred percent control of all black-grass populations in both seasons was only achieved by the use of KERB FLO® (propyzamide). It was visible that the black-grass populations that were difficult to control had a powerful constitution, even better than that of those populations {{that turned out to be}} highly susceptible to the herbicide treatments. The fall results in both seasons of the experiment (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011) were consistent. This was also confirmed for the efficacy results for foliar herbicides in spring. Subject to field history, there was a wide range in sensitivity to the tested herbicides. Black-grass populations from coastal regions were poorly controlled by FOCUS ULTRA® (cycloxydim) or SELECT 240 EC® (clethodim) + PARA SOMMER® (paraffin oil), but were highly susceptible to MOTIVELL® (nicosulfuron). Contrary results were observed with reference to the blackgrass populations from the inland. These populations were derived from fields where the crop rotation contains of 66 % cereals and 33 % maize. The populations from the coast were sampled in crop rotations dominated by cereals or cereals followed by oil seed rape.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{characterisation}} study of water samples collected from an Advanced Water Recycling Plant (AWRP) operating in Perth, Western Australia are presented. The AWRP treats secondary wastewater by ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis (RO) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) to produce recycled water for groundwater replenishment. Water samples collected after RO and UV treatment were characterised by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, using an established protocol for target screening. The target screening of 291 compounds detected a total of 13 chemicals in post-RO and post-UV water, including 2 corrosion inhibitors (4 + 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole, benzotriazole), 3 pesticides (metolachlor, propiconazol, <b>prosulfocarb),</b> 3 pharmaceuticals (lamotrigin, metformin, tramadol), 1 personal care product (galaxalidone), 3 artificial sweeteners (saccharin, acesulfame, sucralose) and 1 flame retardant (triethyl phosphate). The corrosion inhibitors benzotriazole and 4 + 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole, and the pharmaceutical metformin were detected in hundreds of ng L− 1, while the other compounds were present in low ng L− 1 concentrations. Analysis of UV treated water samples showed that UV treatment also helped to reduced UV degradable compounds such as the corrosion inhibitors (> 50 % removal), triethyl phosphate (~ 50 % removal) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (~ 95 % removal). Overall, the detection of 13 chemicals through target screening analyses did {{not account for the}} residual dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in post RO water, the majority of which is still an intriguing unknown. However, the target screening did show that there were no obvious “known” anthropogenic contaminants contributing to the majority of the DOC in post-RO and post-UV treated water. Calculated risk quotients (RQ) for all detected chemicals in UV treated water were 2 to 6 order of magnitude below 1, implying an high degree of safety associated with human consumption of recycled water. Overall the chemicals screening provided further evidence of the overall safety of the use of recycled wastewater treated by RO and UV as a potable water source...|$|E
