25|$|By mid-century, Henderson County {{had become}} a major {{producer}} of tobacco, much of which was exported to Great Britain.

25|$|Information: Preparations {{for seeing}} {{in the new year}} were {{originally}} undertaken to greet the toshigami, or deity of the incoming year. These begin on December 13, when the house was given a thorough cleaning; the date is usually nearer {{the end of the month}} now. The house is then decorated in the traditional fashion: A sacred rope of straw (shimenawa) with dangling white paper strips (shide) is hung over the front door to prevent evil spirits from entering and to show the presence of the toshigami. It is also customary to place kadomatsu, an arrangement of tree sprigs, beside the entrance way. A special altar, known as toshidana ("year shelf"), is <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> <b>with</b> kagamimochi (flat, round rice cakes), sake (rice wine), persimmons, and other foods in honor of the toshigami. A fair is traditionally held in late December at shrines, temples or in local neighborhoods. This is in preparation for the new year holidays. Decorations and sundry goods are sold at the fair. Originally these year-end fairs provided opportunities for farmers, fisherfolk and mountain dwellers to exchange goods and buy clothes and other necessities for the coming year.|$|E
25|$|Fishing was {{the most}} {{important}} industry from the 14th century until the mid-19th. Salt water fishing began before 1320, when too fine nets were seized by City authorities, but expanded greatly from the 16th century. Fisher Street was named after the fishing community there. From about 1775 welled and dry smacks were used, mostly as cod boats, and rigged as gaff cutters. Fishermen sailed as far as Iceland in the summer. They served Billingsgate Fish Market in the City of London, and moored in Barking Pool. Scymgeour Hewett, born on 7 December 1797, founded the Short Blue Fleet (England's biggest fishing fleet) based in Barking, and using smacks out of Barking and east coast ports. Around 1870 this fleet changed to gaff ketches that stayed out at sea for months, using ice for preservation of fish produced by flooding local fields in winter. Fleeting involved fish being ferried from fishing smacks to gaff cutters by little wooden ferry-boats. The rowers had to stand as the boats were <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> <b>with</b> fish boxes. Rowers refused to wear their bulky cork lifejackets because it slowed down their rowing. At first the fast 50-foot gaff cutters with great booms projecting beyond the sterns raced the fish to port to get the best prices.|$|E

500|$|By late autumn, {{the death}} toll in London and the suburbs began to slow until, in February 1666, it was {{considered}} safe enough for the King and his entourage {{to come back to}} the city. With the return of the monarch, others began to return: The gentry returned in their carriages accompanied by carts <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> <b>with</b> their belongings. The judges moved back from Windsor to sit in Westminster Hall, although Parliament, which had been prorogued in April 1665, did not reconvene until September 1666. Trade recommenced and businesses and workshops opened up. London was the goal of a new wave of people who flocked to the city in expectation of making their fortunes. Writing at the end of March 1666, Lord Clarendon, the Lord Chancellor, stated [...] "...the streets were as full, the Exchange as much crowded, the people in all places as numerous as they had ever been seen...".|$|E
500|$|Before {{founding}} Beecher's, Dammeier {{had never}} made cheese, and had little direct knowledge of the cheese making business. His self-described [...] "passion" [...] for cheese began during his childhood in Tacoma, Washington, where his family always kept a cheese board <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> <b>with</b> local cheeses. Raised in a family business involving printing and food manufacturing, he decided to open a cheese business after his family sold the printing company. He named it for his great-grandfather, Beecher McKenzie. Dammeier also owns the Seattle-based specialty grocer Pasta & Co. and is a major investor in Pyramid Breweries, Inc.; {{other members of his}} family have stakes in Pyramid as well. Dammeier also founded Bennett's Pure Food Bistro on nearby Mercer Island, and the food truck Maximus/Minimus, both of which carry many dishes prepared with Beecher's products. In 2003, Dammeier opened Beecher's in Seattle's Pike Place Market when a rare large retail location became available in the market after the nursery Molbak's closed its Market location and moved to its current Woodinville, Washington property.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} an embarrassment for Trueblood and the university. In his memoirs, Handy {{recalled}} being summoned to Trueblood's office: [...] "His desk was <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> <b>with</b> letters...and clippings...from around the country...and {{he also had}} a copy of the McCutcheon cartoon. (He) was taking all of this as ridicule, although I had publicized the story with sincere enthusiasm for a new advance in education of which I felt the University of Michigan should be proud." [...] The faculty voted unanimously to suspend Handy for a year for [...] "publishing false and injurious statements affecting the character of the work of one of the Professors." [...] In addition to the suspension, Handy was charged as a [...] "faker" [...] in the press: Henry J. Handy, the student-correspondent at the University of Michigan who sent a sensational story to the Chicago newspapers, relating how Professor Thomas C. Trueblood had a class in love-making, has been suspended for one year and the story has been branded as a 'fake.' [...] Handy based the story on an incident that occurred during the rehearsal of a drama, when Professor Trueblood showed one of the students how to kneel to propose.|$|E

London, thought I to myself, is the city of the fairies.|$|R

2500|$|On September 7, 1876, General Crook ordered Captain Anson Mills to take 150 troopers, riding {{upon the}} command’s best horses, to the northernmost mining {{camps in the}} Black Hills to obtain food and {{supplies}} for his starving troops and hurry back. [...] Accompanying Mills’s command were civilian scouts Grouard and Crawford, and newspaper correspondents Strahorn and Davenport. Lieutenant John W. Bubb, the expedition commissary, had charge of sixteen packers and sixty-one pack mules. Mills’s command left camp that same evening in [...] "a thick mist," [...] guided by Grouard, Crook’s chief scout. About 1:00a.m. the command stopped to rest, then moved on at daylight. On the afternoon of September 8, 1876, Grouard and Crawford and were ranging a mile or more in advance of Mills, and Grouard spied Indian hunters and ponies <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> <b>with</b> game. Further investigation revealed the presence Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse’s village of Oglalas, Minneconjous, Brules and Cheyennes, numbering thirty-seven lodges and about 260 people, of whom 40 to 100 were warriors. The village lay compactly in a broad depression of ravines encircled by the spires of Slim Buttes, [...] limestone and clay summits capped with pine trees near present-day Reva, South Dakota. [...] Grouard and Crawford also found about 400 ponies grazing near the village. Tipis were clustered about the various ravines and streams that crisscrossed the natural amphitheater and smoke from the tipi fires hanging low beneath the misty clouds obscured the lodges. The village slept soundly in the cold rain.|$|E
2500|$|Ritson's {{mental health}} was deteriorating {{as he worked}} on the book. [...] He himself wrote of being [...] "in continu'd state of il-health, and low spirits". [...] This {{particularly}} manifested itself in the virulence of his many attacks on the poor scholarship of Percy, Pinkerton and Warton in a lengthy [...] "Dissertation on Romance and Minstrelsy" [...] with which he prefaced the work. [...] In this Dissertation he addresses the problem of the origins of the romance form. [...] He rejects not just Warton's theory that romance was a literary form that came to Europe from the Islamic world, but also the contentions of others that it came from the Celtic countries or from Scandinavia, concluding that its true point of origin was France. [...] He proceeds first to a consideration {{of the state of the}} English language in the Middle Ages, which he thinks was at first too rude and undeveloped for French poets to have thought of borrowing romances from across the Channel, and then to a chronological survey of the English romances. [...] Finally he considers the social history of the minstrel. [...] This was a subject of long-standing dispute between himself and Thomas Percy, Percy holding that the minstrels enjoyed a high status in mediaeval society, while Ritson produced much evidence, here and elsewhere, to show that they were considered a low and vagabondish class. [...] Such men, he thought, could not be the authors of the romances, which were rather the work of learned men. [...] The Dissertation is <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> <b>with</b> relevant information, much of it new, but his theses are not always coherently developed, so that at times, as Monica Santini says, [...] "the only thread of his argument is the continuous harrying of Warton".|$|E

50|$|Khasab has an {{interesting}} trading position, which hinges on {{its proximity to}} Iran. Iranians export sheep and goats into the local port, from where the animals are dispatched to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in trucks. On their return trip to the Islamic Republic, the sailors load their boats up with electronic goods and American cigarettes, arriving in Khasab after sunrise and leave before sunset to conform with Omani immigration laws. Since the trading is illegal under Iranian law, they must avoid the Islamic Republic's coastguard {{as well as all}} other shipping in the busy waters of the Strait of Hormuz. The crossing is hazardous since the vessels, <b>piled</b> <b>high</b> either <b>with</b> livestock or with numerous boxes must avoid the path of the scores of oil-tankers which pass through the Strait in a transverse direction daily. Recent increases of United States sanctions against Iran have increased the amount of smuggling done through Khasab.|$|R
