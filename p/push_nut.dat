50|$|A <b>push</b> <b>nut</b> {{resembles a}} toothed washer, {{commonly}} fabricated in metal. These are installed by pressing onto {{the end of}} a grooved shaft, until the nut's inner teeth snap into the groove. The use of push nuts avoids the cost of threading a nut onto the end of the shaft during the manufacturing process. However, a <b>push</b> <b>nut</b> once installed is normally destroyed in the removal process, which potentially prevents removal of mechanisms captive to the shaft for replacement or servicing without having the correct replacement <b>push</b> <b>nut</b> on hand—if the part number and specification for the <b>push</b> <b>nut</b> is even known—and possibly also requires a specialized pressing tool to conform with manufacturer's guidance.|$|E
50|$|A Persian drill is a drill {{which is}} turned by <b>pushing</b> a <b>nut</b> {{back and forth}} along a spirally grooved drill holder. It was {{formerly}} used for delicate operations such as jewellery making and dentistry. A ratcheting screwdriver with a 'spiral ratchet' mechanism {{may be used as}} a Persian drill.|$|R

50|$|Thrust-collar type MJTs {{are used}} in {{applications}} where {{it is difficult to}} use threaded tensioners, such as on rolling mills where the joint would typically need to be tightened by crane wrenching. Jackbolts <b>push</b> a threadless <b>nut</b> against a retainer ring, which is fitted into a groove and transfers the jacking force to the main bolt or stud. Because there are no threads, they can also be used in press column applications, eliminating the problems and hassles associated with large nut threads.|$|R
2500|$|Sanielevici partly rejected, partly nuanced, the {{historical}} definitions {{of race and}} the tenets of scientific racism. Călinescu paraphrases his core idea: [...] "races are affinities of an anthropological kind, reaching beyond the supposedly historical races." [...] Thus, the main criterion available for differentiation and classification of human races was human nutrition. Already in 1903, he argued that Mongols, [...] "the least mixed" [...] people of the [...] "yellow race", were [...] "brachycephalic" [...] because they consumed raw meat, and thus required stronger temporal muscles. In La Vie des mammifères..., Sanielevici postulated that racial clusters had emerged around staple foods, corresponding to regional patterns in the Stone Age diet. In his account, a European megaflood had pushed Dryopithecus out of the canopy, replacing its diet with <b>nuts,</b> <b>pushing</b> it toward bipedalism, and then turning it into modern man. The Romanian author distinguished five basic racial and dietary types, based on the archeological cultures and each created by its own foodstuff: Aurignacian (allium plants, beans), Chellean (nuts), Magdalenian (fish), Mousterian (snails, fruit) and Solutrean (meat, horses). These types corresponded to the environmental divisions, respectively: warm steppe, warm woods, tundra, cool woods, cold steppe.|$|R
5000|$|... 2003 Monkey Nuts 2003 - In {{a protest}} against student debt, McGowan <b>pushed</b> a monkey <b>nut</b> along the road for several miles using only his nose to move the nut, {{starting}} at Goldsmiths College in South London and ending at Number 10 Downing Street. It took him twelve days to complete his challenge, with him covering about three-quarters of a mile every day. Upon reaching 10 Downing Street, he gave in the nut to Downing street staff, who congratulated him and offered him a cup of tea, and the police security applauded. McGowan also described his journey, saying: [...] "The streets were dirty. There was hair and spit and bird poo. There were unmentionable things." [...] McGowan had to apply for police permission to go up the door of 10 Downing Street. Mark admitted the nut he gave in at the end was not his original - he wore out eleven others and one was stamped on by yobs. Talking to The Sun newspaper, McGowan said: [...] "David Blaine sitting in a plastic box is boring, what I do is much better. It was hard and lonely work... A lot of people treated me shamefully and I felt like giving up. I felt {{a bit like a}} dog down there on the pavement, {{on my hands and knees}} with people laughing and jeering. But I expect Tony Blair will have to declare the nut as a gift. It's probably worth more than my £15,000 student fees debt as a piece of contemporary art." ...|$|R
