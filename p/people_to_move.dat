5|$|Relocation was {{completed}} on July 22, 2008. Some 2007 reports claimed that Chongqing Municipality will encourage an additional fourmillion <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{away from the}} dam to the main urban area of Chongqing by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal genetic {{studies suggest}} that the first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia. The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years. Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> south and east into Canada and beyond.|$|E
5|$|In Sydney, fear of an {{impending}} Japanese invasion caused <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> west; housing {{prices in the}} Eastern Suburbs dropped, while those beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly. The attack also led to {{a significant increase in}} the membership of volunteer defence organisations, and strengthening of defences in Sydney Harbour and Port Newcastle.|$|E

5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was {{ice-free}} because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the nine}} {{surviving}} stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, {{but two of the}} north-west stones are considerably larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would have required the efforts of many <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and erect it.|$|E
5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{sponsored a}} Mexican Repatriation program which was intended <b>to</b> encourage <b>people</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, but thousands, including some U.S. citizens, were deported against their will. Altogether about 400,000 Mexicans were repatriated.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after Giri was {{classified}} a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of Myanmar. Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, {{this was because}} forecasters did not anticipate Giri to strengthen {{as quickly as it}} did. The greatest fear of the residents was the aftermath of the storm. There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta. The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6m (12ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, authorities used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri. According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Cornell {{lobbied for}} the {{establishment}} of the South Parks and Boulevard System. The first bond vote was rejected in 1867, as just a method to provide remote driving grounds for rich citizens and to lure <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away for the benefit of real estate speculators and developers. In 1869, the bills were passed by the legislature, and the South Park Commission was formed with support from Cornell. The future site was primarily under Lake Michigan or abutting the Illinois Central Railroad right of way. In 1892, the formerly trestled railroad was raised on an embankment, along the present west edge of the park. South Park (the present Jackson Park) was slowly developed, and along with the Midway Plaisance and Washington Park, the designs by Frederick Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were focused on lagoons and navigation from the Lake to South Park Way (now King Dr.) and 55th Street, in addition {{to the development of a}} country driving park, horse and buggy paths along the lake, and a water system running north to downtown. By the 1880s, the development included the Kenwood and Bowen communities, and by the 1890s, immigrant neighborhoods were developing. The city limits were expanded from 39th to 130th in 1889, absorbing virtually all of Hyde Park Township (35th to 138th).|$|E
25|$|The many foreclosures and {{the high}} level of {{unemployment}} of the 2000s and early 2010s induced many black <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from Jamaica to the South, as part of the New Great Migration.|$|E

25|$|The Temple {{had little}} luck {{converting}} most midwesterners to communist ideals, even when disguised as religion. Admiring Fidel Castro's 1959 overthrow of Batista in Cuba, Jones traveled to Cuba in 1960 {{to attempt to}} convert poor Cuban black <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to his congregation in Indiana, but the plan failed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, land speculators {{discovered}} Florida, and businessmen such as Henry Plant and Henry Flagler developed railroad systems, which led <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in, {{drawn by the}} weather and local economies. From then on, tourism boomed, fueling a cycle of development that overwhelmed {{a great deal of}} farmland.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times {{has used}} income quintiles to define class. It has {{assigned}} the quintiles from lowest to highest as lower class, lower middle class, middle class, upper middle class, and upper class. These definitions equate class with income, permitting <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from class to class as their income changes.|$|E

25|$|The city {{began to}} expand further south as {{epidemics}} in 1835 and 1870 caused more <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{away from the}} port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913, and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area. By 1930 Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants, including 37,067 Europeans.|$|E
25|$|The early {{settlers}} in Township 7 sustained their lives through farming. The land was ideal for fruit farming and many vineyards began to emerge. The fertile soil and lake climate that were ideal for producing crops is what attracted many <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to the township. There was also {{vast amounts of}} trees {{to be used for}} building homes and other structures. The most common occupations in Lakewood were farming and the building trades.|$|E
25|$|In cities {{during the}} Great Leap, {{there was an}} {{emphasis}} on collective use of public space even for activities that had usually {{taken place in the}} home. For example, entire neighborhoods were required to eat their dinner in public dining halls. Ultimately, the Great Leap Forward proved disastrous, failing to industrialize effectively and causing famine due to labor shortages on farms. In 1962, the government began allowing <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> back to farms.|$|E
50|$|Just as {{with its}} beneficiaries, the trust's money ran low by the 1960s. By 1965, {{residents}} were required <b>to</b> pay rent. <b>People</b> began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{out of the}} Home as the area around Grand Concourse declined.|$|R
50|$|It {{turned out}} that Vilcabamba did {{actually}} have a higher-than-normal percentage of elderly people, but that this was caused by migration patterns: Young <b>people</b> tended <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out of the area, while the elderly moved in.|$|R

25|$|In {{domestic}} affairs the Housing Act of 1919 led to affordable council housing which allowed <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out of decrepit inner-city slums. The slums remained {{for several more}} years, with trams being electrified long before many houses. The Representation of the People Act 1918 gave women householders the vote, {{but it would not}} be until 1928 that full equal suffrage was achieved. Labour displaced the Liberal Party for second place and achieved major success with the 1922 general election.|$|E

The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10–20,000 years. Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> south and east into Canada and beyond.

25|$|Archeological and Indigenous genetic {{evidence}} {{indicate that}} North and South America {{were the last}} continents into which humans migrated. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> gradually across the Bering land bridge (Beringia), from Siberia into northwest North America. At that point, they were blocked by the Laurentide ice sheet that covered most of Canada, confining them to Alaska and the Yukon for thousands of years. The exact dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas {{are the subject of}} an ongoing debate.|$|E
