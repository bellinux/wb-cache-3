2500|$|The {{information}} gathered by a port scan has many legitimate uses including network inventory and the verification {{of the security}} of a network. <b>Port</b> <b>scanning</b> can, however, also be used to compromise security. Many exploits rely upon port scans to find open ports and send specific data patterns in an attempt to trigger a condition known as a buffer overflow. [...] Such behavior can compromise {{the security of a}} network and the computers therein, resulting in the loss or exposure of sensitive information and the ability to do work.|$|E
2500|$|All {{forms of}} <b>port</b> <b>scanning</b> {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that the targeted host is compliant with RFC [...] Although this is the case most of the time, there is still a chance a host might send back strange packets or even generate false positives when the TCP/IP stack of the host is non-RFC-compliant or has been altered. This is especially true for less common scan techniques that are OS-dependent (FIN scanning, for example). The TCP/IP stack fingerprinting method also relies on these types of different network responses from a specific stimulus to guess the type of the operating system the host is running.|$|E

40|$|The {{vulnerabilities}} {{existing in}} the Internet such as insecure network architectures are exploited to gain un-authorized {{access to a}} network. A launch of an attack usually begins with a deliberate process of analyzing potential victims. This attack is called scan attack. The most common scan attack type is called TCP <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack as TCP is a connection oriented protocol. A TCP <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack misuses the process of establishing connection between two hosts for communication (TCP three-way handshake) by a half open sacn type (not completing the connection). The existing TCP <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack detection approaches have many issues such as detection is not done in real-time, no automated mitigation approach is available and many <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> detection approaches are hardware dependent. In this thesis, based on drawbacks of the existing TCP <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> detection approaches, the requirements for a TCP <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack detection and mitigation algorithm are derived and the algorithm is proposed to be developed on an architecture called OrchSec SDN architecture (an orchestrator based SDN architecture). Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm in networking where the data plane (consisting of routers, switches) is separated from the control plane (makes decisions on traffic in the network). The architecture used is called the OrchSec SDN architecture and it separates the monitoring and control functions of the network and uses an orchestrator to coordinate the communication between them. The OrchSec SDN architecture utilizes the network monitoring and SDN control functions and hence is used to develop the TCP <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack detection and mitigation algorithm. Finally, {{the behavior of the}} proposed algorithm is tested and validated. The most important future work would be to extend the algorithm to detect and mitigate all the existing <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack types...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} growth of the {{computer}} system and networks, the mysterious and malicious threats and attacks on the computer systems are also increasing exponentially. There is a need of continuous evaluation of the security of a network and enhancement of the network attack detection system, which will be able to detect different attacks along with the characteristics of the attacks. In previous work, the <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack is considered as precursors to an attack and the target was to provide the mitigation technique for the particular <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack. There have been relatively few empirical studies done for <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> related attacks and those that do exist may no longer reflect the impact of such attacks on the functionalities of the UTM/network device and on the network. To address this lack of knowledge, this experiment is carried out in fully controlled test bed environment wherein a set of varieties of attack can be simulated and impact of attack(s) is analyzed and appropriate mitigation technique is suggested to mitigate the <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attack. The experiment result indicates that the <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> mitigation implementation on UTM helps reducing the load on the UTM device and reduces network congestion effectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental approach {{to determine the}} correlation between <b>port</b> <b>scans</b> and attacks. Discussions in the security community often state that <b>port</b> <b>scans</b> {{should be considered as}} precursors to an attack. However, very few studies have been conducted to quantify the validity of this hypothesis. In this paper, attack data were collected using a test-bed dedicated to monitoring attackers. The data collected consist of <b>port</b> <b>scans,</b> ICMP scans, vulnerability scans, successful attacks and management traffic. Two experiments were performed to validate the hypothesis of linking <b>port</b> <b>scans</b> and vulnerability scans to the number of packets observed per connection. Customized scripts were then developed to filter the collected data and group them on the basis of scans and attacks between a source and destination IP address pair. The correlation of the filtered data groups was assessed. The analyzed data consists of forty-eight days of data collection for two target computers on a heavily utilized subnet. 1...|$|R

30|$|IP {{networks}} are constantly targeted by new techniques of {{denial of service}} attacks (SYN flooding, <b>port</b> <b>scan,</b> UDP flooding, etc), causing service disruption and considerable financial damage. The on-line detection of DoS attacks in the current high-bit rate IP traffic is a big challenge. We propose in this paper an on-line algorithm for <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> detection. It is composed of two complementary parts: First, a probabilistic counting part, where the number of distinct destination ports is estimated by adapting a method called ‘sliding HyperLogLog’ to the context of <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> in IP traffic. Second, a decisional mechanism is performed on the estimated number of destination ports in order to detect in real time any behavior that {{could be related to}} a malicious traffic. This latter part is mainly based on the exponentially weighted moving average algorithm (EWMA) that we adapted to the context of on-line analysis by adding a learning step (supposed without attacks) and improving its update mechanism. The obtained <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> detecting method is tested against real IP traffic containing some attacks. It detects all the <b>port</b> <b>scan</b> attacks within a very short time response (of about 30 s) and without any false positive. The algorithm uses a very small total memory of less than 22 kb and has a very good accuracy on the estimation of the number of destination ports (a relative error of about 3.25 %), which is in agreement with the theoretical bounds provided by the sliding HyperLogLog algorithm.|$|R
