Current antimatter production techniques are reviewed, followed by a description of Dirac's relativistic quantum theory of the vacuum state and corresponding solutions for <b>particle</b> tunneling <b>and</b> reflection from a potential barrier.

The geodesics for test particles in AdS$_ 4 $ and dS$_ 4 $ spacetimes are respectively sinusoidal and hyperbolic sine world lines. The world line for light rays is straight lines as known. In particular, the world lines of test particles are {{not dependent on}} their energy. Spontaneous symmetry breaking of AdS$_ 4 $ spacetime provides a physical explanation for arising of the virtual <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>antiparticle</b> <b>pairs</b> in vacuum. Interestingly, the energy of a pair and the time its particles moving along their geodesics can be related by a relation similar to Heisenberg uncertainty one pertaining quantum vacuum fluctuations.

40|$|Neutrons travel along {{straight}} lines in free space, but only survive for a distance which {{depends on their}} energy. Thus, detecting neutrons in space in principle provides directional and distance information. Apart from secondary neutrons produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the Earth atmosphere, which are the dominant background, direct neutron emission is caused by solar flares, with clear time correlation with X-rays, which can be measured from few tens MeV up to few GeV. There is no detectable astrophysical source up to the PeV scale, when neutrons coming from supernova remnants may reach the Earth before decaying. In addition, ultra high energy neutrons are the most plausible explanation for the measured anisotropy of cosmic-ray showers produced in the atmosphere above $ 10 ^{ 18 }$ eV. From the GeV to the PeV scale, the expected neutron flux is very low and not too different from the antiproton flux, as the same cosmic-ray collisions with the interstellar medium which can produce antiprotons can also produce neutrons and antineutrons. This background flux of cosmic-ray neutrons is very low and {{has not yet been}} detected. Measuring the neutron energy spectrum in space is a very effective way of searching for decays of exotic particles. For example, dark matter could consist of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which may annihilate into final states with <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>antiparticle</b> <b>pairs.</b> Consequently, a number of indirect WIMP searches are being carried on, focusing on positron and antiproton spectra. However, no experiment is presently foreseen to look for "bumps" in the neutron energy spectrum, which is virtually background free. Here we consider the implications of a measurement of the neutron energy spectrum in astronomy and astrophysics and list the interesting energy regions in the search for WIMPs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of a {{relativistic}} Dirac half integer spin free particle tunneling through a rectangular quantum-mechanical barrier. If the energy difference between the barrier <b>and</b> the <b>particle</b> is positive, <b>and</b> the barrier width is large enough, there is proof that the tunneling may be superluminal. For first spinor components of <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>antiparticle</b> states, the tunneling is always superluminal regardless the barrier width. Conversely, the second spinor components of <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>antiparticle</b> states may be either subluminal or superluminal depending on the barrier width. These results derive from studying the tunneling time in terms of phase time. For the first spinor components of <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>antiparticle</b> states, it is always negative while for the second spinor components of <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>antiparticle</b> states, it is always positive, whatever {{the height and width}} of the barrier. In total, the tunneling time always remains positive for particle states while it becomes negative for antiparticle ones. Furthermore, the phase time tends to zero, increasing the potential barrier both for <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>antiparticle</b> states. This agrees with the interpretation of quantum tunneling that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle provides. This study results are innovative with respect to those available in the literature. Moreover, they show that the superluminal behaviour of particles occurs in those processes with high-energy confinement. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
