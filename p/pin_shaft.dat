40|$|In {{this text}} {{one can see}} the process of the {{preliminary}} design to achieve a solution for a high efficiency propelling system for the A boat competing in the Dong solar challenge. Specifically, this document reports the research made to achieve a solution for the mechanical design of this motor from some features given by the foregoing electric design. To achieve this goal, a methodical design will be performed. During this methodical design, 2 different concepts are considered. Almost every component in both concepts is the same, as they are the components which accomplish the main functions of the motor, which is turning electric power into movement. They differ in the bearing disposition and the shafts shape, which will be an important point of discussion. The aim of this report is then choosing between the two concepts according to some requirements, like the shape of the rotor determined by the electric design, and some wishes, like high efficiency, low weight and being easy to attach to the boat. The calculations are made to orientate the discussion about which concept is the best, but they are not definitive to set the final dimensions of the different components. Before being able to discuss which one is better, some calculations need to be made, as they make the difference within the two motors. The bearings’ life is considered a very important point of discussion. After calculating the forces applied on the bearings using the finite element software LISA 7. 7, it is found that in both motors, {{there is at least one}} bearing which life is too short. For this reason, needle bearings are adopted to solve the problem in the motor 1. For the motor 2, this option cannot be adopted so this almost discards this concept as an option. Then the calculations for the connection between the shaft and the rims through the pins are made. The three possible failures of the connection considered are shearing forces on the <b>pin,</b> <b>shaft</b> tear and rim tear. The lowest safety factor found is the one concerning the shearing forces on the pin, so if this connection fails, it will be here. Nevertheless, as this safety factor is big enough, the connection is validated. After that, a first simulation to know the behaviour of the shafts is made. Both shafts are simulated under the same conditions of performance with the Solidworks Simulation Express extension. The two principal matter of discussion are the von Mises stress and the angular displacement of the nodes. The result of the simulation shows that the shaft in the motor 1 is better in both items of discussion, with a safety factor for the stress of 2, 54 and a displacement of 0, 2 mm. Other items considered during the design such as assembly, fabrication and weight don’t turn to be determinant because there is not a big difference between them in the two different concepts. After discussing each requirement and wish, one can see that the motor 1 is better, or at least equal, than the motor 2 in every item discussed. For this reason, the concept chosen for the motor is the motor 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{improvement}} of manufacturing processes to assure product quality {{and reduce the}} amount of raw material and energy is the main objective of many recent researches. Some of them study cross wedge rolling (CWR) as a substitute to hot upsetting in the manufacture of stepped <b>shafts,</b> <b>pins,</b> eccentric <b>shafts</b> and many other mechanical parts. In this process a cylinder is deformed by two wedge tools assembled on plane plates that move tangentially one against the other. The main objective of this work is to study the thermomechanical behaviour of medium carbon steel during hot CWR by means of a numerical analysis. The numerical results will be compared to the microstructure of microalloyed steel samples which were submitted to CWR experimental tests. The results suggested that dynamic recrystallization was present during CWR and that microstructures in the austenitic region were very refined...|$|R

40|$|The Risher Road Waste Unit {{is located}} {{at the base of a}} small bluff (approximately 30 ft high) {{composed}} of sand and gravel. Due to collapse of the face of the bluff a steep slope of colluvium has formed at the base. The area of investigation is located on the slope of colluvium, and is marked by the presence of two pin flags spaced approximately 25 ft apart parallel to the bluff face. In order to investigate the presence of buried metallic material that might indicate waste containers or other wash beneath the colluvial slope a magnetometer survey was conducted in and around the vicinity of the pin flags. The survey consisted of a 5 -ft by 5 -ft square grid node pattern in a 40 -ft by 60 -ft rectangle.

40|$|Abstract. The article {{analyses}} {{the process}} of friction in the needle bearing as {{the function of the}} alterations of geometrical parameters, namely the diameter of the shaft – D, the needle – d and the bearing clearance. The change in the relation between the diameters D and d results in the change of the contact area of the friction pair; in the case of two shafts with parallel axes (the needle of the bearing and the <b>shaft</b> <b>pin)</b> the contact area, if compared with the analogical process in the ball bearing, alters significantly and leads to resistance in motion. There are two types of friction in the needle bearing: the rolling friction and the sliding friction; the analysis of the movement of the bearing elements enabled the estimation {{of the extent to which}} the sliding friction matters in the overall balance of motion resistance. The article also defines the type of wear as the function of initial clearance...|$|R

The process of determining these requirements is also covered, along with a set of best practices for thoughtful design in general. An initial phase of testing is covered as well, from the design of the testing apparatus to the execution of a torsional test on the shaft. With limited data, conclusions are hard to draw with certainty, but initial results seem to indicate that the shaft performs as expected. The intent of this document is to serve {{as an example of the}} level of detail and thoroughness that is expected when designing racecar components. To that end, this document should provide a number of unique examples of how specific problems were modeled and addressed in the design. It should also serve as a template for future documentation of such design efforts. by Jack J. Wanderman. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems of modern production techniques is the achievement of an appropriate quality at minimal costs and accompanied by the production efficiency increase. Therefore, while designing the production process, the technology used should have a considerable influence on the durability and reliability of machine parts to be produced.

The engineer has a range of production techniques to choose for the proper surface layer formation.

40|$|Carburizing {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and wide used thermo-chemical {{treatment}} methods of surface modification of tool steels. It is a process based on carbon diffusive enrichment of the surface material and is applied for elements that are supposed to present higher hardness and wear resistance sustaining core ductility. Typical elements submitted to carburizing process are gears, <b>shafts,</b> <b>pins</b> and bearing elements. In the last years, more and more popular, especially in highly advanced treatment procedures used in the aerospace industry is vacuum carburizing. It is a process based on chemical treatment of the surface in lower pressure, providing much higher uniformity of carburized layer, lower process cost and much lesser negative impact on environment to compare with conventional carburizing methods, as for example gas carburizing in Endo atmosphere. Unfortunately, aerospace industry requires much more detailed description of the phenomena linked to this process method and the literature background shows lack of tests that could confirm fulfilment of all needed requirements and to understand the process itself in much deeper meaning. In the presented paper, authors focused their research on acetylene flow impact on carburized layer characteristic. This {{is one of the}} most crucial parameters concerning homogeneity and uniformity of carburized layer properties.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} External {{fixation}} pins tend to loosen with time, especially from cancellous bone. A coating that releases a bisphosphonate {{has been shown}} to improve the fixation of dental implants in humans. We now tested a bisphosphonate coating on steel pins for external fixation. The primary hypothesis was that coated pins would be better fixed in the diaphysis. Methods 20 patients with medial knee osteoarthritis underwent proximal tibial correction osteotomy with hemicallotasis. They received a pair of pins (Orthofix) in the tibial shaft, one bisphosphonate-coated and one uncoated. Another pair of pins was inserted in the metaphysis, near the joint. This pair was a bisphosphonate-coated pin and an HA-coated pin. All pins were inserted according to a random list. The pins were removed after the osteotomy had healed (8 - 15 weeks), and extraction torque served as the predetermined main outcome variable. Results No pins showed clinical signs of loosening. Removal torque for the <b>shaft</b> <b>pins</b> was 6. 6 Nm (SD 2. 2) for the bisphosphonate and 6. 0 Nm (SD 2. 5) for the uncoated (difference = 0. 5, 95 % CI: - 0. 03 to 1. 3). Removal torque for the metaphyseal pins was 4. 4 Nm (SD 1. 3) for the bisphosphonate-coated and 4. 2 Nm (SD 1. 6) for the HA-coated (difference = 0. 2, 95 % CI: - 0. 5 to 1. 0). Interpretation We could not show any improved cortical fixation, but the metaphyseal findings are striking. In a previous study on 19 patients with a similar layout, HA-coated and uncoated pins were compared. In the metaphysis, all 19 uncoated pins loosened before removal. It was concluded that uncoated pins could not be used in the metaphyseal region. The present results suggest that a bisphosphonate coating enables metaphyseal fixation similar to that of hydroxyapatite coatings, with no difference from uncoated pins in cortical bone...|$|R

This report will explore {{the architecture of the}} current Performance Management System (PMS) for frontline production section in Greenside Colliery, with specials impetus given to the measurement front line time utilization. Guided by existing literature and case studies on Performance Measurement Systems and equipment time losses one was then able to conduct work studies in the erratic underground coal mining sections. This was done with the view of building a factual basis for process flows and root cause identification. Informed by the above the report will give recommendations, on the short comings and suitability of the current PMS, a concise definition of what ìproduction downtimeî and illuminate critical areas of lost production. From the study of best practices the PMS was found to be suited generally for frontline coal management. However {{more needs to be done}} in improving the accuracy of the data recorded and its communication. A definition was fabricated for Lost Production Time based on the existence of a critical value chain. Based on this definition the critical areas of lost production time were identified and summarized in diagrammatic form that will be used in the data capturing of the new PMS. The study found that Continuous Miner operational stoppages and Feeder Breaker breakdowns present the best opportunities of improvement and recommends that work studies be done to improve the operational stoppages and equipment redesign consideration be made to reduce shearing <b>pin</b> and torque <b>shaft</b> damage.

The crank and <b>shaft</b> <b>pins</b> of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|R
