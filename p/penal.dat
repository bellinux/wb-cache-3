5|$|Ross Island <b>Penal</b> Colony was the {{inspiration}} for Rura Penthe, the <b>penal</b> colony island in the 1954 Disney film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{effort to}} establish a <b>penal</b> colony was by Archibald Blair who found the remoteness of the island as ideal for such a colony. But his initiative failed to go beyond 1796 as malaria prevented it. The First Indian War of Indian Independence in 1857 rekindled {{the interest of the}} British Administration in India {{to establish a}} <b>penal</b> colony in the Andaman Islands for political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the <b>penal</b> colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the <b>penal</b> colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E
5|$|Enact cabinet {{orders in}} order to execute the {{provisions}} of this Constitution and of the law. However, it cannot include <b>penal</b> provisions in such cabinet orders unless authorized by such law.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of its {{establishment}} in 1858 till it was disbanded on 7 October 1945, the <b>penal</b> colony was administered by 24 Chief Commissioners. This deserted fortress is now a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|On {{other issues}} {{he was more}} liberal, such as {{supporting}} moves to abolish <b>penal</b> laws against dissenting Christians. He also opposed efforts to bar those found guilty of adultery from remarriage.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Justice was {{in charge}} of {{judicial}} and <b>penal</b> processes, but had no supervisory role over the Censorate or the Grand Court of Revision.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Penal</b> Code {{states the}} {{elements}} and penalties of common criminal offences such as homicide, theft and cheating, and also sets out general principles of criminal law in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Under the Shari'a <b>penal</b> {{code that}} applies to Muslims in twelve {{northern}} states, offences such as alcohol consumption, homosexuality, infidelity and theft carry harsh sentences, including amputation, lashing, stoning and long prison terms.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{incident}} that occurred was {{the assassination of}} Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India who had visited the islands on an inspection tour. He had visited the Ross Island <b>penal</b> settlement. The attack on Lord Mayo {{was carried out by}} Sher Ali, one of the convicts of the <b>penal</b> colony who was on a sick leave; the assassination was carried out while Mayo was returning after a pleasant trip to Mount Harriet on the evening of 8 February 1872. Another political prisoner who suffered the longest period of 47 years of incarceration was Musai Singh who was released for good behavior in July 1907 {{on the occasion of the}} 50th anniversary of India's First War of Independence in 1857.|$|E
5|$|According to her account, {{all of the}} {{children}} died, as did her husband, within a short time of each other. She was imprisoned for larceny in Wexford in December 1864, when she was only about 15 years old, and came to England in 1867. In February 1868, she was sentenced to four years of <b>penal</b> servitude for committing larceny in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Although {{previously}} favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's {{wars and}} religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, {{in which he}} purported to suspend all <b>penal</b> laws against Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the Third Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{was given}} an order to {{relocate}} to the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from Baghdad {{was the beginning of}} a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually to the <b>penal</b> colony of Acre, Palestine (now in Israel).|$|E
5|$|By 1908 {{there were}} calls for another Royal Commission into Western Australia's <b>penal</b> system. Truth {{newspaper}} repeatedly criticised Fremantle Prison between 1903 and 1910, {{with much of}} the blame placed on the comptroller general and superintendent. Allegations included that new offenders still were not separated from older ones, that regulations were systemically broken, and that prisoners were not paid for the work they did.|$|E
5|$|For {{fighting}} the Germans {{as part of}} the <b>penal</b> battalions, Pechersky was promoted to the rank of captain and received a medal for bravery. He was eventually discharged after a serious foot injury. In a hospital in Moscow, he was introduced to his future wife, Olga Kotova.|$|E
5|$|From 1865 to 1867, British {{authorities}} {{rounded up}} {{supporters of the}} Irish Republican Brotherhood, or Fenians, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to Western Australia. In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship Gazelle and settled in Boston. Later that year, pardons were issued {{to many of the}} imprisoned Fenians, after which only eight militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's <b>penal</b> system.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, {{there were}} 12,197 convicts {{who had been}} {{exported}} from British India. Some of the convicts who were freed were engaged in agriculture, {{and those who were}} forced to do service were given monetary compensation of US$25 per month. However, even then escape from the <b>penal</b> colony was impossible and any escapee who tried was killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was {{ignored by the}} state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools, rather than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with {{the appointment of a}} superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a Labor government with members interested in <b>penal</b> reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912. It shares with Katingal Special Security Unit in New South Wales the record for brevity of use of a permanent Australian <b>penal</b> structure.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Reagan {{signed the}} Mulford Act, which {{repealed}} a law allowing public carrying of loaded firearms (becoming California <b>Penal</b> Code 12031 and 171(c)). The bill, which {{was named after}} Republican assemblyman Don Mulford, garnered national attention after the Black Panthers marched bearing arms upon the California State Capitol to protest it.|$|E
5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's <b>penal</b> system in the Zone. One major point of contention was that it did not allow for trial by jury for American citizens arrested there. They raised questions as {{to the quality of the}} judges in the territory and other issues.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala, a CIA-backed {{military}} coup ousted the left-wing President Jacobo Árbenz in 1954. The post-Arbenz government—a military junta headed by Carlos Castillo Armas—repealed a progressive land reform law, returned nationalized property {{belonging to the}} United Fruit Company, set up a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, and decreed a Preventive <b>Penal</b> Law Against Communism {{at the request of}} the United States.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, {{attempted}} suicide, abetment of suicide, and abetment {{of attempted}} suicide are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians {{are unable to}} claim a defence under section 88 of the <b>Penal</b> Code since they intended to cause the patients' deaths. However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E
5|$|In its 332nd article, {{the current}} <b>penal</b> code punishes infractions with a prison {{sentence}} {{of up to}} two years. If the sentence is shorter than 240days, there is a formula for converting it into a fine. If the offense is directed towards regional symbols, the penalties are halved.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's primary {{interest}} lay {{in improving}} the state's mental and <b>penal</b> institutions. These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years {{by the end of}} his term, he was disappointed that he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Tunisia, Marita Covarrubias {{arranges}} for {{the release}} of Alex Krycek from a <b>penal</b> colony. Upon returning to the United States, the two meet with the wheelchair-bound Smoking Man, who tells them that an alien craft has crashed in Oregon. The Smoking Man sees the crash as a chance to rebuild the Project, but claims that finding it will be complicated.|$|E
5|$|Pearson was a Liberal and {{was elected}} at the 1847 general {{election}} as a Member of Parliament for Lambeth. His campaign {{was prompted by}} a desire to promote his <b>penal</b> reform campaign in parliament. He resigned his seat in 1850 thorough the mechanism of accepting the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Stroud began {{serving a}} 17-year term at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary on December 19, 1942, and became inmate #594. In 1943, he was {{assessed}} by psychiatrist Romney M. Ritchey, who diagnosed him as a psychopath, but with an I.Q. of 134. Stripped of his birds and equipment, he wrote {{a history of the}} <b>penal</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Suicide is a {{significant}} non-medical {{cause of death in}} Singapore. Although attempted suicide is an offence punishable with jail under section 309 of the <b>Penal</b> Code, Singapore still sees many cases of suicide each year. Between 2000 and 2004, 1,700 people killed themselves, and in 2007 suicides amounted to about 2.2% of all deaths. For every successful suicide attempt, there were seven unsuccessful ones.|$|E
5|$|The Ely and Littleport riots {{occurred}} between 22 and 24May 1816. At the Special Commission assizes, held at Ely between 17 and 22June 1816, twenty-four rioters were condemned. Nineteen had their sentences variously commuted from <b>penal</b> {{transportation for life}} to twelve-months imprisonment; the remaining five were executed on 28June 1816.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Penal</b> {{system of}} Japan (矯正施設) is {{operated}} by the Ministry of Justice. It {{is part of the}} criminal justice system, and is intended to resocialize, reform, and rehabilitate offenders. The ministry's Correctional Bureau administers the adult prison system, the juvenile correctional system, and three of the women's guidance homes, while the Rehabilitation Bureau operates the probation and the parole systems.|$|E
5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense. The old Model <b>Penal</b> Code test was replaced by a test that shifts the burden of proof regarding a defendant's sanity from the prosecution to the defendant. Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} focuses {{of sociology}} include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality and deviance. As all spheres {{of human activity}} {{are affected by the}} interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as health, medical, economy, military and <b>penal</b> institutions, the Internet, education, social capital and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Their {{interaction}} {{system is}} principally sociological: {{the presence of}} the <b>Penal</b> Code article on slandering the state system inevitably results in sending a certain percentage of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination. Thus, it is not psychiatry itself that is punitive, but the totalitarian state uses psychiatry for punitive purposes with ease.|$|E
5|$|Turkey's {{judicial}} {{system has been}} wholly integrated with the system of continental Europe. For instance, the Turkish Civil Code has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the Swiss Civil Code and Code of Obligations, and the German Commercial Code. The Administrative Code bears similarities with its French counterpart, and the <b>Penal</b> Code with its Italian counterpart.|$|E
5|$|After World War II {{ended in}} 1945, Bruno Tesch and Karl Weinbacher of Tesch & Stabenow were tried in a British {{military}} court and executed for knowingly providing Zyklon B to the SS {{for use on}} humans. Gerhard Peters, who served as principal operating officer of Degesch and Heli and also held posts in the Nazi government, served two years eight months in prison as an accessory before being released due to amendments to the <b>penal</b> code.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1926, Filitti {{was one of}} {{the authors}} of a legal history overview, Contribuții la istoria justiției penale în Principatele române ("Contributions to the History of <b>Penal</b> Justice in the Romanian Principalities"). By means of Iorga's {{academic}} journal Revista Istorică, he also publicized his discovery of a 17th-century Romanian glossary, which emissaries of the Holy See used on their missions to the Danubian Principalities. He returned in 1927 with a work tracing the very history of the Legislative Council: Originea și menirea Consiliului Legislativ ("The Origin and Purpose of the Legislative Council").|$|E
