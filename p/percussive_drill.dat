2500|$|A jackhammer, {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a portable <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> powered by compressed air. It is used to drill rock and break up concrete pavement, among other applications. It jabs with its bit, not rotating it. A jackhammer operates by driving an internal hammer up and down. The hammer is first driven down to strike the back of the bit and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle. The bit usually recovers from the stroke by means of a spring. The earliest form of a jackhammer, a [...] "percussion drill" [...] was invented in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior and}} fragmentation response of rock materials is investigated in this work. In particular, Bohus granite is selected with application to <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> It {{is well known}} that rock behaves totally different in compression and tension and dynamic loading conditions and high strain rates under the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process makes the material behavior even more complicated. The KST-DFH material model is shown in this work to be appropriate in order to constitutively describe granite at dynamic fragmentation. It consists of a plasticity model in compression and a damage model in tension. The yield surface locus is a quadratic function of the mean pressure in the principal stress space and the damage model is anisotropic. Several experiments are performed in order to define the mechanical behavior and dynamic response of granite and calibrate the KST-DFH model parameters for this material. The material model is implemented as in a commercial finite element program and validated based on dynamic tests such as Edge-on Impact (EOI) and spalling test using Hopkinson bar. The numerical tool is then used to model the rock response during the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. In doing so, only one spherical tool button and just the first impact are considered for simplicity. The anticipated fracture mechanism in <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> is captured and the penetration stiffness obtained is in agreement with practical drilling experiments. In paper A, the experimental work is described and the granite mechanical response is explained. In particular, the influence from pre-existing cracks and defects is examined in great detail. In paper B, the experimental results are used to calibrate the material model parameters. The numerical tool discussed earlier is employed to investigate the rock fracture mechanisms at <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> In paper C, the effect of pre-existing, or structural, cracks on dynamic fragmentation of granite is investigated in detail. These cracks may be the result from former impact of the drill bit, or by means of other unconventional methods such as microwave and laser that are used to increase the effectiveness of the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. In paper D, the dynamic tensile behavior of granite samples is investigated. Spalling tests using a Hopkinson bar are performed and a strain rate of order 102 1 /s is obtained. This experimental technique involves the same order of strain rate as present in rock materials during <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> A dynamic tensile strength of 18. 9 MPa is obtained at a strain rate of 70 1 /s. This is more than twice the tensile strength of the specimen (with the same size) at quasi-static conditions, which is 8 MPa. QC 20150212 </p...|$|R

Drilling and planetary soil/rock sample acquisition provides information about history of past events, minerals and chemical composition of the soil/rock of the planetary body, available resources for future manned missions and the mechanical behavior of the planetary soil/rock. Several types of drilling devices have been proposed for lunar, Mars, and planetary subsurface exploration. However, these devices have limitations (e. g. heavy equipment and need for large axial force) {{that need to be}} addressed in order to be feasible for extraterrestrial bodiesâ€™ exploration. A special type of ultrasonic <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> have been proposed by Honeybee Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to address the limitations of current drilling devices. In this study, the mechanical system of the ultrasonic <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> and its interaction with the supporting medium is studied. The percussive mechanism consists of an ultrasonic horn, a free mass, and the drill rod. Special attention is given to the impact between the free mass and the drill rod, including the effects of structural damping, the supporting medium of the rod, plastic deformation in the contact area, and repeated impacts of the free mass on the drill rod. A general methodology to analyze the impact of the free mass on the drill rod, analogous to the longitudinal impact of a mass on a rod, is developed. The methodology involves uncoupling the nonlinear problem by determining the response of each body independently under the contact force to find the local indentation, then using Hertz force-indentation relation to find the contact force. This method is applied using mode superposition method and finite element technique for various support conditions of the rod (e. g. rigid, elastic, free, viscoelastic). Additionally, a model to account for drill rod penetration into the supporting medium due to impact of the free mass is also presented. It was found that for an undamped rod, the support condition of the rod does not affect the contact force if the contact ends before the arrival of the reflected wave to the point of contact. It was also observed that the contact force due to impact, for a given support condition, increases with increasing damping of the rod. Moreover, a modified Hertz equation is introduced to include plastic deformation on the rod due to impact of the free mass. The study was performed for identical repetitive impacts and it was found that the largest plastic deformation occurs in the first impact, with additional plastic deformation decreasing with the increasing number of impacts. The dynamic response of the overall <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> was investigated with a finite element model, including the interaction of the free mass with the ultrasonic horn and the drill rod. A numerical example indicated that the dynamic response of the ultrasonic drill is directly affected by the supporting medium. It was found that system with fixed support experienced a higher frequency of oscillation of the free mass and higher impact force compared to the system with the elastic support and the model accounting for penetration into the supporting medium...|$|E

40|$|An {{in-depth}} look at <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> {{shows that}} the transmission efficiency is very important; however, data for <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> in hard rock or permafrost is rarely available or the existing data are very old. Transmission efficiency {{can be used as}} a measurement of the transmission of the energy in the piston to the drill steel or bit and from the bit to the rock. Having a plane and centralized impact of the piston on the drill steel can optimize the transmission efficiency from the piston to the drill steel. A transmission efficiency of near 100 % between piston and drill steel is possible. The transmission efficiency between bit and rock is dependent upon the interaction within the entire system. The main factors influencing this transmission efficiency are the contact area between cutting structure and surrounding rock (energy loss due to friction heat), damping characteristics of the surrounding rock (energy dampening), and cuttings transport. Some of these parameters are not controllable. To solve the existing void regarding available drilling data, an experiment for gathering energy data in permafrost for <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> was designed.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the {{petroleum}} industry have experienced a drastically increase in drilling costs. At the same time the oil prize has been highly unstable resulting in an increased focus on reducing drilling costs. The aim of this thesis is to look for cost reducing measures when drilling in hard rock formations offshore. Drilling in hard formations is both challenging and time consuming as a consequence of Low Rate of Penetration (ROP) and high None Productive Time (NPT). Typically hard rock stones encountered offshore are limestone, basalt, chart and chalk which for instance {{can be found in the}} NCS, on Iceland and offshore Faroe Islands.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that percussive drills are very {{promising}} since they can increase the rate of penetration in hard rock formations. Any small improvements on the percussive drills {{can make a big}} contribution to lowering the drilling costs since drilling a well for the oil & gas industry is very costly. This thesis presents a percussive drilling system mainly driven by a tubular reciprocating translational motion permanent magnet synchronous motor (RTPMSM), which efficiently converts electric energy to kinetic energy for crushing the hard rock since there is no mechanical media. The thesis starts from state-of-the-art of percussive drilling techniques, reciprocating translational motion motors, and self-sensing control of electric motors and its implementation issues. The following chapters present modeling the hard rock, modeling the drill, the design issues of the drill, the RTPMSM and its control.

40|$|Geothermal {{heat flow}} is {{obtained}} {{as a product}} of the geothermal gradient and the thermal conductivity of the vertical soil/rock/regolith interval penetrated by the instrument. Heat flow measurements are a high priority for the geophysical network missions to the Moon recommended by the latest Decadal Survey and previously the International Lunar Network. One of the difficulties associated with lunar heat flow measurement on a robotic mission is that it requires excavation of a relatively deep (approx 3 m) hole {{in order to avoid the}} long-term temporal changes in lunar surface thermal environment affecting the subsurface temperature measurements. Such changes may be due to the 18. 6 -year-cylcle lunar precession, or may be initiated by presence of the lander itself. Therefore, a key science requirement for heat flow instruments for future lunar missions is to penetrate 3 m into the regolith and to measure both thermal gradient and thermal conductivity. Engineering requirements are that the instrument itself has minimal impact on the subsurface thermal regime and that it must be a low-mass and low-power system like any other science instrumentation on planetary landers. It would be very difficult to meet the engineering requirements, if the instrument utilizes a long (> 3 m) probe driven into the ground by a rotary or <b>percussive</b> <b>drill.</b> Here we report progress in our efforts to develop a new, compact lunar heat flow instrumentation that meets all of these science and engineering requirements...|$|E
40|$|Traditional rotary {{drilling}} for planetary rock sampling, in situ analysis, and sample return are challenging because {{the axial force}} and holding torque requirements are not necessarily compatible with lightweight spacecraft architectures in low-gravity environments. This paper seeks to optimize an ultrasonic <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> tool to achieve rock penetration with lower reacted force requirements, with a strategic view toward building an ultrasonic planetary core drill (UPCD) device. The UPCD is a descendant of the ultrasonic/sonic driller/corer technique. In these concepts, a transducer and horn (typically resonant at around 20 kHz) are used to excite a toroidal free mass that oscillates chaotically between the horn tip and drill base at lower frequencies (generally between 10 Hz and 1 kHz). This creates a series of stress pulses that is transferred through the drill bit to the rock surface, and while the stress at the drill-bit tip/rock interface exceeds the compressive strength of the rock, it causes fractures that result in fragmentation of the rock. This facilitates augering and downward progress. In {{order to ensure that}} the drill-bit tip delivers the greatest effective impulse (the time integral of the drill-bit tip/rock pressure curve exceeding the strength of the rock), parameters such as the spring rates and the mass of the free mass, the drill bit and transducer have been varied and compared in both computer simulation and practical experiment. The most interesting findings and those of particular relevance to deep drilling indicate that increasing the mass of the drill bit has a limited (or even positive) influence on the rate of effective impulse delivered...|$|E

40|$|Acquiring {{samples from}} the {{subsurface}} of Mars poses many challenges. The scientific return increases with the depth from which the samples are obtained, but so does the risk. Thus, {{it is important to}} develop a fully autonomous drilling platform that will be capable of accessing the required depth and retrieving cores for scientific analysis. The method of drilling most likely to succeed will be a conventional mechanical core drill, either rotary or percussive, with a mechanical system for removing the cuttings and rock core from the hole. Instead of fluid flushing systems for removing cuttings, which {{would be very difficult to}} provide and in addition may contaminate the sample, an auger system is the best solution for rotary drilling.

The technique {{has been used to}} provide information on different ground properties and conditions and for drill productivity evaluation. Five different test sites have been used: the OSCAR area in the Kiirunavaara magnetite mine in Kiruna, the Viscaria copper mine in Kiruna, the Zinkgruvan mine in south-central Sweden, the GlÃ¶dberget tunneling site in VÃ¤sterbotten county and the HallandsÃ¥sen tunneling site in southern Sweden. A methodology has been suggested and tested for treatment of raw data in order to extract rock dependent parameter variations from variations generated by the drill system itself and other external influences. Prediction of rock hardness and fracturing can be done without initial calibration, providing a good foundation for interpretation by site personnel. The mining applications show that drill monitoring has a very high potential for ore boundary delineation and also for classification of existing rock types. In tunneling applications drill monitoring demonstrates a good capability of foreseeing rock conditions ahead of the tunnel face. Other benefits are the speed of the method, its practicality {{and the fact that it}} requires no additional equipment, time or access to the production front. The potential for detailed drill productivity evaluation by drill monitoring has been demonstrated. Detailed information of the time consumption for each activity in the drilling cycle can be presented as well as the distribution of the total production.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{evidence}} of life on Mars is the ultimate motivation for its scientific exploration. The results from the Phoenix mission indicate that the high N. latitude ice-rich regolith at low elevations {{is likely to be}} a recently habitable place on Mars [Stoker et al., 2010]. The near-surface ice likely provided adequate water activity during periods of high obliquity, 3 to 10 Myr ago. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen are present in the atmosphere, and nitrates may be present in the soil. Together with iron in basaltic rocks and perchlorate in the soil they provide carbon and energy sources, and oxidative power to drive metabolism. Furthermore, the presence of organics is possible, as thermally reactive perchlorate would have prevented their detection by Viking and Phoenix. The Mars Icebreaker Life mission [McKay et al., 2013] focuses on the following science goals: (1) Search for biomolecular evidence of life; (2) Search for organic matter from either exogeneous or endogeneous sources using methods that are not effected by the presence of perchlorate; (3) Characterize oxidative species that produced reactivity of soils seen by Viking; and 4) Assess the habitability of the ice bearing soils.

40|$|The need to {{maintain}} optimal energy efficiency is critical during the drilling operations performed on future and current planetary rover missions (see figure). Specifically, this innovation seeks to solve the following problem. Given a spring-loaded <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> driven by a voice-coil motor, one needs to determine the optimal input voltage waveform (periodic function) and the optimal hammering period that minimizes the dissipated energy, while ensuring that the hammer-to-rock impacts are made with sufficient (user-defined) impact velocity (or impact energy). To solve this problem, it was first observed that when voice-coil-actuated percussive drills are driven at high power, it {{is of paramount importance}} to ensure that the electrical current of the device remains in phase with the velocity of the hammer. Otherwise, negative work is performed and the drill experiences a loss of performance (i. e., reduced impact energy) and an increase in Joule heating (i. e., reduction in energy efficiency). This observation has motivated many drilling products to incorporate the standard bang-bang control approach for driving their percussive drills. However, the bang-bang control approach is significantly less efficient than the optimal energy-efficient control approach solved herein. To obtain this solution, the standard tools of classical optimal control theory were applied. It is worth noting that these tools inherently require the solution of a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP), i. e., a system of differential equations where half the equations have unknown boundary conditions. Typically, the TPBVP is impossible to solve analytically for high-dimensional dynamic systems. However, for the case of the spring-loaded vibro-impactor, this approach yields the exact optimal control solution as the sum of four analytic functions whose coefficients are determined using a simple, easy-to-implement algorithm. Once the optimal control waveform is determined, it can be used optimally in the context of both open-loop and closed-loop control modes (using standard realtime control hardware) ...|$|E

First, an auxiliary problem of stationary indentation of a rigid indentor is considered. The rock is modelled by an inÂ¯nite elastic medium with damage-induced material softening.

The bore-hole is a semi-inÂ¯nite cylinder with a curvilinear bottom. It is assumed the indentation is produced by a stationary motion of the rupture front at which an appropriate rock strength condition is violated. The bore-hole boundary is not known in advance and consists of four parts: a free of traction non-rupturing part, a contact non-rupturing part, a free of traction part of the rupture front, and a contact part of the rupture front. Thus the problem is formulated as a non-local non-linear free-boundary contact problem and algorithms of its numerical solution are discussed. The problem solution provides axial force necessary for the drill bit progression through the rock. Then the stationary-periodic <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> problem is reduced to the stationary problem on the rupture progression stage of the cycle and to the classical contact problem on the reverse and progression-before-rupture stages of the cycle. As a result, this provides a nonlinear progression-force diagram...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{a method}} to drill into a rock surface {{regardless}} of the gravitational field or orientation. The required weight-on-bit (WOB) is supplied by a self-contained anchoring mechanism. The system includes a rotary percussive coring drill, forming a complete sampling instrument usable by robot or human. This method of in situ sample acquisition using micro - spine anchoring technology enables several NASA mission concepts not currently possible with existing technology, including sampling from consolidated rock on asteroids, providing a bolt network for astronauts visiting a near-Earth asteroid, and sampling from the ceilings or vertical walls of lava tubes and cliff faces on Mars. One {{of the most fundamental}} parameters of drilling is the WOB; essentially, the load applied to the bit that allows it to cut, creating a reaction force normal to the surface. In every drilling application, there is a minimum WOB that must be maintained for the system to function properly. In microgravity (asteroids and comets), even a small WOB could not be supported conventionally by the weight of the robot or astronaut. An anchoring mechanism would be needed to resist the reactions, or the robot or astronaut would push themselves off the surface and into space. The ability of the system to anchor itself to a surface creates potential applications that reach beyond use in low gravity. The use of these anchoring mechanisms as end effectors on climbing robots has the potential of vastly expanding the scope of what is considered accessible terrain. Further, because the drill is supported by its own anchor rather than by a robotic arm, the workspace is not constrained by the reach of such an arm. Yet, if the drill is on a robotic arm, it has the benefit of not reflecting the forces of drilling back to the arm s joints. Combining the drill with the anchoring feet will create a highly mobile, highly stable, and highly reliable system. The drilling system s anchor uses hundreds of microspine toes that independently find holes and ledges on a rock to create an anchor. Once the system is anchored, a linear translation mechanism moves the drill axially into the surface while maintaining the proper WOB. The linear translation mechanism is composed of a ball screw and stepper motor that can translate a carriage with high precision and applied load. The carriage slides along rails using self-aligning linear bearings that correct any axial misalignment caused by bending and torsion. The carriage then compresses a series of springs that simultaneously transmit the load to the drill along the bit axis and act as a suspension that compensates for the vibration caused by percussive drilling. The drill is a compacted, modified version of an off-the-shelf rotary <b>percussive</b> <b>drill,</b> which uses a custom carbide-tipped coring bit. By using rotary percussive drilling, the drill time is greatly reduced. The percussive action fractures the rock debris, which is removed during rotation. The final result is a 0. 75 -in. (. 1. 9 - cm) diameter hole and a preserved 0. 5 - in. (. 1. 3 -cm) diameter rock core. This work extends microspine technology, making it applicable to astronaut missions to asteroids and a host of robotic sampling concepts. At the time of this reporting, it is the first instrument to be demonstrated using microspine anchors, and is the first self-contained drill/anchor system to be demonstrated that is capable of drilling in inverted configurations and would be capable of drilling in microgravity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a control strategy for a <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> {{driven by an}} oscillating Tubular Linear Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (TLPMSM). The drill consists of a piston with permanent magnets and a casing with integrated stator windings. The casing encapsulate the whole unit and {{should be used to}} hammer into rocks. Between the piston and the casing there are two gas springs used to store the kinetic energy of the masses as potential energy while the oscillating masses change direction. The electric force from the TLPMSM should be used to bring the mechanical system in resonance. When the system is in resonance only a small amount of electric energy is needed to maintain the oscillation. The electric energy injected is needed to compensate for the losses in the system and the energy lost when the casing hits the rock. The developed control strategy consists of a field oriented vector controller for the current and an outer controller for the mechanical oscillations. The outer controller is a proportional controller with positive feedback, which is found to have particularly good properties for the application. The outer controller controls the oscillation at the resonance frequency without any information about the process. This is highly desirable since it is very challenging to make an accurate model of a rock. Furthermore, the controller only demands a current when the the back emf is non zero. This means that when the TLPMSM is unable to produce any output power the current in the windings is zero, which prevents unnecessary copper losses. It is shown that the relative position between piston and casing oscillates twice for each time the casing strikes the rock surface. In the simulated scenario, the impact force from the casing to the rock can reach 645 kN with an oscillation frequency of 38 Hz. To increase the oscillation frequency the gas spring pressure need to be increased. Two methods to make the control strategy sensorless are also presented. The first strategy is a Statically Compensated Voltage Model (SCVM) which is based on the information provided by the induced back emf. The second strategy is based on saliency in the machine and uses injection of a high frequency square wave signal. In this work this strategy is referred to as Square Wave Injection. Both techniques are working in the application but they have different advantages and disadvantages. It is shown that the SCVM is insensitive to measurement noise since 10 % noise could be added to the current measurement without any trouble. It is also shown that it is dependent on good parameter estimation, especially for the rotor ux. An error in the parameter estimations leads to a lowering of the impact force from the casing to the rock from 417 kN per hit to 343 kN per hit. For Square wave injection it is the opposite. It is sensitive to measurement noise since only 0. 2 % current measurement noise could be added without that the estimation stopped working. If the oscillation frequency is increased the noise level need to be even lower. However, it is not dependent on parameter estimations since process parameters are almost not used. When each estimation techniques is simulated without measurement noise the square wave injection technique gives a lower maximum position estimaton error than the SCVM, 0. 82 mm versus 1. 64 mm. But for the square wave injection technique the position estimation error is high at the instant when the current is applied. Since the force generating current is erronously applied an impact force from the casing to rock of 364 kN is reached and this is lower compared to the impact force of 417 kN when the SCVM is used. It is recommended to use SCVM for this application. The SCVM {{can be used in a}} larger range of oscillation frequencies for the mechanical system and is more robust against non-ideal conditions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated rotary <b>percussive</b> <b>drill</b> is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} strategy for automatic control of the ITH <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process. Such automation would provide the benefits of improved productivity and quality in terms of penetration rate and hole deviation, as well as enhanced hole quality and machine life. Analysis of field data acquired from drilling experiments performed at INCO's Little Stobie Mine is presented. As {{a result of this}} analysis, a control algorithm is formulated to enhance the drilling process efficiency. This algorithm calculates the specific energy (SE) of the rock and adjusts the applied feed force based on this SE value, using a relationship obtained from the field data analysis. A model of the <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling</b> process is developed and simulated in software. The proposed control algorithm is tested through simulations on this simulated drilling process. The results of the simulation show a significant increase in efficiency of the drilling process. As a result of vibration data analysis it is concluded that vibration should be controlled through an improved design of the shock-absorber, rather than through drilling variables. A detailed shock-absorber test data analysis is therefore presented. Recommendations for design changes in the shock-absorber are also given. Deviation analysis is also presented in the thesis, which shows a poor correlation between the machine variables and the hole deviation data. Hence, it is recommended that deviation be controlled by steering. An innovative guided drilling mechanism for controlling the hole deviation is also proposed. This mechanism consists of an eccentric ITH percussive hammer with controlled rotational speed, which can be employed as an actuator to steer the drill string in a desired direction without using any down hole instrumentation. Modelling and simulation analysis of this system is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{drilling}} {{is essential}} in the mining industry. Complexities involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties but also {{the nature of the}} drilling action impact the drilling performance and operational costs. Brittleness is a fundamental rock property relevant to rock drilling and excavation works. However, rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated. In this study, a new brittleness index developed upon fracture energy quantities withdrawn from the complete stressstrain characteristics in uniaxial compression of rock is presented. A vast independent data on the drilling performance reported elsewhere in the literature was evaluated against the new brittleness index. The results show that the proposed brittleness index successfully describes the performance of different drilling methods including PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) rotary drilling, roller-cone rotary <b>drilling</b> and <b>percussive</b> <b>drilling.</b> Munoz, H.

40|$|The {{influence}} of springy impact interface and of curved drill rods on energy transfer in <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> was studied. Analytical models for pneumatic and hydraulic rock drills were introduced, {{in which the}} springy piston-rod impact interface was taken into account. A nonlinear model for the springy impact interface was also implemented in a computer simulation program for <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> systems. Laboratory tests were performed and the experimental results were compared with the results by three theoretical models. The agreement between theoretical and experimental incident stress waves {{was found to be}} satisfactory. The factors affecting the rock drilling efficiency were analysed. For the hydraulic rock drills investigated, it was found that a springy impact interface slightly decreases the drilling efficiency. For pneumatic rock drills, however, the analysis showed that an appropriate springy impact interface might increase the drilling efficiency significantly. The reflection and transmission of harmonic stress waves at a constant curvature bend of an ilifinite uniform bar was analysed theoretically. The energy fluxes of the reflected and transmitted extensional and flexural waves were obtained for an incident wave which may be either extensional or flexural. Results are shown in polar radiation diagrams for an incident extensional wave. It was found that for bends of small angles, the radius of curvature has little effect on the transmission of extensional stress waves and a significant amount of extensional wave energy is transmitted through the bends. Furthermore, the efficiency of <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> with a bent drill rod was investigated using a combined approach of FFT and matrix method. In <b>percussive</b> rock <b>drilling</b> with slightly bent rods (bend angle up to 100), {{it was found that the}} efficiency is practically the same as with straight rods. It was also found that the efficiency can remain high even if the rod is significantly bent (bend angle up to 30 Â°). GodkÃ¤nd; 1993; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R
