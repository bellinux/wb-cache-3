5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity {{is not the}} same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{numerous}} laws that {{form part of}} kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of certain animals (such as pork, shellfish (both Mollusca and Crustacea)) and most insects, {{with the exception of}} certain species of kosher locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to slaughter mammals and birds according to a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> shechita.

5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

50|$|Podocytes {{are found}} lining the Bowman's {{capsules}} in the nephrons of the kidney. The foot <b>processes</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> pedicels that extend from the podocytes wrap themselves around the capillaries of the glomerulus {{to form the}} filtration slits. The pedicels increase the surface area of the cells enabling efficient ultrafiltration.|$|R
5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude {{some distance from the}} shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Forty leagues (120nautical {{miles or}} around 220km) {{to the east}} of Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships (the Rose Pink and the Fancy, captained by a young Charles Harris) dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and {{barnacles}} from the outside of the boats, in a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> careening, necessary because no dry dock was available to pirates.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 K. K. Madsen {{described}} an automated variation of SMAW, {{now known as}} gravity welding. It briefly gained popularity in the 1960s after receiving publicity for its use in Japanese shipyards though today its applications are limited. Another little used variation of the <b>process,</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> firecracker welding, was developed {{around the same time}} by George Hafergut in Austria.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} Erlang formulae, {{including}} Erlang B, Erlang C {{and the related}} Engset formula, based on different models of user behavior and system operation.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the District's {{southern}} {{territory of}} Alexandria went into economic decline {{partly due to}} neglect by Congress. The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia {{to take back the}} land it had donated to form the District, through a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> retrocession.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E

PC12 cells treated for 10-14 days with nerve growth factor had no release of vesicles from the cell body which {{indicates}} the aggregation of vesicles in {{the ends of the}} neurites.|$|R
5|$|Negombo Tamils, or Puttalam Tamils, {{are native}} Sri Lankan Tamils {{who live in}} the western Gampaha and Puttalam districts. The term does not apply to Tamil {{immigrants}} in these areas. They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the Negombo Tamil dialect, and by aspects of their culture such as customary laws. Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the Sinhalese ethnic group through a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Sinhalisation. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by caste myths and legends (see Passing (sociology)).|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This <b>process,</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|Regional geology accords that Dublin's {{hard water}} is well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness, while the Plzeň Region's soft water {{is ideal for}} brewing Pilsner (pale lager), such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which {{benefits}} making pale ale {{to such a degree}} that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Burtonisation.|$|E
