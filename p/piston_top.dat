50|$|Due to {{the heating}} and {{efficiency}} problems, L-head engines fell from high power uses such as aircraft engines fairly quickly, prior to World War I. They lived {{on for some}} time in the automotive world and were used in the World War II Jeep, for instance. L-heads are no longer used in automobile engines, although they remain in common use for small-engine applications in lawnmowers and generators. Because of their heat-retaining design, the size of valves and the compression ratio are limited (the valve/combustion chamber is away from the <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> typically creating a larger combustion space--a lower compression ratio), which in turn reduces available power and economy. Not all L-heads are cam-in-block engines; the location of the camshaft varies in this layout.|$|E
50|$|All MEL engines had {{wedge-shaped}} {{combustion chambers}} formed between a flat head surface and an angle milled block deck (10 degrees off square with the bore axis), with the <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> determining the compression ratio and combustion chamber shape, {{similar to the}} Chevrolet Big-Block 348 combustion chamber, also introduced in 1958, and the later 409 and 427. Unlike the Chevrolet, which had staggered valves and scalloped or M shaped valve covers, the MEL valves were inline with shaft mounted rocker arms like the FE model Ford engines which were introduced at the same time. As with the previous generation V8's, an open runner intake manifold was used, requiring {{the use of a}} stamped steel lifter valley cover {{similar to that of the}} Pontiac V8 engines. Also, the intake manifold provided no exhaust crossover passage to warm the air/fuel mixture. Further MEL engines employed two individual thermostats, aimed to improve the regulation of the engine's coolant temperature.|$|E
50|$|An {{exhaust brake}} is a valve which {{essentially}} creates a back-pressure in the exhaust system, which applies enough force onto the engine's pistons {{to slow the}} engine. In most cases, an exhaust brake is so effective that it can slow a heavily-loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle’s service brakes. Under these conditions, the exhaust flow from the cylinders is bottlenecked and rapidly builds pressure in the exhaust system upstream from the exhaust brake. Depending on engine speed, this pressure can easily reach up to 60 PSI maximum working pressure. Maximum working pressure is limited {{as part of the}} design of an exhaust brake. In this example, that same 60 PSI also remains in the cylinder for the entire exhaust stroke (exhaust valve open) and exerts 60 PSI on the <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> to resist its upward movement. The produces a negative torque, slowing the engine for a braking effect. Thus, simply restricting the exhaust flow can generate substantial braking.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} much {{progress}} {{in the development of}} gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, choosing an appropriate <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> contour to obtain desirable combustion efficiency is still an arduous process for engineers. This study investigates the combined effects of piston bowl geometry and a charge motion control valve (CMCV) on tumble flow and combustion features in GDI engines. Based on the model validation, the processes of intake, spray, mixture formation and combustion at different engine speeds are simulated and analyzed for different piston shapes for the two cases of opening and closing the CMCV. The results show that the bowl on the top of piston is beneficial for the formation and development of tumble flow. The flat top piston with the CMCV closed is able to achieve acceptable combustion pressure. However, with the increase of engine speed and load, the advantages of the flat top pistons gradually disappear; the dual offset bowl piston has a minimum tumble ratio and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) {{at the end of the}} compression stroke because of the projection in the middle of the <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> surface which leads to a lower pressure rise rate and a reduced flame propagation speed at high load. The closed CMCV contributes to a faster evaporation rate and a more uniform mixture at lower speeds. It is not recommended for use at high speeds due to lower intake air mass and reduced combustion pressure. The research provides an effective way for engineers to choose an appropriate <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> contour combined with a CMCV to obtain desirable combustion efficiency...|$|E

50|$|The 2JZ-GTE {{originally}} powered the Toyota Aristo V (JZS147) in 1991 {{before becoming}} Toyota's flagship performance engine in the Toyota Supra RZ (JZA80). Its mechanical basis was the existing 2JZ-GE, but differed {{in its use}} of sequential twin turbochargers and an air-to-air side-mounted intercooler. The engine block, crankshaft, and connecting rods of the Supra's 2JZ-GE and 2JZ-GTE are the same, with notable differences being that the 2JZ-GTE has recessed <b>piston</b> <b>tops</b> (giving a lower compression ratio), oil spray nozzles to aid in cooling the pistons and a different head (redesigned inlet/exhaust ports, cams and valves). However, other 2JZ-GE equipped models (Aristo, Altezza, Mark II) share a different part number for connecting rods.

40|$|A set of {{experiments}} and a simulation study are completed {{to quantify the}} effect of the piston crevice on engine efficiency. The simulation study breaks down the loss mechanisms on brake efficiency at different displacement volumes (300 - 500 cc) and compression ratios (8 - 20). Experiments focus on indicated efficiencies for a narrow range of compression ratios (9. 24 - 12. 57) with different piston crevice volumes. Piston crevice volume is increased in two steps by machining a groove into the <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> land, and is decreased by raising the top ring. Indicated efficiency is measured at various loads (0. 4 - 1. 0 bar MAP), speeds (1500, 2000, 2500 rpm), and coolant temperatures (50 °C and 80 °C). All data points compared in this study are recorded at MBT timing with a relative air-fuel ratio ([gamma]) of 1. For the baseline case (CR = 9. 24, speed = 2000 rpm, coolant = 80 °C), increased crevice volume results in an indicated efficiency degradation of 0. 3 - 0. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3. This absolute decrease corresponds to a 1. 2 - 1. 5 % relative decrease for a 100 % increase in crevice volume; referenced to the control piston crevice modification. Decreasing crevice volume leads to a gain in indicated efficiency of 2. 3 - 3. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3, which corresponds to a 6. 9 - 11. 8 % relative increase for a 100 % decrease in crevice volume; referenced to the control piston crevice modification. Results of the experimental investigation, when compared across compression ratio, engine speed, and coolant temperature, show that the crevice effect on efficiency is largely independent of these three parameters. Large gains from decreased piston crevice volume prompt renewed discussions on <b>piston</b> <b>top</b> land, top ring, and crown design. by Patrick M. Smith. Thesis: S.

It is shown that the highest temperature is within the permit and piston ring sticking will not happen. At the same time, the largest stress bellows allowable stress of the material, so the piston can meet the requirement. Also, the result in this article provides reference for piston design and optimization. Piston is the core component of oil engine, its quality {{is directly related to}} engine performance. Piston often work in the condition of high temperature, high speed and high pressure under the periodic variation of high mechanical and heat loading. When the temperature increasing, material strength limit go down[1]. Compared with a thermal analysis or a structural analysis, the real practical work of piston is in a large difference. Thermal analysis will be combined with structural analysis, research on its strength conditions in the work temperature can obtain actual result. Taking the piston of an engine as an example, this paper makes analysis of thermal-mechanical couple for it by using indirect couple method.
