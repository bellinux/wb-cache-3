5|$|Following Australia's {{unlikely}} win at Headingley, the England selectors {{were widely}} condemned for {{their failure to}} choose a specialist wrist spinner to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited {{as a reason for}} the hosts' loss, as the <b>part-timer</b> Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{selection}} of workers into part-time jobs, and the wages they earn, are analysed using Canadian data. We {{focus on the}} distinction between voluntary and involuntary part-time workers since involuntary <b>part-timers</b> earn substantially lower wages than voluntary <b>part-timers.</b> We nd that the {{selection of}} individuals into involuntary part-time work is more closely tied to job characteristics such as industry, occupation and region of employment than personal or human capital characteristics. Personal characteristics play {{a larger role in}} explaining the lower wages of the involuntary <b>part-timers</b> but results also suggest that selection e ects dominate the contribution coming from di erences in endowments...|$|R

40|$|The authors use matched employer-employee panel data on Belgian private-sector {{firms to}} {{estimate}} the relationship between wage/productivity differentials and the firm’s labor composition in terms of part-time and sex. Findings suggest that the groups of women and <b>part-timers</b> generate employer rents, but also that the origin of these rents differs (relatively lower wages for women, relatively higher productivity for <b>part-timers).</b> Interactions between gender and part-time suggest that the positive productivity effect is driven by male <b>part-timers</b> working more than 25 hours, whereas the share of female <b>part-timers</b> is associated with wage penalties. The authors conclude {{that men and women}} differ with respect to motives for reducing working hours and the types of part-time jobs available to them: women often have to accommodate domestic constraints by downgrading to more flexible jobs, whereas male part-time work is frequently related to training and collectively negotiated hours reductions that do not affect hourly pay. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{work and}} labour market {{situation}} of female part-time {{workers have been}} a central focus of contrasting sociological interpretations of the labour market. These share in common a view that <b>part-timers</b> occupy jobs {{with lower levels of}} skill and lower pay than full-timers, but provide very different accounts of why this should be the case. However, the major perspectives adopt a relatively static view of the labour market, implicitly assuming that the relativities between full-timers and <b>part-timers</b> are likely to remain relatively constant across time. This paper shows that the skill position of female parttimers workers has improved significantly since the early 1990 s. While this has benefited some sectors of <b>part-timers</b> more than others, there is no consistent evidence of polarisation. There is still a significant skills gap, but the changes over time cast doubt over the view that female <b>part-timers</b> should be regarded as a quite distinct peripheral sector of the workforce...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to answer the question: What factors are related to pharmacists 2 ̆ 7 {{decisions}} to become part-time professionals? The four specific objectives of the study were: (1) to characterize and compare part-time pharmacists with moonlighting pharmacists with respect to their motivations to work in a part-time job, (2) to characterize and compare part-time pharmacists with full-time and moonlighting pharmacists with respect to their: overall well-being, perceived ability to perform pharmacy practice functions, career plans, and perceived impact on pharmacy practice, (3) to determine the level of career commitment and professional involvement of part-time pharmacists and compare their career commitment and professional involvement with that of full-time and moonlighting pharmacists, and (4) to identify the set of reasons that best describes pharmacists 2 ̆ 7 motives for being engaged in their given work arrangement. A random sample of 3, 000 pharmacists nationwide was surveyed. A net response rate of 57 percent was achieved. Of those respondents currently working as pharmacists, 68 percent were full-timers, 13 percent were moonlighters, 14 percent were <b>part-timers,</b> and 5 percent were <b>part-timers</b> in two or more jobs. A majority of both male and female pharmacists worked in full-time jobs. When <b>part-timers</b> were compared against moonlighters, there were differences in the importance ratings assigned to the various reasons for working part-time. <b>Part-timers</b> gave the highest ratings to the reasons: 2 ̆ 2 like the work, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 need time for child-rearing, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 looking for greater flexibility. 2 ̆ 2 Moonlighters gave the highest importance ratings to the reasons: 2 ̆ 2 like the work, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 keep up with skills, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 provide more money for personal income. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Part-timers</b> also showed significantly higher levels of well-being, perceptions of their ability to perform pharmacy practice skills, and perceptions of their impact on the pharmacy profession. <b>Part-timers</b> showed significantly higher levels of career commitment than full-time pharmacists.

40|$|Questions of {{identity}} have been mostly related {{to war and}} internal clashes among different sects and parties during {{a major part of}} Lebanon’s contemporary history. People were often killed and tortured because of their presumed identities. For more peaceful and educational purposes, this study investigates the professional identities of part-time instructors at one Lebanese HE institution. Three key related questions are addressed. A major question has to do with investigating the professional identities of these instructors, another question deals with {{what it means to be}} a part-time instructor and a third with the professional development practices of these <b>part-timers.</b> The two latter objectives have a high impact in crafting the first. A case study was carried out at the American Oriental University (AOU) were 26 <b>part-timers</b> and three full-timers (ex-part-timers) were interviewed. To triangulate the data, four of the participants were asked to participate in diary writing. In addition, document checking was carried out. The <b>part-timers</b> were chosen to represent the wider population of <b>part-timers</b> at the University. Thus, they were chosen to illustrate particular factors characterising <b>part-timers,</b> such as gender, seniority, educational standing, number of work sites and type of part-time choice. Thematic and discourse analysis were used to analyse the data and investigate the different models of those part-timers’ professional identities. Analysis revealed that each <b>part-timer’s</b> professional identity is unique and exists on a continuum ranging from highly democratic to highly managerial. The former is characterised by being democratic, collaborative and based on trust, while the latter is individualistic, competitive and externally-regulated (Day and Sachs, 2004). The neo-liberal forces prevailing in the current educational arena, however, rendered these identities more inclined towards the managerial end (Apple, 2003). Each identity was rendered unique on the continuum not only because of multiplicity of forces impacting it, but rather because of the different sources and intensities of these forces, and thus their unorthodox effects.

30|$|This section {{extends the}} {{analysis}} of full-wage wages to total employment, including those working part-time {{in the year of}} observation.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} the heterogeneous nature of part-time employment for poverty risk, we now distinguish between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment. As indicated earlier, involuntary part-time employment as captured in EU-SILC is more an indication of underemployment as it only considers people working less than 30  h. Involuntary part-time workers stated to be looking for a full-time job or to work more hours, whereas voluntary <b>part-timers</b> indicated that {{they do not want to}} work more hours, work <b>part-timers</b> because of caring activities, sickness, disability, education, or other not-further-specified reasons. To what extent part-time work is done for ‘care’ reasons is to be considered as an entirely voluntary choice is of course debatable (OECD 2010). Respondents stating that they work less than 30  h but explicitly report that it is a full-time job are excluded in figures that make a distinction between voluntary and involuntary <b>part-timers.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{match was}} widely {{anticipated}} {{and had a}} huge leadup. Pakistani captain Wasim Akram withdrew due to injury. India elected to bat after winning the toss, with Sidhu (93 from 115 balls, 11 fours) and Tendulkar (31 off 59 balls, 3 fours) reaching 90 before Tendulkar was dismissed by Pakistan fast bowler Ata-ur-Rehman. Although wickets fell regularly, with all Pakistani bowlers barring <b>part-timer</b> Salim Malik among the wickets, the Indians continued to score quickly, with Jadeja making a rapid 45 from 25 balls in the final overs, including 40 from Waqar Younis' last two overs. India scored 287/8 in their 50 overs. Prasad and Kumble then took three wickets each to restrict Pakistan to 248/9, despite their strong start due to a quick 55 from Pakistan's stand-in-captain and opener Aamer Sohail, to complete a memorable victory and qualify for the semifinals, making it 2 wins in 2 World Cup matches against the arch-rivals. This resulted in widespread disappointment in Pakistan, leading to a government inquiry, crowd demonstrations outside players' homes and the suicide of one distraught fan.|$|E

Drawing on national micro-data from Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, our multivariate analyses show cross-national similarities in terms of lower job learning opportunities for female <b>part-timers.</b> We found a significantly higher incidence of repetitiveness only among Swedish female <b>part-timers</b> and lower degrees of task discretion among British, Dutch, and Swedish women working part-time hours. Female <b>part-timers</b> were either equally satisfied with their work as female full-timers or even more satisfied.

While women working part-time hours were as affected by their job quality characteristics as were full-timers, we conclude that the shorter hours of work per se provide an important additional source of job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} individual and workplace characteristics in accounting for differences in hourly earnings {{between men and women}} in full and part-time jobs in Britain. A four-way gender-working time split (male full-timers, male <b>part-timers,</b> female full-timers, and female <b>part-timers)</b> is analysed, and allowance is explicitly made for workplace and occupational female segregation. Within gender groups, the striking difference between full and part-time employees is that full-timers work in higher paying occupations than do <b>part-timers.</b> Also, female occupational segregation makes a significant contribution to the earnings gap between male and female part-time employees but not for full-time workers. A further new result is that female workplace segregation contributes significantly to the full/part-time earnings gap of both males and females. Part-time employees work in more feminized workplaces and their earnings are lower. There remains, moreover, a substantial residual gender earnings gap between male and female employees.
