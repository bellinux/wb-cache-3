25|$|In 1998, the Federal Trade Commission in the USA {{considered}} {{the lack of}} privacy for children on the Internet, and created the Children Online <b>Privacy</b> <b>Protection</b> Act (COPPA). COPPA limits the options which gather information from children and created warning labels if potential harmful information or content was presented. In 2000, Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was developed to implement safe Internet policies such as rules, and filter software. These laws, awareness campaigns, parental and adult supervision strategies and Internet filters can all help to make the Internet safer for children around the world.|$|E

Writer Michael Dolan, who obtained {{a copy of the}} hand-written list of rentals, wrote about it for the Washington City Paper. Dolan justified accessing the list on the ground that Bork himself had stated that Americans only had such privacy rights as afforded them by direct legislation. The incident led to the enactment of the 1988 Video <b>Privacy</b> <b>Protection</b> Act.|$|E

The Electronic Privacy Information Center's brief, signed by technical experts as well as lawyers, focused {{on the importance of}} data minimization to both security and <b>privacy</b> <b>protection.</b> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy and Technology and Public Citizen filed a joint brief.

In February 2007, Democratic Representative Michael M. Honda proposed the Student <b>Privacy</b> <b>Protection</b> Act of 2007 to change Vitter's amendment from requiring high schools to provide military recruiters with students' personal information unless they explicitly opt-out to requiring the student's explicit consent first. According to the Congressional Quarterly, Vitter stands behind the current provision. He stated that if it is changed, families who supported military recruiting may miss out if required to opt in.|$|E

2500|$|According to [...] Nicklas Lundblad, another {{perspective}} on <b>privacy</b> <b>protection</b> {{is the assumption}} that the quickly growing amount of information produced will be beneficial.
