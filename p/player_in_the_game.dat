5|$|The Bearcats' second {{possession}} {{of the second half}} was more successful than their first. On the first play of the drive, running back Jacob Ramsey broke free of the Tech defense for a 25-yard run, the longest run of any Cincinnati <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> He followed that first-down run by gaining eight more yards on consecutive runs. Pike then ran three yards for a first down at the Tech 44-yard line. There, however, Cincinnati's offense sputtered and could not gain another first down. The Bearcats' punted, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Tech 14-yard line with six seconds remaining in the quarter. The Hokies had time for one play, a 21-yard run by Evans to the Tech 35-yard line. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech had a 13–7 lead over Cincinnati.|$|E

5|$|The game's water effects {{received}} substantial upgrades {{because of}} the large role naval battles play in The Battle for Middle-earth II. The developers endeavored to make the surface of oceans and lakes look realistic by using techniques similar to those applied in films when creating computer-generated ocean water. The digital water simulates deep ocean water by reflecting its surroundings on the surface, and wave technology was used to create large waves along coastlines to immerse the <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> experience. Lost towns, corals, and fish were added underwater to add to the effect. Water was chosen as the first graphical component of The Battle for Middle-earth II to take advantage of DirectX 9 programmable shaders. These additions were part of an overall Electronic Arts strategy to continue the Lord of the Rings experience that began with the trilogy film series.|$|E
5|$|There were no fights {{straight}} {{after the}} next restart, which resulted in booing from the crowd. Within 24 seconds of that restart, the crowd had their way; Mark Recchi hit Wade Redden, who immediately launched himself into a fight with John LeClair. While those two fought, Recchi and Bryan Smolinski engaged in a second fight {{in the middle of}} the rink. LeClair received an additional penalty for holding, placing the Senators on the power play. At the next face-off, a fight once again broke out straight away, between Jason Spezza and Patrick Sharp. Spezza received a fighting major, a misconduct and double game misconduct, totalling 35 penalty minutes, the most of any <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, and tragic heroine of the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse that turns humans into fiends. Believing {{that there is no}} cure for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Ayane, a young female ninja and one of the DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E

5000|$|A pooling {{equilibrium}} in {{game theory}} is an equilibria {{result of a}} signaling game. In a signaling game, players send actions called [...] "signals" [...] to other <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Signaling actions are chosen based on privately held information (not known by other <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game).</b> These actions do not reveal a player's [...] "type" [...] to other <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and other <b>players</b> will choose strategies accordingly. Under this equilibria, all types of a given sender will send the same signal, some representing their true type, some correctly mimicking the type of others, as they have no incentive to differentiate themselves. The receiver therefore acts like having received no information/message maximizing his/her utility according to his/her prior belief.|$|R

Energa Toruń also played off against Kraków in their own gym. Playing on Kraków was notable former WNBA player Anna DeForge, whom Lindsay had played against before. She was only able to make 14 points in the game during 34 minutes of play but she was able to make 20 rebounds. Defensively she had 2 blocks and made 2 passes. Energa Toruń eventually won the match in a surprise upset over TS Wisła Can Pack Kraków with 73 ponts. Kraków made 68 points.

500|$|The game's audio was {{generally}} well received, with IGN comparing some of Koji Kondo's {{pieces to the}} work of Philip Glass. Many atmospheric sounds and surround sound were designed to effectively immerse the <b>player</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> world. Some reviewers complained that the audio samples used in the game sounded dated; others considered this a benefit, calling them [...] "retro". Game Revolution called the sound [...] "good for the Nintendo, but not great in the larger scheme of things" [...] and noted that the cartridge format necessitated [...] "MIDI tunes that range from fair to terrible".|$|E

Glennon also set the ACC Championship Game record for pass completion percentage (66.7%) by completing 18 of his 27passes. Taylor, meanwhile, set ACC Championship Game records for longest run and longest quarterback {{run with a}} 31-yard scramble {{in the second quarter}} that helped set up the tying touchdown for Virginia Tech.
