25|$|Wool pants, or, once available, rubber <b>pants,</b> <b>were</b> {{sometimes}} used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber <b>pants</b> <b>were</b> harmful {{because they thought}} the rubber acted as a poultice and damaged the skin of infants. The constant problem to be overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter {{in contact with the}} skin, were the two main causes of these problems.|$|E
25|$|Black {{nationalism}} {{was increasingly}} influential in rap {{during the late}} 1980s, and fashions and hairstyles reflected traditional African influences. Blousy <b>pants</b> <b>were</b> popular among dance-oriented rappers like M.C. Hammer. Fezzes, kufis decorated with the Kemetic ankh, Kente cloth hats, Africa chains, dreadlocks, and Black Nationalist colors of red, black, and green became popular as well, promoted by artists such as Queen Latifah, KRS-One, Public Enemy, and X-Clan.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pants.</b> <b>Pants</b> <b>are</b> {{manufactured}} in nylon and mesh (for hot weather practices), and nylon and spandex for a tight fit (with team colors) for games. Most <b>pants</b> <b>are</b> manufactured {{with the traditional}} lace-up fly as a zippered fly is impractical and subject to damage due to stress in the rough and tumble of the game. The interior sides of the pants legs contain four individual pockets to hold two thigh pads (one for each leg) and two knee pads. The pads are placed in the pockets before the <b>pants</b> <b>are</b> put on in the locker room. The <b>pants</b> <b>are</b> secured with a belt, sometimes with a traditional metal buckle or with several rings. Game-used jerseys and <b>pants</b> <b>are</b> sports collectibles, with those of celebrity athletes realizing high sums.|$|R
25|$|Experimentation {{continued}} in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes {{on the white}} <b>pants</b> <b>were</b> replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, {{one in which the}} stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005. In 2006, the traditional orange-brown-orange sequence returned.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{problems}} with the uniforms themselves. The pants for chokuninkan were designated as being white, but in Europe white <b>pants</b> <b>were</b> only worn in court uniforms on special occasions. This issue was even pointed out by Otto von Bismarck when the Iwakura mission visited Germany. On September 18, 1877, an edict of the Daj≈ç-kan brought these pants into line with the coats, changing them to the same black wool material.|$|E

25|$|Trousers {{of various}} designs were worn {{throughout}} the Middle Ages in Europe, especially by men. Loose-fitting trousers were worn in Byzantium under long tunics, and were worn by many tribes, {{such as the}} Germanic tribes that migrated to Western Roman Empire in the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages, as evidenced by both artistic sources and such relics as the 4th-century costumes recovered from the Thorsberg peat bog (see illustration). Trousers in this period, generally called brais, varied in length and were often closed at the cuff or even had attached foot coverings, although open-legged <b>pants</b> <b>were</b> also seen.|$|E

Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.|$|E

25|$|The Oilers' uniforms {{consisted}} of blue or white jerseys, red trim, and white pants. From 1966 through 1971, the pants {{with both the}} blue and white jerseys were silver, to match {{the color of the}} helmets. The team commonly wore light blue pants on the road with the white jerseys from 1972 through 1994, {{with the exception of the}} 1980 season, and selected games in the mid 80s, when the team wore an all-white road combination. For selected games in 1973 and 1974, and again from 1981 through 1984, the Oilers wore their white jerseys at home. The light blue <b>pants</b> <b>were</b> discarded by coach Jeff Fisher in 1995.|$|E

Also the socks changed to a plain red. The cap changed slight as the 'P' was thinned, giving a more stylistic look. In the 2002‚Äì2003 season, the Major A team wore a black undershirt and socks, as well as a black with red brimmed cap instead of the traditional red for night games played on a Friday night. The night uniform was scrapped by 2004 and the singular uniform for all senior teams returned.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Rams wore blue {{pants with}} their white jerseys {{for a pair}} of early-season games, but after losses to the New York Giants and Seattle Seahawks, the Rams reverted to gold pants with their white jerseys.

The gold <b>pants</b> <b>were</b> used for only one regular season game at Seattle. The blue jerseys with white pants and white jerseys with blue pants combination were used most of the time. For the 2009 season, the Rams elected to wear the white pants with both jerseys {{for the majority of the}} time except the games against the Vikings and Texans (see below) where they wore the throwback jerseys from the 1999 season, week 2 in Washington when they wore gold pants with the blue jersey, and week 12 against Seattle when they wore blue pants with the blue jersey.|$|E

500|$|After {{creating}} Oliver's Green Arrow costume, Cranstoun had {{the task}} of crafting updated costume looks for Bart, Arthur, and Victor for the [...] "Justice" [...] episode. Cranstoun explained that even though Victor {{does not have any}} metal on his physical body like his comic book counterpart, she wanted to include a metallic look to his costume. The designer tried to give Victor a more [...] "futuristic" [...] feel, along with [...] "a bit of Transformer-y" [...] essence, by including angular pieces on his vest and coloring them silver, black, and purple. For Bart, the costume designers tried to take what was used in his season four appearance and move that to the next level. In season four, Bart wore a red hoodie with yellow cargo pants, which were used to reflect his teenage identity. With his Justice League appearance, they tried to give the character an appearance that seemed faster.
