40|$|<b>Pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana) abundances {{commonly}} {{are estimated}} using fixed-wing surveys, but these estimates {{are likely to}} be negatively biased because of violations of key assumptions underpinning line-transect methodology. Reducing bias and improving precision of abundance estimates through use of detection probability and mark-resight models may allow for more responsive <b>pronghorn</b> management actions. Given their potential application in population estimation, we evaluated detection probability and mark-resight models for use in estimating <b>pronghorn</b> population abundance. We used logistic regression to quantify probabilities that detecting <b>pronghorn</b> might be influenced by group size, animal activity, percent vegetation, cover type, and topography. We estimated <b>pronghorn</b> population size by study area and year using mixed logit-normal mark-resight (MLNM) models. <b>Pronghorn</b> detection probability increased with group size, animal activity, and percent vegetation; overall detection probability was 0. 639 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 612 – 0. 667) with 396 of 620 <b>pronghorn</b> groups detected. Despite model selection uncertainty, the best detection probability models were 44 % (range[*]=[*] 8 – 79 %) and 180 % (range[*]=[*] 139 – 217 %) greater than traditional <b>pronghorn</b> population estimates. Similarly, the best MLNM models were 28 % (range[*]=[*] 3 – 58 %) and 147 % (range[*]=[*] 124 – 180 %) greater than traditional population estimates. Detection probability of <b>pronghorn</b> was not constant but depended on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. When <b>pronghorn</b> detection probability is a function of animal group size, animal activity, landscape complexity, and percent vegetation, traditional aerial survey techniques will result in biased <b>pronghorn</b> abundance estimates. Standardizing survey conditions, increasing resighting occasions, or accounting for variation in individual heterogeneity in mark-resight models will increase the accuracy and precision of <b>pronghorn</b> population estimates...|$|R

25|$|The {{contribution}} of ungulates to the diet of golden eagles {{has long been}} the most controversial and debated aspect of the species' whole biology. In total, deer comprise about 4.97% of all golden eagle food, bovids about 4.92%, pigs about 0.71% and <b>pronghorns</b> less than that. The occasional hunting by eagles of domestic stock and preferred game species has been used as the justification for population control. Sheep farmers in Scotland have historically claimed that up to 80% of deaths in their flocks were caused by eagles. Leslie Brown claimed, to the opposite extreme, that it was “physically impossible” for a golden eagle to kill any ungulate scaling several times their own weight. The truth lies somewhere in between. Almost all predation on live ungulates is directed at lambs, fawns or kids and these mostly in {{the first few months of}} life. Once they exceed a certain size, it is not practical for breeding eagles to predate the growing ungulates, not only due to the difficult and dangerous nature of the kill but also the fact it would be too heavy to carry to the nest.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of Elephant Odyssey is the Fossil Portal, an artificial tar pit that periodically drains to reveal man-made Pleistocene-era bones. The path turns {{a corner and}} opens up at the Mammoth Passage Plaza, with exhibits for jaguars and African lions to the left, an exhibit that has housed two-toed sloths to the right, and {{the tip of the}} elephant exhibit, with a large wading pool, straight ahead. The path continues to the left along the pool, passing by the jaguar exhibit on the left. The northern end of the elephant pool drains into the Mixed Species Exhibit, which houses tapirs, capybaras, and guanacos. The path meets up with the elephant exhibit again before it reaches the Elephant Care Center, where visitors can watch keepers care for the animals. Next is an exhibit for secretarybirds with grasses, a tree and a statue of the extinct Daggett's eagle nearby. Afterwards, the path goes down a crevasse with a wall embedded with vivaria for dung beetles and diving beetles, among other aquatic insects. The path tunnels below the elephant exhibit to reach the other side, where it continues between the elephant exhibit and a creek for native reptiles and amphibians. Just past the source of the stream is a restaurant and gift shop, and after that is a couple of exhibits for <b>pronghorns,</b> horses, and camels. Next the path splits between a playground, a rattlesnake terrarium, and a California condor aviary with artificial rock spires and a stream. The paths then reunite and join the rest of the zoo.|$|E

Wildlife managers need <b>pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana) movement data in North Dakota because harvest quotas are based on a summer survey, which might not represent the distribution of <b>pronghorn</b> during the fall hunting season. Using data from 121 radio-collared <b>pronghorn,</b> we quantified migration dates, distance, direction and site fidelity for <b>pronghorn</b> in North Dakota, 2004 - 2008. Nearly half (45 %) of the <b>pronghorn</b> were migratory, moving [greater than] 15 km between winter and summer ranges. Of the migratory <b>pronghorn,</b> 89 % moved northeast in the spring, and 97 % moved southwest in the fall. <b>Pronghorn</b> showed higher fidelity to summer ranges than winter ranges. Few fall migrations occurred between the survey and the hunting season; therefore, during our years of study, the survey accurately reflected unit occupancy of <b>pronghorn</b> for the hunting season. It is also important to identify <b>pronghorn</b> seasonal habitat use to guide land management decisions, inform mitigation processes and identify limited resources. We modeled summer and winter resource selection for 50 GPS-collared, female adult <b>pronghorn</b> in North Dakota, 2005 - 2008. We used vegetation type, ruggedness and distance to nearest roads as predictors. During both seasons, <b>pronghorn</b> selected open vegetation types in non-rugged habitat. Primary roads were avoided in the summer and secondary roads were avoided during both seasons. Reduction of open vegetation, or increased road developments, in non-rugged areas where habitat is limited, might decrease the suitability of available <b>pronghorn</b> habitat...|$|R

40|$|In general, when an {{archaeologist}} addresses {{the issue of}} faunal procurement on the Plains, especially the northern Plains, the model used entails the communal hunting of bison. The non-communal procurement of a secondary prey species is frequently overlooked by Plains archaeologists. It is {{the intent of this}} thesis to present a <b>pronghorn</b> procurement strategy that aligns itself with the current archaeological evidence, gathered from across the northern Plains. Based on the abundance of Wyoming and Great Basin communal <b>pronghorn</b> procurement features, along with a single northern Plains trapping structure, the procurement of <b>pronghorn</b> is often regarded as a communal undertaking. However, a review of the site literature reveals that archaeological <b>pronghorn</b> remains are present in small quantities in numerous habitation sites situated throughout their prehistoric range. In addition, evidence for <b>pronghorn</b> kill sites on the northern Plains is minimal at present. This leaves one to ponder the question; why are small quantities of <b>pronghorn</b> remains present in campsites across the northern Plains? The first part of this thesis addresses the above question through the examination of the unique behavioural and morphological characteristics of the <b>pronghorn,</b> as well as bow and arrow technology. This is undertaken in order to demonstrate the suitability of both the <b>pronghorn</b> and the aboriginal hunting technology to small-scale procurement. In addition ethnographic, historic and archaeological data concerning <b>pronghorn</b> procurement on the northern Plains are presented in a framework that allows for a revision of prevailing models concerning this activity. In addition, small-scale and communal procurement is analyzed within the theoretical framework of optimal foraging theory. This provides evidence that the small-scale hunting of <b>pronghorn</b> was an efficient hunting strategy and therefore {{it is reasonable to assume}} that it was practiced prehistorically. The remainder of this thesis addresses a secondary, yet relevant, question involving the lack of visibility of <b>pronghorn</b> remains in the archaeological record. If <b>pronghorn</b> were an obtainable and useful secondary resource then why are such small quantities of bone present at archaeological sites situated within ideal <b>pronghorn</b> habitat? This question is explored within the context of bone survivorship. With both cultural and non-cultural reasons for the differential preservation of <b>pronghorn</b> remains being outlined. Specifically, carnivore attrition, weathering and trampling are explored as possible non-cultural agents that affect the archaeological visibility of <b>pronghorn</b> assemblages. Cultural processes include primary/secondary butchering and processing strategies as well as carcass transportation decisions are also investigated. In addition, the <b>pronghorn</b> assemblages from EbPi- 75 and D 1 Ou- 72 are statistically tested to determine if bone density has any correlation to element frequency. Finally, the two recently excavated northern Plains <b>pronghorn</b> assemblages from EbPi- 75 and D 1 Ou- 72 are analyzed and compared to the existing body of archaeological research from the northern Plains, High Plains, and the Wyoming Basin. From this comparison and the thesis research in general, a new model for <b>pronghorn</b> procurement is developed that better suits the northern Plains archaeological record to date...|$|R

40|$|While {{terrestrial}} seasonal migrations worldwide {{continue to}} decline, the migrations of <b>pronghorn</b> antelope (Antilocapra americana) in the Northern Great Plains remain poorly studied. Development due to energy exploration and extraction within this region has recently increased, possibly placing restrictions on <b>pronghorn</b> movement. In this study, I used two habitat modeling methods, maximum entropy and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), to identify suitable <b>pronghorn</b> habitat, and two corridor modeling methods, circuit theory and least-cost path, to identify seasonal migration corridors. I used <b>pronghorn</b> locations during the 2008 {{spring and fall}} migration seasons to identify which habitat and corridor models perform the best based on <b>pronghorn</b> occupancy and area included in the corridor. The maximum entropy model performed better than AHP, resulting in corridors that included more <b>pronghorn</b> locations than those created using AHP. Additionally, corridors derived from circuit theory included more <b>pronghorn</b> locations within a smaller area than those created using the least-cost path method. I recommend using the maximum entropy cost surface and the area of overlap between the two corridors at 15 % habitat suitability level for future management actions. Without further study and conservation efforts built on this new knowledge, <b>pronghorn</b> populations may eventually decline and the functioning and biodiversity of the Northern Great Plains may be greatly impaired...|$|R

40|$|Populations of <b>pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana) are {{subjected}} to multiple forms of density-dependent and density-independent regulation. Little {{is known about the}} combined effects of these variables across multiple populations throughout the landscape. The objectives of this study were to examine long-term trends in density and recruitment in <b>pronghorn</b> and to assess how different forms of regulation influence these trends. We used multiple density-dependent and density-independent explanatory variables in a model selection process to explain variation in <b>pronghorn</b> density and July fawn : doe ratios from 1955 to 1993 in 4 <b>pronghorn</b> management units in Nebraska. We also investigated levels of density-dependent feedback in each management unit. Examination of long-term population trends suggested that <b>pronghorn</b> populations in Nebraska exhibited an Allee effect (inverse density dependence), in which population growth decreases as density decreases. We suggest that variation in rangeland condition and presence of adequate forage could explain the presence of the Allee effect. Both density-dependent and density-independent variables affected <b>pronghorn</b> populations, with density of cattle, spring precipitation, abundance of winter wheat, and hunting harvest most important for explaining fluctuations in <b>pronghorn</b> densities. Snow depth and density of cattle best explained yearly July fawn : doe ratios. The importance of each factor was variable across the different management units.

40|$|Habitat {{quality is}} an {{important}} factor that can greatly affect wildlife populations. <b>Pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana) habitat in the Texas Panhandle, USA has been lost through growth of human settlements and agricultural lands.
