As starting material {{for the construction of}} networks, we used twinned vesicle pairs, one of which is multilamellar and functions as a membrane donor and the other unilamellar and functions as a membrane acceptor upon manipulation. By electromechanical insertion of a <b>pipet</b> <b>tip</b> into the unilamellar vesicle followed by lateral pulling of the micropipet away from the vesicle, a nanotube was formed. Buffer solution contained in the pipet was then injected into the nanotube orifice, forming a vesicle of controlled size that was immobilized on the surface.

40|$|By {{exploiting}} {{the capabilities of}} steady-state electrochemical measurements, we have measured the inner diameter of a lipid nanotube using Fick’s first law of diffusion in conjunction with an imposed linear concentration gradient of electroactive molecules over {{the length of the}} nanotube. Fick’s law has been used in this way to provide a direct relationship between the nanotube diameter and the measurable experimental parameters Δi (change in current) and nanotube length. Catechol was used to determine the Δi attributed to its flux out of the nanotube. Comparing the nanotube diameter as a function of nanotube length revealed that membrane elastic energy was playing an important role in determining the size of the nanotube and was different when the tube was connected to either end of two vesicles or to a vesicle on one end and a <b>pipet</b> <b>tip</b> on the other. We assume that repulsive interaction between neck regions can be used to explain the trends observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{demonstrates}} that the gas-filled compartments in the packing material commonly called “bubble wrap ” can be repurposed in resource-limited regions as containers to store liquid samples, and to perform bioanalyses. The bubbles of bubble wrap are easily filled by injecting the samples into them using a syringe with a needle or a <b>pipet</b> <b>tip,</b> and then sealing the hole with nail hardener. The bubbles are transparent in the visible range of the spectrum, {{and can be used}} as “cuvettes ” for absorbance and fluorescence measurements. The interiors of these bubbles are sterile and allow storage of samples without the need for expensive sterilization equipment. The bubbles are also permeable to gases, and can be used to culture and store micro-organisms. By incorporating carbon electrodes, these bubbles can be used as electrochemical cells. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of the bubbles by culturing E. coli, growing C. elegans, measuring glucose and hemoglobin spectrophotometrically, and measuring ferrocyanide electrochemically, all within the bubbles. The storage, transportation, manipulation, and analysis ofsamples and reagents for applications in public health, agriculture, veterinary medicine, and environmental monitoring require appropriate containers.

Standard curves prepared in human plasma for verapamil (r(2) = 0. 999) and its metabolite norverapamil (r(2) = 0. 998) were linear over a range of 2. 5 - 500 ng/ mL. Based on the observed precision and accuracy, a lower limit of quantitation of 5 ng/mL was assigned for both analytes. Sample preparation consisted of protein precipitation with an organic solvent containing the structural analogue gallopamil as an internal standard. Protein precipitation was selected both to maximize throughput and to test the robustness of direct nanoelectrospray infusion. Aliquots of supernatant (10 muL) were transferred to the back plane of the chip using disposable, conductive pipet tips for direct infusion at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.

40|$|Primary {{neuronal}} cell {{cultures are}} valuable tools to study protein function since {{they represent a}} more biologically relevant system compared to immortalized cell lines. However, the post-mitotic nature of primary neurons prevents effective heterologous protein expression using common procedures such as electroporation or chemically-mediated transfection. Thus, other techniques must be employed in order to effectively express proteins in these non-dividing cells. In this article, we describe the steps required to perform intranuclear injections of cDNA constructs into dissociated adult sympathetic neurons. This technique, which {{has been applied to}} different types of neurons, can successfully induce heterologous protein expression. The equipment essential for the microinjection procedure includes an inverted microscope to visualize cells, a glass injection pipet filled with cDNA solution that is connected to a N 2 (g) pressure delivery system, and a micromanipulator. The micromanipulator coordinates the injection motion of microinjection pipet with a brief pulse of pressurized N 2 to eject cDNA solution from the <b>pipet</b> <b>tip.</b> This technique does not have the toxicity associated with many other transfection methods and enables multiple DNA constructs to be expressed at a consistent ratio. The low number of injected cells makes the microinjection procedure well suited for single cell studies such as electrophysiological recordings and optical imaging, but may not be ideal for biochemical assays that require a larger number of cells and higher transfection efficiencies. Although intranuclear microinjections require an investment of equipment and time, the ability to achieve high levels of heterologous protein expression in a physiologically relevant environment makes this technique a very useful tool to investigate protein function...|$|E

The tube is incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and 10 ml L broth containing 10 mM MgC 12 and 0. 1 % glucose is added. The tube is shaken overnight at a 45 ° incline, with the cap in the half-opened position. The tubes are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the bacterial debris. The supernatant is centrifuged in a SW 41 rotor (Beckman) at 30, 000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet is suspended in 200 u. 1 of SM (1) and transferred to a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube.

40|$|Authors: Chee Wai Chua, Maho Shibata, Ming Lei, Roxanne Toivanen, LaMont Barlow & Michael Shen ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes a}} novel three-dimensional “organoid” culture for prostate epithelial cells. We describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, {{the isolation of}} epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting, and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. The dissection and dissociation of prostate tissue and the preparation of cells for plating takes 8 - 9 hours. Organoids that can be quantified and analyzed are obtained after 7 - 10 days. Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of both normal and transformed organoids, and should be useful for studies of normal prostate as well as prostate cancer. ### Introduction Three-dimensional “organoid” culture techniques {{have been used for}} culture of stem/progenitor cells from tissues including the small intestine, stomach, liver and pancreas (1 - 4). We have developed a novel method for the culture of prostate epithelial organoids that display tissue architecture resembling that of the normal prostate (5). Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of prostate luminal cells, which have historically been difficult to grow, and differs from previous “prostasphere” conditions, which favor the growth of prostate basal cells and fail to display a response to androgen deprivation (6). In particular, our organoid culture conditions allow for the growth of prostate organoids from single luminal stem/progenitor cells, as well as mouse tumor organoids, and thus should be widely applicable for studies of prostate biology. Notably, our culture methods are distinct from recently published conditions for prostate organoid culture using defined media conditions (7, 8). In the following protocol, we describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, the isolation of epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using antibodies against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, also CD 326) and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin, also CD 324), and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture using supplemented hepatocyte medium with 5 % Matrigel. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. ### Materials 1. 1 Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. 1 or 2 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice (or mice of interest) - PBS (for dissection) - 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase solution (STEMCELL Technologies # 07912) - Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F- 12 (DMEM/F- 12, Gibco # 10565) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) 1. 2 Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA (STEMCELL Technologies # 07901) - Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution Modified (HBSS, STEMCELL Technologies # 37150), supplemented with 2 % FBS - Dispase 5 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07913) - DNaseI 1 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07900) - Trypan blue solution 0. 4 % (Gibco # 15250 - 061) - HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 (STEMCELL Technologies # 07171) (Critical: We recommend purchasing ROCK inhibitor from STEMCELL Technologies for consistent results.) 1. 3.

Medium preparation and cell plating 1. 96 -well low-attachment plate (Corning # 3474) - 24 -well flat bottom plate (BD # 353047) (for embedding culture) - Hepatocyte medium (Corning # 355056) (Tip: This reagent has regularly been on back order. Check in advance for availability.) - 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; comes with Corning # 3555056) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS (Gibco # 12676) (Critical: Charcoal-stripped FBS must be heat-inactivated prior to use by heating in 55 °C water bath for 60 min. Heat-inactivated charcoal-stripped FBS can be aliquoted and stored at - 20 °C.) - 100 x Glutamax (Gibco # 35050) - Thawed matrigel (Corning # 354234) (Critical: After removal of Matrigel from storage at - 20 °C, it must remain on ice at all times until use to prevent polymerization. We recommend placing Matrigel on ice in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight to thaw and keeping it on ice until it is added to media. Unused Matrigel can be refrozen, but avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.) - 5 mM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 - 10 - 5 M dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in ethanol (Sigma #A- 8380) - 100 x antibiotic-antimycotic (Caution: We recommend culturing without antibiotics, but antibiotics can be added during the initial culture period or if there is concern for contamination from other sources.) 1. 5. Passaging and freezing organoids 1. Cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) - 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA - HBSS + 2 % FBS - Prepared organoid media (see 2. 4) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS - Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma #D 2650) ### Equipment 1. CO 2 euthanasia chamber - Dissecting microscope - Micro-dissecting instruments - Water baths set at 37 °C and 55 °C - Sterile petri dishes - Eppendorf tubes (1. 5 mL) - Incubator, humidified at 37 °C, with 5 % CO 2 - Laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet - Centrifuges (for Eppendorf and Falcon tubes) - Falcon tubes (15 and 50 mL) - Orbital shaker - Cell strainer 40 uM (Corning # 352340) - Hemocytometer - BD FACSAria cell sorter (or similar) ### Procedure Critical: The volumes detailed below are for dissociation of an intact prostate from an 8 - 12 week wild type mouse. For larger prostate samples such as those from aggressive tumor models, all reagents should be increased proportionally from the volumes suggested below. For example, if a prostate tumor is approximately twice the size of a wild type prostate, 2 x the volume of suggested reagents should be used. 2. 1. Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. In tissue culture hood, combine 200 µL 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture with 1. 8 mL DMEM/F 12 + 5 % FBS. Place in 37 °C water bath until ready to use. - Resect mouse prostates and transfer to sterile petri dish containing cold PBS for dissection 6. Using a dissecting microscope, fine forceps, and sharp scissors, remove residual fat from prostate tissue. - Fill 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of diluted pre-warmed collagenase/hyaluronidase solution and transfer prostate tissue into the tube. - Using small, sharp sterile scissors, macerate the prostate tissue by rapidly opening and closing the scissors inside the tube to cut the tissue into small pieces. Fill the tube with an additional 400 - 500 µL dilute collagenase/hyaluronidase solution until almost full. - Incubate in 37 °C incubator for 3 hours. (Tip: The Eppendorf tube may be placed on its side in a sterile petri dish to maximize the surface area of prostate tissue exposed to collagenase/hyaluronidase solution. Periodic shaking of the tube to redistribute prostate tissue is helpful.) 2. 2. Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. Centrifuge digested tissue at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1. 5 mL cold 0. 25 % trypsin-EDTA and transfer to 50 mL conical tube. Incubate in 4 °C refrigerator for 1 hour. (Caution: To minimize cell death, keep trypsin ≤ 4 °C prior to and during use. Trypsin can be gently thawed overnight with Matrigel and kept on ice. An orbital shaker can be used during the trypsinization step for optimal digestion.) - During trypsinization, place 900 µL dispase in 37 °C water bath at least 10 minutes prior to use. Immediately before use, add 100 µL DNaseI to dispase solution. - After trypsinization is complete (1 hour), add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 2 x volume of trypsin) to quench reaction. Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Add 1 mL of pre-warmed dispase/DNaseI solution. Pipette the sample vigorously for 1 - 2 minutes using P 1000 pipette until solution is homogenously translucent with no visible tissue fragments. (Do not allow digestion to continue for more than 2 minutes.) (Critical: To maximize cell dissociation, this pipetting step should be done continuously.) - Add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 5 x volume of dispase) to quench reaction. - Filter cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube. - Centrifuge filtered suspension at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1 mL HBSS + 2 % FBS and transfer to 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube. - Count viable cells using a hemacytometer and trypan blue. - Centrifuge and resuspend cells in HBSS + 2 % FBS at 100 µL/ 1 × 10 e 6 cells. (If fewer than 1 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained, resuspend in 100 µL) 2. 3. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) *Keep cell suspension and reagents on ice until sorting is finished. 1. Divide cell suspension into four 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes as follows - a. Tube 1 (unstained control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - b. Tube 2 (PerCP control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - c. Tube 3 (APC control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - d. Tube 4 (sample for collection) : remaining sample (up to 1 mL) - Add FACS antibodies as follows: - a. Tube 1 : no antibody - b. Tube 2 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse E-cadherin PerCP-Efluor 710 antibody - c. Tube 3 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse APC-EpCAM antibody - d. Tube 4 : both antibodies at 1 : 100 dilution (1 µL antibody per 100 µL cell suspension). - (Critical: If fewer than 4 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained after enzymatic dissociation, use 10 µL of cell suspension for control tubes 1 - 3 and dilute with 90 µL HBSS + 2 % FBS for a total of 100 µL. Use the same antibody concentrations. Resuspend tubes 1 - 3 in 50 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS instead of 500 µL in step 6 of cell sorting and use 1 µL of dilute DAPI instead of 10 µL.) - Cover with foil and incubate on ice for 25 minutes. - Spin tubes at 350 rcf at 4 °C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Add 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS to all tubes. Spin at 350 rcf at 4 °C for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend all tubes in 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632. - Prepare a 1 : 100 dilution of 0. 5 mg/mL DAPI by adding 5 µL DAPI to 495 µL HBSS + 2 % FBS. Add 10 µL of dilute DAPI to each tube. - Transfer each suspension into a labeled round-bottom clear rubber-top plastic test tube for loading into sorter. - Prior to sorting, prepare multiple 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes pre-filled with 500 µL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 for collecting cells. - Perform sorting via sterile FACS facility (tubes 1 - 3 will be used to set appropriate gates; tube 4 will be used to collect cells for plating). Collecting cells at 60, 000 cells per tube will facilitate easier plating. Keep collected cells on ice until ready to plate. 2. 4. Medium preparation and cell plating 1. Prepare desired amount of culture medium by combining the following components to the indicated final concentrations (a-d can be combined and stored as a 50 mL aliquot at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks; e-h should be added on the day of use based on the amount of media needed) : - a. Hepatocyte medium (47 mL per 50 mL media) - b. 10 ng/mL EGF (100 µL of 5 µg/mL stock per 50 mL media) - c. 5 % heat-inactivated, charcoal-stripped FBS (2. 5 mL per 50 mL media) - d. 1 x Glutamax (500 µL per 50 mL media) - e. 5 % Matrigel (50 µL per 1 mL media) - f. 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 (2 µL of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media) - g. 100 nM DHT (10 µL of 10 e- 5 M stock per 1 mL media) - h. 1 x antibiotic-antimycotic (10 µL per 1 mL media; optional) - Keep prepared culture media at room temperature until use (rapid warming in 37 °C water bath may cause Matrigel to solidify at top of tube). - Centrifuge sorted cells at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in prepared media at 5, 000 cells per 100 µL media. (If cells were collected at 60, 000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 1. 2 mL media. If there is concern for cell death, count viable cells prior to centrifuging and resuspend accordingly.) - Add resuspended cells to 96 -well low attachment plate at 100 µL per well for a final plating density of 5, 000 cells per well. - Change media every 4 days by adding 100 µL fresh media to each well on days 4 and 8 after plating. On day 12, when wells are full (300 µL), transfer each well to a 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. Remove 200 µL of supernatant and add 100 µL fresh media (total volume will be 200 µL). Transfer onto a new 96 -well plate using P 1000 <b>pipet</b> <b>tip</b> (smaller tips may damage organoids). Alternate every 4 days between either adding 100 µL media or spinning down to remove 200 µL and add 100 µL until ready for passage. (Multiple wells can be pooled prior to centrifuging and redistributed evenly if there are many wells.) 2. 5. Cell plating using embedding conditions 1. Medium preparation is the same as in 2. 4. 1 except that component e is not added. Media can be pre-warmed in a 37 °C water bath. This pre-warmed media will be used to cover the solidified Matrigel ring in 2. 5. 7. - Prepare cold media as in 2. 4. 1 except that component e is not added and f is at a final concentration of 25 µM (5 µL of 5 mM stock per 1 mL media). Keep this media on ice and it will be used to resuspend cells. - Pellet cells as in 2. 4. 3 and resuspend in prepared cold media at 5, 000 cells per 40 µL media. (If cells were collected at 60, 000 cells per Eppendorf tube, resuspend in 480 µL media.) (Tip: For the embedding condition, the number of cells plated can be much lower.) - Mix the 40 µL media containing cells thoroughly with 60 µl Matrigel (If 60, 000 cells are resuspended in 480 µL media, mix with 720 µL Matrigel). Avoid bubbles. This step should be done on ice to prevent Matrigel solidification. - Plate the 100 µL media Matrigel mixture around the ring of a well in a 24 -well plate. - Incubate the 24 -well plate in 37 °C incubator for 30 minutes to allow the Matrigel ring to solidify. - Add 400 µL pre-warmed media as prepared in 2. 5. 1 to each well. (Critical: Make sure that the media is warm enough prior to addition to the well to avoid dissolving the Matrigel ring.) - Change media every 4 days by aspirating the media off the Matrigel ring and adding fresh media. (Tip: Aspiration should be performed {{from the middle of the}} well to avoid disturbing the Matrigel ring.) 2. 6. Passaging and freezing organoids 1. When organoids are large (usually 3 - 5 weeks after plating), prepare organoids for passage by transferring into 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes and spinning at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. (Multiple wells can be pooled.) Discard supernatant. - Wash cells in cold PBS and spin again at 250 rcf for 5 minutes. (Critical: Without this PBS washing step, the trypsin reaction will not be optimal due to residual FBS in the medium, resulting in incomplete dissociation into single cells.) - Add 1 mL warm 0. 25 % trypsin/EDTA and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 5 minutes. (Tip: In the context of very large organoids or organoids that are difficult to dissociate, step 3 can be replaced by incubation in cold 0. 25 % trypsin/EDTA at 4 °C for 30 minutes.) - Pipette up and down with P 200 <b>pipet</b> <b>tip</b> for 30 seconds to dissociate cells. - Transfer suspension into a 15 mL conical tube prefilled with 2 mL cold HBSS + 2 % FBS. - Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend cell pellet in fresh media and plate into a new low-attachment 96 -well plate. Cells can be plated by either replating 4 x the number of wells passaged in 100 µL per well or by counting viable cells and replating at 5, 000 cells/ 100 µL media per well. - Organoids can be frozen at any point during a passage cycle by centrifuging at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspending in 1 mL freezing media in 1. 8 mL cryo tubes (50 % FBS, 40 % hepatocyte media, 10 % DMSO). Gradual freezing to ≤ - 80 ° using an insulated cryofreezing container is recommended. Organoids should be thawed rapidly in a 37 °C water bath and immediately diluted in 10 mL HBSS + 2 % FBS per 1 mL freezing media. Centrifuge thawed organoids at 250 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspend in organoid culture media for plating. 2. 7. Passaging and freezing of embedded organoids 1. Dissolve the Matrigel ring by adding about 125 µL dispase at 5 mg/mL to each well of the 24 -well plate to make the final concentration of dispase 1 mg/ml. - Incubate in 37 °C incubator for 10 minutes. - If the Matrigel ring dissolves, proceed as in 2. 6. 1. If not, incubate at 37 °C for another 5 minutes. ### Timing It should take approximately 8 - 9 hours (depending on experience) from dissection of mouse tissue to plating of sorted epithelial cells. ### Troubleshooting 3. 1. Incomplete cell dissociation after dispase step 1. Check that all reagents are within the use by date - Make sure to thoroughly mince tissues prior to collagenase/hyaluronidase digestion. - During the dispase step, make sure the solution is pre-warmed at 37 °C for at least 10 minutes and perform vigorous pipetting of sample for up to 2 minutes. 3. 2. Organoids fail to form from plated cells 1. Ensure the DAPI aliquot being used results in optimal exclusion of dead cells during sorting. Replace if necessary. - Decrease the speed and pressure used during sorting. 3. 3. Plated cells form adherent cultures instead of organoids 1. Ensure you are using a low-attachment surface plate. - Some low-attachment brands will still result in adherent cultures. We have found that the Costar plates from Corning are optimal for minimizing cell adherence. ### Anticipated Results Organoid formation from plated cells is a rapid process, and small organoids should be identifiable after about 3 days for organoids from wild-type mice, or within 24 hours for organoids derived from mouse models of prostate cancer. Organoid forming efficiency should be quantitated approximately 7 - 10 days after plating of sorted cells. Wild-type cells should generate large cystic structures, while tumor cells will form more solid organoids. If the EpCAM E-Cadherin sorting strategy is utilized, there should not be any evidence of fibroblast cells in organoid cultures. ### References 1. Sato, T. et al.

From {{the information contained in}} these unique functions (obtained from individual molecules), one can extract a relatively clear picture on the way the system behaves; e.g. its kinetic scheme, or its potential of activity, or its reduced dimensions form. In particular, one can construct (many properties of) the reaction pathway of an enzyme when monitoring the activity of an individual enzyme. Additionally, significant aspects regarding the analysis of single molecule data—such as fitting methods and tests for homogeneous populations—have been described by several authors. [...] On the other hand, there are several issues with the analysis of single molecule data including construction of a low noise environment and insulated <b>pipet</b> <b>tips,</b> filtering some of the remaining unwanted components (noise) found in recordings, and the length of time required for data analysis (pre-processing, unambiguous event detection, plotting data, fitting kinetic schemes, etc.).|$|R

Our findings were as follows: 1. Most cells displayed a localized calcium rise in response to micropipet aspiration. This represented an average threefold increase as compared to resting level, and it was observed during the first 10 s following aspiration. A slow return to initial level occurred within about 3 min. Further, this calcium rise involved a mobilization of intracellular stores, since it was not prevented by adding a calcium chelator into the extracellular medium. 2. All micropipet-aspirated cells displayed a local accumulation of microfilaments, with a preferential localization in the cell protrusions or near the <b>pipet</b> <b>tips.</b> 3.

5000|$|BSA has {{numerous}} biochemical applications including ELISAs (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry. Because BSA is a small, stable, moderately non-reactive protein, it {{is often}} used as a blocker in immunohistochemistry. During immunohistochemistry, which is the process that uses antibodies to identify antigens in cells, tissue sections are often incubated with BSA blockers to bind nonspecific binding sites. This binding of BSA to nonspecific binding sites increases the chance that the antibodies will bind only to the antigens of interest. The BSA blocker improves sensitivity by decreasing background noise as the sites are covered with the moderately non-reactive protein. During this process, minimization of nonspecific binding of antibodies is essential in order to acquire the highest signal to noise ratio. BSA is also used as a nutrient in cell and microbial culture. In restriction digests, BSA is used to stabilize some enzymes during the digestion of DNA and to prevent adhesion of the enzyme to reaction tubes, <b>pipet</b> <b>tips,</b> and other vessels. [...] This protein does not affect other enzymes that do not need it for stabilization. BSA is also commonly {{used to determine the}} quantity of other proteins, by comparing an unknown quantity of protein to known amounts of BSA (see Bradford protein assay). BSA is used because of its ability to increase signal in assays, its lack of effect in many biochemical reactions, and its low cost, since large quantities of it can be readily purified from bovine blood, a byproduct of the cattle industry.|$|R
40|$|Pain and {{depression}} are universally linked: people with depression often complain of pain, and those suffering from persistent pain {{are at an}} increased risk for depression. The present investigation explores the potential role of progesterone metabolism in both pain {{and depression}}. The first manuscript describes the effect of olfactory bulbectomy (a model of depression in the rat linked to changes in progesterone metabolism) on formalin-induced pain. Pain was increased in bulbectomized rats {{in the second phase}} of the formalin test. Two-week treatment with amitriptyline did not affect pain responses, while fluoxetine was antinociceptive in both olfactory bulbectomized and control rats. The second manuscript describes antinociceptive properties of six progesterone metabolites administered systemically to rats. 3 alpha-reduced metabolites produced a biphasic response. Pain was reduced at low doses and this was reversed at higher doses. The dihydroprogesterones produced a similar effect but with lower potency. Their effect was reversed by indomethacin, indicating that their conversion to 3 alpha-reduced metabolites was required for nociception. 3 alpha-reduced metabolites were inactive. All antinociceptive effects were reversed by bicuculline. The physiological levels of ring A-reduced progesterone metabolites in the rat are not established. Manuscript 3 addresses the treatment of standards used in immunoassays: ethanol and plastic <b>pipet</b> <b>tips</b> should be avoided since they inflate measured values of standards and cause underestimation of analyte levels. Manuscript 4 describes the development of a competitive binding assay with colorimetric detection, which [...] -at desired sensitivity [...] -outperformed the commonly used radioimmunoassay in terms of precision, sample processing time and overall cost. The limit of detection ranged from 6 pg for progesterone and pregnanolone to 54 pg for epipregnanolone, and imprecision was 12 %. Normal levels of progesterone and its metabolites were measured in male rat plasma. The most abundant were 5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone and pregnanolone, followed by progesterone, allopregnanolone, isopregnanolone, epipregnanolone and 5 beta-dihydroprogesterone. The levels of 5 beta-reduced metabolites had previously not been measured and were believed not to be naturally occurring metabolites in rats. The measured levels of other compounds were in agreement with reports measuring some of the metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or highly specific RIA...|$|R

40|$|Authors: Sarah Reppert, Katerina Andreev, Sandra Wittmann & Susetta Finotto ### Abstract Lung {{cancer is}} one of the most {{frequently}} occurring cancer types. Successful lung cancer therapies in patients require preliminary investigations of promising therapeutic reagents in animal models. This protocol describes a method to induce lung tumours in mice and to deliver an immunoregulatory molecule directly to the lung by intranasal application. Here we describe the usage of murine cell lines L 1 C 2 and B 16 F 10 for the induction of lung adenocarcinoma or metastatic melanoma respectively. In this model the tumour cells are injected intravenously in the tail vein of the mice. To apply therapeutic reagents locally in the lung during tumour growth, the mice are anaesthetized and the therapeutic molecule is applied drop by drop into the nose of the mouse at different time points after tumour induction. To monitor the outcome of the therapy tumour size can be defined by analyzing Haematoxilin/Eosin stained slices of the lung. ### Introduction Advancements in novel therapies for lung cancer in patients require an understanding and monitoring of the immune response mechanisms in humans as well as improvements of the experimental model of the disease. To investigate the immune responses in lung cancer, mouse models are a helpful tool. In our laboratory we standardized a method to induce lung cancer and to apply therapeutic molecules to the lungs of mice. The technique of lung tumour induction facilitates the analysis of the effects of different therapeutical molecules in the anti-tumour immune response. Here we show two models of lung tumours, the B 16 -F 10 metastatic melanoma model and the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model. Previous studies have been performed in our group both in wild type and in knockout mice in the melanoma model (1) as well as in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model (2). Tumour development can be analyzed at different stages after intravenous tumour cell injection. It can be evaluated by quantifying the lung areas which are invaded with tumour cells on the lung surface as well as by analyzing lung sections stained with Haematoxilin/Eosin. Our laboratory showed that intranasal application of particular neutralizing antibodies as well as other biological active molecules ensures a localized effect in the lung (3 - 5). Using this protocol we repeatedly achieved a reduction of lung tumour growth in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma mouse model after intranasal application of a neutralizing anti-IL 17 A antibody (6). In contrast to other methods like intraperitoneal or intravenous injection of therapeutical molecules, the intranasal protocol provides the possibility to deliver the therapy directly to the affected lung. ### Reagents **Tumour cell induction** 1.

We suggest using 2 × 10 e 5 tumour cells per mouse for intravenous injection in the tail vein. The experimental procedure takes approximately 21 days. In case of using other mouse strains than wild type mice, the number of cells for injection and the time duration of the experiment needs to be tested and established first. Intranasal application of antibodies can be performed at different time points as well as in different dosages after tumour cell injection. The amount of antibody depends on the amount of protein you intend to neutralize in the lung. The data sheet of the antibody or previous publications might give a hint. As a possible control animals can be treated with PBS or the corresponding isotype antibody instead of the specific blocking antibody. We suggest the application of the antibody at two time points after tumour cell injection (Figure 1). To analyze the tumour growth, lung tissue can be embedded in paraffin cut into 4 micrometers thick sections which will be then stained with Hemtaoxilin/Eosin (H&E;) in accordance to standardized histological laboratory protocols. Afterwards the tumour-bearing area can be analyzed. For this purpose, stained sections can be displayed on a computer monitor with a computer linked Nikon Coolscan V ED scanner using the Program SF launcher thereby determining the ratio of the area of the lung section occupied by tumour to the lung section tumour-free area. To classify the tumour type the affected areas the slide must be further analyzed with a light microscope (e. g. Zeiss Axio Observer. D 1; Axio Vision 4. 7 software) using different magnifications. **Tumour induction** REAGENT SETUP Prepare the cell culture media DMEM + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for B 16 F 10 cells and RPMI + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for L 1 C 2 cells and store it at 4 °C.

Alternatively, the tail can also be warmed using an infrared lamp. - Take up 200 µl cell suspension in the syringe. - Insert the syringe horizontally in the tail vein of the mouse and inject the cell suspension slowly (Figure 2 d). - TIMING: 30 min. **Intranasal application** REAGENT SETUP - Prepare the solution for intranasal treatment and store it on ice. For this purpose make-up the stock concentration of the antibody or of the therapeutical molecule according to the manufacturer´s protocol (often in buffer containing BSA). Dilutions of antibodies or other therapeutical molecules, to set up the working solution for intranasal delivery, should be done with sterofundin or NaCl.
