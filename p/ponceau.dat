25|$|The {{term was}} invented by Peter Stephen Du <b>Ponceau,</b> who {{considered}} polysynthesis, as characterized by sentence words and noun incorporation, {{a defining feature of}} all Native American languages. This characterization was shown to be wrong, since many indigenous American languages are not polysynthetic, but {{it is a fact that}} polysynthetic languages are not evenly distributed throughout the world, but more frequent in the Americas, Australia, Siberia, and New Guinea; however, there are also examples in other areas. The concept became part of linguistic typology with the work of Edward Sapir, who used it as one of his basic typological categories. Recently, Mark C. Baker has suggested formally defining polysynthesis as a macro-parameter within Noam Chomsky's principles and parameters theory of grammar. Other linguists question the basic utility of the concept for typology since it covers many separate morphological types that have little else in common.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "polysynthesis" [...] {{was first}} used by Peter Stephen DuPonceau (a.k.a. Pierre Étienne Du <b>Ponceau)</b> in 1819 as a term to {{describe}} the structural characteristics of American languages [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Baron, his Italian greyhound, Azor (which he {{took with}} him everywhere), his young aide de camp Louis de Pontière, his {{military}} secretary, Peter Stephen Du <b>Ponceau</b> (then called Pierre Etienne Du <b>Ponceau),</b> {{and two other}} companions, reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire on December 1, 1777, where they were almost arrested for being British because Steuben had mistakenly outfitted them in red uniforms. They were extravagantly entertained in Boston. On February 5, 1778 Steuben and his party arrived in York, Pennsylvania, where the Continental Congress had relocated after being ousted from Philadelphia by the British advance. Arrangements were made for Steuben to be paid following the successful completion of the war according to his contributions. He arrived at Valley Forge on February 23, 1778, and reported for duty as a volunteer. One soldier's first impression of the Baron was [...] "of the ancient fabled God of War ... he seemed to me a perfect personification of Mars. The trappings of his horse, the enormous holsters of his pistols, his large size, and his strikingly martial aspect, all seemed to favor the idea. He turned the volunteers into a great army" ...|$|E
2500|$|Von Steuben {{was most}} likely gay. [...] His exits from the court of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and from Paris were under clouds of {{accusation}} of homosexual activity. Von Steuben arrived in the United States with his 17-year-old secretary, Peter Stephen Du <b>Ponceau,</b> who is rumored to have been his lover. At Valley Forge, he began close relationships with Benjamin Walker and William North, then both military officers in their 20s, which are assumed by many to have been romantic. Because homosexuality was criminalized at the time, records of his relationships are limited to references in correspondences.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his accession {{to the title}} of Dauphin, Charles had to face threats to his inheritance, and {{he was forced to}} flee from Paris on 29 May 1418 after the partisans of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, had entered the city the previous night. By 1419, Charles had established his own court in Bourges and a Parlement in Poitiers. On 11 July of that same year, Charles and John the Fearless attempted a reconciliation by signing, on a small bridge near Pouilly-le-Fort, not far from Melun where Charles was staying, the Treaty of Pouilly-le-Fort known also under name of Paix du <b>Ponceau</b> (<b>ponceau</b> from French pont, [...] "bridge", is a small one-span bridge thrown over a stream). They also decided that a further meeting should take place the following 10 September. On that date, they met on the bridge at Montereau. The Duke assumed that the meeting would be entirely peaceful and diplomatic, thus he brought only a small escort with him. The Dauphin's men reacted to the Duke's arrival by attacking and killing him. Charles' level of involvement has remained uncertain to this day. Although he claimed to have been unaware of his men's intentions, this was considered unlikely by those who heard of the murder. The assassination marked the end of any attempt of a reconciliation between the two factions Armagnacs and Burgundians, thus playing into the hands of Henry V of England. Charles was later required by a treaty with Philip the Good, the son of John the Fearless, to pay penance for the murder, which he never did.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{line between}} Yffiniac and Matignon was opened in stages. Yfinniac – St. Alban on 23 February 1924, St. Alban – Erquy on 3 February 1924, Erquy – Pléherel on 3 November 1925, Pléherel – Pléheron on 27 June 1926 and Pléheron – Matignon on 27 June 1926. It closed on 31 December 1948. In 1929, a train derailed at Port à la Dux. The {{locomotive}} fell down an embankment {{and the driver}} was killed. The main bridges on the line were the Viaduc de Caroual ou de Cavé, the <b>Ponceau</b> de la Côtière and the [...] Passerelle de la Côtière at Erquy, the [...] Viaduc des Ponts-Neufs at Hillion ( [...] long, [...] high), the Viaduc du Préto at Pléneuf-Val-André and the Viaduc de Port-Nieux at Fréhel.|$|E
2500|$|This step visualizes {{the total}} protein {{that has been}} {{successfully}} transferred to the membrane. Total protein staining allows the user to check the uniformity of protein transfer and to perform subsequent normalization of the target protein with the actual protein amount per lane. Normalization with the so-called [...] "loading control" [...] has based on immunostaining of housekeeping proteins in the classical procedure, but is heading toward total protein staining recently, due to multiple benefits. [...] At least seven different approaches for total protein staining have been described for Western blot normalization: <b>Ponceau</b> S, stain-free techniques, Sypro Ruby, Epicocconone, Coomassie R-350, Amido Black, and Cy5. [...] In order to avoid noise of signal, total protein staining should be performed before blocking of the membrane. Nevertheless, post-antibody stainings {{have been described as}} well.|$|E
2500|$|Munsee and Unami are linguistically very similar. Therefore, {{they have}} been {{considered}} dialects of one language, and both together have {{been referred to as}} the language of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians, {{as can be seen in}} the Grammar of the language of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians, written by the Moravian missionary David Zeisberger and published in a translation from German into English by Peter Stephen du <b>Ponceau</b> in 1827. Zeisberger does not even mention the [...] "dialect" [...] names when describing varying grammatical features, while the translator refers to them in two annotations. Despite their relative closeness the two are sufficiently distinguished by features of syntax, phonology, and vocabulary that speakers of both consider them not mutually intelligible so that, more recently, linguists have treated them as separate languages.|$|E
2500|$|As {{he could}} only speak and write {{a small amount of}} English, Steuben {{originally}} wrote the drills in the German dialect of Prussian, the military language of Europe at the time. His secretary, Du <b>Ponceau,</b> then translated the drills from Prussian into French, and a secretary for Washington translated it to English. They did this every single night so Washington could command his soldiers in the morning. Colonel Alexander Hamilton and General Nathanael Greene were of great help in assisting Steuben in drafting a training program for the Army. The Baron's willingness and ability to work with the men, as well as his use of profanity (in several different languages), made him popular among the soldiers. It is here he met his reputed future lover, Captain Benjamin Walker. [...] Upon meeting Walker {{for the first time he}} exclaimed [...] "If I had seen an angel from Heaven I should not have more rejoiced." [...] Within weeks, Walker was Steuben's aide-de-camp.|$|E
2500|$|Chateau d'eau du {{boulevard}} Bondi (1812). [...] This fountain, {{along with}} the fountains of <b>Ponceau</b> {{and those in the}} Place de Vosges, were the first fountains in Paris where the water itself was the chief decorative element, [...] and the sculpture and architecture were secondary. [...] They were all designed by engineer Pierre Simon Girard. [...] The Chateau d'eau was the first monumental fountain in Paris to feature two circular vasques, [...] or stone basins, one above the other on a column, with water overflowing the basins and falling into a larger circular basin below. [...] This design of fountain had existed on a small scale in Roman gardens and in Rome during the Renaissance, and in Aix-en-Provence, but not in Paris, and not on such a large scale. [...] In addition to the central fountain, cast-iron lions spouted water into the lower basin. [...] The novelty and scale of this fountain made it a popular promenade destination of Parisians. [...] The fountain was moved in 1867, and today is located in front of the former Halle from the demolished Paris market of Les Halles located in la Villette.|$|E

A <b>Ponceau</b> S stain is useful because it {{does not appear to have}} a deleterious effect on the sequencing of blotted polypeptides and is therefore one method of choice for locating polypeptides on Western blots for blot-sequencing. It is also easily reversed with water washes, facilitating subsequent immunological detection. The stain can be completely removed from the protein bands by continued washing. Common stain formulations include 0.1% (w/v) <b>Ponceau</b> S in 5% acetic acid or 2% (w/v) <b>Ponceau</b> S in 30% trichloroacetic acid and 30% sulfosalicylic acid.|$|E
