Pentad analysis of the atmospheric and terrestrial water balances during the 1988 drought and 1993 flood show that, jet variability, while influential over many of the subseasonal anomalous precipitation episodes was not a necessary condition for precipitation anomalies. Great Plains evaporation exhibited a 2 -week delay with respect to precipitation suggesting a minor role for precipitation recycling during these events. ENSO and NAO variability are shown to contribute significantly to the large midsummer positive precipitation anomalies during 1993. EEOF analysis of pentad 900 hPa meridional winds during MJJ show three temporally stable modes of variability, each exhibiting similar spatial characteristics to the monthly EOF spatial patterns.

Furthermore, we also examined the critical factor for generating large tsunami heights in the Seto Inland Sea. Figure 11 c shows the tsunami-height profiles obtained using the sub-slip models for the larger-earthquake scenario. From the results of sub-slip models 1 and 2 (red and blue lines in Figure 11 c, respectively), the up-dip extension of the seismogenic zone {{can be seen to}} have almost no effect on tsunami height in the Seto Inland Sea, and the total tsunami heights are the same as those of the smaller-earthquake scenario. The K-values for sub-slip models 1, 2, and the smaller-earthquake scenario are poor with values of 2.34, 2.31, and 1.96, respectively (Table 1). Conversely, the down-dip extension shifts the subsidence associated with the down-dip edge of the slip landward (as mentioned in the sub-section associated with the Pacific coastal tsunami in Shikoku region) and raises tsunami heights up to about 1 m for the Seto Inland Sea (green line Figure 11 c). The resultant profile is almost {{the same as that of}} the larger-earthquake scenario, except for the western edge of the Seto Inland Sea.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 I {{investigated}} common {{patterns in}} North Pacific salmon abundance and marine fish recruitment and environmental drivers of these patterns. In Chapter 1 I identified patterns of covariation in {{the abundance of}} regional groups of wild pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum salmon (O. keta), and sockeye salmon (O. nerka) from 34 population groups from Asia and western North America using multivariate analysis. The most prominent pattern of abundance variation was dominated by the Alaskan population groups and greater abundance was related to warm sea surface temperatures in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. The second dominant pattern captured a dipole between North American and Asian salmon population groups that was associated with an intense, large-scale Aleutian Low. This highlights the existence of basin-wide covariations in wild salmon abundance {{that are associated with}} spatially coherent and regionally distinct patterns in North Pacific climate. In Chapter 2 I tested the hypothesis that synchronous Northeast Pacific marine fish recruitment is due to a shared susceptibility to environmental variability. For 52 marine fish stocks in the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska (GOA), and California Current (CC) ecosystems, I tested for synchrony in stock-recruitment residuals within each ecosystem. Based on evidence of synchrony, I used Bayesian hierarchical models to model stock-recruitment residuals for groups of stocks with similar life histories as a linear function of environmental covariates. Within the GOA several stocks had a similar strong relationship with Northeast <b>Pacific</b> sea surface <b>height.</b> In the CC many stocks had a strong relationship with San Francisco sea level, experiencing higher recruitment during periods of high sea level and low upwelling the year before spawning and low sea level and high upwelling the year of spawning. Although for most stocks these models explained {{only a small portion of}} the variance in the stock-recruitment residuals, there was a consistent relationship among stocks within the ecosystems to the covariates. Future research should utilize these common responses to environmental variables across stocks to improve identification of environmental processes important to variability in abundance and productivity of fish...|$|R

Development of a seasonal forecast model for the spatial probability of tropical cyclones occurrences in the Australian region. III. Discussion and summary. 6. Discussion of results. The hazard of tropical cyclones (TCs) is a very relevant topic to the Australian economy and {{to the welfare of}} its northern population. Australia's climate and the interannual variability of Australian region TC formation (genesis; TCG) is strongly dominated by the ocean-atmosphere interannual climate pattern El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{and to a lesser extent}} by other climate modes of variability. This thesis investigates new ways of seasonal forecasting Australian region TCG counts and distribution by identifying potentially skilful climatological predictors and applying more advanced statistical modelling methods than previous models for the region. ENSO is known to be the most important predictor of seasonal variations in TCG for the Australian region. To investigate the ENSO-independent effects of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on Australian TCG, a simple, but effective method has been developed to separate the IOD from ENSO. Results demonstrate, that there is reasonable individual forecast skill afforded by the influence of the isolated IOD. In combination with common ENSO metrics, however, the IOD does not significantly improve seasonal forecasting of seasonal TCG counts in the Australian region or subregions. A Poisson regression model using Bayesian inference and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was developed to forecast seasonal TCG counts in the Australian region. The final three-predictor model based on derived indices of subtropical Central Pacific June-July-August average convective available potential energy (CAPE), the tropical northeast Pacific May-June-July average meridional winds at 850 hPa (v 850) and subtropical central South <b>Pacific</b> June-July-August geopotential <b>height</b> at 500 hPa performs best with the corresponding correlation coefficient between observed annual TCG totals and cross-validated model hindcasts of r = 0. 73 over the 40 -year record between 1968 / 89 - 2007 / 08. The model is adaptable for hindcasting seasonal TCG totals in Australia's Eastern (Coral Sea) TC subregion, while it lacks skill in the Western (eastern Indian Ocean) TC subregion (r = 0. 79 and r = 0. 38 respectively). To improve forecasts of annual TCG counts in the Western region (90 ⁰- 135 ⁰E), a separate model was developed with correlations between cross-validated hindcasts and observed annual TCG count of r = 0. 67 using the June-July-August tropical Central Pacific sea level pressure (SLP) and the above used index of v 850 as predictors. A logistic regression approach applied in the Bayesian seasonal forecast model was found to be successful in forecasting spatial probabilities of Australian region TCG on a 2. 5 ⁰ x 2. 5 ⁰ grid for the upcoming season. The most skilful model is based on the SLP, NINO 4 and v 850 indices, combined with spatial information from CAPE and shows an average improvement over the climatological average of 25 %. The average distribution of TCG probabilities over the study period, as well as the hindcasted strong variations of probabilities and distribution of TCG during ENSO events match remarkably well against observations over most of the study domain. Results demonstrate that the combination of dynamic with synoptic and/or thermodynamic features is most useful to identify climatic influences on the seasonal frequency and spatial distribution of TC development in the Australian region. Independent forecasts using the three introduced models and comparisons with current operational models demonstrate the relatively high skill of the models presented in this thesis.
