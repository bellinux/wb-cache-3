5000|$|A firzogerin, {{literally}} [...] "fore-sayer" [...] or [...] "front-sayer" [...] (Yiddish פירזאָגערן, alternately, vorsangerin, foreleiner, zugerin, or zugerke; Hebrew הרבנית הדרשנית ha-rabbanit ha-darshanit), was {{a historic}} {{role in the}} synagogue for a learned Jewish woman leading women in prayer from the weibershul (women's gallery or annex of a synagogue) as a precentress, parallel to the main service led by a male chazzan. Gender-segregated seating within synagogues was common from the early Middle Ages well into the modern period. The firzogerin stood {{in the front of}} the women's gallery, balcony, or annex and translated the Hebrew prayers into the vernacular language for the other women who had come to pray. Sometimes the firzogerin translated more or less exactly; other times she translated freely and added her own interpretation. This parallel prayer system was probably welcome to women for whom the Hebrew liturgy, due to their lack of education, was largely incomprehensible. The firzogerin attained her status because she was more knowledgeable than most women, often acquiring her knowledge of Hebrew and the intricacies of rabbinic Judaism from her husband, father, or other learned relative. It was not unusual for this <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> consecutively by several generations of women of a particular family. Besides reciting prayers for and mentoring other female members of the community, firzogerin would sometimes write their own prayers (called tkhines) as well as poems. On rare occasions women precentors may have led a second prayer service apart from the one organized by men.|$|E

2500|$|General Erich von Falkenhayn, the German Chief of the General Staff {{had ordered}} a {{construction}} programme on the Western Front in January 1915, {{to make it}} capable of being defended indefinitely by a small force against superior numbers. An elaborate, carefully sited and fortified front position was built behind fields of barbed wire, with camouflaged concrete machine-gun nests and a second trench close behind the front trench to shelter the trench garrison during bombardments. To evade Allied artillery-fire intended to obstruct the movement of reinforcements from the new rear defences, communication trenches were built. The front <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> at all costs as the main line of resistance but in May 1915, Falkenhayn ordered a reserve <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built along the Western Front, [...] behind the front position, {{out of range of}} enemy field artillery.

[...] Or after a [...] "sinister stillness" [...] and [...] "a crash of rifle fire" [...] the listening post would frantically return, reporting {{the direction of the}} opposition's attack. If it was a large scale attack, [...] "each man would know a stern fight was before him", because if the <b>position</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held,</b> it would <b>be</b> some hours before they could hope for reinforcements.

These brigades, the 19th Australian and 6th New Zealand <b>were</b> <b>to</b> hold the passes as long as possible, allowing the other units to withdraw. [...] The Germans attacked at 11:30 on 24 April, met fierce resistance, lost 15 tanks and sustained considerable casualties. The Allies held out the entire day; with the delaying action accomplished, they retreated {{in the direction of the}} evacuation beaches and set up another rearguard at Thebes. [...] The Panzer units launching a pursuit along the road leading across the pass made slow progress because of the steep gradient and difficult hairpin bends.|$|R
