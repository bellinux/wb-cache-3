2500|$|In weak-form efficiency, future prices {{cannot be}} {{predicted}} by analyzing prices from the past. Excess returns cannot be earned {{in the long}} run by using investment strategies based on historical share prices or other historical data. Technical analysis techniques {{will not be able to}} consistently produce excess returns, though some forms of fundamental analysis may still provide excess returns. Share prices exhibit no serial dependencies, meaning that there are no [...] "patterns" [...] to asset prices. This implies that future price movements are determined entirely by information not contained in the <b>price</b> <b>series.</b> Hence, prices must follow a random walk. This 'soft' EMH does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to systematically profit from market 'inefficiencies'. However, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock markets to trend over time periods of weeks or longer and that, moreover, there is a positive correlation between degree of trending and length of time period ...|$|E

This study examines the monthly, weekly and daily structure in several oil <b>prices</b> <b>series</b> using a modeling approach based on fractional integration and long range dependence. The {{results indicate that}} oil <b>prices</b> <b>series</b> are highly persistent, with orders of integration equal to or higher than 1. Breaks in the series do not alter the main conclusions of this study. That means that shocks have a permanent nature and strong policy measures must be implemented to return the series to their original long term projections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} {{characterize}} and predict petroleum futures prices, using ideas gained from nonlinear dynamical theory. Data on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) of crude oil and heating oil futures are used.
