50|$|Typically, {{amorphous}} silicon thin-film cells use a <b>p-i-n</b> <b>structure.</b> The {{placement of the}} p-type layer on top is also due to the lower hole mobility, allowing the holes to traverse a shorter average distance for collection to the top contact. Typical panel structure includes front side glass, TCO, thin-film silicon, back contact, polyvinyl butyral (PVB) and back side glass. Uni-Solar, a division of Energy Conversion Devices produced a version of flexible backings, used in roll-on roofing products. However, the world's largest manufacturer of {{amorphous silicon}} photovoltaics had to file for bankruptcy in 2012, as it could not compete with the rapidly declining prices of conventional solar panels.|$|E
50|$|Its basic {{electronic}} structure is the p-i-n junction. The amorphous structure of a-Si implies high inherent disorder and dangling bonds, {{making it a}} bad conductor for charge carriers. These dangling bonds act as recombination centers that severely reduce carrier lifetime. A <b>p-i-n</b> <b>structure</b> is usually used, {{as opposed to an}} n-i-p structure. This is because the mobility of electrons in a-Si:H is roughly 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of holes, and thus the collection rate of electrons moving from the n- to p-type contact is better than holes moving from p- to n-type contact. Therefore, the p-type layer should be placed at the top where the light intensity is stronger, so {{that the majority of the}} charge carriers crossing the junction are electrons.|$|E
50|$|The double {{heterostructure}} {{is a very}} useful structure in optoelectronic devices and has interesting electronic properties. If one of the cladding layers is p-doped, the other cladding layer n-doped and the smaller energy gap semiconductor material undoped, a <b>p-i-n</b> <b>structure</b> is formed. When a current {{is applied to the}} ends of the pin structure, electrons and holes are injected into the heterostructure. The smaller energy gap material forms energy discontinuities at the boundaries, confining the electrons and holes to the smaller energy gap semiconductor. The electrons and holes recombine in the intrinsic semiconductor emitting photons. If the width of the intrinsic region is reduced to the order of the de Broglie wavelength, the energies in the intrinsic region no longer become continuous but become discrete. (Actually, they are not continuous but the energy levels are very close together so we think of them as being continuous.) In this situation the {{double heterostructure}} becomes a quantum well.|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{comparative}} study of electrical injection in longitudinal p-i-n and coaxial p-n core-shell nanowires by performing a three-dimensional numerical simulation. In {{the case of the}} core-shell structure, we show that both electrons and holes of high density can be efficiently injected into and confined in the structure even without an i-region. The required bias voltage and doping concentrations in the core-shell structure are smaller than those in the longitudinal <b>p-i-n</b> <b>structure</b> to achieve the same carrier injection level. Furthermore, we show that a type-Ι band alignment, as required in traditional <b>p-i-n</b> <b>structure</b> is not necessary in core-shell structure, allowing more flexibility in nanowire devices design. Our results thus provide a theoretical foundation and understanding that a core-shell structure is far superior to the longitudinal <b>p-i-n</b> <b>structure</b> for electrical injection nanowire lasers.
