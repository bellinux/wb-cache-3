The prevalence of positive cases reported in Spain and Belgium was 12. 3 % and 9. 3 % respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Hospital-acquired {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection {{has been}} well described and continues to occur worldwide. Recent nosocomial outbreaks {{have been linked to}} unsafe injection practices, use of multi-dose vials, and poor staff compliance with standard precautions. This report describes a nosocomial outbreak that occurred in a <b>paediatric</b> haematology and <b>oncology</b> unit of a large academic hospital, the epidemiological investigation of the outbreak, and preventive measures implemented to limit further in-hospital transmission. METHODS :Outbreak investigation including contact tracing and HBV screening were initiallycarried out on all patients seen by the unit during the same period as the first three cases. Routine screening for the entire patient population of the unit was initiated in February 2013 when it was realised that numerous patients may have been exposed. RESULTS : Forty-nine cases of HBV infection were confirmed in 408 patients tested between July 2011 and October 2013. Phylogenetic analysis of the HBV preC/C gene nucleotide sequences revealed that all tested outbreak strains clustered together. Most (67 %) patients were HBeAg positive. The cause of transmission could not be established. Preventive measures targeted three proposed routes. HBV screening and vaccination protocols were started in the unit. CONCLUSIONS : The high number of HBeAg positive patients, together with suspected lapses in infection prevention and control measures, are believed to have {{played a major role in}} the transmission. Measures implemented to prevent further in-hospital transmission were successful. On-going HBV screening and vaccination programmes in <b>paediatric</b> haematology and <b>oncology</b> units should become standard of care. [URL]...|$|R

Patients and Methods. A panel of experts of the supportive care working group of the Italian Association <b>Paediatric</b> Haematology <b>Oncology</b> (AIEOP) addressed this issue by guidelines on vaccinations in paediatric cancer patients. The literature published between 1980 and 2013 was reviewed. Results and Conclusion. During intensive chemotherapy, vaccination turned out to be effective for hepatitis A and B, whilst vaccinations with toxoid, protein subunits, or bacterial antigens should be postponed to the less intensive phases, to achieve an adequate immune response. Apart from varicella, the administration of live-attenuated-virus vaccines is not recommended during this phase. Family members should remain on recommended vaccination schedules, including toxoid, inactivated vaccine (also poliomyelitis), and live-attenuated vaccines (varicella, measles, mumps, and rubella). By the time of completion of chemotherapy, insufficient serum antibody levels for vaccine-preventable diseases have been reported, while immunological memory appears to be preserved. Once immunological recovery is completed, usually after 6 months, response to booster or vaccination is generally good and allows patients to be protected and also to contribute to herd immunity...|$|R

Factors influencing outcome {{in children with}} relapsed AML were investigated. The study included all 146 children in the Nordic countries diagnosed with AML between 1988 and 2003, who relapsed. Data on disease characteristics and relapse treatment were related to outcome. Sixty-six percentage achieved remission with survival after relapse (5 years) 34 +/- 4 %. Of 122 patients who received re-induction therapy, 77 % entered remission with 40 +/- 5 % survival. Remission rates were similar for different re-induction regimens but fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-based therapy had low treatment-related mortality. Prognostic factors for survival were duration of first complete remission (CR 1) and stem cell transplantation (SCT) in CR 1. In early relapse (< 1 year in CR 1), survival was 21 +/- 5 % compared with 48 +/- 6 % in late relapse. For children receiving re-induction therapy, survival in early relapse was 29 +/- 6 % and 51 +/- 6 % in late. Patients treated in CR 1 with SCT, autologous SCT or chemotherapy had a survival of 18 +/- 9, 5 +/- 5 and 41 +/- 5 %, respectively.
