50|$|The {{correct way}} {{to draw a}} <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>chart</b> is to plot every price change but {{practicality}} has rendered this difficult {{to do for a}} large quantity of stocks so many point and figure chartists use the summary prices {{at the end of each}} day. Some prefer to use the day’s closing price and some prefer to use the day’s high or low depending on the direction of the last column. The high/low method was invented by A.W. Cohen in his 1947 book, 'How to Use the Three-Point Reversal Method of Point & Figure Stock Market Timing' and has a large following.|$|E
50|$|The {{principles}} of technical analysis {{are derived from}} hundreds of years of financial market data. Some aspects of technical analysis {{began to appear in}} Amsterdam-based businessman Joseph de la Vega's accounts of the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis {{is said to be a}} method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical analysis charting tool. In the 1920s and 1930s Richard W. Schabacker published several books which continued the work of Charles Dow and William Peter Hamilton in their books Stock Market Theory and Practice and Technical Market Analysis. In 1948 Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published Technical Analysis of Stock Trends which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline. It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts, because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>chart</b> analysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts</b> were {{automated}} in the UK in {{the early}} 1980s by the Indexia company run by Jeremy Du Plessis. This automation increased the popularity <b>and</b> usage of <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts</b> because hundreds of charts could be viewed and altered quickly and easily. At {{the same time a}} method of log scaling <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts</b> was devised, where the value of the Xs and Os was set to a percentage rather than a price. This allowed the sensitivity of <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>charts</b> to remain constant no matter what the price level.|$|R
50|$|Kaufman, in New Trading Systems and Methods, 2005, {{documents}} research he and Kermit Zeig performed {{over many}} years computerizing <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charting.</b> LeBeau <b>and</b> Lucas also developed computerized <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts</b> in Technical Traders Guide to Computer Analysis of the Futures Markets.|$|R

50|$|Du Plessis {{describes}} the historical {{development of these}} charts from a price recording system to a charting method. Traders kept track of prices by writing them down in columns. They noticed patterns in their price record and started referring to them first as ‘fluctuation charts’ and then as ‘figure charts’. They started using Xs instead of numbers and these charts became known as ‘point charts’. Traders used both <b>point</b> <b>charts</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts</b> together <b>and</b> referred to them as their <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts,</b> which is where Du Plessis suggests the name <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> came from. Modern <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts</b> are drawn with Xs and Os where columns of Xs are rising prices and columns of Os are falling prices, although many traditionalists such as David Fuller and Louise Yamada still use the Xs only point method of plotting.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts</b> are plotted on squared paper, 45 degree lines {{may be used}} {{to define}} up trends and down trends from {{important}} highs and lows on the chart allowing objective analysis of trends.|$|R
50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>charts</b> {{are based}} {{primarily}} on price action, not time. If there are no significant price moves over time, P&F charts will show no new data. This difference can make P&F charts ideal for detecting directional patterns and trends in a condensed format.|$|R
50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> (P&F) is a {{charting}} {{technique used}} in technical analysis. <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charting</b> does not plot price against time as time-based charts do. Instead it plots price against changes in direction by plotting {{a column of}} Xs as the price rises and a column of Os as the price falls.|$|R
50|$|Also {{in common}} usage are two methods of obtaining price targets from <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts.</b> The {{vertical}} method measures {{the length of}} the thrust off a high or low and projects the thrust to obtain a target. The horizontal method measures the width of a congestion pattern and uses that to obtain a target.|$|R
50|$|The hikkake pattern, or hikkake, is a {{technical}} analysis pattern used for determining market turning-points and continuations. It {{is a simple}} pattern that {{can be observed in}} market price data, using traditional bar <b>charts,</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts,</b> or Japanese candlestick charts. The pattern does not belong to the collection of traditional candlestick chart patterns.|$|R
40|$|Financial {{charting}} {{software is}} widely used for technical analysis of price movements in financial markets. Commercial off-the-shelf charting components are often used to build such software. However, the outputs of some charting components are difficult to be verified because the correct outputs are unknown. In many cases, charting output verification relies on subjective visual judgement and manual construction of the chart by the testers, which are prone to human errors. Hence, the charting components could be poorly tested before being integrated into software. In this paper, we perform {{a study on the}} <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>charting</b> component <b>and</b> propose an automatic testing techniqure that is built upon the notions of assertion checking and metamorphic testing to alleviate these problems.

5000|$|The {{technique}} is over 100 years old. [...] "Hoyle" [...] {{was the first}} to write about it and showed charts in his 1898 book, The Game in Wall Street. [...] The first book/manual dedicated to <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> was written by Victor Devilliers in 1933. Chartcraft Inc, in the USA, popularized the system in the 1940s. Cohen founded Chartcraft <b>and</b> wrote on <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charting</b> in 1947. Chartcraft published further pioneering books on P&F charting, namely those by Burke, Aby and Zieg. Chartcraft Inc is still running today, providing daily <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> services for the US market under the name of Investors Intelligence. Veteran Mike Burke still works for Chartcraft, having started back in 1962 under the guidance of Cohen. Burke went on to train other <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> gurus, such as Thomas Dorsey who would go on to write authoritative texts on the subject.|$|R
40|$|Financial {{charting}} {{software is}} widely used in share, commodity and foreign currency exchange markets to visualize and analyze price movements. Its quality is critical because incorrect outputs may lead to wrong analysis and trading decisions, and consequently substantial financial losses. Human visual judgment is often required to test financial charting software because of the graphical complexity of software outputs and limited knowledge of expected outputs. Such approach is labour intensive and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an automated testing technique combining metamorphic testing, assertion checking and a novel data label extraction method to eliminate human visual judgment from testing financial charting software. We used this technique to test pre-release builds of a commercial <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>charting</b> software component, <b>and</b> demonstrated that the proposed technique can effectively detect actual faults in the software component. Further, we discuss how the technique can be extended to test other charting software components...|$|R
40|$|The sole use {{of price}} and related summary {{statistics}} in a technical trading strategy is an anathema to weak-form market efficiency. In practice, however, traders actively use technical analysis to make investment decisions which makes this an important, but often neglected, area for study. This thesis includes four empirical chapters, which provide important {{evidence on the}} profitability of technical trading. The results from the detailed analysis undertaken in this thesis have broad relevance to both academics {{and those in the}} investment community. Existing research has been predominantly confined to evaluating basic technical trading rules, such as moving averages. Crucially, this ignores chart patterns. Widely employed by practitioners, such patterns form a vital part of technical analysis. As the most important price pattern, the head and shoulders pattern is subjected to detailed and thorough examination in this thesis. A significant contribution is made by evaluating formations recognised and used by traders, in sharp contrast to limited existing studies. Furthermore, a new method is developed to establish how quickly profits from a head and shoulders strategy decay, which has important implications for traders. Existing research has identified both reversal and relative strength effects in financial asset returns. A key separator between these two findings is the formation and holding time over which portfolios of winners and losers are evaluated. Motivated by this, a very large sample of ultra high-frequency data is used to investigate intraday momentum and reversal effects. As well as being an important contribution to research in this field, the results are, once again, of relevance to practitioners. The need for further research into technical analysis is clearly demonstrated by <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charting.</b> Whilst traders have made consistent use of the technique for around a century, the amount of existing research is extremely small. <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> has attractive data filtering properties, clear trading rules and is particularly suited to intraday technical analysis. Again, using a very large sample of high-frequency data, a detailed evaluation of the profitability of a <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> trading strategy is undertaken.

40|$|As a young investor, it is {{essential}} that I take advantage of investment principles such as compounding interest rates and the time value of money. History has proven that although riskier than other forms of investments, Canadian and U. S. common shares have yielded double digit percentage returns. Therefore, as a young investor with ample time for investment earnings growth, even with the volatility of the stock market, investing in Canadian and U. S. common shares can be a very rewarding investment strategy. Therefore, to become more knowledgeable about investing, I completed a valuation exercise on five Canadian and five American publicly companies. The ten companies were selected from five different industries which were as follows: • financial services – banks • oil and gas – integrated oils • merchandise and lodging • communications and media - telecommunications • industrial products – transportation equipment and components. To begin this exercise, I conducted a thorough review of existing literature relating to both fundamental analysis and technical analysis. The sources of literature included, but were not limited to, peer reviewed (scholarly) journals, company reports, and case studies. For the fundamental analysis portion, the literature reviewed included broad areas such as its history, the role of financial variables, financial ratios, and criticisms. Specific research focused on the application of Piotroski`s F_SCORE approach by Piotroski (2000) himself, Nguyen (2004), Lopes and Galdi (2007), Pettersson and Maican (2007), along with several others. Introduced by Piotroski, the F_SCORE approach captures the financial health of companies. This approach 4 consists of the application of financial variables such as return on assets, inventory turnover, change in total asset turnover, as well as several other variables to companies. The company then receives scores based on how well each of these variables is scored in the company’s financial performance. The research has identified that firms with high F_SCOREs tend to have higher earnings growth compared to firms that possess lower F_SCOREs. Due to timeframes associated with completing this paper, I had reviewed literature on technical analysis but did not incorporate its findings into my own analysis. Specific aspects of technical analysis such as its history, price patterns, <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> <b>charts,</b> moving averages, candlestick charts, and criticisms were analyzed from the existing literature. From reviewing the existing literature, it was evident that the F_SCORE is a successful predictor of future earnings growth. Therefore, I had conducted a thorough analysis which included conducting a detailed ratio analysis for the past 20 fiscal quarters and a vertical analysis. The ratios which were used were based on the findings of the literature reviewed. Industry specific ratios, which were captured from investment reports and company annual reports, were also utilized to offset any anomalies, including the small selection of the companies. The completion of these ratios was critical for calculating F_SCOREs for each company, which would then be compared to future earnings as part of a regression analysis. However, before I completed the regression analysis, return data for each company’s stock was captured. Based on these returns, I then proceeded to calculate the monthly return, monthly excess return, quarterly return, quarterly excess return, average quarterly return, average quarterly excess return, six month return, six month excess return, average six month return, and average six month excess return. By having all of these returns and F_SCOREs calculated, I was 5 then able to complete a regression analysis for each company which identified the relationship between F_SCORE and subsequent returns, as represented by linear equations. The findings of the regression analysis revealed conflicting results compared to that of the literature reviewed. With 11 types of returns displaying a significantly positive relationship, 18 types of returns displaying a significantly negative relationship, and 51 types of returns displaying a no significant relationship, {{it was found that the}} findings of my study do not support the F_SCORE literature reviewed. In terms of raw returns and excess returns, it was found that there was a more significant relationship between F_SCOREs and future excess returns as opposed to future raw returns. Limitations that may have impacted my results included the small sample size of companies included in the study, time-frame of when the study was administered, exclusion of dividends in return calculations, and company selection...|$|R

The inclusion of linear perspective would later become a standard element in Renaissance painting and sculpture, after being described by Leon Battista Alberti in his 1435 treatise Della Pictura.|$|R
