5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen <b>pine</b> <b>needles.</b> In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. Its small size and dark color makes it easy to overlook.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, <b>pine</b> <b>needles,</b> grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen <b>pine</b> <b>needles,</b> and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E

40|$|For many herbivorous mammals, oils from {{conifers}} are feeding repellents. Our {{study investigated}} effects of <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil on feeding and other behaviors of northern pocket gophers. In one-choice feeding trials pocket gophers were offered sweet potato from single feeding stations placed into each subject 2 ̆ 7 s home cage. Stations contained either a scent dispenser with <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil or with mineral oil. <b>Pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil did not inhibit food retrieval under these conditions. Responses to <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil {{and to a}} control odorant, d-pulegone, were also tested in mazes where subjects were offered choices between two goal boxes, each containing food associated with an odorant. To examine the possibility that pocket gophers avoid any unfamiliar odor because of neophobia, freshly caught animals were tested in a maze offering a choice between goals scented with d-pulegone and goals containing mineral oil. The behavior of the animals {{in the side of}} the maze containing pulegone did not differ from their behavior in the side containing mineral oil, indicating indifference to this stimulus. <b>Pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil, however, elicited aversive responses. When one goal box contained <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil, the second mineral oil, subjects were less frequently located {{in the side of the}} maze containing pine scent and consumed less food there. Responses of northern pocket gophers to <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil in mazes are similar to those of plains pocket gophers studied earlier under comparable conditions. Results obtained with both species suggest that <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> oil may be an effective repellent for all species of pocket gophers...|$|R

5|$|Seung Sahn {{was born}} in 1927 as Duk-In Lee (modern romanisation: Yi Deog'in) in Sunchon (순천), South Pyongan Province of {{occupied}} Korea (now North Korea) to Presbyterian parents. In 1944, he joined an underground resistance movement {{in response to the}} ongoing occupation of Korea by the Empire of Japan. He was captured by Japanese police shortly after, avoided a death sentence, and spent time in prison. Upon his release, he studied Western philosophy at Dongguk University. One day, a monk friend of his lent him a copy of the Diamond Sutra. While reading the text, he became inspired to ordain as a monk and left school, receiving the prātimokṣa precepts in 1948. Seung Sahn then performed a one-hundred day solitary retreat in the mountains of Korea, living on a diet of <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> and rain water.

5|$|In the Summer of 1999, a {{group of}} volunteers worked to restore and clean up the {{cemetery}} {{that led to a}} ceremony in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance. The article in The Day highlighted the difficulty in finding the cemetery which is located {{on the banks of the}} Pachaug River, in the village of Glasgo, located in the town of Griswold. Iva Arpin said that the town would repair the stone walls and that the Children of the American Revolution would return in the spring to continue their work on the cemetery. In 2002, the cemetery had undergone a significant restoration which included the unearthing and accounting for all the burial markers that had been strewn about the grounds. Arpin noted that some of the stones showed signs of vandalism. The Day described how some of the marker stones and monuments were covered in nearly a foot of <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> and that the roots had uprooted the anchor stones causing the headstones to fall and break.|$|E
5|$|Highly abundant, {{the brown}} roll-rim is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern Anatolia. It is equally widely {{distributed}} across northern North America, extending north to Alaska, {{where it has}} been collected from tundra near Coldfoot in the interior of the state. In southwestern Greenland, P. involutus has been recorded under the birch species Betula nana, B. pubescens and B. glandulosa. The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch (Betula pendula). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids calcareous (chalky) soils. It has been noted to grow alongside Boletus badius in Europe, and Leccinum scabrum and Lactarius plumbeus in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, commonly under plantings of white birch (Betula papyrifera) in urban areas. It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in Pinus radiata plantations planted outside their natural range. A study of polluted Scots pine forest around Oulu in northern Finland found that P.involutus became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined. Emissions from pulp mills, fertiliser, heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution, which was measured by sulfur levels in the <b>pine</b> <b>needles.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E

25|$|Beside {{the danger}} of people {{receiving}} burns from the fire or embers, campfires may spread into a larger fire. A campfire may burn {{out of control in}} two basic ways: on the ground or in the trees. Dead leaves or <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood, or from thermal radiation. If a root, particularly a dead one, is exposed to fire, it may smoulder underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and the campers have left the area. Alternatively, airborne embers (or their smaller kin, sparks) may ignite dead material in overhanging branches. This latter threat is less likely, but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment, and may spread more quickly than a ground fire.|$|E

25|$|His Geese Alighting on Water, painted at Enman'in, Ōtsu in 1767, is {{an early}} example of his mature style. The subject is treated {{as a part of}} nature; nothing {{philosophical}} is implied as had been done with such imagery in the East Asian tradition. Likewise, Kingfisher and Trout, painted in 1769, features a bird {{near the top of the}} image, waiting for a fish. The trout swims under a large rock near the center. Bird, fish, and stone all appear as they do in nature, creating a matter-of-fact, comprehensible, and natural-looking piece. Later in his oeuvre, Pine Trees in Snow, executed in 1773 for the wealthy Mitsui family, is realistic despite being in the Japanese idiom of ink on a gold background. The two six-panel screens show tree bark and <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> separated by differing brush strokes, and the white snow seems to weigh down the branches. The bark is painted in the tsuketate technique, which uses no outlines, just dark and light shades to create the illusion of volume.|$|E
