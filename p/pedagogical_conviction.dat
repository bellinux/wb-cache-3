Couple this with the obsession for having children score highly on standardized tests, an outcome that many believe is best solved through direct instruction. Many of us react {{to the idea that}} learning (or knowing) is a process of acquiring information, instead treating it as a participatory act involving rich relations among the formal content, rich contexts, and engaging tasks (Sfard, 1998). I certainly subscribe theoretically to the situativity view and the conviction that context matters, as well as the <b>pedagogical</b> <b>conviction</b> that students should learn science by addressing meaningful problems in rich contexts. However, a core question that emerges is how do we engage students in rich contexts that situate the context while still supporting them in interacting with the more formal underlying concepts and theories? SungWon: The interesting point I find here is that the context becomes really rich insofar as the formal concepts and theories emerge to the students as resources for realizing their motive. I am reminded that the artifact designing activity introduced i...|$|E

The project involves four secondary schools located in manufacturing and non-academically oriented Swedish municipalities. More specifically, the material consists of teachers’ written reactions in relation to certain activities, as well as of field notes from seminars and municipal reports. Certain convictions appearing from the involved teachers and school directions are analysed according to pedagogic discourses identified in Basil Bernstein’s theory of sociology of education. There are two parallel aims of the article; first, to shed light on contemporary prevailing <b>pedagogical</b> <b>convictions</b> (primarily in schools similar to our selection) and second, to make specifications of an analytic tool intended for categorisations of <b>pedagogical</b> <b>convictions.</b> Referring to the first aim, our results point towards the fact that certain discourses are more dominant than others, all of which based on beliefs that naturalise differences between pupils. Grounded in this picture, the authors discuss possible consequences for pupils who, due to their social background, run the risk of being less familiar with what is expected from school as an institution...|$|R
40|$|The move {{to local}} school {{management}} (LSM) {{in its various}} formations {{is one of the}} most significant educational policy moves to occur in recent times in western countries. Although something is known about the effects on governance, budgeting and resource decision making, relatively little is known about the rhetorical and actual ways teachers' work is affected. Even the proponents admit this, albeit in terms of the little known relay effect on student learning. Drawing on the narrative biography of a single high school teacher, as part of a larger multi-sited ethnography, this study revealed the level of policy incoherence to be such that most of the worst excesses of accountability and marketisation accompanying LSM were minimised. Emerging from a deeply held set of <b>pedagogical</b> values and <b>convictions,</b> this instance confirmed a robust view of teacher identity as lying beyond those of victim construction...|$|R
