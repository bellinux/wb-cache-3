5|$|After a full {{pre-season}} {{he started}} to <b>play</b> <b>well</b> and hit six goals in 30 Third Division games during his time at Ashton Gate. Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan {{that he had no}} intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but that he would make an exception for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} had concluded, word was leaked that star forward Heatley had demanded a trade, placing GM Murray in a {{precarious}} position. On June 30, {{a deal to}} Edmonton was finalized, but Heatley rejected it by refusing to waive his no-trade clause. On September 12, 2009, Heatley was traded, along with a fifth-round pick in 2010 NHL Entry Draft, to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forwards Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo, {{as well as a}} second-round pick in the 2010 NHL Draft. Michalek would <b>play</b> <b>well</b> for the Senators, but Cheechoo struggled and was demoted to the Binghamton Senators before having his contract bought out in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{suffered}} a knee cartilage injury in mid-October, after a successful operation {{he was expected}} to be out for a month. This meant he would be likely to miss crucial Champions League ties against Manchester United and Aalborg. He returned earlier than expected and was back in training on 9 November, having missed seven games. Samaras returned to action on 12 November, coming on as a substitute in a 3–0 win over Kilmarnock. On 25 November he started against Aalborg but did not <b>play</b> <b>well</b> and missed several chances as Celtic lost 2–1. This loss consigned Celtic to a bottom place finish in their group.|$|E
50|$|Siwarak {{moved to}} BEC Tero Sasana FC in 2008. Although Siwarak <b>played</b> <b>well</b> in BEC Tero Sasana F.C. {{he was not}} always a starter, because Pisan Dorkmaikaew another goalkeeper in BEC Tero also <b>played</b> <b>well.</b> Therefore, the {{competition}} in the team is high, and being a starter is not guaranteed.|$|R

5|$|The {{first game}} was against Otago University on 10 September, which the home side won easily, 21–0. Jack Verge {{was the only}} one of the team to <b>play</b> <b>well,</b> {{preventing}} the home side scoring through his tackling. For the return match on 15 September, the younger Verge was brought in at five-eighth, which helped strengthen the team. No points were scored in the first half, although the visitors came close to getting a try but were held up on the line. In the second half, Otago scored six points to Sydney's three, and again came away the winners. Verge missed scoring from a penalty kick, which hit the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{finished}} the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place {{higher than the}} previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only {{on the day of}} a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to <b>play</b> <b>well</b> when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez was {{announced}} as the starter for the Eagles Week 11 {{game against the}} Buccaneers after {{it was revealed that}} Bradford suffered a separated shoulder and a concussion. Sanchez's opening drive was excellent, completing 100% of his passes and ending it with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Josh Huff to make the score 7-0. Sanchez continued to <b>play</b> <b>well</b> {{for the majority of the}} 1st half, and threw a second touchdown pass to Darren Sproles, but the Buccaneers offense had already scored 21 points. However, after that drive, Sanchez started to crumble, throwing an interception near the end of the second quarter. Sanchez finished the game with 3 interceptions, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown, in a humiliating 45-17 blowout. His 2 touchdown passes were the only points scored by the offense.|$|E

5|$|Several {{changes to}} the roster were made before the 2007–08 {{campaign}} as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second round draft picks, and signed Jamario Moon and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents. On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets. Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles. However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to <b>play</b> <b>well</b> consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed {{the possibility of a}} smooth campaign.|$|E

25|$|Waller was a {{tactical}} innovator, and introduced {{the idea of}} using one inside forward to play in a deeper role, capable of accurate passing, who could bring faster wide men into play, often with long cross–field balls.

By portraying hypocrisy in a comedic manner, Fielding shifts his focus from a discussion of love and lovers.|$|E
