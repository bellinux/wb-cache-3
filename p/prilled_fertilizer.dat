5000|$|FDP {{involves}} [...] "briquetting" [...] {{nitrogen fertilizer}} by compacting <b>prilled</b> <b>fertilizer</b> into 1-3 gram briquettes. The briquettes (either urea- or NPK-based) are then {{placed in a}} plant's root zone, {{as opposed to the}} traditional application method of broadcasting. Trials have shown that FDP and UDP (when only urea is used) can increase crop production up to 36 percent, reduce fertilizer use by up to 38 percent, and reduce nitrogen losses by up to 40 percent.|$|E
40|$|Semiorganic phophate {{fertilizer}} {{is one of}} {{the alternatives}} of ferlilizer supplying elements of N, P and K needed plant. This product was expected to be able to substitute the phosphate fertilizer supplied in chemical fertilizer form. Manufacturing of semi organic phophate fertilizer consist of (1) composting of mixed organic materials and livestock manure, (2) grinding of compost, (3) grinding of phosphate rocks, (4) blending and prilling of grinded compost, phosphate rocks and water and (5) Drying of <b>prilled</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> As far as now the drying of semi organic phophate fertilizer was carried out by drying under the sunshine. This proces was difficult to be done on rainy season, so it was needed an equipment to dry semi organic phophate fertilizer, i. e, a Rotary Dryer. The purpose of the program was to design a Rotary Dryer for drying of semi organic phophate fertilizer to maintain or even increase the capacity of production. Main components of Rotary Dryer were Shell, Fuel Burner, Gear of Shell mover, and Motor for driving Shell. Shell rotated at 4 - 8 rpm when It was being operated. This Shell was equipped with baffles for improving the contact between hot gas and <b>prilled</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Motor for driving Shell was a single phase electric motor 1 HP equipped with reducer, chain and transmision gear. The Rotary Dryer was operable easily and safely. Drying using Rotary Dryer yield product of fertilizer with moisture content 12. 9...|$|E
50|$|The largest {{commercial}} {{application of}} explosives is mining. Whether the mine {{is on the}} surface or is buried underground, the detonation or deflagration of either a high or low explosive in a confined space {{can be used to}} liberate a fairly specific sub-volume of a brittle material in a much larger volume of the same or similar material. The mining industry tends to use nitrate-based explosives such as emulsions of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate solutions, mixtures of ammonium nitrate <b>prills</b> (<b>fertilizer</b> pellets) and fuel oil (ANFO) and gelatinous suspensions or slurries of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuels.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{different}} methods for obtaining the most products at economical rates from the available agricultural {{area has been}} necessary to satisfy the food needs of the fast- increasing population of the world by 17 -th century. Accordingly, among the various alternative methods, chemical fertilizers have played {{a big part in}} the food revolution, and the fertilizer quality affects the new race of the environment toward market needs. In our work, we tried to improve the fertilizer quality, during the prilling process, by referring to an already available downstream system; the temperature â€“ phase relationship of the <b>prilled</b> <b>fertilizers</b> was investigated, and physicochemical properties were calculated for improving fertilizer- storage conditions. We worked on ammonium nitrate crystals in this study. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} to be prilled {{must be in}} a solid state at room temperature and a low-viscosity liquid when melted. Prills are formed by allowing drops of the melted prill substance to congeal or freeze in mid-air after being dripped {{from the top of}} a tall prilling tower. Certain agrochemicals such as urea are often supplied in <b>prilled</b> form. <b>Fertilizers</b> (ammonium nitrate, urea, NPK fertilizer) and some detergent powders are commonly manufactured as prills.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{development}} of Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for a fertilizer plant. The software is advanced, easy to use, less complex, {{less expensive and}} also less time consuming. It consists of number of modules like detailed information of equipment, maintenance procedures, work order and employees detail. The objectives of CMMS are to reduce overall downtime, overall yearly maintenance cost and occurrence of failures of the equipment and to get day-by-day maintenance plan and strategy. In this regard, the behavioral chart for urea <b>prilling</b> unit at <b>Fertilizer</b> plant has been developed in form of Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Besides this, a maintenance program has also been proposed and used {{for the purpose of}} maintenance planning of the urea prilling unit. The outcome of software has been consulted with the concerned plant individuals and found to be extremely favorable for improving the performance level of the concerned plant...|$|R
40|$|Use of high {{analysis}} fertilizers such as {{diammonium phosphate}} {{in place of}} ordinary superphosphate and urea in place of ammonium sulphate over years, sulphur application to crop fields has considerably decreased, {{which has led to}} widespread sulphur deficiency in Indian soils. Hence, considering this into account a field study for two years was conducted at the research farm of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to evaluate sulphur-coated urea (SCU) as a source of sulphur (S) and an enhanced efficiency of nitrogen <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Prilled</b> urea (PU) coated with 4 to 5 % S significantly increased wheat grain yield to the tune of 9. 58 to 11. 21 % and nitrogen 19. 06 to 23. 94 % and sulphur uptake 21. 76 to 29. 29 % over prilled urea alone by wheat. However, net return and benefit: cost ratio was the highest and significant at 5 % S coating onto PU. Five % SCU supplied 50 % of the sulphur needs of the wheat crop and enhanced nitrogen recovery efficiency by 60 % and is therefore recommended as sulphur as well as enhanced efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer for wheat in Indo-Gangetic plains of India. This is an important finding considering the environmental safety by increased nitrogen recovery and also productivity in present scenario...|$|R
