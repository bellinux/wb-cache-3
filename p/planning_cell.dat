40|$|In {{wireless}} communication systems, optimal placement of base station locations, i. e.,cell planning, {{has been considered}} one of major tools for performance improvement. However, the <b>cell</b> <b>planning</b> requires signicant eort for acquiring suitable sites aswell as expensive computer software for nding out optimal locations. While theprice of equipment has dropped rapidly, the cost of cell planing remains similar orbecomes even more costly with increasing complexity of wireless systems. Therefore,the <b>cell</b> <b>planning</b> cost has become a burden to network operators. There is a needto examine cost benet of sophisticated <b>cell</b> <b>planning.</b> In this thesis, we investigate the tradeo between cost and performance of dierentcell planning levels. We assume that the regular hexagonal cell strucuture representsthe optimal <b>cell</b> <b>planning,</b> and model <b>cell</b> <b>planning</b> levels by means of randomnessin two-dimensional point processes. We also introduce a simple cost model whichtakes into account non-linear increase in total cost with dierent <b>cell</b> <b>planning</b> levels. Numerical results are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. It is observed thatthe cost benet of <b>cell</b> <b>planning</b> depends on {{the pace of the}} cost increase. When fastincrease in the cost against better <b>cell</b> <b>planning</b> is assumed, we can nd a regionwhere lower level of <b>cell</b> <b>planning</b> is more cost-eective. This thesis provides a toolfor decision making that operators can utilize. More realistic simulations and costmodels remain as further study...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: The PVC super-phylum gathers {{bacteria}} {{from seven}} phyla (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobiae, Chlamydiae, Lentisphaera, Poribacteria, OP 3, WWE 2) presenting different lifestyles, <b>cell</b> <b>plans</b> and environments. Planctomyces and several Verrucomicrobiae exhibit a complex <b>cell</b> <b>plan,</b> with an intracytoplasmic membrane inducing the compartmentalization of the cytoplasm into two regions (pirellulosome and paryphoplasm). The evolution {{and function of}} this <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> is still subject to debate. In this work, we hypothesized that it could {{play a role in}} protection of the bacterial DNA, especially against Horizontal Genes Transfers (HGT). Therefore, 64 bacterial genomes belonging to seven different phyla (whose four PVC phyla) were studied. We reconstructed the evolution of the <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> as precisely as possible, thanks to information obtained by bibliographic study and electronic microscopy. We used a strategy based on comparative phylogenomic {{in order to determine the}} part occupied by the horizontal transfers for each studied genomes. Results: Our results show that the bacteria Simkania negevensis (Chlamydiae) and Coraliomargarita akajimensis (Verrucomicrobiae), whose <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> were unknown before, are compartmentalized, as we can see on the micrographies. This is one of the first indication of the presence of an intracytoplasmic membrane in a Chlamydiae. The proportion of HGT does not seems to be related to the <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> of bacteria, suggesting that compartmentalization does not induce a protection of bacterial DNA against HGT. Conversely, lifestyle of bacteria seems to impact the ability of bacteria to exchange genes. Conclusions: Our study allows a best reconstruction of the evolution of intracytoplasmic membrane, but this structure seems to have no impact on HGT occurrences...|$|R
