50|$|The main organ was rebuilt in 1942 by Kuhn Organ Builders {{from the}} year 1942. In 1975 the organ was rebuilt again, the visible <b>pipes</b> were <b>retained,</b> but the {{majority}} of the inner workings were replaced.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, the Hook and Hastings Company - a {{prominent}} 19th century organ builder - installed an organ {{in the choir}} loft. This organ {{was placed in a}} visually impressive case. The organ was significantly altered by the Lima Pipe Organ Company of Elida, Ohio, in 1965; the case and most of the <b>pipes</b> were <b>retained,</b> augmented by all new mechanism (including windchests constructed of aluminum) and several additional ranks of pipes. It currently has three manuals and 33 stops.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1974 by Iowa native Lynn A. Dobson, who serves as President and Artistic Director. The company employs 20, and has {{produced}} over 90 new instruments. It has also restored a number of historic organs, and tunes and maintains a variety of instruments in the upper Midwest. First known {{for the construction of}} mechanical action organs, the company has since the 1990s also undertaken the construction of organs with electric actions, most employing slider windchests. Notable instruments built by Dobson include the organ at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, California (which includes some <b>pipes</b> <b>retained</b> from the organ of the former St. Vibiana's Cathedral), and the organ for the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the home of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Major church installations include a 95-rank organ installed at Highland Park United Methodist Church, Dallas, Texas, in 2009, and an 82-rank instrument installed at Independent Presbyterian Church, Birmingham, Alabama in 2012. In 2013, Dobson completed a new mechanical action instrument for Merton College Chapel, making the firm one of a very few American organ builders to send its work to England. Dobson is currently building an organ for Saint Thomas Church in New York; when completed, it will be the largest built by Dobson.|$|R

50|$|In 1971, the TR6R Tiger and TR6C Trophy {{adopted the}} P39 frame {{like the other}} 650 models. The twin high <b>pipes</b> were <b>retained</b> on the left side. The main {{improvement}} over the previous models was the handling, helped by the stronger frame and improved front forks. However, many problems occurred with these new models. The oil capacity was reduced, causing the engine to run hot and the new 'conical' hub front brake required frequent adjustment to avoid fade. The new electrics proved unreliable. Mid-year changes attempted to correct these problems. For 1972, a five-speed was offered as an option, thus creating the TR6RV and TR6CV models. The TR6 model ended in 1973 when it {{was replaced by the}} 750-cc TR7 model.|$|R
40|$|Corrugated pipes are {{commonly}} used because of their local rigidity combined with global flexibility. The flow through such a pipe can induce strong whistling tones, which is an environmental nuisance and can {{be a threat to}} the mechanical integrity of the system. This paper considers the use of a composite pipe: a shorter corrugated pipe segment embedded between smooth pipe segments. Such a <b>pipe</b> <b>retains</b> some flexibility, while the acoustical damping in the smooth pipe reduces whistling tones. Whistling is the result of coherent vortex shedding at the cavities in the wall. This vortex shedding is synchronized by longitudinal acoustic waves traveling along the pipe. The acoustic waves trigger the vortex shedding, which reinforces the acoustic field for a critical range of the Strouhal number values. A linear theory for plane wave propagation and the sound production is proposed, which allows a prediction of the Mach number at the threshold of whistling in such pipes. A semi-empirical approach is chosen to determine the sound source in this model. This source corresponds to a fluctuating force acting on the fluid {{as a consequence of the}} vortex shedding. The functional form of the Strouhal number dependency of the dimensionless sound source amplitude is based on numerical simulations. The magnitude of the source and the Strouhal number range in which it can drive whistling are determined by matching the model to results for a specific corrugated pipe segment length. This semi-empirical source model is then applied to composite pipes with different corrugated segment lengths. In addition, the effect of inlet acoustical convective losses due to flow separation is considered. The Mach number at the threshold of whistling is predicted within a factor 2.

50|$|The organ, {{situated}} in the triforium above the sanctuary, was built in 1922 by Alfred Hunter and Sons of Clapham, London. Because of the striking and unusual acoustics of the building, it was voiced by the builder {{in the church and}} remains today exactly in its original tonal design. Hunter built a number of very fine instruments throughout the country but the one in St James's is regarded by organists and organ builders as the finest example of his superb craftsmanship. Five ranks of <b>pipes</b> were <b>retained</b> from the Gray & Davison organ (previously by the famous eighteenth century builder, Samuel Green) originally in the Spanish Chapel. The present organ has fifty three ranks of pipes on three manuals and pedals. Wind pressures are from three and a half inches for flue-work to ten inches for the heavy reeds.|$|R
50|$|PVC Bendit is a {{tool that}} uses heat to soften PVC pipe from the inside. It {{consists}} of an electrical resistance heating element jacketed in a metal hose with a power supply cable. It is primarily used to bend PVC pipe, though {{it can also be}} used to bend other thermoplastic tubes and sheets. It works by bringing up the temperature of the pipe or sheet to the softening point of 176 degrees or higher. Naturally, the longer the pipe is on the bender, the hotter and softer it will get. Once the pipe is softened, it can be formed into different shapes within the limitations of the material. When cooled, the <b>pipe</b> will <b>retain</b> all of the properties of the original material, but it will have additional stress on the points of the pipe that are stretched or compressed in the bending process.|$|R

500|$|Dreadnought {{was one of}} {{the first}} vessels of the Royal Navy to be fitted with {{instruments}} for electrically transmitting range, order and deflection information to the turrets. The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting top at the head of the foremast and on a platform on the roof of the signal tower. Data from a [...] Barr and Stroud FQ-2 rangefinder located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. Voice <b>pipes</b> were <b>retained</b> for use between the Transmitting Station and the control positions. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target.

40|$|Full-scale {{tests have}} been carried out on lengths of {{unrestrained}} and restrained plain and jointed distribution pipe sections (similar to 4 '' or similar to 100 mm internal diameter) in order to investigate the strains and loads generated in cast iron water distribution mains as a result of temperature fluctuations. Tests on unrestrained sections enabled the coefficient of thermal expansion of the pipe material to be measured. In a fully restrained situation, which can occur in a pipe section in service when the joints are locked, tensile stresses arise from a decrease in temperature (in accordance with the predictions of a simple one-dimensional model) and it is shown that these stresses are sufficiently high to fracture a corroded pipe. In situations where the tensile stress leads to joint slippage, leakage through the joint is observed. Water leakage was also observed through the wall of corroded <b>pipes</b> that <b>retained</b> sufficient structural stability to carry load without failure...|$|R
40|$|Corrugated pipes combine {{small-scale}} rigidity {{and large-scale}} flexibility, {{which makes them}} very useful in industrial applications. The flow through such a pipe can induce strong undesirable whistling noises and even drive dangerous structural vibrations. Placing a short corrugated segment along a smooth pipe reduces the whistling, while this composite <b>pipe</b> still <b>retains</b> some global flexibility. The whistling is reduced by thermo-viscous damping in the smooth pipe segment. A linear semi-empirical model is proposed that allows to predict the critical Mach numbers {{at the onset of}} whistling for a composite pipe at moderately high Reynolds numbers. Experimental results for corrugated pipes of three different corrugations geometries are presented revealing fair agreement with the theory. In addition, the model indicates that even for a corrugated pipe segment with an anechoic termination, corresponding to a very long smooth pipe segment, there exists a finite critical Mach number above which the whistling occurs.

50|$|The largest {{technical}} challenge facing the Flussbad {{comes in the}} form of the raw-sewage overflow pumped into the Spree Canal by the combined sewage system during heavy rain. Although these heavily polluting discharges would be cleaned by the plant filter in the Friedrichsgracht area before reaching the bathing area further downstream, there remains the problem of one especially large overflow pipe located near the Schleusenbrücke, which is directly in the planned swimming area. In order to get this liability under control, the Flussbad team intends to build a control structure into the sewage <b>pipe</b> that would <b>retain</b> the wastewater accumulated there and, after the rain stopped, slowly funnel it back to the sewage treatment plants. This would prevent the wastewater from entering the swimming area.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the electronic organ in the mid-1930s spelled {{the end of the}} harmonium's success in the West (although its popularity as a household instrument declined in the 1920s as musical tastes changed). The Hammond organ could imitate the tonal quality and range of a <b>pipe</b> organ whilst <b>retaining</b> the compact dimensions and cost-effectiveness of the harmonium as well as reducing maintenance needs and allowing a greater number of stops and other features. By this time, harmoniums had reached high levels of mechanical complexity, not only through the need to provide instruments with a greater tonal range, but also due to patent laws (especially in North America). It was common for manufacturers to patent the action mechanism used on their instruments, thus requiring any new manufacturer to develop their own version; as the number of manufacturers grew, this led to some instruments having hugely complex arrays of levers, cranks, rods and shafts, which made replacement with an electronic instrument even more attractive.|$|R
40|$|Three indoor, sheeted bag-stack fumigations of {{paddy rice}} using {{aluminium}} phosphide were undertaken in Guangdong Province, southern China. We measured {{the effect of}} two types of sheeting (polyvinylchloride [PVC] or polyethylene [PE]) and two types of floor sealing (clips or fixing into a slot with a rubber pipe) on phosphine concentration and retention. The aim was to test the feasibility of retaining fumigant at a sufficient concentration for long enough to control known resistant insect pests. Each stack was pressure tested and phosphine concentrations measured daily during the fumigation. Cages of test insects in culture medium, including resistant and susceptible strains, were placed inside each stack and could be observed through the clear sheeting. Highest concentrations for the longest period were obtained in a PVC-covered stack that included a ground sheet and wall sheets sealed {{to the floor with}} rubber pipes. A similar PVC-covered stack sealed to the floor with clips instead of <b>pipe</b> did not <b>retain</b> gas as efficiently and required re-dosing. A PE-covered stack, with no ground sheet but also with wall sheets sealed to the floor with pipe, produced an acceptable fumigation. Susceptible Rhyzopertha dominica were controlled in 2 days and the most resistant strain in 15 days. Resistant Cryptolestes ferrugineus survived until day 21. The paddy was still free of insect infestation 7 months later when the bag-stack was opened to mill the rice. Pressure half-lives correlated with gas concentration and retention. Sorption appeared to be a major limiting factor, reducing potential fumigant dosage by about 50 %. The trials demonstrated the feasibility of sealing bag-stacks to a standard high enough to control all known resistant strains...|$|R
