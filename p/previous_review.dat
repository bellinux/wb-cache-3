25|$|A public {{review was}} called, dealing {{primarily}} with objections to receiving {{the rest of}} Bramley. Many petitioned {{to argue that the}} village's links, especially transport, were mainly with Guildford rather than the towns of Godalming (or Farnham). The precedent of the <b>previous</b> <b>review</b> was cited, when a proposal to move Bramley out of Guildford and into Mole Valley was rejected after local opposition. However, the review felt that this did not justify splitting the ward (something the Boundary Commission seeks to avoid completely) and that the other parts of the ward had strong links to Godalming. Furthermore, it cited the point that, in the <b>previous</b> <b>review,</b> Bramley Parish Council had stated that if it were to be moved it would prefer to be moved to South West Surrey and thus argued that the previous objection had accommodated a preferred progressive change towards being wholly in South West Surrey if necessary to equalise electorates.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} findings, Mabus {{considered}} a court-martial for Toussaint but ultimately decided against it, {{because of the}} amount of time that had passed between the incidents and the report, the <b>previous</b> <b>review</b> of the incidents and the short amount of time between Toussaint's return from an overseas deployment and the end of his enlistment. On October 21, the Navy announced that Toussaint would be reassigned to Naval Special Warfare Group 2 in Norfolk, Virginia where he would have no command responsibilities. He received a letter of censure. His planned re-enlistment was denied and he was forced to retire in January 2010. Roughead has also ordered the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to re-examine the case. Sestak has called for Congressional hearings into the hazing allegations.|$|E
500|$|Krall's {{version of}} [...] "Almost Blue" [...] divided critics. On a {{positive}} note, Thom Jurek of AllMusic enjoyed its blues roots {{and called the}} cover [...] "striking". Agreeing, BBC Musics Kathryn Shackleton appreciated Krall's [...] "sultry and raw" [...] vocals, which Creative Loafings Hal Horowitz called [...] "beautifully muted". However, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club questioned its overall composure for not [...] "do much". Despite appreciating Costello's version in a <b>previous</b> <b>review,</b> Wolk from Slate disapproved of her edition and evident genre change, preferring her [...] "pre-rock ballad standards" [...] to her current material.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Joey Lynch of Billboard compared the song's demo {{to the studio}} versions, claiming that [...] "The studio version of 'Joan of Arc' is a massive improvement on the illegally leaked demo that preceded news of the album itself. [...] Nowhere is this more apparent than on 'Joan of Arc,' a solid album track that sounds 10 times better than the leaked version." [...] While reviewing the three tracks released prior to the album, Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called it [...] "arguably the standout of the whole over-blown affair," [...] noting that the song [...] "sounded like a highlight even in its more acoustic demo form, but the album version is a full-on stunner... The song sounds {{a bit like a}} Cardigans leftover circa 'Long Gone Before Daylight'. It's the strongest (anti-)ballad of Madonna's last few albums, and a strong argument for artists responding to the denigration of their art through the more considered medium of the art itself, rather than snap public statements. [...] More than any of the previously released songs, 'Joan of Arc' also establishes one of the foundational themes of Rebel Heart, albeit one not always evident when wading through the poorly sequenced album." [...] Adding to the <b>previous</b> <b>review,</b> Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised the juxtapositions in the album's lyrical content, which according to her, [...] "make some of her most vulnerable, engaging work in years— in particular 'Joan of Arc'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some skeptics {{consider}} the Rorschach inkblot test pseudoscience, as several studies suggested that conclusions reached by test administrators since the 1950s were akin to cold reading. [...] In the 1959 edition of Mental Measurement Yearbook, Lee Cronbach (former President of the Psychometric Society and American Psychological Association) is quoted in a review: [...] "The test has repeatedly failed as a prediction of practical criteria. [...] There {{is nothing in}} the literature to encourage reliance on Rorschach interpretations." [...] In addition, major reviewer Raymond J. McCall writes (p.154): [...] "Though tens of thousands of Rorschach tests have been administered by hundreds of trained professionals since that time (of a <b>previous</b> <b>review),</b> and while many relationships to personality dynamics and behavior have been hypothesized, the vast majority of these relationships have never been validated empirically, despite the appearance of more than 2,000 publications about the test." [...] A moratorium on its use was called for in 1999.|$|E

40|$|The present review {{examines}} {{research on}} the effects of technology use on reading achievement in K- 12 classrooms. Unlike <b>previous</b> <b>reviews,</b> this review applies consistent inclusion standards to focus on studies that met high methodological standards. In addition, methodological and substantive features of the studies are investigated {{to examine the relationship between}} education technology and study features. A total of 85 qualified studies based on over 60, 000 K- 12 participants were included in the final analysis. Consistent with <b>previous</b> <b>reviews</b> of similar focus, the findings suggest that education technology generally produced a positive, though small, effect (ES=+ 0. 16) in comparison to traditional methods. However, the effects may vary by education technology type. In particular, the types of supplementary computer-assisted instruction programs that have dominated the classroom use of education technology in the past few decades are not producing educationally meaningful effects in reading for K- 12 students. In contrast, innovative technology applications and integrated literacy interventions with the support of extensive professional development showed somewhat promising evidence. However, too few randomized studies for these promising approaches are available at this poin...|$|R
