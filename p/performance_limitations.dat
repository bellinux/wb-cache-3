5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft <b>performance</b> <b>limitations,</b> such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{tracking}} <b>performance</b> <b>limitation</b> for a class of networked control systems(NCSs) with two-channel constraints. In communication channels, we consider bandwidth, energy constraints and additive colored Gaussian noise(ACGN) simultaneously. In plant, non-minimal zeros and unstable poles are considered; multi-repeated zeros and poles are also applicable. To obtain the optimal performance, the two-parameter controller is adopted. The theoretical {{results show that the}} optimal tracking performance is influenced by the non-minimum phase zeros, unstable poles, gain at all frequencies of the given plant, and the reference input signal for NCSs. Moreover, the <b>performance</b> <b>limitation</b> is also affected by the limited bandwidth, additive colored Gaussian noise, and the corresponding multiples for the non-minimum phase zeros and unstable poles. Additionally, the channel minimal input power constraints are given under the condition ensuring the stability of the system and acquiring system <b>performance</b> <b>limitation.</b> Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

25|$|On 31 October 1934, the French Ministry of Air {{issued a}} {{specification}} for a heavy fighter. The specification demanded the aircraft {{be capable of}} performing three principal roles: fighter direction, {{in which it was}} required to lead formations of single-engine fighters with sufficient maneuverability; day attack, in which the type was also to escort friendly close air support and bomber aircraft; and nightfighter operations. Specified performance details included a maximum speed of 450km/h at 4,000 meters, a 300km/h cruising speed, and an endurance of at least four hours. Armament requirements included two fixed forward-firing 20mm cannons and a single machine gun to the rear for self-defence. The sought aircraft was also required to accommodate two/three seats along with a twin-engine configuration; however, some of the <b>performance</b> <b>limitations</b> imposed upon the aircraft, such as the maximum weight, served to restrict the range of suitable engines to power the type.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} {{evolved in}} the years between World War I and World War II. Flight decks were installed on several different types of ships to explore the possibilities of operating naval aircraft without the <b>performance</b> <b>limitations</b> of floatation devices required for seaplanes and flying boats. The most successful of these early aircraft carriers were built from battlecruisers. Battlecruisers typically had a speed of about , which was several knots faster {{than the speed of}} contemporary battleships. Additional speed was not necessary for maintaining station with the battle fleet, but enabled the carrier {{to catch up with the}} battle fleet after temporarily leaving formation to turn into the wind for launch or recovery of aircraft. The speed of the carrier during launch effectively decreased the takeoff distance for embarked aircraft, so faster carriers could operate heavier aircraft with greater range and superior combat capability. As such naval aircraft became operational, no nation could risk fielding less capable aircraft; so the speed of later purpose-designed aircraft carriers was set by the speed of the converted battle cruisers. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the displacement of purpose-designed aircraft carriers to 23,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} {{class of}} model proposes that observers {{are limited by}} the total number of items which can be encoded, either because the capacity of VSTM itself is limited (e.g., Cowan, 2001; Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988). This type of model has obvious similarities to urn models used in probability theory (see, for example, Mendenhall, 1967). In essence, an urn model assumes that VSTM is restricted in storage capacity to only a few items, k (often estimated to lie in the range of three-to-five in adults, though fewer in children (Riggs, McTaggart & Simpson, 2006)). The probability that a suprathreshold change will be detected is simply the probability that the change element is encoded in VSTM (i.e., k/N). This capacity limit has been linked to the posterior parietal cortex, the activity of which initially increases with the number of stimuli in the arrays, but saturates at higher set-sizes (Todd & Marois, 2004). Although urn models are used commonly to describe <b>performance</b> <b>limitations</b> in VSTM (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988; Sperling, 1960), it is only recently that the actual structure of items stored has been considered. Luck and colleagues have reported a series of experiments designed specifically to elucidate the structure of information held in VSTM (Luck & Vogel, 1997). This work provides evidence that items stored in VSTM are coherent objects, and not the more elementary features of which those objects are composed.|$|E

The tracking performance is measured by an integral square error between {{the output of the}} plant and the reference signal. Our purpose is to find the fundamental limit for the attainable tracking performance, under any control structure and parameters, in terms of the characteristics and structural parameters of the given plant, {{as well as those of}} the reference signal under consideration. It is shown that this fundamental limit depends on the interaction between the reference signal and the nonminimum phase zeros of the plant and their frequency-dependent directional information.
