It identifies and explains {{the causes of}} landlord and tenant disputes arising mainly from poorly drafted commercial leases. It investigates the relevant codes for leasing business premises, the Law Society business lease, the regulatory reform of part II of the 1954 Act, the British <b>Property</b> Federation <b>lease,</b> and various other attempts at reform of commercial <b>property</b> <b>leases.</b> This research also investigates the potential need for ethnic minorities in commercial property to have the key legal terms of commercial <b>property</b> <b>leases</b> made available in both English and other languages. There is little previous academic research on reform of commercial <b>property</b> <b>leases</b> through legislative intervention (other than Crosby Reading reports). This research aims to contributute towards filling the gap {{that exists in the}} literature by investigating reform through legislation. This research involved semi-structured interviews with participants from five groups: lawyers, surveyors/agents, landlords, tenants and business owners. Most interviewed supported reform of commercial <b>property</b> <b>leases</b> through legislative intervention, and better guidance explaining the meaning of key legal terms of commercial <b>property</b> <b>leases,</b> especially from ethnic minority businesses...|$|R

The custody of the lump sum is the property owner's compensation. We present a theory of leases that emphasizes tenant liquidity risk and owner input moral hazard. Monthly rent leases dominate when tenant consumption depends importantly on owner supplied inputs. However, the antichresis insulates owners from tenant liquidity risk while rent contracts do not, making antichresis leases more attractive for tenant populations with greater liquidity risk.
