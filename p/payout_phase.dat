40|$|Consistent with {{international}} trends, {{the role of}} a Defined Contribution (DC) schemes is expected to grow substantially in India. The <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> of DC schemes has received relatively less attention than the accumulation phase. Key risks to be addressed are the longevity and inflation risks, along with provisions for survivors’ benefits. The paper discusses pros and cons of lump sum, a phased withdrawal, and annuities as options during the <b>payout</b> <b>phase.</b> It emphasizes that for small accumulations, a phased withdrawal may be a better option than annuities. There is a need to research on designing annuities which permit differing risk sharing arrangements among insurance companies, the annuity buyers, and government. Need for developing a world class pension research centre is strongly emphasized to enable India to address pension challenges in an informed and effective manner. pension schemes, annuities, pension pay outs, prension research centre, defined contribution scheme, Economics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the overall {{structure of the}} Danish pension system, reviews the relative role {{of different types of}} pension institutions, and discusses their asset allocation strategies and investment performance. The paper also examines the regulation and supervision of providers of pension services, the growing reliance on risk-based supervision,and the application of the so-called contribution principle. The Danish pension system includes a modest universal social pension with a supplement for low-income pensioners and near universal participation in occupational and personal pensions that are primarily based on defined contribution plans. The annuity market is well developed: 50 percent of annual contributions are allocated to the purchase of deferred annuities, while immediate annuities are also purchased at or even after retirement. However, detailed comprehensive data on the rate of annuitization are lacking. Distinct features of the Danish pension system include the widespread use of profit participating contracts with minimum guaranteed benefits and regular provision of bonuses, covering both the accumulation and <b>payout</b> <b>phases,</b> and extensive use of group deferred annuity contracts. A new traffic light system with periodic stress testing has resulted in greater emphasis on asset liability matching and hedging strategies by pension institutions and a shift in investment policies in favor of foreign bonds and long-term swap contracts.,Debt Markets,Emerging Markets,Pensions&Retirement Systems,Insurance&Risk Mitigation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the move towards risk-based supervision of pension institutions in Denmark. Although Denmark has not adopted a comprehensive model to assess risk it {{has developed a}} number of building blocks which it uses for risk-based assessment. The motivations for improving risk assessment include a desire to identify emerging problems, and concerns about the solvency of pension institutions. In Denmark there is extensive use of guaranteed minimum returns in both the accumulation and <b>payout</b> <b>phases</b> which create substantial obligations on pension institutions, and {{focus attention on the}} integrity and solvency of the institutions which provide them. In conjunction with freeing up investment restrictions and moving towards market valuation of assets, the supervisor has introduced a'traffic light'stress test model which calculates the effect of several market scenarios - the red test which is the more plausible and the yellow test which is possible but less likely. In addition {{to the use of the}} traffic light system, there has been a growing emphasis on the adequacy of internal risk control systems and greater reliance on market discipline. Pension institutions have sought to reduce their exposure to market volatility by better matching of assets and liabilities. There is a much better understanding of the risks inherent in the pension institutions'portfolios, and there has been a substantial increase in the use of hedging instruments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} response allocation amongst two concurrently available computerized slot machines, one dispensing Losses Disguised as Wins (LDWs) while the other did not. Both payouts were equal in the beginning and became consistently worst for the LDW machine by lowering the <b>payout</b> each <b>phase.</b> LDWs are slot machine outcomes, participants bet on a slot machine and win back less than their wager. This may be a problem because participants may react to LDWs as a win, misleading the participant to think they are winning more than they actually are. In the present study the LDW outcome payout started at 80 percent payback and decrease by 20 percent each phase and non LDW, maintained at 400 percent payback over 12 percent of the trials. Twenty individuals were recruited by the researcher. Results indicated that a higher percentages of spins were allocated to the machine dispensing LDW. These results suggest that gamblers have a preference for LDW machines because of the reinforcement of the misleading factors that may indicated a win.

40|$|The current {{economic}} and financial crisis has shaken confidence in funded pension systems in general and in defined contribution (DC) pension plans in particular. The crisis has highlighted the impact of market conditions on retirement savings accumulated in DC pension plans and the uncertainty as to whether those retirement savings may prove adequate to finance retirement – particularly for those close to retirement. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide recommendations on how to ensure adequate retirement income from DC pension plans. In this context, this paper addresses three main questions: 1) How much do people need to save? 2) How can the effects of market risk on DC pension plans be alleviated? 3) How can retirement income be protected during the <b>payout</b> <b>phase?</b> The analysis concludes that in order to deliver adequate retirement income from DC pension plans with a certain degree of certainty, there is a need for comprehensive measures which include: higher contributions; increasing the contribution period by postponing retirement; setting as default options relatively conservative investment policies including life-cycle strategies; and managing risk in the <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> with inflationindexed life annuities. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{dramatic}} financial crisis and with the first waves of baby boomers approaching retirement we hardly need to think about how best to arrive at the pension funds' <b>payout</b> <b>phase.</b> This paper argues that there is an urgent need to raise retirement saving, to reduce defined contribution plan members' exposure to investment risks and to provide the financial industry with cheap and safe payout instruments. These challenges are also likely to call for a more active government role. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, most Central and Eastern European {{countries}} have reformed their pension systems, significantly downsizing their public pillars and creating private pillars based on capitalization accounts. Early policy attention was focused on the accumulation phase but several countries are now reaching the stage where they need to address the design of the <b>payout</b> <b>phase.</b> This paper reviews the complex policy issues that will confront policymakers in this effort and summarizes recent plans and developments in four countries (Poland, Hungary, Estonia, and Lithuania).

40|$|Switzerland {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} with long-term experience on the payout decisions made by retirees in fully-funded pension plans. Switzerland is also atypical in its unusually high annuitization rates: A majority of retirees covered by mandatory occupational pension plans choose an annuity. This paper will shed light on this extraordinary aspect. It revisits the historical role of occupational pension plans in the provision of old age income, and examines the role of regulation in the <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> of the scheme. Recent developments in both market conditions and regulations are used to assess the impact of certain determinants of the annuitization decision, such as money’s worth ratios (MWR), means-tested benefits and behavioral factors.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the Hungarian second pillar since inception has been mixed. This {{is partly due to}} a less than satisfactory support for the 1997 pension reform, conservative fund portfolio distributions, the hybrid nature of the mandatory pension fund system, the segmented nature of the market in terms of costs, and a less than aggressive commitment {{on the part of the}} Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority to a low-cost, transparent, and competitive equilibrium. In the accumulation phase, the authorities would need to further promote transparency and comparability of information on costs and investment performance, facilitate migration to lower cost funds, and more generally promote competition. The regulatory framework of the <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> needs to be overhauled before the first cohort of workers retires.

40|$|This paper assesses how {{countries}} ’ pension {{arrangements and}} regulation shape the appropriate structure and flexibility of retirement payout options. The paper aims at providing {{a guide to}} policy makers on how to address the diverse questions posed when designing the <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> or promoting DC pension arrangements, as well as encouraging a market for annuities. The paper addresses questions concerning the type of retirement payout options for accumulated assets in DC plans a country should allow, which entities should provide annuities, {{and the type of}} annuity products that could be allowed. The main recommendation is for policy makers to consider mandating deferred life annuities that start paying at very old ages (e. g. at age 85) and allow for the remaining assets accumulated in DC accounts to be allocated as programmed withdrawals (preferably with flexibility to face contingencies) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{conceptual}} framework for the <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> in which annuity providers and policyholders share longevity and investment risks in a flexible way. To be more precise, we develop an participating life annuity product in which systematic longevity risk, i. e., the risk associated with systematic deviations from mortality rates extracted from prospective life tables derived for the Portuguese population, is shared between both counterparties. This will {{address some of the}} main demand and supply constraints in annuity markets, namely the inexistence of prospective life tables for the Portuguese population, the perception of unfair pricing, the consideration of bequest motives, adverse selection problems or the lack of financial instruments to hedge against longevity risk. Contrary to traditional GSA's, in which surviving policyholders bear both systematic and unsystematic longevity risk, we devise a contract in which, in exchange for a relatively small premium, annuitants will bear only the part of longevity that exceeds pre-determined thresholds...|$|E
40|$|We address life annuities and pensions, {{looking in}} {{particular}} at transfers/sharing of biometric risks, i. e. risks {{related to the}} annuitant’s lifetime and health status, involved by the policy conditions or the pension plan rules. First, we focus on various arrangements which aim at building the post-retirement income, and involve either the accumulation phase, or the <b>payout</b> <b>phase,</b> or both. Various products are available on financial and insurance markets, each product with a specific guarantee structure (Conventional Life Annuities either immediate or deferred, Variable annuities, withdrawal plans, etc.). We then shift {{to a range of}} specific annuity products, stressing the relevant features: Advanced Life Delayed Annuity (ALDA), Ruin Contingent Life Annuity (RCLA), Variable Annuities (VA). Finally, we focus on some arrangements for the payout phase: the life annuity with a guarantee period, the value-protected life annuity (that is, providing “capital protection”), progressive annuitization schemes, life annuities combined with Long Term Care (LTC) benefits. We conclude with a short introduction to the longevity-linked life annuities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relative}} performance of different investment strategies for {{different structures of}} the <b>payout</b> <b>phase.</b> In particular, it looks at whether the specific glide-path of life-cycle investment strategies {{and the introduction of}} dynamic features in the design of default investment strategies affect significantly retirement income outcomes. The analysis concludes that there is no “one-size-fits-all” default investment option. Life-cycle and dynamic investment strategies deliver comparable replacement rates adjusted by risk. However, life-cycle strategies that maintain a constant exposure to equities during most of the accumulation period, switching swiftly to bonds in the last decade before retirement, seem to produce better results and are easier to explain. Dynamic management strategies can provide somewhat higher replacement rates for a given level of risk than the more deterministic strategies, at least in the case of pay-outs in the form of variable withdrawals. The length of the contribution period also affects the ranking of the different investment strategies with life-cycle strategies having a stronger positive impact the shorter is the contribution period. ...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{introduced}} a mandatory {{retirement savings scheme}} in 1992. This built on pre-existing voluntary occupational plans. The new scheme has been very successful in expanding coverage and mobilizing large financial savings that are equal to close to 100 percent of GDP. However, Australia does not impose restrictions on payout options. The <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> used {{to be dominated by}} lump sum withdrawals, which accounted for 80 percent of benefit payments as recently as 2002. But pension payments increased in recent years and now represent 45 percent of total payments. The vast majority of these pension payments take the form of term annuities and allocated annuities. The latter are similar to phased withdrawals in Chile but run for fixed terms of up to 25 years rather than for lifetime terms. The demand for life annuities and lifetime phased withdrawals is very limited. The paper discusses the factors that have shaped the pattern of demand for retirement products, including the availability of the universal age pension and the effect of clawback provisions, the impact of the high level of home ownership, and the widespread preference of retiring workers for reliance on self-annuitization. The paper also reviews the prudential regulation of superannuation funds and life insurance companies.,Debt Markets,Emerging Markets,Pensions&Retirement Systems,Economic Theory&Research...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a brief {{overview}} of the third pillar of pensions in Albania and what are the different alternatives related to the payout. Referring to the actual development of this market in Albania, experience of the actors involved, I find it indispensable and necessary to provide some theoretical background and considerations, and then build up a simple model of projection of a pension scheme cost and a model for payout alternatives for the Albanian pension funds. A great deal of importance is shown towards posing the assumptions. Also, the paper gives an explanation about the differences among different payout options and suggests the best option for the existing pension funds in Albania. The best option represents my conclusion and recommendation for the actual third pillar of pensions and the others that might join latter. To sum up, the first conclusion of the paper is that the annuity option is the best alternative for the <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> of the pensions. It has the advantage of providing the highest protection against the risk of longevity. The second conclusion is that based on other countries experiences, the annuity market have to be developed hand in hand with the pension system development.

40|$|The Chilean Electronic Market for Annuities {{was created}} in 2004 in order to correct several {{malfunctions}} {{of the market for}} annuities. The Chilean Pension System is composed of two phases. On the accumulation phase, savings are collected and managed by asset managers. The <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> consists in pension payments mainly in the form of annuities and programmed withdrawals. The market for annuities is the interface between these two phases and therefore, any excessive transaction costs in this market will have direct implication in the final pension. The SCOMP or Electronic Consultation and Offer System for Annuities and Phased Withdrawals, replaced the traditional way the pensioners looked for and bought retirement products in the Chilean market. This electronic quotation system was created to help reducing search costs for both retirees and suppliers of retirement products (Life Insurance Companies and Pension Fund Administrators), as well as diminishing room for manipulation by individual brokers. This paper presents and analyzes the main features of the Chilean electronic quotation system, with particular attention to its effects on the industry competitiveness. To this end, statistical evidence is presented to evaluate the benefits of the system in terms of information transparency and price competition in the market...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{economic}} {{issues associated with}} the <b>payout</b> <b>phase</b> where a defined contribution (DC) retirement arrangement is adopted. In particular, the role of annuities in providing a retirement income is examined as well as insurance they provide against retirement risks such as inflation, longevity and rate of return volatility. A comprehensive money&# 146;s worth calculation based on a Australian population cohort mortality table shows that overall, Australian nominal and inflation indexed life annuities provide relatively good value for money. Although relative to annuities sold in the US and the UK they do suffer from relatively high adverse selection costs, which could in turn reduce demand. In addition, {{the presence of a}} government provided safety net pension could also result in low demand for annuities. These two issues suggest that government intervention may be warranted to ensure retirees have access to affordable private insurance to protect their retirement benefit. This could take the form of mandating an annuity purchase at retirement. However, which annuity should be mandated is not well understood. This is an important question as there are many alternative annuity designs, each providing different degrees of retirement risk protection to an individual. This thesis uses numerical simulations to empirically analyse {{the costs and benefits of}} mandating alternative annuities from both an individual and government&# 146;s perspectives to determine optimal annuity design. A model is used to estimate the value of payouts over time from various types of annuities across a range of retirement benefits. A means tested safety net pension is assumed to exist. Two stochastic variables &# 151; inflation and the risky rate of return, are simultaneously used to show how the annuity payouts react to theses changes, highlighting the insurance features of various annuities. Consumer preferences for the various annuities are estimated based on tolerance to risk. The variable annuity dominates the utility rankings under two conditions: [...] when the relative risk aversion is low and a safety net payment isn&# 146;t available, and when the relative risk aversion is high and a safety net payment is made. Otherwise the CPI indexed annuity has the highest ranking. Sensitivity analysis shows that the results presented here are robust to a number of alternative assumptions about the key variables...|$|E
