5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he <b>pulled</b> <b>one</b> person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E

5|$|Bengaluru FC {{started their}} {{campaign}} in the away game against Vietnamese team Lao Toyota F.C.. A defensive lapse by Curtis Osano and an excellent free-kick just outside the penalty box from Phatthana Syvilay meant that Bengaluru were trailing by 2–0 at the 30 minutes mark. In the second half, Lao Toyota were reduced to 10 men, but Bengaluru were unable {{to capitalize on the}} chances created. However, C.K. Vineeth <b>pulled</b> <b>one</b> back in the stoppage time, and the score ended at 2–1 in the favour of the home team.

Bengaluru's attack were unable to convert chances against 10-men Sporting until C.K. Vineeth found {{the back of the}} net in 64th minute. However, the home team's joy was short lived as Odafa {{completed}} his brace in 74th minute and Bengaluru faced first loss at home in the season. In the next home game Bengaluru FC faced I-League debutant DSK Shivajians F.C.. Bengaluru were leading 2–0 with a goal each from Sunil Chhetri and Kim Song-Yong, but due to a defensive error from Bengaluru FC, DSK Shivajians <b>pulled</b> <b>one</b> back by a goal from ex-Bengaluru player Sampath Kuttymani, just before the half time. Bengaluru FC finished the game 4–1 with two more goals in the second half from substitutes Shankar Sampingiraj and Seminlen Doungel, and reclaimed the top spot. In the next game against the defending champion, Mohun Bagan, after the goalless first half, Lalchhuanmawia was sent off by the referee.

25|$|Southampton were {{knocked out}} of the UEFA Europa League on 8 December 2016 when they drew 1–1 with Hapoel Be'er Sheva at St Mary's Stadium. Despite the home side {{dominating}} much of the possession and having many more chances on goal, it was the visitors who took the advantage in the 78th minute when Maor Buzaglo scored the Israeli side's only shot on target after poor defending from the Saints, who were left needing two goals in just over ten minutes in order {{to advance to the}} knockout stages. Defender Virgil van Dijk <b>pulled</b> <b>one</b> back in stoppage time, and Maya Yoshida came close to winning the game with a last-minute header, but the game ended level and Hapoel finished the group in second place.|$|E

25|$|Four days later, Parma {{travelled}} to Lecce, {{knowing a}} win {{at the weekend}} against Lecce would mathematically ensure safety. With Zaccardo not fit, Rolf Feltscher was afforded a rare start for the away side and Lecce had the better of the early stages before Parma came back into it and deserved the lead they took halfway through the second half. It was top scorer Giovinco who found the net with an excellent free-kick. Lecce could have equalised before Parma doubled their lead with a composed finish from Gabriel Paletta who had sprung the offside trap. Nenad Tomović <b>pulled</b> <b>one</b> back with an accurate header late on and Lecce pressed well late on, but failed to get a point. Parma consolidated their place in 9th position.|$|E
25|$|Borussia Dortmund won the UEFA Champions League in 1997. In {{a memorable}} final in Munich, Dortmund faced Juventus.

In the second half, Alessandro Del Piero <b>pulled</b> <b>one</b> back for Juventus with a back heel, then 20-year-old substitute and local boy Lars Ricken latched on to a through pass by Andreas Möller. Only 16 seconds after coming on to the pitch, Ricken chipped Angelo Peruzzi in the Juventus goal from over 20 yards with his first touch of the ball. Dortmund lifted the trophy with a 3–1 victory. Dortmund manager Ottmar Hitzfeld was able to lift the title for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The {{draw for}} {{the second round of}} the League Cup saw Middlesbrough handed a {{historic}} game versus League One side Yeovil Town – the game being the first ever competitive meeting between the two clubs. It turned out to be a comfortable victory for the home side. Gareth Southgate fielded a slightly weakened side, though handed Marvin Emnes his debut, along with first starts for Justin Hoyte and Didier Digard. Mido made his record three goals in three games after he opened the scoring, before Digard got his first goal for the club. Jérémie Aliadière added the third before Gavin Tomlin <b>pulled</b> <b>one</b> back for Yeovil. Emnes got a goal on his debut just after half-time, then Adam Johnson got the final goal to make it 5–1. Meanwhile, there was a full debut for Rhys Williams and a home debut for Josh Walker as they both came on as substitutes.|$|E
