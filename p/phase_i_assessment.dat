The purpose of the investigation was to determine if the Single-Shell Tank Waste Management Areas (WMAs) T and TX-TY have impacted groundwater quality. Waste Management Areas T and TX-TY, located {{in the northern part of}} the 200 West Area of the Hanford Site, contain the 241 -T, 241 -TX, and 241 -TY tank farms and ancillary waste systems. These two units are regulated under RCRA interim-status regulations (under 40 CFR 265. 93) and were placed in assessment groundwater monitoring because of elevated specific conductance in downgradient wells. Anomalous concentrations of technetium- 99, chromium, nitrate, iodine- 129, and cobalt- 60 also were observed in some downgradient wells. <b>Phase</b> <b>I</b> <b>assessment,</b> allowed under 40 CFR 265, provides the owner-operator of a facility with the opportunity to show that the observed contamination has a source other than the regulated unit.

Task 1 collected reference materials needed to complete the SIRID assessment. The documents include reports from the TWRS procedure compliance system (ERMI) that list the SIRID requirements for TWRS in each functional area and the documents that TWRS identified as implementing each SIRID (Phase 1 of the TWRS assessment). Also included are documents that were identified during this assessment as implementing project W- 314 SIRIDs. Task 2 evaluated the 16 TWRS program SIRID functional areas to identify areas that applied specifically to project W- 314. The SIRIDs applicable to project W- 314 were determined by evaluating each individual SIRID in each functional area against the scope of project W- 314 from inception to the point at which it begins operation. The following project W- 314 functional areas were then prioritized into three groups to allocate resources to the most critical items. Priority 1 SIRID functional areas contain requirements that pertain to activities done completely within the scope of project W- 314 (engineering, quality assurance, and construction). Task 3 consisted of an assessment of each functional area, in priority sequence, to further refine the set of SIRIDs that apply to project W- 314. This task involved determining, for each SIRID requirement, a document used on the project that implemented the requirement. This is analogous to a <b>Phase</b> <b>I</b> <b>assessment</b> under the SIRID program but tailored specifically to project W- 314. A matrix was developed to document the results.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Interdisciplinary Health Sciences. Human Nutrition)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Various {{enabling}} {{factors are}} required to incorporate technology in teaching and learning, moving towards a more learner-centred approach. Although efforts are being made to address the situation, the effective incorporation of ICT is not yet the norm in African higher education institutions (HEI). Data is available regarding the situation in African HEI, but very {{little is known about}} the situation of nutrition training. This research programme was divided into three phases. <b>Phase</b> <b>I,</b> <b>assessment</b> of the current use, awareness, attitudes and practices of ICT in nutrition training followed a descriptive, cross-sectional approach. A convenience sample of six HEI in South Africa, Malawi, Zambia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe was included. Data were collected from students (N = 591) and lecturing staff (N = 29) in nutrition-related courses using a questionnaire on ICT awareness, attitude and practices. Phase II, development and validation of a purpose-designed e-learning nutrition module followed a descriptive, cross-sectional approach. An e-learning module on Nutrition and HIV/AIDS with eleven sub-modules was developed, using an e-learning platform taking the specific constraints of developing countries into account. It was validated by expert reviewers (N = 27) for content validity and students (N = 175) for face validity. Phase III, to determine the impact of the module on cognitive knowledge followed an experimental before-after approach and used a set of twenty True/False questions for eight of the sub-modules (N = 173). Although there is widespread accessibility to computers, less so to the internet, in nutrition-related courses at Southern African HEI, respondents still felt that more computers should be made available. Computers are not fast enough and lack of finances is the main barrier to home and internet access. Students rate their ICT skills as average to good. Institutional ICT policies and support seem to be lacking, but their attitude to ICT is positive and supportive. Respondents felt that ICT could add a new dimension to nutrition training and are in favour of application of ICT in different modes. Most indicate that the current use of ICT in nutrition training is inadequate. The Nutrition in HIV/AIDS module was validated and found to be useful as an educational tool, being user-friendly, interactive and self-paced. The majority of students reported that their ICT skills were sufficient to complete the e-learning activity. Although generally rated as at least as effective, or more effective than conventional lectures, clearly this mode of elearning should not replace traditional teaching. The content was found to be comprehensive and evidence-based. The depth of the content was sufficient, the level correct for undergraduates and the material relevant to the Southern African context. The interactivity was deemed important, helpful and effective. Most students indicated that they would recommend the Nutrition in HIV/AIDS module to other students, that they enjoyed the presentation and learnt something new. There was an improvement in knowledge scores and/or the number of questions being answered correctly in all but one sub-module. The results confirm previous studies indicating that well-designed elearning modules have the potential to increase the performance of students...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{temperature}} is common after brain trauma and stroke, {{considered to be}} detrimental to outcome and usually treated with systemic cooling interventions. However, targeting cooling interventions at the head may be more logical. In addition to arterial blood, the human brain is cooled by heat loss through the skull and heat loss from the upper airways. It is these two mechanisms of heat loss which {{are the subject of}} this thesis. The initial research aim was to find out if restoring ‘normal’ airflow through the upper respiratory tracts of intubated, brain-injured patients could reduce brain temperature. Air at room temperature and humidity replicating normal resting minute volume was continuously administered nasally to 15 such patients. After a 30 minute baseline, they were randomised to receive airflow or no airflow for 6 hours and then crossed over for a further 6 hours. The airflow did not produce significant reductions in intracranial temperature (Mean - 0. 13 °C, SD 0. 55 °C, 95 % CI - 0. 43 to 0. 17 °C). However, some evidence of heat loss through the skull was serendipitously observed. This was investigated formally in a randomised factorial trial, together with nasal airflow with enhancements (unhumidified air at twice minute volume with 20 ppm nitric oxide gas) intended to overcome some of the possible reasons for the neutral results with ‘normal’ airflow. After a 30 minute baseline, 12 intubated, brain-injured patients received enhanced nasal airflow, bilateral head fanning (8 m/s), both together and no intervention in randomised order. Each intervention was delivered for 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes washout. Mean brain temperature was reduced by 0. 15 °C with nasal airflow (p= 0. 001, 95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 23 °C) and 0. 26 °C with head fanning (p< 0. 001, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 34 °C). The estimate of the combined effect of airflow and fanning on brain temperature was 0. 41 °C. Physiologically, this study demonstrated that heat loss through the upper airways and through the skull can reduce parenchymal brain temperature in brain-injured humans, that the effects are additive and the onset of temperature reduction is rapid. The most promising mechanism appeared to be heat loss through the skull and the final piece of research involved developing and initial (<b>phase</b> <b>I)</b> <b>assessment</b> of a convective head cooling device in healthy volunteers, with intracranial temperature measured non-invasively by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After a 10 minute baseline, five healthy volunteers received 30 minutes head cooling followed by 30 minutes head and neck cooling via a hood and neck collar delivering 14. 5 °C air at 42. 5 L/s. The net brain temperature reduction with head cooling was 0. 45 °C (SD 0. 23 °C, p= 0. 01, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 74 °C) and with head and neck cooling 0. 37 °C (SD 0. 30 °C, p= 0. 049, 95 % CI 0. 00 to 0. 74 °C). There was no significant reduction in cooling with progressive depth into the brain i. e. core brain was cooled. The main relevance of this research is physiological because it adds to knowledge and understanding of mechanisms of heat loss from the upper airways and through the skull in humans. Clinically, factors which enhance or inhibit these mechanisms may have an effect on brain temperature but the therapeutic relevance of head cooling by these methods requires further research.

The region has annual CO{sub 2 } emissions of about 265 million metric tonnes (292 million tons), primarily from 122 coal-fired electric generation facilities, some of which burn almost 4. 5 million tonnes (5 million tons) of coal per year (U. S. Department of Energy, 2010). Validation Phase (Phase II) field tests gathered pilot data to update the Characterization Phase (<b>Phase</b> <b>I)</b> <b>assessment</b> of options for capture, transportation, and storage of CO{sub 2 } emissions in three geological sink types: coal seams, oil fields, and saline reservoirs. Four small-scale field tests were conducted to determine the properties of rock units that control injectivity of CO{sub 2 }, assess the total storage resources, examine {{the security of the}} overlying rock units that act as seals for the reservoirs, and develop ways to control and measure the safety of injection and storage processes. The MGSC designed field test operational plans for pilot sites based on the site screening process, MVA program needs, the selection of equipment related to CO{sub 2 } injection, and design of a data acquisition system. Reservoir modeling, computational simulations, and statistical methods assessed and interpreted data gathered from the field tests. Monitoring, Verification, and Accounting (MVA) programs were established to detect leakage of injected CO{sub 2 } and ensure public safety. Public outreach and education remained {{an important part of the}} project; meetings and presentations informed public and private regional stakeholders of the results and findings. A miscible (liquid) CO{sub 2 } flood pilot project was conducted in the Clore Formation sandstone (Mississippian System, Chesterian Series) at Mumford Hills Field in Posey County, southwestern Indiana, and an immiscible CO{sub 2 } flood pilot was conducted in the Jackson sandstone (Mississippian System Big Clifty Sandstone Member) at the Sugar Creek Field in Hopkins County, western Kentucky. Up to 12 % incremental oil recovery was estimated based on these pilots. A CO{sub 2 } huff ânâ puff (HNP) pilot project was conducted in the Cypress Sandstone in the Loudon Field. This pilot was designed to measure and record data that could be used to calibrate a reservoir simulation model. A pilot project at the Tanquary Farms site in Wabash County, southeastern Illinois, tested the potential storage of CO{sub 2 } in the Springfield Coal Member of the Carbondale Formation (Pennsylvanian System), in order to gauge the potential for large-scale CO{sub 2 } storage and/or enhanced coal bed methane recovery from Illinois Basin coal beds. The pilot results from all four sites showed that CO{sub 2 } could be injected into the subsurface without adversely affecting groundwater. Additionally, hydrocarbon production was enhanced, giving further evidence that CO{sub 2 } storage in oil reservoirs and coal beds offers an economic advantage. Results from the MVA program at each site indicated that injected CO{sub 2 } did not leave the injection zone. Topical reports were completed on the Middle and Late Devonian New Albany Shale and Basin CO{sub 2 } emissions. The efficacy of the New Albany Shale as a storage sink could be substantial if low injectivity concerns can be alleviated. CO{sub 2 } emissions in the Illinois Basin were projected to be dominated by coal-fired power plants...|$|E

Often they are done as part of a property transfer and are done along with a <b>Phase</b> <b>I</b> Environmental Site <b>Assessment.</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} hazardous material {{and public health}} and safety impacts from implementation of the Homewood Mountain Resort (HMR) Ski Area Master Plan (Project). The analysis presented in this chapter is based partly on review of the <b>Phase</b> <b>I</b> Environmental Site <b>Assessment</b> (<b>Phase</b> <b>I</b> ESA) prepared for the HMR property (Robison Engineering 2005). The Project area consists of 20 contiguous parcels on 1, 200 acres in Placer County near the west shore of Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The property is forestland developed as a ski resort since the 1960 s. Elevation of the property ranges from 6, 360 to 7, 880 feet above sea level. Generally, the property slopes steeply to the east toward Lake Tahoe. The community of Homewood, which consists of residences, a post office and several small businesses, is situated east of the Project area, between HMR and the west shore of Lake Tahoe. The west, north, and south sides of HMR are bordered by undeveloped forestland administered by the USDA Forest Service (USFS), Lake Tahoe Management Unit (LTBMU) ...|$|R
