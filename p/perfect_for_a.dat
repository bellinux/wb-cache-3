5|$|Shortly {{after his}} music career took off, began {{receiving}} offers for acting roles. He turned down every request until 1994, {{when he was}} offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film Maverick. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie's release Black received {{an increasing number of}} calls from directors who thought he would be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and The Larry Sanders Show. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack's wife. Black had a major role in another television movie Going Home, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film Anger Management.|$|E
25|$|Father Crespí had {{identified}} a location along the Los Angeles River {{that would be}} <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> settlement, possibly a mission, but in 1781, King Charles III of Spain ordered that a pueblo be built on the site, {{which would be the}} second town in Alta California after San José de Guadalupe, founded in 1777. By royal edict, all of the waters of the river and its tributaries were reserved for the Pueblo de Los Angeles, a condition which would have a profound impact on development of the Valley.|$|E
25|$|With {{a better}} {{knowledge}} of the beetles distribution and habitat a recovery plan was formed. The first plan of action was to identify the areas targeted for recovery. It was decided that if four of the karst invertebrates (Neoleptoneta myopica, Tartarocreagris texana, Tevamaurops reddelli, and Batrisodes texanus) inhabited a cave {{it needed to be}} deemed a long term protection plan. If a habitat is to be recovered areas that contain high diversity and contain other rare fauna should be chosen. The additional listing of species should be taken into thought when choosing recovery areas. Areas of land selected for recovery should be spread out as far as possible to protect from a major catastrophic event does not take out the entire population. Other factors to consider when selecting recovery sites include areas that ensure long term protection, stable environment, and past and present land use. The second part of the recovery plan was to decide the size of area needed to save them. Areas of large continuous karst landscape must be implicated to ensure the survival of the invertebrates. Groundwater movements, topography, and drainage pattern were taken into place when selecting areas for recovery. All of these things must be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> successful recovery. Also the type of use for surrounding land must be considered. If the area is to close to development, many factors can threaten its recovery including the threats listed above. The final step of the plan included land acquisition, conservation easements, and cooperative agreements with landowners. This final is very important. Without the land needed to save the invertebrates the recovery can not take place and the endangered species will become extinct.|$|E

500|$|On 1 April Benfica faced Porto in {{the second}} Clássico of the season, and a second-half goal by Sabry helped the club defeat their {{historic}} rivals. Gomes Ferreira commented: [...] "The game was <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nil-nil draw, when in the 67th minute a moment of genius decided the game: a great, meaningful goal from Saby, launching Benfica into the title race and hampering Porto". Benfica maintained their momentum {{on a trip to}} the Portalegre team, Campomaiorense. An early dismissal of José Soares helped them win easily, with Sabry scoring in a fourth consecutive game.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{wanted to}} start filming in Canada {{in order to save}} money. This plan was contended by Johnson, and the film's cinematographer, Ericson Core, after they found a {{preferred}} area for shooting around downtown Los Angeles' Arcade Building. Core noted that the appeal came from the [...] "beautiful, old brick buildings and great rooftops," [...] which they felt was <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> depiction of Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, in comparison to the studio's choice where the filming would be done in Montreal or Vancouver. Due to their insistence, coupled with Ben Affleck's disinterest in filming in Canada (after having filmed there for his previous film, The Sum of All Fears) they were able to change the studio's mind.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} The Sun Also Rises {{guaranteed}} interest from Broadway and Hollywood. In 1927 two Broadway producers wanted {{to adapt the}} story for the stage but made no immediate offers. Hemingway considered marketing the story directly to Hollywood, telling his editor Max Perkins {{that he would not}} sell it for less than $30,000—money he wanted his estranged wife Hadley Richardson to have. Conrad Aiken thought the book was <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film adaptation solely on the strength of dialogue. Hemingway would not see a stage or film adaption anytime soon: he sold the film rights to RKO Pictures in 1932, but only in 1956 was the novel adapted to a film of the same name. Peter Viertel wrote the screenplay. Tyrone Power as Jake played the lead role opposite Ava Gardner as Brett and Errol Flynn as Mike. The royalties went to Richardson. [...] It was again adapted into a film in 1984. It was adapted into a one-act opera in 2000.|$|E

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it [...] "", and added that with [...] "Footprints" [...] Lewis would receive comparisons to Carey. Digital Spy's reviewers gave similar opinions about [...] "Footprints in the Sand".

Most {{of the time we}} have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But if you do it right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E

In addition, Ebert wrote that the film's closing was <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> future installment, giving X2 three out of four stars. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was rare for a sequel to be better than its predecessor.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Hugh Jackman heavily improved his performance, concluding [...] "X2 is a summer firecracker.

[...] Furthermore, {{he noted that the}} jokes were more pronounced in this episode, making the opening scene during Prismo's party that much funnier.

2500|$|According to Wittgenstein, {{philosophical}} {{problems arise}} when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, {{where all the}} familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed.

Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the [...] "rough ground" [...] of ordinary language in use. Much of the Investigations consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: [...] "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity.
