50|$|By definition, an {{automatic}} {{fire suppression system}} can operate without human intervention. To do so it must possess a means of detection, actuation and delivery. In many systems, detection is accomplished by mechanical or electrical means. Mechanical detection uses fusible-link or thermo-bulb detectors. These detectors are designed to separate at a specific temperature and release tension on a release mechanism. Electrical detection uses heat detectors equipped with self-restoring, normally-open contacts which close when a predetermined temperature is reached. Remote and local manual operation is also possible. Actuation usually involves either a pressurized fluid and a release valve, {{or in some cases}} an electric <b>pump.</b> <b>Delivery</b> is accomplished by means of piping and nozzles.

In Group P, epidural analgesic solution was administered as a bolus before the surgical incision and was continued until the end of the surgery.

HUVECs were suspended as single cells in Matrigel and injected subcutaneously in the abdominal midline. Within 10 days after injection, HUVECs expressed pseudopod-like extensions and began to accumulate in arrays. By day 20, we observed human vessels that contained erythrocytes, and on day 30 we observed perivascular cells that expressed smooth muscle actin, thus resembling mature vessels. Throughout the experimental period, HUVECs bound Ulex europaeus lectin and expressed CD 31, VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor, as well as ICAM- 2. A fraction of the cells also expressed the proliferation marker Ki 67. Moreover, the sialomucin CD 34, which is rapidly down-regulated in cultured HUVECs, was reinduced in vivo. However, we found no reinduction of CD 34 in cells cultured inside or on top of Matrigel in vitro. We also injected cells suspended in Matrigel around the catheter tip of implanted osmotic <b>pumps.</b> <b>Delivery</b> of recombinant human interferon-γ by this route led to strong induction of MHC class II and ICAM- 1 on the human vessels.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. M. E. thesis. August 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 153 pages. The {{goal of this}} thesis {{is to develop a}} computationally inexpensive, accurate, and practical mathematical model of a hydraulic reed style check valve. While the modeling of disc style check valves is well represented in literature, reed valve modeling research has focused on applications in air compressors and internal combustion engines, where the working fluid has low density, viscosity, and bulk modulus. However, in a hydraulic system, the fluid – namely oil – is dense, viscous, and stiff, contributing additional physical effects that must be considered. Furthermore, the operating pressure in hydraulic systems is higher than in pneumatic systems, creating additional challenges from a structural perspective. In this thesis, a one degree of freedom hydraulic disc and reed style check valve model were developed using a hybrid analytical, computational, and experimental approach. The disc valve equation of motion was derived from Newton’s second law applied to the disc considering forces including pressure, spring reaction, and drag. Euler- Bernoulli beam theory was used to derive the reed valve equation of motion. In each case, the valve flow rate was modeled as quasi-steady orifice flow using an empirical discharge coefficient. A non-contact method of experimentally measuring check valve position during operation using a laser triangulation sensor (LTS) was developed. An acrylic viewing window was installed in the check valve manifold to allow optical access. To precisely measure position through air, acrylic, and oil, refraction of the laser light was accounted for using Snell’s law. Finally, the disc and reed valve models were validated {{in the context of a}} single cylinder hydraulic piston pump across a range of operating conditions. <b>Pump</b> <b>delivery,</b> which is a measure of volumetric efficiency, and check valve position were chosen as the validation metrics. Experimental results showed that both the disc and reed check valve model accurately predicted the timing of valve opening and closing.

40|$|OBJECTIVEdChildren {{and adults}} with type 1 {{diabetes}} who receive insulin pump therapy have reported hypoglycemia during air travel. We studied the effects of atmospheric pressure on insulin <b>pump</b> <b>delivery.</b> RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODSdTen insulin pumpswere connected to capillary tubes. The effects of changes in ambient pressure on insulin delivery, bubble formation, bubble size, and cartridge plunger movement were analyzed. RESULTSdDuring a flight (200 mmHg pressure decrease), excess insulin delivery of 0. 623 % of the cartridge volume occurred (P, 0. 001, Student t test). In hypobaric chamber studies, bubbles developed in the insulin when the pressure decreased and displaced the insulin out of the cartridge. Pre-existing bubbles changed in size consistent with Boyle law. Cartridge plunger movement did not occur in normal flight conditions but did occur when catastrophic plane depressurization was mimicked. CONCLUSIONSdAtmospheric pressure reduction causes predictable, unintended insulin delivery in pumps by bubble formation and expansion of existing bubbles. A 10 -year-old girl with well-controlled{{type 1 diabetes}} managed with in-sulin pump therapy developed re-current hypoglycemia 60 to 90 min after commencing commercial air travel. Upon direct inquiry, we are now aware of 50 children and adults using insulin pumps who experience this phenomenon. In 1994, Aanderud et al. (1) demon-strated that insulin pumps delivered “more insulin than the set rate during de-compression. ” At sea level, the ambient pressure is 760 mmHg (1 atmosphere).
