In this work, a new technique for stabilization of femoral and humeral fractures constituted {{by the use of}} intramedullary pin and paracortical <b>pins</b> <b>fixed</b> with polymethylmethacrylate was evaluated. Twelve animals (six cats and six dogs) were used. Three of them had humeral fracture and the others had femoral fractures. The bone healing was evaluated by radiographic monitoring 30, 60 and 90 days after the surgery. It was observed, immediately after the deployment of the technology (trans-operative period), that the method effectively neutralized the forces of rotation, bending, shear and axial displacement, providing degrees of alignment and adequate affixing; however, over time, the required stability did not remain, causing delay in bone union of some animals. Moreover, wound dehiscence, integrity loss of the implants and osteomyelitis were observed. This approach to fractures stabilization is applicable only to transverse fractures or slightly oblique ones, and can be considered inefficient, facing the number of imperfections observed during the research...|$|R

40|$|Undesired {{vibration}} {{may occur}} in lightweight structures due to excitation and low damping. For {{the purpose of}} vibration attenuation, resonantly shunted piezoelectric transducers can be an appropriate measure. In this paper, uncertainty in design and application of resonantly shunted piezoelectric patch transducers to attenuate the vibration of a beam due to uncertain rotational support stiffness and uncertain static axial loading is investigated. A linear mathematical model of a beam with piezoelectric patch transducers using RITZ formulation {{is used to calculate}} the vibration attenuation potential under uncertainty. Variation in the support stiffness and variation static axial loading lead to detuning and cause the resonant shunt to work off the desired frequency, resulting in higher vibration amplitudes. For a beam that is <b>pinned</b> or <b>fixed</b> at both ends, the attenuation effect is less sensitive to uncertainty in the support stiffness than in case of an elastic support that is neither fully <b>pinned</b> nor fully <b>fixed</b> at both ends.

Morphogens form spatially non-uniform profiles in tissues and cells are instructed based on thresholds of {{concentration in the}} profiles. The numerical profiles usually need to be converted from experimental data, such as images, to common scale for proper comparison. Three normalization methods, Minimum Variance, Extrema <b>Pinning,</b> and <b>Fixed</b> Integral, are commonly used in the conversion processes and their efficacies have never been evaluated. In this study, we compare these methods using computationally simulated data. We constructed a mathematical model to simulate the production, diffusion, and decay behavior of a morphogen to generate 2 ̆ 7 ground truth 2 ̆ 7 data that contains the true quantitative information of the molecule that cannot be easily acquired experimentally. We then added noise to represent the various errors produced in experiments and processed the noisy data as we would with real experimental data. Statistical analysis, including significance testing and sample size estimation, were performed on data before and after normalization. We found that Minimum Variance is the most efficient method in capturing true data profiles and detecting incremental differences. Extrema <b>Pinning</b> and <b>Fixed</b> Integral, however, exhibit weakness in data distortion and high demand for samples, respectively. Our results indicate that extra {{care must be taken}} in experiments in choosing the most efficient method for data comparison. ...|$|R

Designed for high current loads, these devices also find applications in lower current, extremely low dropout-critical systems, where their tiny dropout voltage and ground current values are important attributes.

Five <b>pin</b> <b>fixed</b> voltage versions feature logic level ON/OFF control and an error flag which signals whenever the output falls out of regulation.
