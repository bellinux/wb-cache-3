50|$|Filderkraut is {{a special}} kind of Sauerkraut which is not {{prepared}} from ordinary white cabbage but from <b>pointed</b> <b>cabbage</b> which is grown on the Fildern Plains near Stuttgart.The Swabian potato salad is also very famous in Germany and even in other countries. In contrast to the mayonnaise-dressed potato salad in Northern Germany, it is lighter and contains less fat. Waxy potatoes are cooked and peeled when they are still hot. Then they are sliced and mixed with diced onions before they are poured over with warm broth, vinegar and oil (great emphasis is laid {{on the fact that the}} liquid components are not mixed before being poured over the potatoes although the chronological order may vary from recipe to recipe). Optional they can be garnished with chive, diced pickles or spiced with mustard.The salad should rest for a few hours or even overnight before serving and can then be enjoyed as accompaniment for different dishes or solely with bread.Of course there are many recipe variations differing in tiny details: the choice of the potato breed, the temperature for peeling, the thickness of the slices and the way of slicing, the amount and addition order of the liquid component, the amount and kind of spices. Naturally most Swabians are convinced that the potato salad of their mother is the very best and only true one.|$|E
40|$|Glucosinolates are {{important}} secondary compounds, {{commonly found in}} Brassicaceae. To what extent these sulfur and nitrogen containing compounds contribute to the total sulfur pool was investigated. In various cultivars of Brassica oleracea viz. curly kale, <b>pointed</b> <b>cabbage,</b> red cabbage, savoy cabbage and white cabbage, total glucosinolate content and composition of the glucosinolate pool (aliphatic, aromatic and indolyl glucosinolates) were measured, together with determination of the total and inorganic sulfur and nitrogen contents. Differences in {{the contents of the}} individual glucosinolates were found between cultivars and plant parts. In all cultivars the total glucosinolate content was highest in the roots. Roots of curly kale had the highest gluconasturtiin content (12. 6 mumol g(- 1) DW), while the shoot of white cabbage had the lowest glucoiberin content (0. 3 mumol g(- 1) DW). Between all cultivars significant differences in glucosinolate content per class were found. Aromatic glucosinolates were highest in the roots of curly kale, accounting for 63 % of the total content, while the roots of savoy cabbage had the highest aliphatic glucosinolate content (8. 1 mumol g(- 1) DW). Expression of the total glucosinolate fraction on a total sulfur basis showed that the contribution of the glucosinolate fraction was very low (1 - 2 %). Since a large amount of total sulfur was present as sulfate (70 - 88 %). total glucosinolate content was also expressed on an organic sulfur basis. These values ranged between 10 - 23 %, for white cabbage and savoy cabbage, respectively. We conclude that expression on an organic sulfur basis is a better parameter to assess the fraction of glucosinolates than on a total sulfur basis. In addition, the organic fraction appears to be a better parameter to define the sulfur requirement for structural growth...|$|E

5000|$|Eden Park {{was located}} at the low <b>point</b> of <b>Cabbage</b> Tree Swamp, with the road running on a {{causeway}} across it. Eden Park {{has been used as}} a sports ground since 1900, and by 1914 the ground was drained and turned into two ovals for cricket. [...] Eden Park has been the home of Auckland Cricket since 1910 and Auckland Rugby since 1925. Its 100-year history boasts some of New Zealand's proudest sporting moments, including the 1950 Empire Games, the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, and the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Since the early 1900s it has hosted major rugby and cricket matches, and is now a regular host of the Bledisloe Cup, ITM Cup, and the Super Rugby games. Most recently, Eden Park hosted the finals for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and it has been named the co-host for 2015 Cricket World Cup.|$|R
