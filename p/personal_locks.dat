He {{is best known for}} his inventions of locks, especially the cylinder lock. His basic lock design is still widely distributed today, and constitute a majority of <b>personal</b> <b>locks</b> and safes.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{cases from}} the Third Circuit, with direct {{similarities}} to Ortega's, {{argued for the}} reasonableness of his privacy expectation. In one, the presence of sensitive and confidential documents within a desk was held to strengthen the privacy expectation; and in the other, [...] the <b>personal</b> <b>lock</b> that a police officer had used for his department locker led to the suppression of a sawed-off shotgun seized by federal agents.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Master Lock {{introduced}} {{a new line of}} combination padlocks called the dialSpeed. The dialSpeed lock is battery-operated, has a lit face, and features multiple user-programmable combinations. It has a master unlocking code that can be accessed through the company web site. The product won a 2011 silver Edison Award. In 2014 Master Lock acquired Sentry Safe for $117.5 million. New products in the 2000s moved beyond locks themselves, including other sealing mechanisms such as industrial space covers.Distribution of Master Lock products occurs through wholesale distributors that then send the locks to individual retailers. Locks are made for a variety of uses, including <b>personal</b> <b>locking,</b> vehicle locking, and others.|$|R

5000|$|Captain Horatio Huffenpuff - Also called [...] "Uncle Captain", he is Beany's kindly {{uncle and}} the Captain of the Leakin' Lena, which takes the pals from one {{destination}} to the other. The Captain is {{always willing to}} instruct Beany and Cecil on their latest assignment, but is rather cowardly and refuses to put himself in any <b>personal</b> jeopardy, <b>locking</b> himself below deck or under a box labeled [...] "Capt. Huffenpuff's Hiding Box" [...] {{for most of the}} episodes. Uncle Captain was voiced by Jim MacGeorge in both series.|$|R
5000|$|At the Index on Censorship Awards, Jon Phillips said of Khartabil, [...] "Locking up Bassel only <b>locks</b> out his <b>personal</b> freedom. By <b>locking</b> up Bassel, his Syrian captors are accidentally {{locking out}} {{themselves}} from the future...thousands of people that Bassel’s work helped, now help him by spreading the message #FREEBASSEL. This is what truly builds Syria and connects it to the global connected future. This award proves that his lock-up, is NOT a lock-out of his digital freedom." ...|$|R
40|$|Guanxi {{has been}} well studied in Chinese {{management}} as a vital factor associated with business strategy and HRM in Chinese communities. However, Guanxi may not be crucial anymore, because Chinese MNCs are rapidly becoming global players since they have started to merge with and acquire Western MNCs, but not through the guanxi related to international strategy. Recently, “a Chinese company bought IBM <b>Personal</b> Computers <b>lock,</b> stock and barrel. Chinese corporations have bought Thomson and RCA televisions, Dirt Devil etc. ” (James Dyson, 2005). This paper investigates Taiwanese MNCs pursuing an internationalisation strategy, and discusses implications for the way third world MNCs manages their international employees. Interview data from twenty four Taiwanese-owned companies are used to identify how the Chinese cultural value of guanxi, underpins their management style in the British context. The paper finds that there are sectoral differences between the IT and financial service industries {{in terms of the}} way guanxi affects recruitment and company location decisions. It is concluded that national culture is still an important factor to influence the international strategy and HRM practice in MNCs of third world origin...|$|R
50|$|Special duct loading {{conditions}} may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, {{and to some}} extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5 ft. to 15 ft. in diameter, and 20 ft. to 30 ft. long. Therefore access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit <b>personal</b> access with <b>locked</b> access.|$|R
50|$|During the Cobra Civil War, the Dreadnoks {{sided with}} Cobra Commander (in reality, the Crimson Guardsman Fred VII, who was impersonating Cobra Commander) against Serpentor. A new Thunder Machine served as Fred's {{transport}} during the conflict. While fellow Dreadnok Buzzer was fighting G.I. Joe general Hawk {{on top of}} the Thunder Machine, Thrasher crashed it into Destro's <b>personal</b> D.E.M.O.N. tank, <b>locking</b> bumpers. After the Thunder Machine was evacuated, Destro ordered the D.E.M.O.N. to fire on it, freeing the vehicle but knocking it over. Thrasher used Monkeywrench's grenades to upright it, a decision he later regretted; while the vehicle remained structurally sound, its engine was damaged, although it remained operational enough to return Fred back to his troops.|$|R
5000|$|Steely Dan often {{incorporated}} jazz {{into their}} music during the 1970s. [...] "Rikki Don't Lose That Number" [...] appropriates the bass pattern from Horace Silver's 1965 song [...] "Song for My Father", while [...] "Parker's Band" [...] features Charlie Parker-influenced riffs and a lyric that invites listeners to [...] "take {{a piece of}} Mr. Parker's band." [...] Baxter's guitar playing drew on jazz and rock and roll influences. On Duke Ellington's [...] "East St. Louis Toodle-oo", he imitates a ragtime mute-trombone solo. Certain songs incorporate additional instrumentation, including exotic percussion, violin sections, bells, and horns. Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that the solos are [...] "functional rather than <b>personal</b> or expressive, <b>locked</b> into {{the workings of the}} music".|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} smart {{multimedia}} devices, multimedia smartphones {{have become the}} most widespread due to their convenient portability and real-time information sharing, as well as various other built-in features. Accordingly, since personal and business activities {{can be carried out}} using multimedia smartphones without restrictions based on time and location, people have more leisure time and convenience than ever. However, problems such as loss, theft, and information leakage because of convenient portability have also increased proportionally. As a result, most multimedia smartphones are equipped with various built-in locking features. Pattern <b>lock,</b> <b>personal</b> identification numbers, and passwords are the most used locking features on current smartphones, but these are vulnerable to shoulder surfing and smudge attacks, allowing malicious users to bypass the security feature easily. In particular, the smudge attack technique is a convenient way to unlock multimedia smartphones after they have been stolen. In this paper, we propose the secure locking screen using time pattern (SLSTP) focusing on improved security and convenience for users to support human-centric multimedia device completely. The SLSTP can provide a simple interface to users and reduce the risk factors pertaining to security leakage to malicious third parties...|$|R
