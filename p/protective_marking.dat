40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{introduce}} the proposal of the technological line (from the initial intake of the essential raw material to the final product) {{for the production of}} pellets from biomass. For better understanding, this work presents the characteristics of various types of biomass and its most common use in everyday life with the focus on specific kinds of pellets (standards, certificates, <b>protective</b> <b>marks</b> both Czech and foreign). Further it informs about the issue of classification, quality frameworks and specification of solid biomass for energy purposes and characteristics associated with the legislation, technologies, techniques and legislative conditions of use of waste biomass. It also compares the different types of pellet samples in the relation to the most important aspects (contents of substances, ash, calorific value etc.) and in what price range they appear in our market. Subsequently, on this basis, the assessment of the technical and economic aspects of the proposed solutions is carried out and the major physical chemical features of biomass are described...|$|R
50|$|Since {{bees are}} {{characterized}} by a distinct color pattern {{as well as a}} defensive sting, they have been subject to mimicry in order to gain its known <b>protective</b> <b>mark.</b> Bumble bees are resembled by sawflies, other bees, day-flying moths, beetles, and flies. Cimbicid sawflies resemble bees, but have swollen antenna tips as a distinguisher. Other bees, such as carpenter and digger bees, contain a striking resemblance to bumble bees, but males contain a yellow clypeus and females have hindlegs with brushes rather than a pollen basket, which is a characteristic of bumble bees. Clearwing hawk moths (of the family Sphingidae such as the species Hemaris thetis) resemble bumble bees while foraging through flowers, but are distinct with skinny legs and spindle antennae. Bumble flower beetles (Scarabaeidae such as Euphoria inda) maintains a similar flight behavior to bumble bees like flying close to plants and buzzing loudly. The longhorned beetle also has a color scheme paralleling bumble bees. Flower flies are especially similar mimics of bumble bees, such as the robber fly, deer bot fly, and bee fly. Bumble bees have developed Müllerian mimicry, when poisonous species mimic other dangerous species' warning signals, as a reinforced defense against predators.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 More than 2, 000 male newts were {{collected}} {{during the summer and}} maintained unfed at 10 °C both pre- and post-irradiation. Exposures ranging up to 30 kR were given with 300 kVp X-rays and ⁶⁰Co gamma rays. Half of the newts were injected (I. P.) with 15 g DMSO/kg (the maximum sublethal dose) just before exposure. The remainder were irradiated without treatment. The mean survival time-exposure curves for both groups of animals were typically sigmoid. However, the mean survival times of the DMSO-treated newts were significantly longer for all exposures between 200 R and 15 kR. The threshold lethal dose for the untreated newts was 200 R, while at exposures up to 600 R the DMSO-treated animals showed a mean survival time not significantly different from the fasting controls (370 days). A dose-reduction factor of 2. 45 was calculated for the time presumed to represent the predominant phase of the hematopoietic syndrome (200 days). Additional studies revealed a linear relationship between the concentration of DMSO administered and the degree of radioprotection afforded and demonstrated clearly that DMSO must be administered prior to irradiation to be <b>protective.</b> <b>Marked</b> changes in the physiological status of the DMSO-treated newts were observed which may partially account for their reduced radiosensitivity. DMSO-treated newts showed a decreased metabolic rate during the early post-injection period. Their red blood cell count underwent a dramatic increase, while untreated newts displayed the typical post-irradiation anemia. DMSO also appeared to prevent the visible skin ulcerations following irradiation commonly observed in the non-treated newts...|$|R

40|$|Vaccines {{are needed}} to prevent the oculogenital {{diseases}} of Chlamydia trachomatis. Infected hosts develop immunity, although temporary, and experimental vaccines have yielded significant protective immunity in animal models, fueling the impetus for a vaccine. Because infections cause sequelae, the functional relationship between infection- and vaccine-induced immunity is unclear. We hypothesized that infection- and vaccine-induced immunity are functionally distinct, particularly {{in the ability to}} prevent sequelae. Chlamydia-immune mice, with immunity generated by either a previous infection or vaccination, exhibited a significant degree of <b>protective</b> immunity, <b>marked</b> by a lower-intensity, abbreviated course of infection. However, vaccinated mice were protected from infertility, whereas preinfected mice were not. Thus, infection-induced immunity does not prevent the pathologic process leading to infertility. Furthermore, T cell subsets, especially CD 8 T cells, {{play a major role in}} Chlamydia-induced infertility. The results have important implications for the immunopathogenesis of chlamydial disease and new vaccine strategies.

40|$|Abstract: The {{military}} {{organization is}} dependent on timely access to up-to-date, relevant and trustworthy information in order to conduct its business. Access to information {{is controlled by the}} user’s security clearance and the classification or <b>protective</b> <b>marking</b> of the data. Whilst it is necessary to preserve data confidentiality and integrity, controls have resulted in strict separation between different levels of security. This regime not only constrains the type and level of information sharing that can be achieved, more critically the speed at which access may be realized is impeded. The military is moving towards Network Enabled Capability (NEC) where the emphasis is on resource sharing within national contingents and on a coalition basis, facilitated by the Network. Future capability is predicated on the core attribute of agility. NEC is expected to enable the dynamic formation of communities of interest and the rapid reorganisation of resources as required by military commanders. This paper tests the assertion that the ability to express, verify and implement flexible security policy is essential to achieve the agility required. The assertion is tested through the practical application of a suitable security policy framework to a small but representative case study, the results of which will be of interest to system architects and decision makers alike.

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{addition}} to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that {{the first player to}} use a <b>protective</b> visor <b>Mark</b> Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, and Under Armour, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon. While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes {{in the case of a}} serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty.|$|R
