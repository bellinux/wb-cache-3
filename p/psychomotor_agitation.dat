This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500mg at a time). The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>agitation.</b> In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.|$|E
500|$|Dopamine {{contributes}} to the action selection process {{in at least two}} important ways. First, it sets the [...] "threshold" [...] for initiating actions. The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior. As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and impulsive behavior; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions. Parkinson's disease, in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement—however, when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person. In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including at the extreme, <b>psychomotor</b> <b>agitation</b> and stereotyped movements.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Kraepelin's partial {{interpretation}} of agitated depression as a mixed state of "manic-depressive insanity" (including the current concept of bipolar disorder) {{has recently been}} the focus of much research. This paper tested whether, how, and to what extent both <b>psychomotor</b> symptoms, <b>agitation</b> and retardation in depression are related to bipolarity and anxiety. METHOD: The prospective Zurich Study assessed psychiatric and somatic syndromes in a community sample of young adults (N = 591) (aged 20 at first interview) by six interviews over 20 years (1979 - 1999). <b>Psychomotor</b> symptoms of <b>agitation</b> and retardation were assessed by professional interviewers from age 22 to 40 (five interviews) {{on the basis of the}} observed and reported behaviour within the interview section on depression. Psychiatric diagnoses were strictly operationalised and, in the case of bipolar-II disorder, were broader than proposed by DSM-IV-TR and ICD- 10. As indicators of bipolarity, the association with bipolar disorder, a family history of mania/hypomania/cyclothymia, together with hypomanic and cyclothymic temperament as assessed by the general behavior inventory (GBI) [15], and mood lability (an element of cyclothymic temperament) were used. RESULTS: Agitated and retarded depressive states were equally associated with the indicators of bipolarity and with anxiety. Longitudinally, agitation and retardation were significantly associated with each other (OR = 1. 8, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 3. 2), and this combined group of major depressives showed stronger associations with bipolarity, with both hypomanic/cyclothymic and depressive temperamental traits, and with anxiety. Among agitated, non-retarded depressives, unipolar mood disorder was even twice as common as bipolar mood disorder. CONCLUSION: Combined agitated and retarded major depressive states are more often bipolar than unipolar, but, in general, agitated depression (with or without retardation) is not more frequently bipolar than retarded depression (with or without agitation), and pure agitated depression is even much less frequently bipolar than unipolar. The findings do not support the hypothesis that agitated depressive syndromes are mixed states. LIMITATIONS: The results are limited to a population up to the age of 40; bipolar-I disorders could not be analysed (small N) ...|$|R

50|$|The social {{navigation}} or niche change hypothesis {{proposes that}} depression {{is a social}} navigation adaptation of last resort, designed especially to help individuals overcome costly, complex contractual constraints on their social niche.

Simultaneously, publicly displayed symptoms, which reduce the depressive's ability to conduct basic life activities, serve as a social signal of need; the signal's costliness for the depressive certifies its honesty. Finally, for social partners who find it uneconomical to respond helpfully to an honest signal of need, the same depressive symptoms also {{have the potential to}} extort relevant concessions and compromises.

40|$|Background: The CORE {{measure was}} {{designed}} to assess psychomotor symptoms and the probability of melancholia in depressed people. We tested the inter-rater {{reliability and validity of}} the Dutch version of the CORE. Methods: Thirty-seven elderly, depressed in-patients were studied. The CORE, Salpêtrière Retardation Rating Scale (SRRS), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-self-report version (QIDS) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were administered. The inter-rater reliability of the CORE was examined by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of agreement between five independent raters. Construct validity was assessed by calculating Spearman rho (ρ) correlations between CORE and SRRS, QIDS and MADRS measure scores. Results: The ICC for total CORE scores was 0. 80, while, for the CORE sub-scales the ICCs were 0. 74 for non-interactiveness, 0. 70 for retardation and 0. 79 for agitation, indicating high inter-rater reliability. Associations between the CORE and SRRS measures supported the validity of the CORE as a measure of psychomotor disturbance, while correlations between the CORE agitation sub-scale and agitation items derived from the QIDS and MADRS were low to moderate. Limitations: Both the sample size and the comparator measures of <b>psychomotor</b> disturbance (especially <b>agitation)</b> may have compromised construct validity analyses. Conclusions: High inter-rater reliability was demonstrated for the Dutch CORE measure. Its validity as a measure of psychomotor disturbance was supported in analyses involving total CORE scores. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

The relation between switching-pause duration and maternal depression was studied in 15 depressed and 20 nondepressed mother-infant dyads. Switching pauses of depressed mothers were longer, more variable, and less consistent with scalar timing. mother-infant interaction vocal timing postpartum depression switching pause Mother-infant interaction has a dialogic or conversational structure {{that depends on the}} mother’s ability to respond quickly and consistently to infant vocalizations (Beebe, Jaffe, Feldstein, Mays, & Alson, 1985).

In a study of mothers with mild depressive symptoms, Bettes (1988) found that switching pauses were longer and more variable in symptomatic mothers.

To evaluate switching pauses in relation to maternal depression, we studied (unipolar) depressed and comparison nondepressed mother-infant pairs in a play interaction at 4 months of age.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} found that in {{patients}} suffering from unipolar depression, associated depersonalization symptomatology is more intense compared to healthy controls, and also that there is a positive correlation between depression and depersonalization. According to data that may be found in the literature, there is a relatively high prevalence of depersonalization symptomatology in unipolar depressions. Our study was aimed at finding whether the presence of depersonalization was related to a specific phenomenological expression of depressive symptomatology in unipolar depression. Subjects and methods: The study included 84 subjects suffering from unipolar depression without psychotic features. Based on the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) score, the subjects were divided into two groups – a group with associated depersonalization (CDS≥ 70) (40 subjects) and a group with subsyndromal depersonalization (CDS< 70) (44 subjects), the later one being treated as a control group. The groups were compared in regard to the intensity of depressive symptomatology, depressive symptoms frequency and the depressive symptoms duration. The General Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale and The Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 were used. Results: The depressive patients with depersonalization had predominantly severe episodes, almost all patients had feelings of sadness, insomnia, and decrease of energetic potentials. The biggest difference between the groups, in terms of greater number of manifest symptoms in the patients with depersonalization, was for <b>psychomotor</b> disturbances (<b>agitation</b> or retardation), insomnia, decrease of energetic potentials and concentration. At the same time, 75 % of the subjects with associated depersonalization had anhedonia, sadness/dysphoria, insomnia and decrease of energetic potentials continuously present. Unlike this group, the control group subjects experienced sadness, appetite problems, concentration and motor behavior changes almost half as frequently. Particularly significant were the differences regarding suicidal thoughts. It was shown that in the group with depersonalization there was a higher percentage of patients with suicidal thoughts, mostly continuously present, which represent a significant suicidal risk factor. Conclusion: Unipolar depression, associated with depersonalization is more severe in its intensity. It has a bigger number of manifest symptoms which have a tendency to continuous duration. A special focus is on the negative impact on the occurrence and lasting presence of suicidal thoughts...|$|R

50|$|<b>Psychomotor</b> <b>agitation</b> {{is a set}} of {{symptoms}} that stem from mental tension and anxiety.

Typical manifestations include pacing around a room, wringing the hands, uncontrolled tongue movement, pulling off clothing and putting it back on, and other similar actions. In more severe cases, the motions may become harmful to the individual, such as ripping, tearing, or chewing at the skin around one's fingernails, lips, or other body parts to the point of bleeding. <b>Psychomotor</b> <b>agitation</b> is typically found in major depressive disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, and sometimes the manic phase in bipolar disorder, though it can also be a result of an excess intake of stimulants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about {{specific}} mood symptoms that may confer risk for suicidal ideation (SI) among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). We evaluated prospectively whether particular symptoms of depression and mania precede the onset or worsening of SI, among adults {{with or without a}} history of a suicide attempt. METHODS: We examined prospective data from a large (N = 2, 741) cohort of patients participating in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD). We evaluated history of suicide attempts at baseline, and symptoms of depression and mania at baseline and follow-up visits. Hierarchical linear modeling tested whether specific mood symptoms predicted subsequent levels of SI, and whether the strength of the associations differed based on suicide attempt history, after accounting for the influence of other mood symptoms and current SI. RESULTS: Beyond overall current depression and mania symptom severity, baseline SI, and illness characteristics, several mood symptoms, including guilt, reduced self-esteem, <b>psychomotor</b> retardation and <b>agitation,</b> increases in appetite, and distractibility predicted more severe levels of subsequent SI. Problems with concentration, distraction, sleep loss and decreased need for sleep predicted subsequent SI more strongly among individuals with a suicide attempt history. CONCLUSIONS: Several specific mood symptoms may confer risk for the onset or worsening of SI among treatment-seeking patients with BD. Individuals with a previous suicide attempt may be at greater risk in part due to greater reactivity to certain mood symptoms in the form of SI. However, overall, effect sizes were small, suggesting the need to identify additional proximal predictors of SI...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} two years after stroke {{approximately}} one-third of the patients suffer from depression, also referred to as post-stroke depression (PSD). Patients with PSD suffer from symptoms, such as a diminished interest or pleasure (anhedonia), depressed mood, sleep disturbances, loss of energy, changes in appetite, feelings of inappropriate guilt, concentration difficulties, <b>psychomotor</b> retardation or <b>agitation,</b> and suicidal thoughts. PSD aggravates the burden of physical, psychological and social disability after a stroke and hinders patient participation in rehabilitation. Therefore, the timely recognition and diagnosis of PSD is essential for the optimization of patient recovery from stroke. In this thesis, first, the role of nurses in the daily care of depressed stroke patients is studied in a systematic literature review, focusing on the early detection of PSD and therapeutic interventions that they can use. The findings showed that nurses distinguished a screening role from an intervening role. They recognized symptoms of depression, however, they experienced the assessment of psychological status as difficult {{because of a lack of}} knowledge, skills, and training. Measurement scales supporting their observations were seldom used. We also investigated the clinical manifestation of PSD as compared to patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic diseases other than stroke or with patients in general practice. The findings demonstrated broadly similar symptom profiles in the three cohorts, showing that PSD is not a different type of depression. However, the stroke patients suffered more severely from these symptoms than the patients with other symptomatic atherosclerotic diseases or the patients in general practice. Subsequently, the clinimetric properties of the 9 -item and the 2 -item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9, PHQ- 2) were investigated in daily nursing practice of hospitalized patients with stroke able to communicate adequately. The inter-rater reliability, the test re-test reliability and the internal consistency of the PHQ- 9 were shown to be good. Nurses judged the PHQ- 9 to be a brief and easy-to-use instrument in daily practice of nursing stroke care. The PHQ- 9 performed best at a score ≥­ 10 and the PHQ- 2 at a score ≥ 2. Administering the PHQ- 9 only to patients who scored ≥­ 2 on the PHQ- 2 improved the identification of depression. The timely detection of PSD, however, is complicated by a decrease in the length of hospital stay, resulting in a large proportion of patients who are discharged within two weeks after stroke. Therefore, we developed and validated the Post-Stroke Depression Prediction Scale (DePreS). This prediction rule enables clinicians to estimate the degree of the depression risk for an individual patient within the first week after stroke. The prediction could be used as the basis for a more selective screening process for PSD. In conclusion, to decrease the burden of PSD and the negative impact on patients' recovery health care providers, such as nurses, taking care of patients with stroke should use valid and reliable assessment tools in order to detect PSD, which needs to be followed by effective and efficient treatment...|$|R

5000|$|Two {{features}} of both mania or hypomania and depression may superficially overlap and even resemble each other, namely [...] "an increase in goal-directed activity" [...] (psychomotor acceleration) vs. <b>psychomotor</b> <b>agitation</b> and [...] "flight of ideas" [...] and [...] "racing thoughts" [...] vs. depressive rumination. Attending to the patient's experiences is very important. In the <b>psychomotor</b> <b>agitation</b> commonly seen in depression, the [...] "nervous energy" [...] is always overshadowed {{by a strong}} sense of exhaustion and manifests as purposeless movements (e.g., pacing, hand-wringing); in psychomotor acceleration, however, the excess in movement stems from an abundance of energy and is often channelled and purposeful. Likewise, in depressive rumination, the patient experiences the repetitive thoughts as heavy, leaden, and plodding; in psychic acceleration, however, (as seen in mania or hypomania) the thoughts move in a rapid progression, with many themes, rather than a singular one, being touched upon. Even when such experiences are accounted for on the basis of depression, the possibility does still exist, however, that the depressive episode may be complicated by other manic or hypomanic symptoms, in which case it is often prudent to attend to the patient's personal and family history (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, early age of onset) {{to determine whether or not}} the patient has bipolar disorder.|$|E
