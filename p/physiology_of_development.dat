40|$|ALK (anaplastic {{lymphoma}} kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered {{as part of}} the NPM-ALK fusion protein, {{resulting from}} a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The native ALK protein is normally expressed in the developing and, at a weaker level, adult nervous system. We recently demonstrated that ALK is a novel dependence receptor. As such, in the absence of ligand, the ALK receptor is kinase inactive and its expression results in enhanced apoptosis, whereas kinase activation, due to a ligand or constitutive as in NPM-ALK, decreases apoptosis. Unligated/kinase unactivated ALK receptor facilitates apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the exposure of a proapoptotic juxta-membrane intra-cellular domain. This review summarizes the biological significance of the ALK receptor in cancer and development, in perspective with its dependence receptor function. The dual function of ALK in the <b>physiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> is illustrated in the visual system of Drosophila. In this part of the nervous system, ALK in the presence of ligand appears essential for axonal guidance, whereas in the absence of ligand, ALK expression can lead to developmental neuronal apoptosis. ALK is also found expressed in neural crest-derived tumors such as human neuroblastomas or glioblastomas but its role is not fully elucidated. However, an excessive or constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activation can lead to deregulation of cell proliferation and survival, therefore to human cancers such as lymphomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Our observations could have important implications in the therapy of ALK-positive tumors harboring the chimeric or wild type ALK protein...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{well-documented}} fact for a {{group of}} persistent, bioaccumulating organohalogens contaminants, namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), is that appropriate regulation was delayed, on average, up to 50 years. Some of the delay may be attributed {{to the fact that the}} science of toxicology was in its infancy when PCBs were introduced in 1920 's. Nevertheless, even following the development of modern toxicology this story repeats itself 45 years later with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) another compound of concern for public health. The question is why? One possible explanation may be the low coherence between experimental studies of toxic effects in animal models and human studies. To explore this further, we reviewed a total of 807 PubMed abstracts and full texts reporting studies of toxic effects of PCB and PBDE in animal models. Our analysis documents that human epidemiological studies of PBDE stand to gain little from animal studies due to the following: 1) the significant delay between the commercialisation of a substance and studies with animal models; 2) experimental exposure levels in animals are several orders of magnitude higher than exposures in the general human population; 3) the limited set of evidence-based endocrine endpoints; 4) the traditional testing sequence (adult animals – neonates – foetuses) postpones investigation of the critical developmental stages; 5) limited number of animal species with human-like toxicokinetics, <b>physiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> and pregnancy; 6) lack of suitable experimental outcomes for the purpose of epidemiological studies. Our comparison of published PCB and PBDE studies underscore an important shortcoming: history has, unfortunately, repeated itself. Broadening the crosstalk between the various branches of toxicology should therefore accelerate accumulation of data to enable timely and appropriate regulatory action. </p...|$|E
40|$|To characterise the <b>physiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> and {{senescence}} for Grevillea 2 ̆ 7 Sylvia 2 ̆ 7 floral organs, respiration, ethylene {{production and}} ACC concentrations in harvested flowers and flower parts were measured. The respiration rate of harvested inflorescences decreased over time during senescence. In contrast, both ethylene production and ACC concentration increased. Individual flowers, either detached from cut inflorescences held in vases at 20 oC or detached from in planta inflorescences {{at various stages}} of development, had similar patterns of change in ACC concentration and rates of respiration and ethylene production as whole inflorescences. The correlation between ACC concentration and ethylene production by individual flowers detached from cut inflorescences held in vases was poor (r 2 = 0. 03). The isolated complete gynoecium (inclusive of the pedicel) produced increasing amounts of ethylene during development. Further sub-division of flower parts and measurement of their ethylene production at various stages of development revealed that the distal part of the gynoecium (inclusive of the stigma) had {{the highest rate of}} ethylene production. In turn, anthers had higher rates of ethylene production and also higher ACC concentrations than the proximal part of the gynoecium (inclusive of the ovary). Rates of ethylene production and ACC concentrations for tepal abscission zone tissue and adjacent central tepal zone tissue were similar. ACC concentration in pollen was similar to that in senescing perianth tissue. Overall, respiration, ethylene and ACC content measurements suggest that senescence of G. 2 ̆ 7 Sylvia 2 ̆ 7 is non-climacteric in character. Nonetheless, the phytohormone ethylene is produced and evidently mediates normal flower development and non-climacteric senescence processes...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a great revival of {{interest}} among plant physiologists throughout the world in problems associated with growth and development in plants. Most of this recent work has been carried out with annual species since it is generally considered more convenient to work with such plants. For this reason our knowledge of the physiology of growth in woody species falls short of that for herbaceous plants. There can be no doubt, of course, that many of the results obtained from the study of herbaceous plants hold also for woody species. For example, evidence will be brought forward below to support the view that the mechanism of photoperiodism is the same for both woody and herbaceous species. Similarly, it has been shown (Czaja, 1934) that auxin is present in the growing shoots of certain woody species, just as in herbaceous plants. Nevertheless, there are many features of growth peculiar to woody species and not found in typical herbaceous plants. For example, growth of the shoot in herbs is normally terminated by flower formation, whereas in most woody species the annual cycle of growth in a high proportion of the growing points is ultimately terminated not by a flower bud, but by a vegetative resting bud. Investigation of features of growth Great Britain are (1) temperature; (2) light intensity;(3) length of day. The probable importance of temperature and light intensity in affecting the annual cycle of growth in woody species has long been recognized, and in the past these, together with rainfall, have generally been considered to be the over-riding factors. The discovery, however, that such processes as the duration of extension growth and time of leaf-fall in woody species may be affected by length of day under experimental conditions (Garner ana Allard, 1923) raises the question as to how far this factor is important in affecting the annual rhythm of growth in nature. Very little definite information on this subject is available at present, and it was therefore decided to carry out an intensive study of the annual cycle of several growth processes in a single species, with special reference to the role of photoperiodic effects in the annual cycle of growth. For this purpose the species, Pinus sylvestris L, appeared to have several advantages, viz. : (1) Various other species of the genus Pinus were already known to show marked photoperiodic effects (Bogdanov, 1931, Kramer, 1936, Jester and Kramer, 1939), ana there were grounds for expecting that P. sylvestris would also prove to be 'photoperiodic' (Sylven, 1942). (2) It is a species which is indigenous to Great Britain (at least in the North, and is naturalised in southern England). Hence observations with respect to the annual cycle of growth under natural climatic conditions could be regarded as 'normal' for this species. An intensive study of the annual cycle of growth, in the light of more recent advances in the <b>physiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> {{does not appear to have}} been made previously for a woody species, although it has been done for various herbaceous plants, including the onion (e. g. Heath, 1940) and certain cereals (e. g. Purvis and Gregory, 1937). Before the experimental work is described, a brief account of the normal cycle of growth in Pinus sylvestris will be given, since a knowledge of this is essential before an attempt is made to discover the factors which determine it. <p...|$|E

40|$|Resident tissue myeloid cells {{play a role}} in {{many aspects}} <b>of</b> <b>physiology</b> {{including}} <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the vascular systems. In the blood vasculature, myeloid cells use VEGFC to promote angiogenesis and can use Wnt ligands to control vascular branching and to promote vascular regression.

Using myeloid-specific deletion of the WNT transporter Wntless we show that myeloid Wnt ligands are active at two distinct stages <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the dermal lymphatics. As lymphatic progenitors are emigrating from the cardinal vein and intersomitic vessels, myeloid Wnt ligands regulate both their numbers and migration distance. Later in lymphatic development, myeloid Wnt ligands regulate proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and thus control lymphatic vessel caliber. Myeloid-specific deletion of WNT co-receptor Lrp 5 or Wnt 5 a gain-of-function also produce elevated caliber in dermal lymphatic capillaries. These data thus suggest that myeloid cells produce Wnt ligands to regulate lymphatic development and use Wnt pathway co-receptors to regulate the balance of Wnt ligand activity during the macrophage-LEC interaction...|$|R
