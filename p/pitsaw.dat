500|$|The Avery Homestead is {{a two-story}} Colonial-style house that is {{believed}} to have been originally constructed around 1696. The main block of the house is built in the double cube of the Georgian style. It is unknown if the house originally began as a one-room one-story house with the original structure having been on the current east-end of the main block. The expansion and alteration of houses in this way was common in Ledyard and tool markings and different fenestration patterns are supporting evidence for this theory. The strongest evidence is the <b>pitsaw</b> marks found on the chimney girts in the hall and parlor, exposed framing and sheathing has markings consistent with a water-powered up-and-down saw. It is certain that the house had achieved its two-story and two-room appearance by 1726 due to its parlor being used as a meeting room for church services. Further evidence in the construction of the fireplace flues which indicates that the main block of the house was completed prior to the American Revolution. Around 1780, the main house was extended by [...] in the rear during a two-story addition that gives the house a slight saltbox appearance. This changes were made while under the ownership of Theophilus Avery. Around 1870, under the ownership Theophilus Avery's grandson, also Theophilus Avery, the original kitchen ell was removed from the building and became a separate building to the east of the house. The new and present ell that was constructed served as an open shed until 1965 when it was converted to a shop and office.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the timbers {{would have}} been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller timbers were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using <b>pitsaws</b> or frame saws. Today, timbers are more {{commonly}} bandsawn, and the timbers may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides.|$|R

50|$|Internally, {{the plan}} {{consists}} of four rooms with a central rear foyer. Walls are rendered brick with wallpaper (with some evidence of earlier wallpaper), ceilings are hardboard with timber cover strips below early plaster and lathe, and cedar joinery includes panelled doors, architraves and skirtings. The two fireplaces have timber surrounds, and the floors consist of <b>pitsawn</b> boards with carpet over.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the future}} {{increase}} in timber supply {{in many countries}} is expected to come from agroforestry farms, the problem of on farm timber sawing, physical strain on sawyers caused by “Pitsawing ” {{have to be addressed}} in order to increase the timber sawing productivity. This study was designed to analyze the productivity and energy expenditure by sawyers when using <b>Pitsawing</b> platforms (PSP) and Portable Steel Log Sawing Platforms (PLSP) in agroforestry farms. The study was conducted in South Kilimanjaro in Kiruweni and Nduweni villages. Data on energy expenditure were obtained through heart rate measurement by using heart rate monitor. Productivity data of both <b>Pitsawing</b> and Portable log sawing platforms were obtained through time studies by using stop watch. Microsoft Excel spread sheet was used for data analysis. Results indicated that when using PLSP site preparation production rates increased from 0. 1 m 3 per hour observed under PSP to 2. 9 m 3 /h. The skidding production rate when using PSP technique was 3. ...|$|R

40|$|Forests in Tanzania occupy {{nearly half}} of the country's total land area. Most of the forestland is {{classified}} as woodland, with smaller areas in tropical high forest, mangrove forest, and plantations. An increasing share of industrial wood is harvested from the plantations, although <b>pitsawing</b> of native timber remains an important component of lumber production. About 97 percent of total roundwood consumption is for fuelwood and charcoal, and much of the country's current emphasis in forestry is on the establishment of village woodlots and agroforestry plots. Education in forestry and forest products is provided by two technical institutes and one university. Wildlife remains an important part of Tanzania's natural resource heritage, and the country supports some of the largest remaining populations of many African game species...|$|R

ABSTRACT: This study assessed Woodstock, species richness, tree diversity and Importance Value Index (IVI) of Chenene Forest Reserve (CFR). Forest inventory carried out in 120 systematically selected sample plots. The forest was post stratified into disturbed and undisturbed strata. The information recorded includes: diameter at breast height, species name, Geographical Positioning System (GPS) readings, and frequency of the species. Indicators of human activities such as charcoal kilns, <b>pitsawing,</b> burnt area and grazing signs. Analysis of the inventory data was done using Microsoft Excel. The inventory carried out in 2011 revealed that average number of stems per hectare (N), basal areas per hectare G (m 2 ha- 1), and volume per hectare V (m 3 ha- 1) as 352 35. 20 (SE), 6. 84 0. 68 (SE) and 44. 68 4. 47 (SE) respectively. The parameters between disturbed and undisturbed strata in this study revealed low parameters in disturbed stratum as compared to undisturbed strata were 567 ± 87. 37 stems h...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the conservation status of tree populations {{and the impact}} of illegal logging in the Niassa National Reserve, a huge protected area in northern Mozambique, bordering Tanzania. The Miombo woodland around 8 villages was sampled on 43 transects laid out from log patios showing evidence of felling. Standing trees and stumps of 8 timber species (P. angolensis, A. quanzensis, M. sthulmannii, B. africana, C. imberbe, D. melanoxylon, P. angolensis and S. madagascariensis) were identified, quantified and measured. A total of 173 respondents in 12 villages were interviewed about their perception on logging and its benefits. Logging had removed 41 % of the trees above the minimum cutting diameter (20 - 50 cm dbh, depending on the species). On average, less than 2 m 3 /ha of standing volume of commercial-sized trees remained, of which very few had good form. <b>Pitsaws</b> where trees had been sawn into planks were widespread and large quantities of waste wood were left on the ground. Planks produced had been transported to Tanzania, where they were sold or further processed. Arrangements for logging were not transparent and villagers complained that they did not receive the benefits accorded by law to communities involved in legal logging (20 % of the profits). Fewer than half of the respondents were in favour of a complete stop of logging; instead, they hoped to obtain greater benefits from it. In return for access, loggers had built schools in two villages, and some local leaders and villagers had received building materials from them. Villagers claimed that people in the area lack forestry skills such as operating chainsaws and transforming timber into products. If required, carpenters have to be brought from Tanzania. Uncontrolled logging has left insufficient volume for future timber harvesting, meaning community forestry is not a feasible livelihood option. Furthermore, tree growth in the reserve is slow (0. 25 cm/yr dbh) and felling is incompatible with the primary management objective of the reserve, which is conservation. The methodology applied here to evaluate the impact of logging could be applied elsewhere to monitor logging and determine whether to issue logging licenses for a specific area...|$|R

40|$|A unique {{forested area}} survives on the Usambara {{mountains}} of north-eastern Tanzania. These forests have been {{isolated from the}} Guinea-Congo rainforests {{for a very long}} period and, as a result, 25 - 30 % of plant species are endemic to the area. The forests are also home to several endemic birds, mammals and a remarkably large number of amphibians. However, many of these plant and animal species are threatened with extinction by extensive forest clearance for agriculture and timber extraction. Much of the forest was cleared in the colonial period, firstly for coffee and later for tea cultivation. Recently the tea estates have suffered from poor management and many people have abandoned work on them and have cleared forest land to practice low-grade agriculture. A particular problem has come with the growing of cardamom. The ground storey of the forest is cleared to cultivate the cardamom under the canopy. This cultivation prevents regeneration of the forest trees and when, after seven or eight years, the yields of the cardamom begin to decline, the people clear the canopy trees to plant maize, sugar cane and cassava. Large areas of forest are being destroyed in this way. Further problems have come from pit-sawers who illegally cut timber in the forests for sale, both in near-by markets and across the border in Kenya. The forest had also been the subject of industrial logging by a parastatal cooperation but this was stopped recently {{when it became clear that}} the logging was unsustainable. Since 1986 IUCN has had a project in the Usambaras funded by the EEC, which has been attempting to give more effective protection to the forest, whilst helping the local people to develop agricultural systems which will be less destructive. The project is based on a process of consultation with local communities. A locally recruited staff member is assigned to each of the thirteen villages in the East Usambaras to encourage the formation of a village development committee. Through the village coordinators the project is able to engage in a dialogue with the villagers, both to ascertain their needs and aspirations and to explain to them the long term environmental problems that will result if the forests are lost. The village committees have been encouraged to come up with their own ideas on solutions to the problem and if these ideas are felt by the project staff to be viable, support is available to help implement them. This support takes the form of the provision of agricultural tools, tree seeds and seedlings, plastic bags for tree growing, earth moving equipment to build fish ponds and fish fry to stock them, and help with transporting building materials and agricultural produce. Attempts have been made to bring the artisanal <b>pitsawing</b> of timber under proper control. The intention was to license villagers to pit-saw timber in forests adjacent to their village land. So far the difficulties in preventing outsiders from logging the forests have been so great that it has been found necessary to put a total ban on all timber extraction. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the forest could support a moderate yield of valuable timber, which is much in demand in local towns; this could provide an incentive to the villagers to maintain forest areas. In its first three years of operation the villagers working with the project have planted 100 kilometres of boundary strips around the forest reserves and 30 hectares or communal plantations, a total of half a million trees. Five central and 168 village tree nurseries have been established. The project has helped villagers put in contour strips on a thousand farms, over an average of 1 - 2 hectares per farm and 40 fish ponds have been constructed and stocked. More importantly/here have been changes in the attitudes of the farmers. They are adopting contour terracing on a wide scale and many farmers have started to plant cloves, pepper and coffee as a source of cash. The forests of the East Usamabaras are still very much under threat. The number of people in the area is simply too great for the land resources available. But working with the villagers has resulted in increased sensitivity to conservation problems, law enforcement is much better tolerated and there is now a genuine effort being made on the part of everybody, from the small farmer to the national administration, to find ways of reconciling the needs of the peoples of me Usambaras and the need to conserve its rich flora and fauna.
