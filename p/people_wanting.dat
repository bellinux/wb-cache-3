5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, there {{remained}} only 40 Mérens horses {{registered in the}} breed studbook. The breed was saved from extinction by utopian communities believing in an ecological apocalypse. As part of the hippie movement, <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> {{to live on the}} fringe of society settled in the small villages of Ariege. They boosted the local economy, including encouraging the resumption of the breeding of Mérens. At the same time, the story of the semi-feral horse Bonbon became a local phenomenon. This Mérens, orphaned following an accident, was raised on bottle-fed goat milk. He was then sold to a horse-dealer before later returning to his homeland and winning prizes as a stallion. He died at twenty, having returned to his herd high in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Brick Lane {{screening}} – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy.

Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> to take home a piece of the film.|$|E

5|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was a toll bridge built by Julian Tolmé in 1873, in the {{expectation}} that the western terminus of the Hammersmith and City Railway would shortly be built on the north bank, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the number of <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> to cross the river at this point. The railway terminus was not built, and problems with drainage on the approach road made access to the bridge difficult for vehicles. Wandsworth Bridge was commercially unsuccessful, and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made toll-free. Tolmé's bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses, and in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} done by Senri Kita, an artist {{new to the}} series. In contrast to previous Fire Emblem games, where the protagonist was of royal blood, the main character Ike {{was intended to be}} of lower social rank, a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it. Ike was born from the many ideas for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game, with many <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> the protagonist everyone could empathize with. His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait by male staff. A character that returned from previous games was Jeigan, who was this time designed as a female character. Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge. This also resulted in higher-quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages. The full-motion videos were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier. Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team. The game's subtitle does not refer to a specific object or place, but instead acts {{as a metaphor for the}} journeys of Ike and other characters.|$|E

Beginning around 1897, as Irving was in decline, Stoker had depended increasingly on his writing for money.

While Stoker is known today for Dracula, he wrote seventeen other novels as well as many short stories and pieces for periodicals.|$|E

25|$|The main {{components}} of LGBT tourism is for destinations, accommodations and travel services wishing to attract LGBT tourists; people looking {{to travel to}} LGBT-friendly destinations; <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> travel with other LGBT people when traveling regardless of the destination and LGBT travelers who are mainly concerned with cultural and safety issues. The slang term gaycation has come to imply a version of a vacation that includes a pronounced aspect of LGBT culture, either in the journey or destination. The LGBT tourism industry includes destinations (tourism offices and CVBs), travel agents, accommodations and hotel groups, tour companies, cruise lines and travel advertising and promotions companies who market these destinations to the gay community. Coinciding with the increased visibility of LGBT people raising children in the 1990s, an increase in family-friendly LGBT tourism has emerged in the 2000s, for instance R Family Vacations which includes activities and entertainment geared towards couples including same-sex weddings. R Family's first cruise was held aboard Norwegian Cruise Lines's Norwegian Dawn with 1600 passengers including 600 children.|$|E
