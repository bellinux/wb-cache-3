40|$|This study {{proposes a}} rule of <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> {{adjustment}}, arguing that the optimal <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> adjustment rate should be set {{in such a way}} that the marginal excess burden associated with a <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> adjustment is kept to a minimum and that the implicit return rates for current retirees are guaranteed at certain levels. We find that the optimal <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> adjustment rate is a function of labor supply elasticity, the perceived marginal benefit-tax linkage, the pre-adjusted <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> rate, the population growth rate, the wage growth rate, and the guaranteed return rate. The sign of the optimal <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> adjustment rate is ambiguous. The optimal <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> adjustment rate falls in accordance with the population growth rate and the wage growth rate, but rises with the guaranteed return rate. The absolute value of the optimal <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> adjustment rate rises with both the pre-adjusted tax rate and the elasticity of labor supply, but falls with the perceived marginal benefit-tax linkage...|$|R

40|$|Calls {{to abolish}} or modify <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> are often heard. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry {{has called for}} the {{abolition}} of <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> as part of wider tax reform. While several reasons are cited for abolishing or modifying <b>payroll</b> <b>tax,</b> a common reason is that <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> reduces employment. It is important {{to distinguish between the}} legal incidence of a tax and its economic incidence. Legal incidence refers to the party legally responsible for paying the tax. In the case of <b>payroll</b> <b>tax,</b> legal incidence falls on the employer. The cost to the employer is, however, reduced by the fact that <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> is a deduction for company tax assessment purposes. Economic incidence refers to who finally bears the tax. As with other taxes—such as excise on alcohol—the economic incidence of <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> can shift along the production and distribution chain. Tax shifting occurs if the price of what is taxed increases when the tax is imposed. When tax shifting occurs, lower employment is only one of several possible effects of <b>payroll</b> <b>tax.</b> In general, the <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> base [...] that is, the items to which the tax applies [...] includes wages and salaries and other forms of employee benefit such as bonuses and fringe benefits. However, a feature is that the tax base differs from state to state. This increases compliance costs for businesses that operate in several jurisdictions. In March 2007, the states and territories agreed to harmonise their bases and administrative arrangements and there has been progress in this undertaking...|$|R
5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} federal income taxes, <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes,</b> estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks.

5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. <b>Payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} public {{corruption}} scandal of Daley's tenure as mayor involved {{the circumstances of}} the resignation of his City Council floor leader, Alderman Patrick Huels, in October 1997. Daley, Huels, and another close friend Michael Tadin grew up within two blocks on S. Emerald Avenue in Bridgeport. Huels attended De La Salle Institute, the same high school attended by Daley, his father, and Michael Bilandic. Huels worked for the city's Public Works Department as a laborer and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor Richard J. Daley died, 11th Ward Alderman Bilandic was named acting mayor, and Huels, then 26, replaced Bilandic as alderman. Huels chaired the Council's Transportation Committee and became Mayor Richard M. Daley's floor leader. In the summer of 2007, in reaction to ongoing indictments and convictions of aldermen, Daley and Huels shepherded a package of ethics reforms through city council. Huels owned a security firm, SDI Security, Inc. along with his wife and his brother, a Chicago police lieutenant. In the mid-1990s, the firm had about 390 full-time employees and was grossing $7 million a year. Huels was president and a director, and Council Finance Committee Chairman Alderman Edward M. Burke (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971 in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on SDI for $326,951 and in June 1996 for $997,382 for failing to pay <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes,</b> including money withheld from its employees' pay checks.|$|E

However, in Japan, firms {{do not have to}} pay for the <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> and the social security contribution for non-regular workers.

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} impact of the first <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> {{reductions}} implemented in France in the 90 s on the wage dynamics of low-income employees. Since these policies represent a net transfer from the State to the employer/employee match, they are unlikely to lead to wage reductions for employees of a given productivity level. However, the degressivity of such <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> reductions leads to a concave link between wage and productivity such that for given productivity changes, wage increases are lower once the <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> reductions are implemented. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test the validity of this low-wage trap hypothesis. Our first empirical strategy simply consists in comparing the evolution of wage increases for employees benefiting from the <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> reductions with those of the closest individuals in terms of wages, but not affected by these reductions. This difference-in-difference strategy shows that low-wage employees were more likely than medium-wage employees to get a raise in 1997 than they were in 1994, when <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> reductions were only marginal. The substantial minimum wage increase in the period makes it hard, though, to interpret these results causally. Our second empirical strategy compares the individual wage evolutions of a near-to-minimum wage employee between 1994 and 1998 with that of a similar individual but for the 1984 - 1988 period. We observe no significant differential evolutions. Overall, our results suggest that <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> reductions did not decrease the expected income of low-wage employees, at least in the short or medium run. <b>Payroll</b> <b>tax</b> reductions; Wage setting; Difference in Difference; Wage dynamic...|$|R
