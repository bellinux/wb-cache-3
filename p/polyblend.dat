The double-row repair was coupled with (3) USP No. 2 (DRAE) or (4) braided <b>polyblend</b> polyethylene suture No. 2 (DRAH). Arthroscopic Mason–Allen stitches were used (single-row) and combined with medial horizontal mattress stitches (double-row). Shoulders were cyclically loaded from 10 to 180  N. Displacement to gap formation of 5 - and 10 -mm at the repair site, cycles to failure, and the mode of failure were determined. The ultimate tensile strength was verified in specimens that resisted to 3, 000 cycles. DRAE and DRAH had a lower frequency of 5 - (P =  0. 135) and 10 -mm gap formation (P =  0. 135). All DRAE and DRAH resisted 3, 000 cycles while only three SRAE and one SRAH resisted 3, 000 cycles (P    0. 05).

Finally, attention {{is given to the}} development of compatibility criteria based upon the large deformation tensile property and density measurements. It was shown that composite equations cannot adequately describe the mechanical behavior of compatible PPO based <b>polyblends.</b> However, it is possible to generate a second order Simplex equation which will closely model the modulus-compositional empirical trends. Furthermore, there are strong indications that the interaction term in the Simplex equation can serve as a useful gauge for compatibility and level of compatibility.

For example, the high molecular weight 2 ̆ 2 antiplasticizer 2 ̆ 2, polystyrene (PS), when dissolved in PPO, decreases the glass transition temperature of the blend while raising the magnitude of the secant modulus and tensile strength above the value which would be predicted by the rule of mixtures. Packing density was found to be useful for explaining antiplasticization and compatibility. It appears to be the key to understanding the moduli of glassy alloys.

40|$|Rheological {{properties}} of blends of polyamide m x D, 6 (PA) with random copolymers of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid (P(MMA-co-MAA)) {{and the related}} ionomers (P(MMA-co-metal MA)), respectively, have been investigated at 260 °C. Addition of small amounts of suitable ionomers (up to 5 wt%) remarkably increases the melt viscosity of PA. At low shear rates and depending on the metal cation of the ionomer, the rheofluidity of PA is reduced by at least two orders of magnitude. The PA melt viscosity increases with the cation as follows: Ni 2 + < Ba 2 + < Mg 2 + < Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Cs+. The major effect is believed to occur when the polymer compatibility is improved {{to the point where}} a finely dispersed two-phase system with a low interfacial tension is reached, as a result of strong ion-dipole interactions. <b>Polyblends</b> show a rheothinning behaviour which agrees with the reversibility of H-bonding and dipolar interactions.
