40|$|Multiparameter {{radar and}} {{polarized}} microwave radiative transfer models for arbitrarily shaped particles are developed. The ice crystals modeled are horizontally oriented hexagonal plates, columns, and needles. The ice water content is fixed at 0. 1 g/cu m, and a realistic size distribution is used. The radar modeling {{is done for}} S through K-band, and the passive microwave calculations are at 37, 85, and 157 GHz. The modeling results show that particle shape is important for both multiparameter radar and passive microwave radiometry. Radar reflectivity and upwelling microwave brightness temperatures depend strongly on the individual particle volume, which in turn depends on the ice crystal shape. Radar differential reflectivity is high <b>for</b> the <b>plates</b> and lower <b>for</b> <b>needles</b> and columns. Linear depolarization calculations indicate that oblate ice crystals such as plates can be distinguished from prolate crystals such as columns. At 85 and 157 GHz, significant polarization brightness temperature differences are calculated <b>for</b> <b>plates</b> and columns. The particle bulk density strongly affects the radar and radiometer observables. Recent measurements of ice crystals are discussed {{to show that the}} model results have practical applicability...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the universal orientation-dependent interactions between non-spherical colloidal particles {{immersed in a}} critical solvent by studying the instructive paradigm of a needle embedded in bounded two-dimensional Ising models at bulk criticality. <b>For</b> a <b>needle</b> in an Ising strip the interaction on mesoscopic scales depends on {{the width of the}} strip and the length, position, and orientation of the needle. By lattice Monte Carlo simulations we evaluate the free energy difference between needle configurations being parallel and perpendicular to the strip. We concentrate on small but nonetheless mesoscopic <b>needle</b> lengths <b>for</b> which analytic predictions are available for comparison. All combinations of boundary conditions <b>for</b> the <b>needles</b> and boundaries are considered which belong to either the "normal" or the "ordinary" surface universality class, i. e., which induce local order or disorder, respectively.

40|$|Needle {{insertion}} into {{soft tissue}} {{is one of}} the common minimally invasive surgical procedures. Many diagnostic and therapeutic clinical procedures require insertion of a needle to a specific location in soft-tissue, including biopsy or radioactive seed implantation for cancer treatment (brachytherapy). In this thesis, we start with modeling the effect of skin thickness on target motion during insertion. A closed-loop control algorithm is then developed <b>for</b> flexible <b>needle</b> steering using camera and ultrasound images for feedback. An ultrasound-based 3 D needle tracking algorithm is then combined with real-time path planning <b>for</b> <b>needle</b> steering. The needle is steered during insertion in gelatin-based and biological soft-tissue phantoms. A non-imaging approach (fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors) is also used <b>for</b> real-time <b>needle</b> shape reconstruction and tip tracking. FBG sensors are used as feedback to the control algorithm to steer the needle towards a target in 3 D space. We then focus on physical target localization and 3 D shape reconstruction <b>for</b> <b>needle</b> steering in phantoms with curved surfaces. A clinical application (needle insertion in the prostate) is also investigated where the needle is steered in a multi-layer phantom with different tissue elasticities. In order to bring the proposed algorithms to clinical environments, we consider practical issues such as including the clinician in the control loop to merge robot accuracy with clinical expertise. The proposed system is adapted to enable clinicians to directly control the insertion procedure while receiving navigation cues from the control algorithm. Navigation cues are provided through a combination of haptic (vibratory) and visual feedback to the operator who controls the <b>needle</b> <b>for</b> steering. The proposed system is further adapted by using a clinically-approved Automated Breast Volume Scanner (ABVS) which is experimentally evaluated to be used <b>for</b> <b>needle</b> insertion procedures. The ultrasound-based ABVS system is used for pre-operative scanning of soft-tissue for target localization, shape reconstruction, and also intra-operatively <b>for</b> <b>needle</b> tip tracking during the steering process. The achieved targeting errors suggest that our approach is convenient for targeting lesions that can be detected using clinical ultrasound imaging systems. These promising results allow us to proceed further in bringing our system towards clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Background: Most popular {{single-use}} acupuncture needles {{consist of}} a stainless steel shaft with a handle made of copper coil or plastic stick. Objectives: To determine {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of these two handle types <b>for</b> <b>needle</b> buckling. Methods: The buckling load <b>for</b> acupuncture <b>needles</b> with these two different handle types was determined using a digital scale, and the stiffness of stainless steel wires used in different types of acupuncture needles was measured using a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis machine. Results: This study showed that an acupuncture needle with a copper coil handle was far more susceptible to buckling than a needle with a plastic stick handle. The average buckling force of acupuncture needles with plastic stick handles was 46. 7 % higher than that with copper coil handles <b>for</b> <b>needles</b> of 0. 25 mmx 30 mm, and 30. 8 % higher <b>for</b> <b>needles</b> of 0. 25 mmx 60 mm. Replacing a copper coil handle with a plastic stick handle could save about 100 tonnes of copper wires and 20 million metres of medical grade stainless steel wire a year worldwide. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that the common practice of using coiled copper for handles on acupuncture needles should be re-evaluated. Replacing a copper coil handle with a plastic stick handle would significantly reduce needle buckling and improve patient comfort and safety. This would also reduce the consumption of copper and medical grade stainless steel wire considerably...|$|R
