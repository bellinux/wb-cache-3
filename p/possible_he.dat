Whenever <b>possible,</b> <b>he</b> attended annual reunions with former Oflag 64 POWs {{and the annual}} national conventions of the American ex-POW organization. He {{was appointed}} to the Editorial Advisory Board of the newly established Washington Times daily newspaper in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Wright rarely played {{live outside}} of Pink Floyd {{compared}} to the other members. Along with Gilmour, he played in 1970 on Barrett's second solo album, Barrett, and helped with its production. He later recalled working on the album as a way of helping Barrett in any way <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> guested at a concert by Sutherland Brothers & Quiver in 1974 at Newcastle Polytechnic.|$|E
5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as <b>possible,</b> <b>he</b> continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E

5|$|American actor Stuart Milligan {{was cast}} as President Nixon, {{which he said}} he found exciting, having played other presidents in the past, {{including}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prosthetic pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and ears to make him resemble Nixon as much as <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he had to wear fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland {{as the voice of}} Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939–40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and {{had to settle for}} making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot ferrying engineers and ground crew from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills were far from being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until he was assigned to flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid {{it as much as}} <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E

5|$|However, in the mid-11th {{century the}} Uí Ímair dynast Echmarcach mac Ragnaill {{is said to}} be the ruler of Mann. He was also King of Dublin from 1036–38 and 1046–52 as well as {{possibly}} being the King of the Rhinns in Galloway, suggesting that the overlordship of the Isle of Man and the Hebrides were once again sundered, (although it is <b>possible</b> <b>he</b> ruled over part or all of the Hebrides as well).|$|E
5|$|In 1111, Domnall evidently {{seized the}} kingship of the Isles by force. It is {{uncertain}} whether he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture. Several years later, {{at a time}} when his aforesaid uncle was gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also <b>possible</b> <b>he</b> was forced out by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. It is possible that he was survived by two sons.|$|E
5|$|In {{domestic}} matters, Scott advocated increased {{salaries for}} public officials, economic development measures, and heavy punishments for persistent criminals. While he desired a tax code that would preclude {{the need for}} the state to borrow money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes as low as <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> also urged them to convert the militia into a youth army. The General Assembly routinely ignored his calls for reform but did pass a measure he advocated that allowed debtors a one-year stay on collection of their debts if they provided both bond and security.|$|E

5000|$|Also, Legionary Baldricus is {{a soldier}} under Centurion Blaccadicus in the Roman Britain section of Blackadder: Back & Forth {{as part of}} the forces {{defending}} Hadrian's Wall. He is apparently bilingual (although it's <b>possible</b> <b>he's</b> a local conscript and doesn't really understand Latin). He wears his helmet back to front, and was presumably killed by the attacking [...] "Scots".|$|R

5|$|Jovanović {{strove to}} make The Takovo Uprising as {{historically}} accurate as <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time}} of the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović led the people to revolt. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris over the course of several months in 1894. It was first exhibited the following year at his brother Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace. The exhibition coincided with the uprising's 80th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from the guards as <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of Eardwulf's family, though his father, also named Eardwulf, {{is known to}} have been a nobleman. Eardwulf was married by the time he became king, though his wife's name is not recorded. It is <b>possible</b> <b>he</b> later wed an illegitimate daughter of Charlemagne. In 798, early in his reign, Eardwulf fought a battle at Billington Moor against a nobleman named Wada, who had been one of those who killed King Æthelred. Wada was defeated and driven into exile. In 801, Eardwulf led an army against Coenwulf of Mercia, perhaps because of Coenwulf's support for other claimants to the Northumbrian throne.|$|E
5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for its {{attention}} to detail and realism {{in the area of}} military tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military experience (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is <b>possible.</b> <b>He</b> also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E

5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically <b>possible,</b> <b>he</b> did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{held the}} office of Dean of York from at least 1147, but may have {{occupied}} the office as early as 1142. He may have been still alive as late as 1157, as it is <b>possible</b> <b>he</b> was the addressee of {{a letter from the}} papacy in January 1157. His last secure attestation as dean is in October 1154. Although Keats-Rohan states in Domesday Descendants that Robert was also Archdeacon of York, he is not so listed in the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae under any of the archdeaconries.|$|E
5|$|The executioner was masked and disguised, {{and there}} is debate over his identity. The commissioners {{approached}} Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is <b>possible</b> <b>he</b> relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, {{but there are others}} who have been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by an examination of the king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.|$|E
