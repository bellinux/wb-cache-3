40|$|Over {{the past}} 25 years <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> has transitioned from a {{technically}} challenging and time consuming research technique to a valuable and practical method of chemical analysis. During this time span, coined the `Raman renaissance 2 ̆ 7 by Dr. Richard McCreery, enhancement techniques and improvements to near-infrared detectors {{have played a}} significant role in extending the utility of this analytical technique. This thesis outlines advancements in Raman scatter enhancement techniques by applying evanescent fields, standing-waves (waveguides) and surface enhancements to increase the generated mean square electric field, which is directly related to the intensity of Raman scattering. These techniques are accomplished by employing scanning angle <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (Chapter 2 - 4) and surface enhanced <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (Chapter 5). In Chapter 6, a 1064 nm multichannel Raman spectrometer is discussed for chemical analysis of lignin. Extending dispersive multichannel <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> to 1064 nm reduces the fluorescence interference that can mask the weaker Raman scattering. Overall, these techniques help address the major obstacles in <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> for chemical analysis, which include the inherently weak Raman cross section and susceptibility to fluorescence interference. Chapter 1 is a general introduction to total internal reflection (TIR) <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and scanning angle (SA) <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Brief introductions to surface enhanced <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and 1064 nm multichannel <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> are provided in their respective Chapters, 5 and 6. In Chapters 2 - 4, the utility of scanning angle <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is put into practice for compositional and thickness measurements of thin polymer films. SA-Raman spectroscopy can be classified as an enhancement technique that can be used for measuring interfacial phenomena with chemical specificity. With improvements to modern technology, scanning angle <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> can provide a practical and adaptable technique for applications where surface enhanced <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (SERS) is impractical. In Chapters 3 - 4, the total internal reflection <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> configuration is expanded to include surface plasmon resonance and plasmon waveguide resonance <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Chapters 2 - 6 contain published manuscripts.
