5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> {{covering}} Knife Edge Two Piece degraded {{and exposed}} the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|R

5000|$|After being {{stored for}} many years by the Peabody Foundation, by the 1940s the plates began to develop a {{malignant}} patina or [...] "bronze disease". This was caused by their exposure to certain compounds while buried, followed by early attempts to clean them of [...] "limey incrustions" [...] by using even more harmful compounds (hydrochloric acid, the oxychlorides associated with this caused the malignant patina to dramatically worsen). The plates were cleaned in an electrolytic bath and then given coats of <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer.</b> Afterward they were carefully mounted in glass and plexiglass vertical display cases.|$|R

50|$|In CDs, the {{reflective}} layer is immediately beneath a thin <b>protective</b> layer of <b>lacquer,</b> {{and is also}} exposed {{at the edge of}} the disc. The lacquer protecting the edge of an optical disc can usually be seen without magnification. It is rarely uniformly thick; thickness variations are usually visible. The reflective layer is typically aluminium, which reacts easily with several commonly encountered chemicals such as oxygen, sulphur, and certain ions carried by condensed water. In ordinary use, a surface layer of aluminium oxide is formed very quickly when an aluminium surface is exposed to the atmosphere; it serves as passivation for the bulk aluminium with regard to many, but not all, contaminants. CD reflective layers are so thin that this passivation is less effective. In the case of CD-R and CD-RW media, the materials used in the reflecting layer are more complex than a simple aluminium layer, but also can present problems if contaminated. The thin 0.25-0.5mm layer of <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> is equivalent.|$|R
50|$|After metalisation, the discs {{pass on to}} a spin-coater, where UV curable lacquer is {{dispensed}} {{onto the}} newly metallized layer. By rapid spinning, the lacquer coats the entire disc with a very thin layer (approx. 70 nm). After the lacquer is applied, the disks pass under a high intensity UV lamp which cures the lacquer rapidly. The lacquer also provides a surface for a label, generally screen printed or offset printed. The printing ink(s) must be chemically compatible with the lacquer used. Markers used by consumers to write on blank surfaces can lead to breaks in the <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> layer, which may lead to corrosion of the reflective layer, and failure of the CD.|$|R

5000|$|PDO {{acknowledged}} that the problem was due to a manufacturing error on its part, but it gave different explanations for the problem. The most widely acknowledged {{explanation is that the}} lacquer used to coat the discs was not resistant to the sulfur content of the paper in the booklets, which led to the corrosion of the aluminium layer of the disc, even though PDO later said it was because [...] "a silver coating had been used on its discs instead of the standard gold." [...] Peter Copeland of the British Library Sound Archive confirmed that silver instead of aluminium in the reflective layer of the CD would react with sulfur compounds in the sleeves, forming silver sulfate, which has a bronze colour. A combination of the two factors seems likely because, as Barbara Hirsch of the University of California points out, the oxidation could only have occurred if the <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> did not seal the metal film and substrate well enough.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{presents}} results of corrosion wear of bonded and sintered hard magneticmaterials Nd-Fe-B and magnets covered by <b>protective</b> polymer, <b>lacquer</b> and metal coatings. Design/methodology/approach: Corrosion tests were made in two corrosive environments in water and in 5 %NaCl solution. Findings: It {{was found that the}} bonded magnets with the polymer matrix demonstrate better corrosion resistancethan the sintered magnets. Employment of the protective coatings on the Nd-Fe-B bonded magnets surfaces mayfeature the effective protection of the substrate material from the corrosive action of the aggressive agent. Practical implications: Magnets covered by <b>protective</b> polymer, <b>lacquer</b> or metal coating are less susceptible tocorrosion so employment of these coatings can lower the losses caused by the corrosion of magnets. Corrosionprotection of Nd-Fe-B magnets needs further investigations. Originality/value: Analysis of the surface topography of the deposited protective coatings makes it possible todetermine coating defects resulting from the action of the aggressive agent. The obtained results can be use inpractice to decrease the corrosion wear of these materials...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{aluminium}} containers, the use of <b>protective</b> polymer <b>lacquers</b> inside cans, and increased recycling by industry, the demand for tin decreased considerably by the early 1980s, and in October 1985 the ITC could no longer maintain the price.

40|$|Recent reports associating {{aluminium}} {{with several}} skeletal (osteomalacia) and neurological disorders (encephalopathy and Alzheimer’s disease) in humans suggest {{that exposure to}} aluminium may pose a hazard to health. This requires the examination of aluminiumcontent in different foodstuffs. Therefore, an analytical method for the determination of aluminium in fish and fishery products, especially in fishery products packaged in aluminium cans, was developed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Fillets of lean and fatty fish showed aluminium levels lower than 1 mg/kg wet weight, muscle of crustacean, molluscan and shellfish had apparently higher aluminium levels (up to 20 mg/kg wet weight). The aluminium content in some aluminum-canned herring was {{much higher than the}} content found in herring caught in the North Sea. These results indicate that aluminium is taken up by the herring fillets in aluminium cans, presumably through the slight and slow dissolution of aluminium from the can wall, due to some defects in the <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> layer. A comparison of the aluminium levels measured in canned herring with the average aluminium-intake (normally between 3 and 5 mg/day) or with the provisional tolerable daily intake of 1 mg/kg body weight per day (WHO 1989) indicated, that the aluminium content of the edible part of aquatic food does not play a significant role.

40|$|Na početku, zbijen u komadu zemljane grude, oblik predmeta se nije razaznavao, međutim, tijekom konzervacijsko-restauracijsko zahvata na brončanom limu postigao sam dva usko vezana efekta: iznova sam osnažio te učvrstio originalne dijelove tankog brončanog lima te vizualno i taktilno ispunio prazan prostor plitke brončane posude. Due to the {{conditions}} {{at the place where}} the finds had been excavated, in the ditch between two walls of the temple where water found its own way to flow along even though filled with layers of soil and rubble (containing archaeological remains), few fragments of metal finds stuck in the vacuum of clay in a layer of soil where they had minimum contact with air and therefore oxidized more slowly. I received bronze material which was compressed within a clod of hardened soil, like a kind of “sandwich”. Only a few-millimetre wide rim of the vessel (Fig. 1) is completely preserved reaching the side that continues into the shallow bottom; together they form round 60 % of the preserved part of the bronze vessel. A precondition for easier conservation of the vessel remains would be separation of bronze sheet from the soil clod. In this respect I determined conservation and restoration phases: - Removal of earth layers - I immerged soil clod with the parts of vessel into a small ultrasound tub filled with distilled water. A part of soil turned into mud and fell off, and the thin bronze sheet was now clean; - Stabilisation of metal surface - I immerged separated parts of the sheet vessel into a wide fire-proof measure filled with distilled water saturated with sodium carbonate NaHCO 3, and put them to simmer on a moderately warm ring. Afterwards, I boiled the complete material one more time in the distilled water, so that the remains of sodium carbonate were neutralised after the previous cooking; - Flattening the dish rim- I warmed the bent edge of rim (softened the structure of the alloy at its critical point at high temperature) and folded it back to the bow direction of the rim line; - Gluing dish fragments - having found the connecting surfaces of sheet parts, I glued them with both quick-drying adhesive and two-component epoxy resin; - Reconstruction and removal of calcite layers - in accordance with the material of the object to be reconstructed (thin bronze sheet) I decided to use thin sheet of brass alloy (Fig. 3), which could easily be folded into a wished shape, and was thinner than the original so that when the whole vessel was reinforced, a few layers of artificial patina/verdigris (Verdigris: a greenish blue substance that forms on the surface of some metals in wet conditions) could be applied. Having additionally reinforced the object, I could more safely remove the remains of calcite film o? the bottom of the shallow vessel; - Fixing artificial verdigris and polishing - I used fine machine brushes to polish the original surface of the vessel in order to make green verdigris lustreless (Fig. 4); - Application of <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> - {{the next step was to}} protect the whole surface of bronze vessel with Paraloid B 72 <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> in Ksilen C 8 H 10 solvent; - Conclusion - all the above mentioned phases of conservation work on the bronze vessel aimed at the reconstruction of the vessel; they should be stressed because these vessel parts were in a very poor condition that they crumbled at a touch.

30|$|CoCrMo alloys are {{contraindicated}} for allergy sufferers. For these patients, uncemented and cemented prostheses made of {{titanium alloy}} are indicated. Knee prostheses machined from that alloy, however, may have poor tribological behavior. Therefore, for allergy sufferers, knee replacements {{in form of}} cemented high-strength oxide ceramic prostheses which reveal excellent tribological behavior are suitable. In addition, the rate of particle induced aseptic loosening may be reduced. For adhesion of bone cement, the smooth ceramic surface, however, exposes inefficient mechanical retention spots as compared with a textured metal surface. Undercuts generated by corundum blasting, which in the short and intermediate term are highly efficient on a CoCrMo surface, are not appropriate on a ceramic surface due to the brittleness of ceramics. The corresponding textures may initiate cracks which will weaken {{the strength of a}} ceramic prosthesis. Due to the lack of textures, mechanical retention is poor or even not existent. Micromotions are facilitated and early aseptic loosening is predictable. Instead silicoating of the ceramic surface will allow specific adhesion and result in better hydrolytic stability of bonding, thereby preventing early aseptic loosening. Silicoating, however, presupposes a clean and chemically active surface which may be achieved by atmospheric plasma or thermal surface treatment. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} silicoating, the bond strengths of atmospheric plasma versus thermal surface treated and silicoated ZPTA (zirconia platelets toughened alumina) surfaces were compared with “as-fired” surfaces by utilizing TiAlV probes (diameter: 6 mm) for traction–adhesive strength test. After preparing samples for traction–adhesive strength test (sequence: ceramic substrate, silicate layer and penetrated silane, <b>protective</b> <b>lacquer</b> (PolyMA), bone cement, TiAlV probe), they were aged up to 150 days at 37 °C in Ringer’s solution. The bond strengths observed for all aging intervals were well above 20 MPa and much higher and more hydrolytic stable for silicoated compared with with “as-fired” ZPTA samples. Silicoating may be effective for achieving high initial bond strength of bone cement on surfaces of oxide ceramics and is also suitable to stabilize bond strengths in the long term under hydrolytic conditions as present in the human body. Activation by atmospheric plasma or thermal surface treatment seems to be effective prior to silicoating. Due to the proposed silicate layer migration, micromotions and debonding should be widely reduced or even eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using novel electromagnetic wave sensors for real-time monitoring of metal pollution in water was assessed. Five solutions with different concentrations of lead (0, 1, 10, 50, 100 mg/L) were measured using several sensing methods: UV-Vis spectroscopy, low frequency capacitance and resistance measurements, and two sensing systems based on microwave technology. With this last approach, two sensing devices were used: a resonant cavity and a planar sensor with gold interdigitated electrode design printed on a PTFE substrate with a <b>protective</b> PCB <b>lacquer</b> coating. Results confirmed {{the ability of}} these systems to quantify the lead concentration as changes in spectrum signal at specific frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spectra were unique, with clearly observed shifts in the resonant frequencies of the sensors when placed {{in direct contact with}} different lead solutions, demonstrating the possibility of continuous monitoring with great sensitivity, selectivity, and high spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, determination of trace and toxic metals using microwave spectroscopy is a promising alternative to traditional grab-sampling and laboratory based analyses. On-line and continuous monitoring of real-time metal concentrations offers the potential for a more effective emergency response and the platform for better scientific understanding and remediation of contaminated mine drainage...|$|R
