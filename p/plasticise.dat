40|$|The present work {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the level of prepreg moisture content on the mixed-mode fracture toughness of a co-cured composite joint. It was found that moisture was stored in the prepreg as either free or bound water. It was also shown that the prepreg stores moisture from high humidity environments as free water, while the level of bound water remains unaffected. The excessive moisture was shown to <b>plasticise</b> the adhesive, lowering the glass transition temperature. The fracture toughness decreased under mode I and mode II loading as the humidity level was increased. The mixed-mode toughness also reduced with increasing storage humidity. However, the measured mixed-mode fracture toughness never reduced below that of the joints fabricated using the as-received material. This indicates that the moisture has a more pronounced effect on the bulk properties of the adhesive rather than on the interfacial adhesion between the composite and adhesive...|$|E

Of these, the first two have disadvantages such as plasticiser leaching and impairment of platelet function. Polyolefin bags cannot be HF welded or steam sterilized.

The intention {{of this study was}} to evaluate to the equibiaxial stress relaxation of 400 g kg(- 1) glycerol <b>plasticised</b> gluten at different biaxial strains at room temperature for a better understanding of the processibility. RESULTS: The <b>plasticised</b> gluten shows significant stress relaxation and the spectra span over six decades of time at biaxial strains from 0. 03 to 1. 51. Plotting the instantaneous modulus against strain reveals strain softening and strain hardening at strains below and above 0. 25, respectively. The relaxation modulus as a function of time can be fitted to the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts equation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that stress relaxation of <b>plasticised</b> gluten is highly dependent on strain level and biaxial deformation accelerates the network relaxation by widening the distribution of relaxation times.

40|$|Most welding {{processes}} for plastics {{do not meet}} the special demands of micro technology. Laser transmission welding, however, features distinctive advantages like low mechanical and thermal load of the joining parts. Hence it is particularly suitable for the welding of micro plastics parts. Certain optical properties of the components to be welded are needed though. While one of the welding parts has to exhibit a high transmittance in the range of the laser wavelength the absorptance of the other one has to be high enough to ensure a sufficient absorption of the laser radiation to <b>plasticise</b> the material. Here, carbon black has almost exclusively gained industrial importance, since it is an inexpensive material with good absorbing properties. However, it leads to a black coloration which is not always acceptable. Recently, there are special pigmentations which allow for a non black colour in the visible range of light, but nevertheless absorb laser radiation.

40|$|Propellants {{can burn}} {{so rapidly that}} the initial rise of {{pressure}} in weapons may be faster than desired. To avoid this unwanted effect, burning rate of the propellants is moderated by applying a surface coating. Coating agents are usually deterrents (moderants), substances that gelatinize or <b>plasticise</b> the nitrocellulose matrix of the propellants decreasing its initial burning rate, therefore, in turn, the rate of gaseous phase formation. The knowledge of the diffusion rate of deterrents helps therefore in developing propellants with superior ballistic performance. Another parameter, namely {{the rate of the}} migration of deterrent into the propellant matrix during ageing / storing is also important as it influences the ballistic shelf-life i. e. the period of time during which the ballistic requirements are fulfilled. As migration measurements are often difficult, expensive and time-consuming the development of the simulation tools of above processes seems to be of a great importance. The present paper describes the simulation method for deterrent and blasting oil diffusion in double base propellant applying the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients D determined in isothermal experiments and taking into account the influence of the swelling effect of the propellant matrix.

40|$|Despite much research, {{bread crumb}} firming during storage and amylase anti-staling {{properties}} are still ill understood. We present a coherent {{view on the}} topic based on literature, experimental data, and food polymer science-related concepts. During bread storage, the gelatinised starch (amylopectin) network, present in soft, fresh bread, is gradually transformed into an extensive, partially crystalline, permanent amylopectin network, with amylopectin crystallites acting as junction zones. This network increasingly accounts for the bulk theological behaviour of aging bread crumb. Furthermore, as amylopectin retrogradation proceeds, moisture migration within the crumb structure occurs, {{and more and more}} water is immobilised within amylopectin crystallites. The crystalline hydrate water can no longer <b>plasticise</b> the different networks, which {{goes hand in hand with}} increased crumb firmness and decreased crumb resilience, due to a less flexible gluten network. The efficiency of anti-staling amylases can be related to the extent they limit the formation and the strength of the permanent amylopectin network, and the water immobilisation. Conventional alpha-amylases weaken the amylopectin network by cutting the long polymer chains connecting the crystalline regions, but have little effect on amylopectin recrystallisation. In contrast, maltogenic alpha-amylase primarily shortens the amylopectin side chains, thus hindering amylopectin recrystallisation, and the concomitant network formation and water immobilisation.

40|$|Natural fibers are {{considered}} to have potential use as reinforcing agents in polymer composite materials because of their principle benefits: moderate strength and stiffness, low cost, and be an environmental friendly, degradable, and renewablematerial. Due to their inherently hydrophilic nature, they are prone to absorb moisture, which can <b>plasticise</b> or weaken theadhesion of fibers to the surrounding matrix and by this affect the performance of composites used in atmospheric humidity,particularly at elevated temperatures. The surface treatments are often applied to the fiber to improve the bond strengthbetween the fibers and matrix. This work discussed the effect of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment and epoxy resin as acompatibilizing agent on interface properties of pineapple leaf fiber (PALF) -epoxy composites. A single-fiber fragmentationtest coupled with data reduction technique was employed to assess interface quality in terms of apparent interfacial shearstrength (IFSS or a) of untreated, NaOH, and epoxy resin treated PALFs-epoxy composites. Tensile properties of untreatedand treated PALFs were also examined. It was found that both treatments substantially increase a, corresponding to animproved level of adhesion.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{the way in which the}} {{chemical}} structure of an epoxy resin influences its ability to absorb and desorb moisture. This issue is addressed in a study of dicyandiamide- and amine-cured epoxy resins. The dicyandiamide-cured material will have a significantly lower preponderance of pendant hydroxyl groups than the amine-cured material and may exhibit different behaviour when exposed to moisture. The uptake and loss of moisture was monitored gravimetrically, using broad band dielectric, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and thickness measurements performed as a function of time at various temperatures. A comparison of the uptake and loss profiles for the first and subsequent cycles indicated significant differences in behaviour attributed to the way in which water can <b>plasticise</b> the matrix. Stresses frozen into the matrix during the cure process are allowed to relax as a consequence of the water hydrating the matrix and create voids and also allow matrix densification. These processes occur during the first hydration cycle and are not reversible. Subsequent hydration and dehydration appear to be reversible after the first hydration cycle. Water in the polymer is distributed between free water which is to be found in microvoids and bound water which is attached to the polymer chain. The amine-cured epoxy resin which contains pendant hydroxyl groups has a greater capacity for water absorption than the ether-containing backbone of the dicyandiamide-cured material...|$|E

Initially the project has investigated the relationship between the shape of the active site of the receptor and its sensitivity and selectivity for analytes in solution. The techniques of electrochemistry, NMR and molecular modelling have been used to study materials interactions. An optimum receptor design was established for a range of analytes so that the surface of an electrode could be modified to create an analytical sensor. The specific adsorption of both the receptor and the analyte on the electrode surface were probed to produce an amperometric sensor for mandelic and lactic acids.;Subsequently, the project has involved the investigation of small molecule adsorption, recognition and permeation at polymer plant wax constituent layers that model leaf cuticles. Correlations have been sought between the responses to these surfactants/adjuvants and the wax compositions. At low levels of interaction, the quartz crystal microbalance was used as a gravimetric sensor of these processes. At higher levels of interaction, when permeation of the film is sufficient to <b>plasticise</b> it, the rheological effects were used to explore solvent/small molecule permeation. In each case, qualitative data was used to diagnose film rigidity vs. viscoelasticity and quantitative data to determine film mass (thickness) or shear moduli, as appropriate.

40|$|The ingress of {{moisture}} into an adhesive bonded structure {{can lead to}} a variety of effects. Moisture has the ability to plasticize the adhesive but may also segregate into microvoids. The water in the voids will have less of an effect as it does not <b>plasticise</b> the matrix and is unable to influence the interface between the resin and the substrate. Only if the Tg of the matrix drops below ambient will it allow expansion of the voids and then there will be consequential lowering of the fatigue characteristics of the resin. Water also has the ability to interact with metallic surfaces leading to changes {{in the nature of the}} interaction between adhesive and adherend. Water has a large dipole signature and is easily studied in terms of its effect on the electrical properties of bonded joint structures. In this paper, applications of electrochemical impedance and dielectric spectroscopies are described.

Application of the techniques to similar joint structures illustrates the similarities and differences of the two approaches.

The regenerative ability of CNS axons decreases with age however this ability remains largely intact in PNS axons throughout adulthood. These differences are likely to correspond with age-related silencing of proteins necessary for axon growth and elongation. In previous studies, {{it has been shown that}} reintroduction of the alpha 9 integrin subunit (tenascin-C receptor, α 9) that is downregulated in adult CNS can improve neurite outgrowth and sensory axon regeneration after a dorsal rhizotomy or a dorsal column crush spinal cord lesion. In the current study, we demonstrate that virally-expressed integrins (α 9, α 6, or β 1 integrin) in the adult rat sensorimotor cortex and adult red nucleus are excluded from axons following neuronal transduction. Attempts to stimulate transport by inclusion of a cervical spinal injury and thus an upregulation of extracellular matrix molecules at the lesion site, or co-transduction with its binding partner, β 1 integrin, did not induce integrin localization within axons. In contrast, virally-expressed α 9 integrin in developing rat cortex (postnatal day 5 or 10) demonstrated clear localization of integrins in cortical axons revealed by the presence of integrin in the axons of the corpus callosum and internal capsule as well as in the neuronal cell body. Furthermore, examination of dorsal root ganglia neurons and retinal ganglion cells demonstrated integrin localization both within peripheral nerve as well as dorsal root axons and within optic nerve axons, respectively.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this report is a contribution to ongoing research to develop more effective orthopaedic joint systems though fundamental studies of the behaviour of various novel material combinations and component configurations. Compliant layer technology, incorporating a low elastic modulus polyurethane layer for the bearing surface, has been proposed to offer prolonged longevity of artificial joints by maintaining a fluid film between the articulating surfaces thus reducing friction and wear. To ensure a complaint layer joint retains fit, form and function over its lifetime, material characterisation techniques were employed. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) highlighted {{the sensitivity of the}} modulus of Bionate® polyurethanes 80 A and 75 D to temperature; in particular for 75 D it revealed the close proximity of its glass transition temperature to in vivo operating temperatures and this shows a strong need for accurate temperature control during in vitro testing. The ability of aqueous lubricants to <b>plasticise</b> Bionate® materials was also demonstrated through DMTA, with reductions in the moduli and damping behaviour for hydrated samples being seen. Through a series of creep experiments, the non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of Bionate® polyurethane materials was demonstrated. Creep rupture was not observed over the test periods, and sample deformation increased considerably with increasing stress as well as temperature and lubrication. Bionate® 75 D displayed significantly lower creep strain and greater permanent deformation that 80 A. The creep data set should essentially allow development of improved designs in compliant layer technology. The tribological performance of the compliant layer articulation as a function of material combinations, implant conformity and implant size was assessed. In order to do this it was necessary to measure the frictional torque and develop tribological functional plots to determine the mode of lubrication. In this study a variety of material combinations for both hip and knee prostheses were investigated using a friction simulator. Firstly, through correlation with other published studies a friction simulator was validated using conventional ultra- high molecular weight polyethylene. Subsequently, metal-on-compliant layer hip and knee prostheses were assessed both experimentally using Stribeck analysis and theoretically using the theory of Hamrock and Dowson. Overall, the performance of compliant layer bearings was promising of improved in vivo behaviour in that fluid film lubrication and relatively low friction factors were achieved with synthetic lubricants. A strong correlation between experimental results and theoretical predictions were observed. The wear performance of a newly developed compliant layer glenoid, designed specifically to utilise compliant layer technology, in total shoulder arthroplasty was investigated. Results suggest that this type of glenoid may be more robust compared to the conventional UHMWPE glenoid. Impingement wear on the compliant layer surface was a frequent finding and was caused from repeated contact between the rim of the hemispherical humeral component and the articular surface of the glenoid, under a constant load. The addition of Vitamin E to compliant layer acetabular components was shown experimentally to have no effect on the friction characteristics of the material. MPC (2 -methacryloyloxethyl phosphorylcholine) grafting on the surface of highly crosslinked polyethylene acetabular components increased the friction and it was postulated that the phospholipids acted as boundary lubricants within a mixed lubrication regime. Larger joints are being developed to improve joint stability, propioception and functional longevity. The friction and lubrication properties of large diameter hip bearings of metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-reinforced polymer couplings were assessed. The frictional studies showed that the metal-on-metal joints worked under the mixed lubrication regime, producing similar friction factor values to each other. The ceramic-on-reinforced polymer samples were shown to operate with high friction factors and mixed lubrication. The study demonstrated that the component’s diameter had little or no influence on the lubrication and friction of the large bearing combinations tested...|$|E

40|$|Bloodmeal is an {{ancillary}} {{product of}} the agricultural industry, containing 80 – 100 % protein, and {{has been used to}} create a bio-based plastic called Novatein Thermoplastic Protein®, with a proprietary blend of sodium sulfite, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), water and triethylene glycol (TEG). Recent investigation has shown that the colour and odour of bloodmeal based thermoplastic can be significantly improved through the pre-treatment of bloodmeal with equilibrium peracetic acid. The resulting decoloured bloodmeal (DBM) no longer relies on the addition of sodium sulfite to be processed in conventional thermoplastic equipment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role by which peracetic acid decolours bloodmeal and the consequences of oxidation on composition, physico-chemical properties, protein structure and interactions and final polymer mobility. Oxidative decolouring of haem is straightforward when the haem is freely accessible or in the form of oxyhaemoglobin and most common oxidants lead to cleavage of the porphyrin ring, resulting in a loss of colour saturation. However, after extensive thermal treatment during manufacture, the haem present in bloodmeal has migrated to inaccessible hydrophobic regions of the protein aggregates or has been oxidised to the form of methaemoglobin. Literature revealed that methaemoglobin catalytically removes hydrogen peroxide, lowering decolouring efficacy. Thus, peracetic acid is required when haem is present in the form of methaemoglobin, as is found in bloodmeal. Further, it was confirmed that a minimum of 3 % w/w peracetic acid, in a 3 : 1 ratio to bloodmeal is required to obtain adequate decolouring (> 70 % whiteness based on the RGB colour space). The role of each component in equilibrium peracetic acid was established; water and acetic acid resulted in protein swelling but were found unlikely to influence accessibility of the oxidants to the haem sites and both hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid were consumed in oxidising reactions. Acidic conditions were found to reduce the consumption of hydrogen peroxide, possibly through the inhibition of hydroxyl radical formation, resulting in less effective decolouring. Acetic acid was observed to have a protective effect on protein recovery as well as the resulting iron content, molecular mass distribution and secondary structure of protein. Due to the large excess of peracetic acid solution required to facilitate diffusion and subsequent decolouring, a significant quantity remains unreacted in the recovered wastewater. Unreacted peracetic acid was shown to have potential for recycling, although in its immediate state it was insufficient to decolour fresh bloodmeal. The protein-rich decoloured bloodmeal recovered had undergone a change in secondary structure composition and was found to contain evidence of a diffusion front, consistent with the heterogeneous phase decolouring mechanism. Oxidation with peracetic acid was found to result in less β-sheet aggregation compared to hydrogen peroxide treatment, although all treatments resulted in an increase in the quantity of disordered structures. Oxidation was also found to result in a significantly lowered glass transition temperature and along with an increased enthalpy of relaxation, evidenced a large improvement in polymer chain mobility compared with untreated bloodmeal. DBM was found to be comprised of 90 – 99 % w/w protein (1 – 10 % w/w salt), with a significantly higher protein solubility and a similar volume weighted molecular mass compared with untreated bloodmeal. Further, DBM was found to have a greater composition of charged and polar amino acids, along with a large reduction in lysine and small reduction in aromatic and heterocyclic amino acids. Additionally, cystine crosslinks which stabilise bloodmeal were found to be partially oxidised to cysteine sulfonate compounds and cysteic acid (cleavage of the disulfide bond). Such a reduction in the quantity of amino acids which are capable of forming covalent networks (lysine, tyrosine and cysteine) support prior evidence that DBM no longer requires sodium sulfite to produce a thermoplastic. The influence of SDS and TEG on secondary structure and chain mobility at ambient and elevated temperatures were explored. It was found that heating DBM and DBM with SDS alone is incapable of providing sufficient energy to induce mobility and chain rearrangement. However, the addition of TEG was found to facilitate chain mobility, and beyond 55 oC significant changes to the secondary structure composition was observed, first through the formation of α-helices and finally through the aggregation of chains into β-sheets. Wide angle X-ray scattering confirmed that the changes in ordered structures composition were reversible in DBM which contained both SDS and TEG. The ability of TEG to <b>plasticise</b> DBM was more thoroughly explored, and it was found that prior to heating TEG was localised into regions either plasticiser-rich or -poor, and this resulted in the presence of two glass transition temperatures. After heating, the TEG was more homogeneously distributed, which resulted in the presence of one broad glass transition region...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} {{combining}} mammalian cells and synthetic polymers for tissue engineering applications are frequently problematic. This {{is due to}} the incompatibility between the sensitive cell component and the harsh polymer processing environments required to form the desired porous scaffold e. g. high temperatures and organic solvents. This results in the necessity for an often inefficient and time consuming two step scaffold seeding process, whereby mammalian cells are added to a pre-fabricated polymer scaffold. High pressure or supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) processing is a method of fabricating porous polymer scaffolds at ambient temperatures and without using organic solvents. When pressurised, CO 2 becomes highly soluble in a variety of amorphous polymers such as poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) to produce a high viscosity liquid. Subsequent decompression causes the formation of gas bubbles that become permanent as the polymer vitrifies. Based upon technology at the University of Nottingham, we hypothesised that mammalian cells could be incorporated into poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) scaffolds using a single step scCO 2 process. This would not only make the process more rapid, but it would remove the inefficient scaffold seeding step required in most cell based tissue engineering strategies. Mammalian cells were subject to a range of high pressure CO 2 and N 2 processing conditions and assessed for cell survival. It was discovered that primary hepatocytes, meniscal fibrochondrocytes, myoblastic C 2 C 12 s and 3 T 3 fibroblasts could survive after exposure to both high pressure gases on a time and pressure dependent basis. Cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute were then assessed for both gene and enzyme function. Using a microarray, it was found that only eight genes (out of 9000) in murine C 2 C 12 cells were significantly down-regulated when compared to untreated cells. Continued cell function was confirmed by measuring BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity as a measure of osteogenic differentiation in myoblastic C 2 C 12 cells. Alkaline phosphatise activity was indistinguishable between untreated cells and cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute. Additional enzyme and receptor function was confirmed by measuring cytochrome P 450 activity in primary hepatocytes after one minute of scCO 2 processing. In {{the second half of the}} study, these short processing times were found to be sufficient to <b>plasticise</b> and foam porous PDLLA scaffolds. Therefore, cells were incorporated into the biodegradable PDLLA foams by pre-mixing the cell suspension with the polymer powder and exposing to scCO 2. Subsequent decompression caused the polymer to foam with the cells trapped within the porous structure. Despite the presence of the plasticised PDLLA, cell survival was confirmed by both an Alamar B 1 ueTM assay and LIVE/DEADTM staining. Osteogenic differentiation on the scaffolds was confirmed by a stain and assay for BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity. Finally, a second generation processing piece of processing apparatus was designed that permitted mammalian cells to be passed into a pressurised vessel containing preplasticised PDLLA using a novel high-pressure CO 2 injection system. This was made possible by constant optimisation of the high pressure apparatus and the introduction of a cell delivery valve. When injected at high pressures cell survival was found to be reduced when compared with previous experiments although this was likely to be due to the additional mechanical trauma caused by the injection process. Despite this, the live cell population was shown to retain its osteogenic differentiation capacity when induced with BMP- 2. With further optimisation of the delivery method, cells may survive this process in sufficient numbers to suggest that it could be used as a method of seeding tissue engineering scaffolds in the future. This development could remove the limitations place on polymer processing time by the finite survival period of the cells, permitting tuning of the scaffold structure to suit the application. In summary, this study has demonstrated that mammalian cells can be incorporated into biodegradable PDLLA scaffolds using a rapid, one-step scCO 2 process without the use of toxic solvents or elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the development of the high pressure injection system could allow cells to be incorporated during the fabrication step, removing the restrictions on polymer processing. This technique could be used for the rapid production of tissue cell loaded engineering scaffolds and other associated biotechnological applications where cells and synthetic polymers are combined, such as cell therapy and recombinant protein production.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{hydrated}} lime improves the workability and water retention of Portland cement (PC) mortars. PC-lime mixes can be reworked without increasing entrained air thus not undermining durability. In addition, lime lowers strength and stiffness making PC mortars more deformable. However, the use of hydrated lime in PC composites has largely decreased due {{to the use of}} plasticisers. These enhance workability and lower cement content reducing heat of hydration. As they are water reducers, they are expected to decrease permeability, minimise shrinkage, enhance ultimate strength and accelerate early-strength gain; leading to stronger, durable composites. Despite these advantages, plasticisers have drawbacks related to wastage and environmental protection. This paper studies the properties of PC-lime mortars and their <b>plasticised</b> equivalents. It concludes that lime raises mortar water demand however, this does not reduce strength but on the contrary, mortars of low lime content (lime amounting 1 / 4 th the cement), have superior flexural and compressive strengths than their <b>plasticised</b> equivalents. The use of lime delivered PC mortars with excellent workability and surface finish and lack of segregation and bleeding. It is concluded that, when lime amounts 1 / 4 th the cement, the mortars are stronger (in tension and compression, at both early and mature age) and gain strength at a faster rate than <b>plasticised</b> mixes. However, when lime equals the cement content, strengths are lower than those of <b>plasticised</b> mixes. It was als...|$|R
40|$|Cellulosic fibre {{composite}} compounds {{based on}} {{hemp and flax}} fibres in triethyl citrate <b>plasticised</b> starch acetate were prepared by melt processing. Composites were prepared with fibre contents up to 50 w%. A stiffness of 8. 3 GPa and stress at maximum load of 51 MPa were obtained with 40 w% flax fibre in a <b>plasticised</b> starch acetate with 20 w% triethyl citrate. An almost linear relation between fibre content and the tensile properties was found. The impact strength of the composites was increased with the plasticiser content. The porosity content was low even at high fibre content. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: USB; 20081010 (joffe...|$|R
40|$|Large {{castings}} of hot-setting <b>plasticised</b> epoxy polymers developed surface crazing {{after being}} subjected {{for several hours}} to moderately high temperatures. The phenomenon was attributed to rejection of the <b>plasticising</b> agent by the surface layer of the material and the resulting local change of mechanical properties. Thermal crazing appears to be extremely sensitive towards stress concentrations and cracks usually follow principal stress patterns. Visualisation of frozen or residual stress fields is, therefore, possible. The material in thin sheet form can also be applied as brittle coating, being bonded on stressed metal surfaces and producing by cracking, principal stress patterns corresponding to acting loads combined with thermal stresses. © 1974...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{performance of}} conducting polymer electrochromic devices (ECDs) utilising gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) <b>plasticised</b> with ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate or (N-butyl- 3 -methylpyridinium trifluoromethanesulphonylimide (P 14 TFSI) has been made. Lithium perchlorate and lithium trifluoromethanesulphonylimide salts {{were used in}} the GPEs to provide enhanced ionic conductivity and inhibit phase separation of the polyethyleneoxide (PEO) and plasticiser. ECDs were assembled from cathodically colouring, polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT), and anodically colouring, polypyrrole (PPy), conducting polymer electrochromes deposited by vapour deposition. The photopic contrast switching over the visible light spectrum, switching speeds and device stability of the ECDs were obtained. These studies demonstrate that the ionic liquid (IL) <b>plasticised</b> GPEs are a suitable replacement for pure IL based devices and volatile organic solvent plasticisers based upon ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate mixtures...|$|R

A local decrease of residual stress (internal forces devour residual stress, cf. [18]), i.e. searching in double of the yield limit (see Sect.  4.5) for the constants is the approach of choice in this case.|$|R
40|$|Two {{indicator}} dyes {{are presented}} that perform reversible chemical reactions with neutral analytes in thin layers of <b>plasticised</b> poly vinyl chloride (PVC). Since these dyes combine {{the properties of}} a selective ligand with those of a chemical reagent, they are termed chromoreactands. The lipophilic decyl derivative of a-Naphthyl Red (CR- 418) reversibly reacts with formaldehyde shifting the absorbance maximum in <b>plasticised</b> PVC from 438 to 449 nm. The sensor membrane exhibits highest sensitivity to formaldehyde in the 1 – 100 mM range with a detection limit of 0. 3 mM. A bisazo dye with a reactive trifluoroacetyl group (CR- 573) reversibly forms a hemiaminal with amphetamine in thin layers of <b>plasticised</b> PVC and changes its colour from blue to red (corresponding to a shift in absorbance maximum from 575 to 548 nm). The sensitivity of the dye in the polymer layer covers the range from 0. 3 to 30 mM amphetamine with a detection limit of 0. 1 mM. The same dye also detects ethanol when the catalyst tridodecylmethylammonium chloride is used to accelerate the chemical reaction. The sensor layer exhibits a sensitive range from 1 to 40 % (v/v) ethanol and a detection limit of 0. 8 % (v/v). Maximum signal changes are observed at 630 nm making CR- 573 compatible with cheap light sources and detectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{biodegradation}} of neat chitosan, glycerol <b>plasticised</b> chitosan {{films and}} their corresponding clay-based nano-biocomposites {{has been studied}} in simulated aerobic soil and composting environments using a respirometric method. The rate of biodegradation was much faster in soil and all test samples achieved close to 100 % biodegradation within 70 days. During biodegradation under aerobic composting conditions the neat chitosan samples achieved approx 65 % biodegradation and the <b>plasticised</b> chitosan samples achieved > 85 % biodegradation within 180 days. Additionally, nano-clay additives had no {{significant effect on the}} overall biodegradability of the chitosan-based materials during composting. High-resolution solid-state NMR studies were performed to examine the chemical structures of the plasticized chitosan and their nano-biocomposites. NMR studies indicated that the glycerol plasticizer was extracted into wet compost within first few days while acetic acid remained through strong hydrogen bonding with chitosan during the degradation process...|$|R
