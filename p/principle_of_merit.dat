It is with great submission to better judgments that I recommend it to consideration, that a critical retrospective examination of the pension list, upon the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit,</b> can never serve for my basis.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{argue that}} David Hume’s {{political}} philosophy is centrally {{focused on the}} prospect of social reform. The conception of justice and politics he develops out of his theories of virtue and moral psychology stresses the pervasive effects of institutions on individuals’ abilities to live decent lives and provides criteria for determining the relative success of such institutions. While Hume’s political philosophy has been interpreted as justifying a society’s status quo, I demonstrate that the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit,</b> need, and equality—commonly considered core <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> social justice—each {{play a vital role}} in his view of what constitutes a healthy, stable society. In particular, I contend that Hume’s emphasis on institutions guaranteeing equal protection of basic rights, the role of the common good in the moral justification of political institutions, and the material and social circumstances of equality that make the institution of justice possible, suggest that social reform is a central concern of his theory of justice and politics...|$|R
40|$|Do {{policies}} {{that seek to}} revive the prospects of minority languages transgress important liberal principles? The article will explore this question by focusing on one controversial aspect of language policy in Wales: the steps taken to set Welsh language requirements for some jobs in the public sector. This is a practice that has generated substantial debate, with opponents claiming that it undermines equality of opportunity {{in the field of}} employment and, in particular, transgresses the principle of appointing on the basis of merit. It will be argued here that such objections do not stand up to scrutiny. Efforts to promote a language's position in the field of employment do not undermine the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit,</b> but merely expand slightly on its meaning. Therefore, liberals should, in principle, be willing to endorse policies similar to those adopted in Wales in recent years. Nevertheless, the fact that these policies can be endorsed in principle does not mean that liberals would wish to exclude them completely from criticism. Rather, as will also be argued, the background conditions against which they are implemented {{and the degree to which}} these can influence an individual's linguistic ability should also be considered, and in the Welsh context, at least, this is an issue that may call for further attention.

40|$|The {{practice}} {{of affirmative action}} has recently been at the vanguard of intense debate {{more than any other}} time in its forty-year history. A growing number of programs including quotas, preferential hiring, minority scholarships, diversity, and reverse discrimination have all been linked to affirmative action, which aims to break down the wall of segregation that excluded racial minorities and women from the workplace and in education. Two class-action lawsuits, Gratz v. Bollinger [02 - 516] and Gnttter v. Bollinger [02 - 241], filed in response to white students being denied admission to the University of Michigan 2 ̆ 7 s undergraduate and law school program, provided the United States Supreme Court with its best opportunity in recent years to focus on the constitutionality of adopting such admissions policies. Affirmative action policies are inconsistent with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> (the idea of attaining what you earn) and they penalize an innocent person for the alleged crimes of his or her ancestors, effectively known as reverse discrimination. Furthermore, affirmative action unfairly rewards minorities on the erroneous notion that a minority status automatically equates 2 ̆ 2 disadvantage. 2 ̆ 2 In conclusion, an additional perspective for the case against implementing affirmative action policy within the workplace and in higher education will be presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether senior public servants should be political or non-political when performing their duties. This debate has long been a central concern in the literature of United States of America from the beginning of public administration, and remains so to this day. It is also the case in South Africa, especially after the ANC assumed power in 1994. The ANC has deployed some of its members to key public service positions with a view of promoting loyalty and service delivery. This paper addresses this issue {{in the context of the}} politics-administration dichotomy. Models, which describe and analyse the relationship between politics and administration are identified. These models are dichotomy model/depoliticized bureaucracy, politicized bureaucracy model, model of complementarity, the British permanent model and the American hybrid model. This paper recognizes a need for “political appointments” (politicized bureaucracy) within the public service due to a threat, real or perceived, of political sabotage by disloyal incumbents of the previous dispensation. After a threat of political sabotage diminishes the government should then introduce the complementarity model, with more emphasis on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit,</b> which is emphasized in the British permanent model and to a certain extent, the American hybrid model. State institutions supporting constitutional democracy should act independently against corrupt public functionaries who abuse “political appointments” for their own personal purposes...|$|E
40|$|Metacognition {{comprises}} {{a spectrum}} of mental activities involving thinking about thinking. Metacognitive impairments may sustain and trigger negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Without complex ideas {{of the self and}} others, there may be less reason to pursue goal-directed activities and less ability to construct meaning in daily activities, leading to the experience of negative symptoms. As these symptoms tend to be nonresponsive to pharmacotherapy and other kinds of treatment metacognition might be a novel treatment target; improvement of metacognition might lead to improvements in negative symptoms. One therapy that seeks to promote metacognition is the Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT). In this study, a case is presented in which a first episode patient with severe negative symptoms is treated with MERIT.

40|$|This document, {{the result}} of {{research}} conducted to resolve some of the confusion surrounding the question <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> pay, synthesizes information and professional opinion about teacher compensation. The material {{is presented in two}} major sections, one devoted to the concept <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> pay and the other to a discussion of alternative methods of rewarding outstanding teachers. Within the concept <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> pay are discussed (1) three major additional compensation provisions, (2) merit provisions in historical perspective, CO <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> pay plans, (4) procedures for merit rating and/or evaluation, (5) pro and con arguments regarding merit pay programs, and (6) some successes and failures <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> pay plans. The differentiated teaching staff approach, the teacher incentive plan, and the approved staff plan are examined in depth in a section on alternative reward methods. Study findings reveal that (I) careful teacher preparation and training (indying improvements in the college programs for training new teachers) is necessary before a schoca can handle the technical and human relationship problems inherent in a thoroughgoing merit program; (2) a merit salary program is feasible only in school systems that have developed approariate objective evaluation procedures; (3) teacher morale, a complex of many factors, is not primarily determined by the salary system, be it merit or nonmerit.

40|$|This {{research}} study examines three regional primary school Boards of Trustees in New Zealand {{leading up to}} the appointment of their new teaching principal. It focusses on trustee perceptions of educational leadership and on each Board's principal selection procedures. The conceptual and research framework identifies three areas for investigation: trustees' new employer role as a result of devolved educational control and their future training needs; the principal's dichotomous role as leader and manager of the school; and the efficacy of the principal selection process taking into account trustees' knowledge of the job, core principal qualities necessary for the position, identification of selection criteria, subjective factors and gender considerations. A qualitative case study approach was used to illuminate the selection process which involved a total of 17 trustees. The research design was based around four information sources: documentary analysis, questionnaire, observational recording of meeting discussions, and a focussed interview with each trustee. Results of the study showed that trustees' predominant perceptions of principal qualities lay in the area of personal relationships and practical teaching experiences, with a preference for leadership rather than managerial skills. Trustees were not yet comfortable in their employer role, and selection processes displayed weaknesses in assessment methodologies and their consistent application. Results also revealed the impact on trustees' decision-making of subjective factors such as selector impressionism, and of the concept of 'best fit' involving dual processes of job and person perceptions. As a consequence, the study recommends that future trustee selection training should be directed towards an understanding of employment legislation and of school leadership and management issues, and a greater proficiency in the use of valid assessment methods. These research findings have implications not only for trustee personnel training but for the expectations of a principal's role in today's schools, and for a broader definition of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> selection...|$|E
40|$|Globally, sport plays a {{significant}} role and forms part of every modern person’s life, irrespective of race, age, gender or ethnic group. Researchers on this topic increasingly focus on the early identification of talent and the development of the talent to ensure optimal performance. One of the most critical trademarks of human development is die correlation between age and physical ability. The primary reason why people participate in sport is to improve their level of participation and performance. Therefore every effort should be made to obtain a more scientific approach towards optimal sports performance, seeing that it is scientifically proven that it improves the effectiveness of a specific sport with regards to the selection and preparation of individuals and teams. In present time South African sport is still facing the challenge to successfully integrate previously disadvantaged communities and to select teams purely on merit. The use of scientific evaluation criteria in the selection process of teams can make a definite contribution to help solidify the selection <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> only. This {{is due to the fact}} that scientifically, assessed physical performance can not merely be ignored or overruled in the selection of teams. The primary objective of this study was first of all to establish whether different norms will be needed for different playing positions in netball and if the assessments that are currently used are able to accurately predict the highest level that players will be able to play at. In the second instance, the objective of this study was to try and determine which components should be part of a set of netball specific evaluation criteria. To accomplish this objective research was done to find many different test protocol and to find literature that would verify the protocol. A third objective was to identify the positional qualities that netball players have to comply to, based on the selected evaluation criteria, and to select the best tests to be used for talent identification. In other words what the minimum test requirements would be to accomplish maximum data gathering. The developed protocol consisted of three (3) motor tests, four (4) physical tests and three (3) kinanthropometrical tests. The research group used in this study consisted of 304 senior netball players i. e. players older than 19 years of age. These players were categorized into three groups, namely players competing at club, national and international level. With the presentation of the statistical analysis, percentile ranks were developed and a 100 research candidates per positional group was used; i. e. 300 netball players in total. Furthermore an ANOVA was used to determine whether there were significant differences between the three positional groups. An analysis was done to determine if the evaluation criteria could discriminate between players from different positional groups. The analysis was merely used as a classification method and did not serve to evaluate die significance of differences. The results delivered position-specific norms. A function for predicting the identification of talented and less talented players was also developed. Although the study showed certain limitations, the research can be utilized to further develop scientific talent identification criteria for netball and this will be to the advantage of sports scientists and coaches involved with netball.

40|$|In February 2012, the German Federal Constitutional Court {{declared}} {{the salaries of}} level W 2 professors in the State of Hesse unconstitutional due to their lack of sufficient alimentation power. In the meantime, federal and nearly all state legislators have provided (draft) laws in order to comply in the future with constitutional requirements. In either case, the new salary law still rests upon a dual system containing basic salaries (partly tiered) and a merit bonus component. However, the reform acts provided so far do not succeed in smoothing out existing alimentation deficits of salary law for professors or even create new constitutionally doubtful legal provisions. This is particularly {{due to the fact}} that legislators both miss a sufficient level of basic salaries compared to other public servants and try to cover additional expenses by curtailing given performance bonuses at the same time ("consumption" of old bonuses).

40|$|The small base of extant {{research}} on doctoral admissions suggests a paradox between <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> and diversity: Faculty profess diversity, but {{rely on a}} conventional notion <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> that undermines diversity’s realization. To untangle this paradox and broaden understanding of graduate admissions, I conducted a comparative ethnographic case study focusing on the social construction <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> in Ph. D. admissions. Over two years of data collection in three research universities, I conducted 86 interviews with faculty and observed 22 hours of admissions committee meetings in ten highly ranked Ph. D. programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Guided by sociocultural theories of evaluation, decision making, and disciplines, I find that what counts as merit has an important organizational dimension that helps explain contradictions between espoused and enacted values. Merit {{is not just an}} individual attribute. It is also a significant organizational challenge that involves apparent contradictions because decision makers compromise across the multiple hierarchies of priorities for the discipline, department, committee, and self. At the department level, a logic of status maintenance affects decision-making processes, perceptions of risk, meanings associated with common criteria, and profiles of preferred applicants. In debating borderline applicants, diversity is an important consideration, as are research engagement and “fit. ” However, faculty make broad, initial cuts using a very high standard of conventional achievement that may undermine diversity. Furthermore, participants associate diversity more with obligation and pragmatic benefits than personal commitment or organizational transformation. The decision-making model, which I call deliberative bureaucracy, maximizes efficiency and collegiality; however, it also reinforces reliance on GRE scores, obscures the basis for ratings and decisions, and sacrifices discussion of criteria and applicants in favor of discussing less-controversial matters of process. I also propose disciplinary logics as a mechanism explaining how disciplines affect faculty judgment, and explore four types of individual-level homophilic preferences that shape ratings and committee deliberations. Findings have broad implications for access to graduate education. They indicate a need to change the organizational culture of gatekeeping so that <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> equity, quality, and diversity are aligned across the evaluative contexts in which judgments <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> are situated...|$|R

40|$|Committee Members: Richard Serpe (Chair), Alicia Gonzales, Sharon EliseMeritocracy {{is often}} {{mentioned}} {{in discussions of}} social inequality, stratification, oppression and "White Privilege," but it is seldom investigated as to its ubiquitous role as a dominant inaugurator of social inequality in America today. Emanating from the central liberal concept that opportunities to compete for resources and goods are fair and equal for everyone, the American social justice ideal of "meritocratic equality" masks the realities of group determinants {{in relation to the}} anatomies of "hegemonies of power" in American culture. Disingenuously deflecting inequality issues from institutional inefficacy onto individual inadequacies and obfuscating fundamental issues of injustice, America's "meritocratic myth" camouflages meritocratic individualism's role as a catalytic agent behind group differential practices in America's social, political and economic architecture. This discursive analysis critiques the puissant connections between meritocratic individualism (meritocracy) and the conceptions and practices of dominant "Americanized" identities, ideology and institutions. It particularly brings into focus the ways meritocracy legitimizes practices of social inequality, especially within the institution of public education. Meritocracy is examined through the lens of myth, as an abstracted ideology whose "universal" tenets have become habituated through uncontested religious, social, psychological and historical processes, which this paper explores. Critical Race Theory provides the analytical framework to examine supposedly "neutral" <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the "fair" and "good" society in relationship to widely accepted <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit,</b> ability, performance and "deservedness.

40|$|Context – Positive {{discrimination}} {{stems from}} the American concept of affirmative action. Literature within this area is more commonly associated with affirmative action in America {{and there is a}} lack of literature from a UK perspective. Therefore, this dissertation will examine positive discrimination within the UK. Objectives – Affirmative action is considered a highly controversial and a highly debated topic (Kravitz 2008 and Coate and Loury 1993). The research project begins with an analysis of the opposing features of positive discrimination and evaluates their merits and faults through study of the literature. Using this as a foundation, the interviews focused upon the understanding and opinions of research participants regarding positive discrimination. This case study of positive discrimination within Edinburgh explores whether positive discrimination is an appropriate measure to produce an equally diverse and representative workforce. Design – The research was conducted under the qualitative method, as the research is concerned with the ‘how’ and ‘why’. Participants were drawn from the private, public and third sectors to ensure a broad representation. Method – A semi-structured interview process was conducted, each interview followed a list of questions, but there was scope for further questions based upon the participant’s answers. Results – The results show that, although the participants can identify the benefit of increased diversity that is brought through the use of positive discrimination, this does not, for them, outweigh the many negative attributes identified. The <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> and ability were more important to the participants when considering recruitment and a workforce’s demographic. It was considered that people should be acknowledged for their skill and experience, not their physical attributes – contrary to the underlying <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> positive discrimination. Conclusions – The research concludes that, from the perspective of the participants, positive discrimination is an evil, which is not necessary to ensure equality within organisations. However, it is acknowledged that further research is needed and future areas are identified...|$|R

The main purpose of constituting such a body, designated in most countries of British heritage as 'civil' or 'public' service commission, {{is to ensure that}} all decisions relating to recruitment and other service matters are made consistent with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> and equity. In Bangladesh, this body is presently designated as the Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC).A commission called Public Service Commission was first established in India in 1926, when it was entrusted with functions almost similar to those of its British counterpart in London, particularly in matters of recruitment of public servants of the central government of British India. Similar provincial level commissions were subsequently established, including the Bengal Public Service Commission in 1937, following the formation of responsible governments in the provinces in pursuance of provisions made in the Government of India Act, 1919, and thereafter in the Government of India Act, 1935. After the partition of India in 1947, replicas of the Public Service Commission in British India were created in Pakistan, both at central and provincial levels. Hence a body designated as Public Service Commission, Eastern Pakistan (renamed later East Pakistan Public Service Commission) came into being in East Bengal (later named East Pakistan) in August 1947.After the emergence of Bangladesh two separate commissions, namely the Public Service Commission (First), and the Public Service Commission (Second), were initially established in May 1972 under provisions made in President's Order No. 34 of 1972. But to give effect to the provisions on public service commissions in the constitution adopted in November 1972, a fresh Presidential Order (President's Order No. 25 of 1973) was promulgated in March 1973 which in effect formally regularized the establishment of the two commissions in existence since May 1972. However, in November 1977 the government promulgated another ordinance to establish a single commission in place of the existing two commissions, which, in effect, came into being on 22 December 1977 and was designated as Bangladesh Public Service Commission.|$|R
500|$|The {{idea that}} a certain power could be {{transferred}} {{from one to another}} was known before the arising of Buddhism. In religious texts such as the Mahābhārata, it is described that devas can transfer certain powers (...) [...] A similar belief existed with regard to the energy gained by performing austerities (...) [...] Apart from these transfers of power, a second origin is found in Brahamanical ancestor worship. In the period preceding the arising of Buddhism, it was believed that after a person's death he had to be transformed from a wandering preta to reach the blissful world of the pitṛs. This was done through the complex Śrāddha ceremonies, which would secure the destiny of the deceased as a pitṛ. In Buddhism, however, ancestor worship was discontinued, as it was believed that the dead would not reach heavenly bliss through rituals or worship, but only through the law of karma.

This sense of responsibility was typical for pre-Buddhist practices of ancestor worship. As for the veneration of dead ancestors, this was replaced by veneration of the Sangha.|$|R
5000|$|The {{margin of}} {{appreciation}} doctrine has gained sufficient prominence, under an emerging <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> subsidiarity, to <b>merit</b> impending incorporation into the Preamble of the European Convention. This formal acknowledgment indicates awareness, {{on the part of}} the Council of Europe, that the evolution of the Convention must include jurisprudence that justifies the application of this doctrine in so many different issues. The {{margin of appreciation}} doctrine may also expand further throughout international law. This is because its underlying concept of a derogation being [...] "necessary in a democratic society"as it is provided for in the European Conventionalso resonates with other international human rights regimes. Although many regimes remain formally ambivalent (or even negative) towards margins of appreciation, the growing influence of Convention law on international norms is, in turn, making the doctrine more attractive to the global community.|$|R

Funding support from the UK Department of Health is gratefully acknowledged. The paper examines alternative routes to a definition for the voluntary sector, settling on a definition developed from first <b>principles.</b> The <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the different definitional approaches are examined, and the components <b>of</b> the chosen <b>principles</b> discussed. By relaxing each principle in turn, broader definitions of the sector are obtained. The discussion is predominantly couched in the British context, although the paper is stimulated by the start, in Spring 1990, of an international comparative study of the voluntary sector. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea that}} a certain power could be {{transferred}} {{from one to another}} was known before the arising of Buddhism. In religious texts such as the Mahābhārata, it is described that devas can transfer certain powers (tejas). A similar belief existed with regard to the energy gained by performing austerities (tapas). However, in the teaching of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> in early Buddhism, merit is not donated in literal parts; meritorious acts in relation to the Sangha are emphasized; devas do not take any part in it; and it is often a compassionate act towards living beings in the next world who may be in suffering. Apart from these transfers of power, a second origin is found in Brahamanical ancestor worship. The Petavatthu text was the Buddhist response to this. In this text, transferring merit to deceased relatives is described in detail. The word , literally, 'gone forth', is used by Theravāda to refer to one's dead relatives in the context <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> transfer. It is the Pali equivalent of Sanskrit preta (hungry ghost), but also Sanskrit pitṛ (father, ancestor). In the period preceding the arising of Buddhism, it was believed that after a person's death he had to be transformed from a wandering preta to reach the blissful world of the pitṛs. This was done through the complex Śrāddha ceremonies, which would secure the deceased's destiny as a pitṛ. In Buddhism, however, ancestor worship was discontinued, as it was believed that the dead would not reach heavenly bliss through rituals or worship, but only through the law of karma. Nevertheless, the practice <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> arose by using the ethical and psychological <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> karma and <b>merit,</b> and connect these with the sense of responsibility towards one's parents. This sense of responsibility was typical for pre-Buddhist practices of ancestor worship. The veneration of dead ancestors was replaced by a veneration of the Sangha instead.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{consider}} how ethical principles can inform the effective design and implementation of technology-based interventions that aim to promote the well-being of socially isolated older adults. We evaluated a new iPad application with small groups of older adults. In this article, we reflect on the ethical issues encountered at each stage of the research process. Drawing on the ethical <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> beneficence, research <b>merit</b> and integrity, justice, and respect, we identify key issues to consider in the future design and implementation of social isolation interventions that use new technologies. Key issues include (a) providing sufficient support to facilitate ongoing social interactions, (b) managing older adults' expectations, (c) providing encouragement without coercion, and (d) responding to individual needs. We conclude that it is important to report on ethical challenges incurred when evaluating social isolation interventions to inform future research in this important area.
