5|$|Ort's Oldies, a used {{record store}} on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, {{commonly}} known as Ort, were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> his off-the-wall {{sense of humor and}} warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues around town.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{violation}} to {{the no-fly zone}} came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down {{four of the six}} Serb jets over Banja Luka. This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the Banja Luka incident was also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO. The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no reports}} of {{dopamine}} in archaea, {{but it has been}} detected in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called Tetrahymena. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize dopamine. It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time, perhaps {{as a result of the}} symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.|$|E
5000|$|As Oliver Henry states, [...] "Fisher {{writes about}} {{black people in}} a manner which expresses their kinship with other peoples. He {{underscores}} and highlights the fundamental human condition of black Americans. … He captures the historically induced unique qualities of black people; but, and <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> he writes of them basically as people.” ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was deemed}} {{significant}} [...] "as {{a milestone in}} the history of public education in the community, and <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> its auditorium was Mer Rouge’s community center. As one longtime citizen explained, in rural areas, schools are much more thanjust schools; they were the “heart of the community,” where all manner of large events took place." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the actions}} of the ITGWU and the smaller UBLU were {{unsuccessful}} in achieving substantially better pay and conditions for the workers, they marked a watershed in Irish labour history. The principle of union action and workers' solidarity had been firmly established. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> Larkin's rhetoric condemning poverty and injustice and calling for the oppressed to stand up for themselves made a lasting impression.|$|R
5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament {{building}} to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E
25|$|The artist {{began to}} {{integrate}} direct activism into his {{projects in the}} late 1980s with his vehicles and his instruments, articles of design that would act as band-aids – not only healing social wounds but <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> calling attention to them.|$|E
25|$|Africa {{is seen by}} Chinese {{businessmen}} as 900 million {{potential customers}} in a fast-growing market,. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> African societies are far from market saturation, like their Western counterparts. Thus, in Africa, China finds not only an ample supply of potential new customers but far less competition from other nations.|$|E
50|$|Growing {{up in the}} 1950s in Santa Clara, California the two {{brothers}} were actively {{a part of the}} post-war idealism and the culture of movies and television shows. Some 8 mm home movies, projection screens, and television sets became a part of everyday life. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> their mother went against the cultural grain of the time and talked to her sons about the Japanese American incarceration experience.|$|R
50|$|Baca’s {{efforts to}} include {{community}} in her artistic processes make her unique to her time. Bringing youth {{together to create}} art left a lasting impression in Los Angeles, shifting Chicano/a culture. The involvement of poor youth of color in Baca’s artistic processes changed the way white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchal culture perceived their place in society. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> Baca’s Citywide Mural Program strengthened community and gave people a sense of purpose.|$|R
40|$|The Thai {{economy has}} {{performed}} extremely well in recent years. What is especially {{interesting is the}} unique &et of economic policies implemented {{during this period of}} accelerated growth. Often dubbed "Thaksinomics," these policies represent a distinct break from the past. To Prime Minister Thaksin's followers ti}e new economic measures are not only capable of returning Thailand to the pre- 1997 glory days of high growth, but <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> enabling the country to successfully coexist economically with China...|$|R
25|$|Up to the 19th century, condoms were {{generally}} used {{only by the}} middle and upper classes. One reason for the lack of condom use was that the working classes tended to lack education on the dangers of sexually transmitted infections. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> condoms were unaffordable for many: for a typical prostitute, a single condom might cost several months' pay.|$|E
25|$|The attacking midfielder is an {{important}} position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and, <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> {{the ability to read}} the opposing defence in order to deliver defence-splitting passes to the strikers; in addition to their technical and creative ability, they are also usually quick, agile, and mobile players, which aids them in beating opponents during dribbling runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Dalton McGuinty's 1999 {{campaign}} was widely criticized as disorganized and uninspired, and most journalists believe he gave a poor performance in the leaders' debate. However, McGuinty was able to rally his party {{in the last ten}} days. On election day, the Liberals won 40% of the vote, their second best showing in almost fifty years. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> nine new MPPs were elected, boosting the caucus from 30 to 36, including dynamic politicians like George Smitherman and Michael Bryant.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Editor Teddi Brown died {{of cancer}} {{at the age of}} 62. “Teddi’s passion {{was one of the best}} things that ever {{happened}} to this magazine,” her successor in the editor’s chair, James Little, wrote at the time. “She used these pages to heartily champion all kinds of causes, from fighting poaching to ending game ranching to encouraging kids to fish. But <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> her passion for journalism brought a whole new level of professionalism to the publication.” ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{announced}} in March 2009, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1 was marketed {{as a new}} class of [...] "Creative HD Hybrid" [...] camera, and as Panasonic's top-of-the-line Micro Four Thirds (MFT) system camera. The GH1 appeared to be the first fully compliant camera with the MFT system standard, which includes High Definition (HD) video capability. The hybrid GH1 was designed from the ground up to not only to take still photos, but <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> full HD video, including manual controls over many video functions.|$|R
30|$|McKinnon (2006) {{points out}} that even (and especially) Chinese holders of US public debt may {{experience}} deterioration of their assets. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> McKinnon and Schnabl (2012) state that China cannot fully float its currency since {{it will not be}} able to lend an amount sufficient to balance the trade surplus; the RMB would continue to appreciate unless the central bank stepped in to purchase dollars. China is seeking to expand lending in RMB through its Silk Road projects and participation in global lending institutions. Over time, this will provide China with further room in which to liberalize its exchange rate.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> Sarajevo in {{the late}} 19th and {{throughout}} the 20th century was home to a burgeoning and large center of Sevdalinka record-making and contributed greatly to bringing this historical genre of music to the mainstream, which had for many centuries been a staple of Bosnian culture. Songwriters and musicians such as Himzo Polovina, Safet Isović, Zaim Imamović, Zehra Deović, Halid Bešlić, Hanka Paldum, Nada Mamula, Meho Puzić and many more composed and wrote some of their most important pieces in the city.|$|E
25|$|When the KMT {{government}} fled to Taiwan {{it brought}} millions of taels (where 1tael ~1.2ozt) {{of gold and}} the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> {{as part of its}} retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China. The KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution, attempting to produce imported goods domestically.|$|E
25|$|Zeshin {{learned not}} only the basics of {{painting}} and sketching, but also Japanese tea ceremony, haiku and waka poetry, history, literature and philosophy. This would form the foundation of his training in {{not only the}} techniques of the traditional arts, but also, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the aesthetic and philosophy of Japanese traditional art. Many of his works from the period of his studies with Nanrei were fan paintings. The great ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi was impressed with these fan paintings and, approaching the young painter, began a friendship which would last for many years.|$|E
50|$|During {{its initial}} {{establishment}} and subsequent operationalization, the AEC {{played a key}} role in the institutional development of Ecosystem ecology. Specifically, it provided crucial financial resources, allowing for ecological research to take place. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> it enabled ecologists with a wide range of groundbreaking techniques for the completion of their research. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the AEC also approved funding for numerous bio-environmental projects in the Arctic and near-Arctic. These projects were designed to examine the effects of nuclear energy upon the environment and were a part of the Commission’s attempt at creating peaceful applications of atomic energy.|$|R
40|$|Efficient trunk flexion and {{extension}} training is paramount to stabilize heavy weights lifted overhead in weightlifting. A strong and balanced trunk, which includes several muscle groups (not just those superficial muscles {{that can be seen}} but <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> the deep ones that hold most of the load), is necessary for success. This article will discuss the importance of balance between flexion {{and extension}} exercises of the trunk, stabilization movements of the trunk, and specific exercises {{that can be used in}} a weightlifting training program to most effectively train for stabilization of the weight overhead...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{problems}} faced by BGP, and indeed the Internet infrastructure as a whole, is {{the growth of the}} Internet routing table. If the global routing table grows to the point where some older, less capable, routers cannot cope with the memory requirements or the CPU load of maintaining the table, these routers will cease to be effective gateways between the parts of the Internet they connect. In addition, and <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> larger routing tables take longer to stabilize (see above) after a major connectivity change, leaving network service unreliable, or even unavailable, in the interim.|$|R
25|$|In 1965, Jim Stewart {{signed a}} formal {{national}} distribution deal with Atlantic Records, although fatefully {{he signed the}} contract without reading it—a decision that would later cost the label dearly. Carla Thomas also formally rejoined the Stax label in 1965. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> for the label's fortunes, the songwriting team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter began to establish themselves as Stax's new team of hit writer/producers. Hayes would also permanently join the Stax house band, often subbing for Booker T. Jones, who was studying music full-time at Indiana University during the mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{principal}} applications of the exterior algebra is in differential geometry where {{it is used to}} define the bundle of differential forms on a smooth manifold. In the case of a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the tangent spaces come equipped with a natural quadratic form induced by the metric. Thus, one can define a Clifford bundle in analogy with the exterior bundle. This has a number of important applications in Riemannian geometry. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> is the link to a spin manifold, its associated spinor bundle and spinc manifolds.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates {{lost two}} key commanders, Mouton and Green, and {{suffered}} casualties {{they could not}} afford. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> relations between the aggressive Taylor and cautious Smith were permanently damaged by their disagreement over Smith's decision to remove half of Taylor's troops following the Battle of Pleasant Hill. The lost opportunity to capture the entire Union fleet as it lay helpless above the falls at Alexandria haunted Taylor to his dying day; {{he was certain that}} Smith had robbed him a chance to cripple the Union forces. The arguments between the two generals resulted in Taylor's transfer to command of the Department of East Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama soon after the campaign ended.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{route through}} the Gap passes {{south of the}} Knüllgebirge and then continues around the northern flank of the Vogelsberg Mountains; the narrower southern route passes through the Fliede and Kinzig Valleys, with the Vogelsberg {{to the north and}} the Rhön mountains and Spessart mountains to the south. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> on emerging from the western exit of the Gap, one encounters gentle terrain from there to the river Rhine, which would have counted in favour of Soviet attempts to reach and cross the Rhine before NATO could prevent this (the intervening Main River would have been less of an obstacle).|$|R
40|$|Photoelectrochemistry {{is truly}} an {{interdisciplinary}} field; a natural nexus between chemistry and physics. In short, photoelectrochemistry {{can be divided}} into three sub-processes, namely (i) the creation of electron-hole pairs by light absorption; (ii) separation/transport on the charge carriers and finally (iii) the water splitting reaction. The challenge is to understand all three processes on a microscopic scale and, <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> how to combine the processes in an optimal way. This review will highlight some first-principles insights to the above sub-processes, in particular as they occur using metal oxides. Based on these insights, challenges and future directions of first-principles methods in the field of photoelectrochemistry will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{considers}} two frequently advocated approaches to reducing indirect taxation in Brazil: reduction in taxes on food; reduction in taxes on intermediate inputs to agriculture. To asses {{the effects of}} both on income distribution poverty levels, a bottom-up general equilibrium model of Brazil (TERM-BR) is linked to a microsimulation model. It is shown {{that one of the}} favoured policies is more poverty reducing, the other more income inequality reducing. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the analysis demonstrates that the two policies lead to very different outcomes in terms of inter-state transfers; a major political barrier to reform in a federal state.

25|$|In 1992, Barcelona {{hosted the}} Summer Olympics. The after-effects {{of this are}} {{credited}} with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% {{and the amount of}} new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination {{in the world and the}} 5th amongst European cities.|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I {{do not have to}} remind you that every man has the right to have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E
25|$|As the Soviets advanced, mutinies {{broke out}} in the capital of Hsinking and lasted from 13–19 August. Some Manchukuoan units rose up and killed their Japanese {{officers}} in revenge for the years of brutal treatment. A few Manchukuoan regulars and auxiliaries remained loyal and continued to fight on alongside the Japanese but they were the minority. Most of the Manchukuoan units melted away into the countryside after the first week or so unless they were stopped by their Japanese advisers. During the conflict, the Soviets captured 30,700 non-Japanese soldiers and killed about 10,000. Among those were 16,100 Chinese, 3,600 Mongolians, 700 Manchus and 10,300 Koreans. It is presumed that most of the Koreans were Kwantung Army auxiliaries while the rest were soldiers of the Manchukuoan Army (although some Koreans did serve in the Manchukuoan forces, such as former Chief of General Staff of the South Korean Army Paik Sun-yup and President of South Korea Park Chung-hee). Among those troops were also some White Russians. However, the majority of the former Manchukuoan Imperial Army remained in the countryside. Many of them joined the Communists since the Nationalists murdered those former Manchukuoan troops that they ran into, and as a result these former puppet troops provided an important source of manpower for the Communist Party in the region. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> they also brought with them large amounts of weapons and equipment.|$|E
40|$|Excavations near Norg (province of Drenthe) {{unearthed}} part of {{an early}} medieval settlement {{with a wide variety}} of features, including wells and several house plans. A number of ‘double pits’ were found, some of which contained a thin black layer of charred material at the base. Botanical analysis suggests that these pits were in fact storage pits (‘silos’). Fire was used to sanitise these pits. This study shows that for this purpose straw, heather (Calluna vulgaris), and probably threshing remains were preferred over wood, be¬cause these produce a short, hot blaze. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the results of this study demonstrate the utmost importance of carefully considered sampling in the field and close collabo¬ration between all of the specialists involved in the process of forming archaeological interpretations...|$|R
40|$|The project SHADOWS {{has started}} {{research}} which is developing software for automatic bug healing. We work with self-healing software, which looks for concurrent bugs. If the~detection software finds a bug, the healing {{action will be}} performed. After every healing action, one {{would like to know}} whether this action has fixed the detected problem and, <b>perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> that it has not caused any other, possibly even more serious, problem. Therefore this paper describes a technique which gives the answer for this question after automatical healing. One can fix some concurent bugs by adding healing locks. One does healing assurance by searching monitorenter instruction and uses Control Flow Graph analysis over Java byte-code. The prototype uses static analysis (tool FindBugs) for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{analyze the}} {{existence}} of price manipulation and optimal trade execution strategies in a model for an electronic limit order book with nonlinear price impact and exponential resilience. Our main results show that, under general conditions on the shape function of the limit order book, placing deterministic trade sizes at trading dates that are homogeneously spaced is optimal within a large class of adaptive strategies with arbitrary trading dates. This extends results from our earlier work with A. Fruth. <b>Perhaps</b> even <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> our analysis yields as a corollary that our model does not admit price manipulation strategies. This latter result contrasts the recent findings of Gatheral [12], where, in a related but different model, exponential resilience was found to give rise to price manipulation strategies when price impact is nonlinear...|$|R
