5000|$|Employer hostility was not {{the only}} obstacle: The fact that some {{branches}} of the trade were falling while others were rising also complicated the early union’s plans. In the late 19th century assortment work - tinware that included household goods, cutlery, and cans, for instance - moved from shop to factory, and machine operators replaced apprentice-trained journeymen on the job. At the same time, though, the increasing use of galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> was creating opportunities for journeymen employed in furnace or architectural shops - demand for metal roofs, cornices, skylights, and ceilings, along with warm air furnaces and ventilation pipe, was on the rise by the late 19th century. In their case, labor-saving machinery, including <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> folders, or brakes, and cutting, rolling, and seaming machines, did not replace skill. But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the Tin, <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron</b> and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade. Although many local unions feared that admitting lower-waged members would undercut journeymen’s wages, a referendum vote in 1896 moved the organization forward. “The constitution of the tinners has been changed so as to admit all who work at sheet metal work into their unions,” the IA reported.” Henceforth, the Tin, <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron,</b> and Cornice Workers’ International Association will be known as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.” ...|$|R
