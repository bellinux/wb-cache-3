500|$|Common {{forms of}} {{preventive}} medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. Both {{external and internal}} parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. Worms {{are the most common}} internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites. [...] External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep itch mites, and maggots. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common <b>preventive</b> <b>method.</b> Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb. [...] Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.|$|E

Our goal was to assess knowledge of <b>preventive</b> <b>methods</b> and current treatment of malaria among the affected community of Trujillo, Honduras. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 71 individuals. Most respondents had a good understanding about common malaria symptoms but not about the complications associated with severe cases.

40|$|AIM: Cancer {{prevention}} {{is the most}} important public cancer management. Although the <b>preventive</b> <b>methods</b> have been known, they haven&# 146;t been performed in practice. Beside the education, consultation should be given. A descriptive study which was performed in military where the adolescents younger than 25 years of age with the capability of developing behaviour styles exist more, was presented in order to evaluate the effects of cancer prevention education to the practice. METHOD: After the evaluation of demographic features and knowledge of soldiers in Ulucinar Special Education Commadership, cancer <b>preventive</b> <b>methods</b> were told by the doctor. Following th lesson, consultation was given about healthy nutrition, quiting smoking, weight control, and determination of risk factors. Nutritional and smoking habits were evaluated after the consultation. RESULTS: Among the soldiers, % 20 of them thought that cancer was contagious and % 23 of them thought that cancer was fetal. Media is the major source of information. Although they knew <b>preventive</b> <b>methods</b> like stop smoking, healthy nutrition, exersize, medical follow-up, they didn&# 146;t carry out them.
