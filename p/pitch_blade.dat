Nonetheless, mixing behaviour of such fluids is still poorly understood due {{to the complexity of}} their rheological behaviour. This study aims to enhance fundamental understanding of the flow and mixing of rheologically complex fluids such as thixotropic, shear-thinning and viscoelastic fluids. The objectives of this study were to investigate within stirred vessels the effects of thixotropy and viscoelasticity, separately, in the absence of other rheological behaviours for the fluids examined. To achieve these aims the rheological behaviour of the fluid examined is isolated by using a fluid that exhibits only one of these behaviours of interest at a time.

The scope of the project is to develop an innovative propeller concept to improve the efficiency and the working capabilities of micro wind turbines, widening the range of the wind speed for which the turbine can transform energy effectively and safely. This new propeller concept is based on a variable <b>pitch</b> <b>blade,</b> which has morphing capabilities that enables the control system to select the optimum twist law along the blade, to optimize the efficiency also in non-nominal conditions.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{designing}} {{wind turbine blades}} {{is to improve the}} power capture ability. Since rotor control technology is currently limited to controlling rotational speed and blade pitch, an increasing concern has been given to morphing blades. In this paper, a simplified morphing blade is introduced, which has a linear twist distribution along the span and a shape that can be controlled by adjusting the twist of the blade's root and tip. To evaluate the performance of wind turbine blades, a numerical code based on the blade element momentum theory is developed and validated. The blade of the NREL Phase VI wind turbine is taken as a reference blade and has a fixed pitch. The optimization problems associated with the control of the morphing blade and a blade with pitch control are formulated. The optimal results show that the morphing blade gives better results than the blade with pitch control in terms of produced power. Under the assumption that at a given site, the annual average wind speed is known and the wind speed follows a Rayleigh distribution, the annual energy production of wind turbines was evaluated for three types of blade, namely, morphing blade, blade with pitch control and fixed <b>pitch</b> <b>blade.</b> For an annual average wind speed varying between 5 m/s and 15 m/s, {{it turns out that the}} annual energy production of the wind turbine containing morphing blades is 24. 5 % to 69. 7 % higher than the annual energy production of the wind turbine containing pitch fixed blades.

Some designs use variable <b>pitch</b> <b>blade</b> control devices in order to maximize the efficiency of the turbines; however these are complex to design, construct and maintain under the severe load conditions sub sea devices experience. There is an interest in the use of composite materials for potential improvements in hydrodynamic and structural performance of Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbines (HATT). In addition to the advantages of high strength-to-mass and high strength to stiffness ratios, anisotropy of the laminated fibre composites can be designed to allow 3 D tailoring of the blade deformation. Anisotropic structures show different levels of elastic coupling, depending on the ply angle in the layers that comprise such a material. Passive control of a turbine blade can be achieved by taking advantage of the directionality of the anisotropic composite material. A structure that undergoes both bending and twisting due to a pure bending load is said to exhibit bend-twist coupling. This type of behaviour has been identified as a potential method for load reduction - particularly fatigue loads, and an increase in both efficiency and annual energy capture in wind turbines [1]. Preliminary studies have since shown that this may also be the case for HATTs [2]. A computationally efficient, yet realistic, model has been developed in order to estimate the amount of induced twist present on a bend-twist coupled blade in a tidal stream. This model takes into account the effect on the induced twist of fibre orientation, blade loading and cross section, material mechanical properties, and shell thickness. The method has been incorporated into a Blade Element Momentum code, modified to predict the performance of free stream tidal devices; such that the performance of a HATT with composite bend-twist coupled blades could be estimated.

Proposed {{for use in}} helicopter rotor blade to hold otherwise freely <b>pitching</b> <b>blade</b> tip inward against centrifugal force and to apply torque about pitch axis to regulate pitching motions of tip.

40|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} techniques to reduce helicopter vibration {{is based on}} using a Higher Harmonic controller to optimally define the Higher Harmonic <b>blade</b> <b>pitch.</b> These techniques typically require solution of a general optimization problem requiring the determination of a control vector which minimizes a performance index where functions of the control vector are subject to inequality constraints. Six possible constraint functions associated with swashplate <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> control were identified and defined. These functions constrain: (1) <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> Fourier Coefficients expressed in the Rotating System, (2) <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> Fourier Coefficients expressed in the Nonrotating System, (3) stroke of the individual actuators expressed in the Nonrotating System, (4) <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> expressed {{as a function of}} blade azimuth and actuator stroke, (5) time rate-of-change of the aforementioned parameters, and (6) required actuator power. The aforementioned constraints and the associated kinematics of swashplate <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> control by means of the strokes of the individual actuators are documented...|$|R
40|$|Controllers for a {{pitch and}} a stall {{regulated}} horizontal axial flow, variable-speed tidal stream turbine are developed, and {{a performance comparison}} is carried out. Below rated flow speed, both turbines are operated in variable-speed mode so that the optimum tip-speed ratio is maintained. One of the turbines has variable <b>pitch</b> <b>blades,</b> which above rated speed are pitched to feather in order to regulate power. The other turbine has fixed <b>pitch</b> <b>blades</b> and uses speed-assisted stall to regulate power. The control system design behind both strategies is examined in MATLAB, with the performance under turbulent flows, loading and energy yield analysis being evaluated in GH Tidal Bladed. Both strategies provide a satisfactory performance, but the out-of-plane loads on the stall regulated turbine were higher over {{the entire range of}} operation. In addition, the dynamic characteristics of the stall regulated turbine require a more complex control design. The results suggest that the pitch regulated turbine would be a more attractive solution for turbine developers...|$|R
