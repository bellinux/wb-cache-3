5|$|<b>Parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> (PTH, {{known as}} parathormone) {{is a small}} protein that takes part in the control of calcium and {{phosphate}} homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. <b>Parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> in vertebrates, including PTH, PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) and tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP 39), has been proposed {{to be the result}} of two rounds of whole genome duplication in the beginning of vertebrate diversification. Bioinformatics analyses, in particular chromosomal synteny study and the characterization of the PTH ligands and their receptors from various vertebrate species, provide evidence that strongly supports this hypothesis. In this mini-review, we summarize recent advances in studies regarding the molecular evolution and physiology of the PTH ligands and their receptors, with particular focus on non-mammalian vertebrates. In summary, the PTH family of peptides probably predates early vertebrate evolution, indicating a more ancient existence as well as a function of these peptides in invertebrates...|$|R
40|$|WNK 4 (with-no-lysine (K) kinase- 4) {{is present}} in the distal nephron of the kidney and plays an {{important}} role in the regulation of renal ion transport. The epithelial Ca 2 + channel TRPV 5 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 5) is the gatekeeper of transcellular Ca 2 + reabsorption in the distal nephron. Previously, we reported that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) increases cell-surface abundance of TRPV 5 by inhibiting caveola-mediated endocytosis of the channel. Here, we report that WNK 4 decreases cell-surface abundance of TRPV 5 by enhancing its endocytosis. Deletion analysis revealed that stimulation of endocytosis of TRPV 5 involves amino acids outside the kinase domain of WNK 4. We also investigated interplay between WNK 4 and PKC regulation of TRPV 5. The maximal level of TRPV 5 current density stimulated by the PKC activator 1 -oleoyl-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) is the same with or without WNK 4. The relative increase of TRPV 5 current stimulated by OAG, however, is greater in the presence of WNK 4 compared with that without WNK 4 (∼ 215 % increase versus 60 % increase above the level without OAG). Moreover, the rate of increase of TRPV 5 by OAG is faster with WNK 4 than without WNK 4. The enhanced increase of TRPV 5 in the presence of WNK 4 is also observed when PKC is activated by <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones.</b> Thus, WNK 4 exerts tonic inhibition of TRPV 5 by stimulating caveola-mediated endocytosis. The lower basal TRPV 5 level in the presence of WNK 4 allows amplification of the stimulation of channel by PKC. This interaction between WNK 4 and PKC regulation of TRPV 5 may be important for physiological regulation of renal Ca 2 + reabsorption by <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> or the tissue kallikrein in vivo...|$|R
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone.</b> This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism.

5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. <b>Parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid {{disease is}} {{conventionally}} divided into {{states where the}} parathyroid is overactive (hyperparathyroidism), and states where the parathyroid is under- or hypoactive (hypoparathyroidism).

40|$|Introduction: Primary hyperparathyroïdism is {{observed}} in 35 to 44 subjects/ 100000 persons. The increased production of <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> is secondary to primary glandular modifications consisting mainly in adenomas. The authors report a clear-cell hyperplasia causing primary hyperparathyroidism. Observation: We report {{the case of}} a 25 -year-old man who was admitted to explore pathologic fractures of the left arm and a malignant hypercalcaemia. Complementary laboratory tests revealed primary hyperparathyroidism. A multiple endocrine neoplasia was excluded by radiologic examinations. Cervical ultra-sound examination revealed 2 parathyroid adenomas and per-operative exploration showed 3 « adenomas ». Microscopic examination of the 4 parathyroid glands specimen concluded to a clear cell hyperplasia. Conclusion: Clear cell hyperplasia is a benign cause of primary hyperparathyroidism.

40|$|Unilateral neck {{exploration}} {{for primary}} hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) {{of old and}} high risk patients can be safely performed under local anesthesia, provided there is a correct preoperative side localization of the enlarged parathyroid gland. We performed large vein sampling and measured intact <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> (PTH) with a new, highly sensitive immunoradiometric assay. The method was used before operation in 20 patients with pHPT. A unilateral positive gradient of serum PTH levels was obtained in 15 patients. At surgery, 13 of these (87 %) proved to be correct, i. e., the adenoma was localized on the same side. Thus, the technique correctly lateralized the parathyroid adenoma in 65 % of the patients. We conclude that large vein sampling with measurement of intact PTH is a potentially useful investigation for preoperative side localization of parathyroid adenomas in pHPT patients scheduled for unilateral surgery under local anesthesia. However, prior to routine bilateral neck exploration large vein sampling is not justified...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-seven unselected {{patients}} were investigated three {{to eight years}} after jejunoileal bypass for morbid obesity. The serum levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, and the renal excretions of calcium and magnesium were reduced. The serum alkaline phosphatase levels were increased. The serum levels of the two vitamin D metabolites 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 -OHD) and 1. 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D (1. 25 -(OHD) 2 D) were reduced and inversely related to the increased serum levels of immunoreactive <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> (iPTH). Serum 1. 25 -(OH) 2 D correlated positively and serum iPTH inversely with serum concentrations and renal excretion rates of calcium. Iliac crest bone biopsies after in vivo tetracycline double-labelling showed a reduced bone turnover with an increased amount of osteoid due {{to an increase in}} both surface extent and mean width of osteoid seams. The increased volume of osteoid was caused by a decreased osteoblastic function with a longer life-span of bone-forming sites and a prolongation of the mineralisation lag time. The amount of trabecular bone was normal. The results indicate an impaired vitamin D metabolism with osteomalacia and secondary hyperparathyroidism...|$|R
5|$|The major {{function}} of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands do this by secreting <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone.</b> It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E

30|$|Systemic use of non-radioactive Sr has showed {{promising}} results {{regarding the}} treatment of bone pathologies, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis [35 – 37], as it directly and positively interferes with bone mass, quality, and strength [38]. Further, in vitro {{studies have shown that}} Sr has the ability to increase bone formation [39, 40] while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation [41]. This dual action on bone remodeling, distinguishes Sr from the other traditional anti-osteoporotic agents, which either increase bone formation (intermittent <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones)</b> or inhibit bone resorption (bisphosphonates) [42]. Several mechanisms have been discussed for how systemic Sr-based therapy enhances bone formation [43 – 46]. Sr might activate the calcium-sensing (or another functionally different cation-sensing) receptor on osteoblasts, thereby leading to enhanced bone matrix production [46]. Another plausible mechanism is that Sr induces prostaglandin production and cyclooxygenase expression, thereby increasing osteoblastic differentiation [44]. Further, Sr might interact with fibroblast growth factor receptors, thereby increasing osteoblast synthetic activity [43]. At last, Sr also interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, enhancing the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in osteogenic cells [45]. In regard with interfering with bone resorption, Sr enhances osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in osteoblasts [40, 47, 48] thereby reducing osteoclastogenesis [42].|$|R

5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, which results in an overproduction of <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} also {{produces}} the hormone calcitonin, which helps regulate blood calcium levels. Parafollicular cells produce calcitonin {{in response to}} high blood calcium. Calcitonin decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into bone. The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormone</b> (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, calcitonin seems far less essential than PTH, as calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy), but not the parathyroid glands.|$|E

40|$|Vitamin D 3 {{is known}} to have {{immunosuppressive}} effects that can be beneficial for treatment of immune disorders and transplant rejection, however therapeutic application is limited due to hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria. The goal of our studies was to explore both the acute and steady state effects of vitamin D 3 on bone remodeling as potential limiting factors to broader use of vitamin D 3 in the clinic. Vitamin D 3 was evaluated for its skeletal effects in both thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTx) and intact rat models. In TPTx rats, deprivation of thyroid and <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> and calcitonin creates a low state of bone modeling and remodeling ideal for evaluation of changes imposed by drug intervention. The use of both models allowed for discrimination of individual (TPTx) versus combined (intact) effects of calciotropic hormones on bone and calcium metabolism. Our studies have confirmed the limitations of using vitamin D 3 for treatment/co- treatment of immune disease in humans due to the intrinsic hypercalcemic properties of the hormone, and also highlighted the potential of vitamin D 3 to negatively impact skeletal integrity due to excessive bone remodeling driven by bone resorption. Taken together our data emphasize the importance of including biomarkers of bone remodeling {{as an integral part of}} clinical and preclinical studies using vitamin D 3 to treat immune disorders and suggest the need for co-treatment with an antiresorptive agent to counteract hypercalcemia and deterioration of bone...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Estrogen {{deficiency}} during menopausal {{transition is}} associated with rapid bone loss. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the time of onset, the rate, and predictors of menopausal bone loss. Study design: Prospective data were analyzed from 160 Chinese women between the ages of 45 to 55 years who participated in the Hong Kong Osteoporotic Study. Main outcome measures: All participants were studied yearly for 4 years. Demographic information, menstrual status according to the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW), and lifestyle habits were recorded as well as bone mineral density (BMD) measured every visit. Baseline follicular stimulating hormone, sex <b>hormone</b> binding globulin, <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones,</b> C-terminal telopeptides of type 1 collagen, estradiol and testosterone were also measured. Results: There was no significant bone loss at the spine, femoral neck and total hip in premenopausal women. Maximal bone loss occurred within the STRAW stage - 2 and - 1. Age at menopause, baseline age, body weight and FSH were independent predictors of bone loss. Subjects in the lowest quartile of baseline body weight (61 kg). Subjects in the highest quartile of baseline FSH (> 40 IU/l) lost bone 1. 3 - 2. 3 times faster at all 3 sites compared with those in the lowest quartile (< 5. 8 IU/l). Conclusion: Strategies to retard bone loss should be stressed to middle aged women, especially those with lean body built or with early menopause, to prevent osteoporosis later on in life. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study aimed {{to examine the}} relationship between the calcaneal speed of sound and biochemical determinants of bone mass, such as sex <b>hormones,</b> <b>parathyroid</b> <b>hormones</b> and serum calcium. METHODS: Data from 549 subjects from the Malaysian Aging Male Study, which included Malay and Chinese men aged 20 years and older residing in the Klang Valley, were used for analysis. The subjects' calcaneal speed of sound was measured, and their blood was collected for biochemical analysis. Two sets of multiple regression models were generated for the total/bioavailable testosterone and estradiol to avoid multicollinearity. RESULTS: The multiple regression results revealed that bioavailable testosterone and serum total calcium were significant predictors of the calcaneal speed of sound in the adjusted model. After adjustment for ethnicity and body mass index, only bioavailable testosterone remained significant; the total serum calcium was marginally insignificant. In a separate model, the total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were significant predictors, whereas the total serum calcium was marginally insignificant. After adjustment for ethnicity and body mass index (BMI), the significance persisted for total testosterone and SHBG. After further adjustment for age, none of the serum biochemical determinants was a significant predictor of the calcaneal speed of sound. CONCLUSION: There is a significant age-dependent relationship between the calcaneal speed of sound and total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin in Chinese and Malay men in Malaysia.
