40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with coiled {{ruptured}} aneurysms with incomplete occlusion at 6 {{months are}} not only at risk for rebleed during further follow-up but also for complications of angiographic follow-up and retreatment, and for <b>progressive</b> <b>mass</b> effect by uncontrollable aneurysm growth. We assessed the frequency and outcome of all these possible aneurysm-related events in 124 patients with incompletely occluded aneurysms at 6 months during a follow-up of 419 patient-years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1994 and 2007, 901 ruptured aneurysms were coiled and 713 (79 %) had 6 -month angiographic follow-up, of which 124 were incompletely occluded (17 %). These 124 patients were followed for a mean of 41 months (median, 30 months; range, 1 - 150 months). RESULTS: During follow-up, 307 angiograms were obtained without complications. Of 124 aneurysms, 88 were retreated (71 %). Fifteen aneurysms were retreated more than once. Altogether, 124 additional treatments were performed, and no complications occurred (0 %; 95 % CI, 0. 0 - 3. 6 %). Four aneurysms rebled, causing death in 2 patients. Another 4 patients experienced <b>progressive</b> <b>mass</b> effect by growth of the coiled aneurysm, leading to death in 1. The annual event rate was 1. 9 %, the annual mortality was 0. 7 %, and the annual rebleed rate was 1. 0 % (8, 3, and 4 in 419 patient-years). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with coiled ruptured aneurysms with incomplete occlusion at 6 months, a strategy of imaging follow-up and retreatment when possible leads to a low incidence of serious adverse events. Rebleeding and <b>progressive</b> <b>mass</b> effect of the aneurysm were responsible for these events, not complications from additional treatment or angiographic follow-u...|$|R

MRI showed a soft-tissue tumor (6  ×  3  ×  4  cm) that affected {{the region of the}} right anterior costal margin, without signs of structural costal invasion.

The remaining capsular flap was mobilized into the defect and a form-stable silicone implant was utilized to cover the chest wall defect and achieve an adequate breast contour. The patient is currently in 5 th year after chest reconstruction, with satisfactory results. Neither the tumor or the symptoms recurred. Discussion: CDT is an uncommon evolution following TBA. Although it is a rare disease, thoracic and plastic surgeons must be alert to avoid misdiagnosis. Defect reconstruction is necessary, mobilizing the capsular flaps and replacing the implants in order to obtain a satisfactory outcome. Conclusion: Knowledge of this rare post-operative evolution is crucial, and early surgical intervention is warranted in order to avoid more aggressive treatment.

40|$|Discs in {{binaries}} have {{a complex}} behavior {{because of the}} perturbations of the companion star. Planet formation in binary-star systems both depend on the companion star parameters and on {{the properties of the}} circumstellar disc. An eccentric disc may increase the impact velocity of planetesimals and therefore jeopardize the accumulation process. We model the evolution of discs in close binaries including the effects of self-gravity and adopting different prescriptions to model the disc's radiative properties. We focus on the dynamical properties and evolutionary tracks of the discs. We use the hydrodynamical code FARGO and we include in the energy equation heating and cooling effects. Radiative discs have a lower disc eccentricity compared to locally isothermal discs with same temperature profile. As a consequence, we do not observe the formation of an internal elliptical low density region as in locally isothermal disc models. However, the disc eccentricity depends on the disc mass through the opacities. Akin to locally isothermal disc models, self-gravity forces the disc's longitude of pericenter to librate about a fixed orientation with respect to the binary apsidal line (π). The disc's radiative properties {{play an important role in}} the evolution of discs in binaries. A radiative disc has an overall shape and internal structure that are significantly different compared to a locally isothermal disc with same temperature profile. This is an important finding both for describing the evolutionary track of the disc during its <b>progressive</b> <b>mass</b> loss, and for planet formation since the internal structure of the disc is relevant for planetesimals growth in binary systems. The non-symmetrical distribution of mass in these discs causes large eccentricities for planetesimals that may affect their growth.

40|$|This paper reviews general {{approaches}} for applying activated carbon (AC) amendments as an in situ sediment treatment remedy. In situ sediment treatment involves targeted placement of amendments using installation options that {{fall into two}} general approaches: 1) directly applying {{a thin layer of}} amendments (which potentially incorporates weighting or binding materials) to surface sediment, with or without initial mixing; and 2) incorporating amendments into a premixed, blended cover material of clean sand or sediment, which is also applied to the sediment surface. Over the past decade, pilot- or full-scale field sediment treatment projects using AC—globally {{recognized as one of the}} most effective sorbents for organic contaminants—were completed or were underway at more than 25 field sites in the United States, Norway, and the Netherlands. Collectively, these field projects (along with numerous laboratory experiments) have demonstrated the efficacy of AC for in situ treatment in a range of contaminated sediment conditions. Results from experimental studies and field applications indicate that in situ sequestration and immobilization treatment of hydrophobic organic compounds using either installation approach can reduce porewater concentrations and biouptake significantly, often becoming more effective over time due to <b>progressive</b> <b>mass</b> transfer. Certain conditions, such as use in unstable sediment environments, should be taken into account to maximize AC effectiveness over long time periods. In situ treatment is generally less disruptive and less expensive than traditional sediment cleanup technologies such as dredging or isolation capping. Proper site-specific balancing of the potential benefits, risks, ecological effects, and costs of in situ treatment technologies (in this case, AC) relative to other sediment cleanup technologies is important to successful full-scale field application. Extensive experimental studies and field trials have shown that when applied correctly, in situ treatment via contaminant sequestration and immobilization using a sorbent material such as AC has progressed from an innovative sediment remediation approach to a proven, reliable technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} fluid-rock {{interaction}} at hydrothermal conditions were investigated by a {{detailed study of}} altered quartz diorite around a single gold-bearing quartz vein, and by experiments reacting quartz diorite with water, using a single-pass, continuous-flow system. Alteration in the natural environment produced ankerite and albite distal to the vein, and albite adjacent to it. Mass balance calculations show {{that there was a}} <b>progressive</b> <b>mass</b> loss (up to 30 %) towards the vein, due primarily to the dissolution of quartz. In experiments at 200 $ sp circ$C, SiO$ sb 2 $, Na and CO$ sb 2 $ concentrations were controlled by the dissolution of quartz, albite and ankerite. SiO$ sb 2 $ reached a steady state concentration below quartz saturation. The concentrations of Ca, Mg, Fe, and Al were buffered by the precipitation of smectite, boehmite and calcite. These experiments show that a fluid may not reach quartz saturation at 200 $ sp circ$C, especially if the infiltrating fluid contains dissolved components which can promote the formation of secondary, quartz-consuming minerals. In the experiment at 350 $ sp circ$C, the fluid reached quartz saturation almost immediately. The secondary minerals were anorthite, chlorite, boehmite, and titanite, which formed at the expense of albite, calcite, and ankerite, thereby increasing pH and releasing Na, SiO$ sb 2 $, CO$ sb 2 $ and Al to the fluid. Quartz was completely dissolved within 500 hours. The most significant conclusion from this experiment is that the progressive loss of quartz to a quartz-undersaturated fluid increases the surface area of more resistant minerals and promotes their dissolution. Investigations of both the natural and experimental systems emphasize the importance of quartz dissolution in creating porosity, and mineral reaction kinetics in controlling wall-rock alteration...|$|R
