5|$|The 25,000-seat Reynolds Arena {{was opened}} in 2003, {{at a cost}} of £18million. The first match at the new stadium was a 2–0 loss to Kidderminster Harriers on 16 August 2003. The {{attendance}} of 11,600 still stands as a record for the ground. After Reynolds left the club, the stadium had a variety of sponsored names, but it is generally known as the Darlington Arena. The capacity was restricted to just 10,000 because of county and local planning regulations, but attendances rarely reached 3,000, and in 2011, the club's receivers <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for sale. In May 2012, Darlington confirmed they would no longer play at the Arena. later that year, it was bought by Darlington Mowden Park R.F.C.|$|E

In late September 2009, Uni-Chem of South Korea announced {{its intention to}} purchase the Hynix site for solar cell manufacturing. However, this deal fell through and as of late 2012, is no longer planned. In 2015, semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom purchased the plant with plans to upgrade and reopen it.

25|$|Graden {{sent the}} film on a VHS to several {{industry}} executives in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the clip and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> on the Internet, where it {{became one of}} the very first viral videos. As Jesus vs. Santa became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series. Fox refused to pick up the series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two were initially skeptical of possible television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out successful. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids' show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned the development of the show into a series.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} was bought as a Sodoma in 1928 by Robert Wilson Reford, a Canadian industrialist and shipping magnate. In the 1930s it underwent X-ray and ultraviolet examination {{for the first}} time, led by a team which included the art historian Wilhelm Suida. He concluded that the Christ child and the landscape were by Leonardo and the remainder was by a Milanese pupil. During a loan to the New York World’s Fair in 1939 the {{painting was}} damaged and further restoration work had to be undertaken. Reford’s family <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for auction in 1972, but by then the attribution had reverted to Sodoma, inevitably resulting in a lower price than had it been accepted as a Leonardo. It was bought back by Wildenstein & Company, who arranged {{for it to be}} transferred a second time, this time onto a composite panel, in 1976. They sold the Madonna (as a Leonardo) to its current owner, an anonymous private collector, in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Baartman died {{in poverty}} in 1815 from an unknown {{inflammatory}} disease (identified possibly as Syphilis). Her body {{was sent to}} Cuvier for scientific observation. Upon receiving the body, Cuvier first made several plaster casts and a wax mold of her body, and then proceeded to dissect her. He removed her skeleton and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for display, along with a cast, in the French National Museum of Natural History. Then, he separated her brain and genitals {{from the rest of}} her body. These organs were then preserved in jars that were on display for more than 150 years, first in the National Museum of Natural History, and then in the Museum of Man following its establishment in 1937. Her remains and casts were finally taken off display in the late 1970s, following complaints from the public. The display was replaced with one relating Baartman's story {{in the context of the}} history of scientific racism.|$|E

Clare provided the opposition and were left to rue five missed goal opportunities as Tipperary claimed a 1-19 to 0-17 victory. It was Corbett's first National Hurling League medal. He made his championship debut on 3 June 2001 in a narrow 0-15 to 0-14 Munster semi-final defeat of Clare. Corbett subsequently won his first Munster medal as Tipperary defeated Limerick by 2-16 to 1-17 to take their first provincial title in eight years. On 9 September 2001 Corbett lined out in his first All-Ireland decider as Tipperary faced Galway. The westerners <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to Tipp, however, two goals by Mark O'Leary gave the Munster men the threshold to withstand a Galway comeback. With nine minutes to go Galway were only a point in arrears, however, Tipperary outscored Galway by five to three in those closing minutes. At the final whistle Tipperary were the winners by 2-18 to 2-15 with Corbett collecting his first All-Ireland medal.|$|E

[...] It built or {{supported}} Methodist churches primarily in poor areas, or {{areas that were}} being developed, including one in the building that would later house the First Roumanian-American congregation. Soon after its purchase of the Norfolk Street building, the Church Extension and Missionary Society discovered that the neighborhood had become mostly Jewish and German. By 1884, it realized [...] "the church was too big and costly to maintain", and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for sale.|$|E

He then handed the band a fragile 78rpm 10-inch acetate record. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and planned to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for auction at Sotheby's, but sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney later had the two songs digitally re-mastered and pressed 50 copies, giving them to friends as a Christmas present, although the two songs were released on 21 November 1995, as part of The Beatles Anthology (Anthology 1). McCartney later said, [...] "The strangest thing for me, listening to it, is that it's like drowning, it's like your life flashing by in front of you. From the earliest things by me and John when we used to sag off school and the earliest demo tape we ever made, to the first little record we made which was a version of John singing [...] "That'll Be The Day", and a little song of mine [...] on the other side that's never been released before." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Peng {{developed}} a personal dislike for Mao's {{efforts to promote}} his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect, infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time. In 1955–56 Peng {{was involved in a}} large number of efforts to moderate Mao's popular image, developing into a personal campaign. Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao's efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955 a draft copy of a book, The Military History of the PVA, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. In the preface of the book it was stated that [...] "the military victories of the PVA" [...] were won [...] "under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong": Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase [...] "and of Comrade Mao Zedong". In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao: Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum, saying: [...] "why take the trouble to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up?</b> What is put up now will be removed in the future." [...] When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted [...] "Long Live Chairman Mao!" [...] (literally [...] "10,000 years for Chairman Mao"), Peng addressed the soldiers, saying: [...] "You shout '10,000 years for Chairman Mao!' – does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He will not even live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!" [...] When one of Peng's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red (a song that idealizes Mao, which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution) be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, saying [...] "That is a personality cult! That is idealism!" [...] Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman, but Peng rejected them, saying: [...] "He is an old man, what is so beautiful about him?" ...|$|E
