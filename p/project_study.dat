According to the Irrawaddy Myitsone Dam Multipurpose Water Utilizing <b>Project</b> <b>study,</b> the maximum water level of the reservoir will be 290 metres. This makes for a flood zone of 766km2, compromising 47 villages.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a Pew Internet & American Life <b>Project</b> <b>study</b> {{found that}} among teens, 65% {{of men and}} 35% of women {{describe}} themselves as daily gamers. This trend {{was found to be}} stronger the younger the age group. The study found that while adult men are significantly more likely to play console games than adult women, on other platforms they are equally likely to play. But even in this area, the numbers are moving towards equality: in 2013, Nintendo reported that half of its users were women, and in 2015 another Pew study found that more American women (42%) than men (37%) owned video game consoles. In 2013, Variety reported that female participation increased with age (61% of women and 57% of males aged 45 to 64 played games).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{determine}} the ideas about <b>project</b> and <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> of teachers working at social and science branches of high schools. To accomplish this, a survey including twenty-five items about project attitudes scale and personal information was administrated to 10 social branch teachers and 15 science branch teachers working in Erzurum, Turkey. Studies of frequency, arithmetic mean, percentage, t-test and ANOVA techniques were {{used to analyze the}} obtained data. The results show that teachers are more optimistic in social branches towards <b>project</b> and <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> than those working in science branches. In addition, there is no statistically meaningful relationship among science and social science teachers’ approaches to <b>project</b> <b>studies,</b> teachers’ experiences, academic careers and project attendance. Finally, with results, suggestions on the effective usage of <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> are given...|$|R

500|$|In December 1962, HSA {{dedicated}} {{its full}} effort to developing the RAF's single seat variant; Wood notes [...] {{the starting point}} for which was broadly similar to the proposal submissions for NBMR-3. On 18 February 1963, Julian Amery, the Minister of Aviation, confirmed that the <b>project</b> <b>study</b> contract had been placed; on 25 March, Amery announced that the BS100 had been selected as the powerplant to be used on the P.1154. At this point, the program was envisioned to involve the ordering of a total of 600 aircraft, 400 for the RAF and 200 for the Royal Navy. However, as HSA carried out further work on the detailed design phase of the programme, it was becoming clear that opinions on the internal equipment for the aircraft varied substantially between the two services.|$|E

2500|$|MTS {{began work}} in March 2011 {{on a study}} to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of reconnecting Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo and Downtown San Diego through a fixed-guideway, electrified streetcar line – the final study on the subject was published in October 2012. The <b>project</b> <b>study</b> corridor runs between the City College Trolley Station area, and Balboa Park {{in the vicinity of}} the San Diego Zoo. An alignment similar to the proposed one was last served by a streetcar system in 1949 on lines 7 (Park Boulevard-University Avenue to East San Diego) & 11 (Park Boulevard-Adams Avenue to Kensington). The Committee evaluated what types of streetcars to use for this proposed line, the possible options including the recently ordered 57 Ultra Short 2011 S70s in the [...] "Modern Streetcar" [...] category, and the restored PCC Streetcars from the Downtown Silver Line in the [...] "Vintage Streetcar" [...] category. The major construction issue was how to cross I-5 without having to reconstruct the entire bridge. The estimated cost for construction of this line was $68.2 million, with each trolley car estimated to cost between $850,000 (for a restored PPC trolley car) to $3.6 million (for a modern trolley car). Four cars are anticipated for service on this line. No funding sources were identified. No further action on this proposal has taken place since the October 2012 release of the study.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} social studies teachers’ perceptions on <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> in primary schools in terms of some variables (gender, graduated faculty, years in profession, and participation to in-service training). For this purpose, a questionnaire is prepared in order to elicit opinions of 25 social studies teachers from 22 primary schools of Ministry of National Education in the province of Kastamonu about their <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> on social studies lessons. Reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was 0. 90. As a result of the survey conducted with teachers of social studies teachers, opinions of the teachers about the <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> being implemented in social studies classes do not show a statistically significant difference in terms of gender, years in profession, and participation to in-service training that they have received, but it was observed that the teachers who graduated from faculty of education have more positive views on the <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> than other social studies teachers...|$|R
