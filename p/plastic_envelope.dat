40|$|Maize (Zea mays) {{seedlings}} {{were exposed}} to elevated atmospheric pressures while growing in moist sand in open <b>plastic</b> <b>envelopes</b> to evaluate the effects of directly applied atmospheric pressure on ethylene production and root growth. Effects were evaluated after 24 h. The threshold pressures necessary to promote ethylene production and decrease root elongation were about 600 and 400 kPa, respectively. Direct atmospheric pressure, at levels up to 300 kPa, mimicked the control decrease in root diameter and increased diameter only slightly at 500 to 1200 kPa. In contrast, in previous work it was shown that physical impedance resulting from compression of the growth medium by external application of 100 kPa increased the ethylene production rate 4 -fold and the root diameter 7 -fold while reducing elongation 75 % in 10 h. The relative insensitivity of roots to direct atmospheric pressure suggests that they perceive physical impedance, achieved experimentally by compressing the growth medium, via a surface mechanism rather than via a pressure-sensing mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} influence of ribs on the ultimate capacity of a bored pile in overconsolidated clay. Ribbed bored piles are known to give increased shaft capacity in comparison to conventional straight-shafted bored piles. The investigation seeks to explore the effectiveness of ribs at increasing the ultimate capacity of a pile, and furthermore to understand how this enhanced capacity is derived. The scale pile test results are analysed using several industry standard methods. A <b>plastic</b> failure <b>envelope</b> for {{the base of the}} pile rib is identified. This <b>plastic</b> failure <b>envelope</b> is used to provide a detailed design solution for the ultimate capacity of a ribbed pile. The design solution is simple and requires a summation of the constitutive contributions from each rib and from the base and shaft of the pile. This method has been used successfully to predict the ultimate capacity of any pile tested to within ± 8 %...|$|R

40|$|Objectives:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of the degree of porosity on the release of growth factors (PDGF AA, PDGF BB, bFGF) by healing PTFE grafts. Design and setting:Laboratory animal study. Materials: 1 cm long segments of non-reinforced PTFE grafts (30 microns fibril length, 2 mm internal diameter, 0. 39 mm thick) were placed as an abdominal aortic interposition in Lewis rats. Fifteen grafts served as control (Group A; porous grafts); in eight rats (Group B; non porous grafts) the PTFE graft was completely wrapped by a non-porous <b>plastic</b> <b>envelope.</b> Animals were killed 4 weeks after surgery. Outcome measures:The release of PDGF AA, PDGF BB, and bFGF was assessed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results:The release of PDGF AA, PDGF BB and bFGF was statistically higher in porous grafts. The only histological difference between the two groups was that porous PTFE grafts were invaded by many tufts of capillaries from the surrounding tissue, whereas this phenomenon was absent in non porous PTFE grafts. Conclusions:The degree of porosity influences the release of growth factors by healing PTFE grafts. This fact may have implication in the endothelisation of PTFE grafts and in myointimal hyperplasia formation as well...|$|E
40|$|Although {{culture of}} Trichomonas vaginalis is more {{sensitive}} than wet mounts in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis, the lack of convenience of culture prevents it from being widely used. To improve the acceptability of diagnosis by culture, a <b>plastic</b> <b>envelope</b> method (PEM) was devised. PEM permits both immediate examination and culture in one self-contained system. The medium consists of dry ingredients that are reconstituted with water before use. The effectiveness of immediate examinations by PEM was {{compared with that of}} wet mounts, and the effectiveness of culture by PEM was compared with that of culture in Trichomonas Medium No. 2 (Oxoid). Of 710 vaginal secretion specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic women that were tested by the four methods, 62 (9 %) were positive for T. vaginalis. The sensitivity was 66 % by wet mount, 66 % by immediate examination by PEM, 89 % by cultures in Oxoid medium, and 97 % by culture by PEM. The two culture methods had equivalent sensitivities but were significantly (P less than 0. 0001) {{more sensitive than}} the two immediate methods. The combined immediate examination by PEM plus culture was more convenient to use than wet mounts plus culture in Oxoid medium. The long shelf-life of PEM's dry medium and its anticipated low cost are additional advantages...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{pyrethroid}} insecticides are degraded {{almost entirely by}} ultraviolet (UV) -catalysed oxidation. A bioassay using the beetle Tribolium confusum duVal caged on bandages soaked in 0. 04 % a. i. cypermethrin showed large differences in residual insecticide-life under three plastic films available for cladding polytunnels. Cypermethrin exposed to a UV film that transmitted 70 % of UVB and 80 % of UVA killed all beetles for 8 weeks, compared to only 3 weeks for cypermethrin exposed in a clear <b>plastic</b> <b>envelope.</b> Cypermethrin under a UV-absorbing film that reduced the transmission of UVB and UVA to 14 % and 50 %, respectively, gave a complete kill for 17 weeks. Reducing the transmission of UVB to virtually zero, and that of UVA to only 3 %, using a UV-opaque film prolonged the effective life of the cypermethrin residue to 26 weeks, and some beetles were still killed for a further 11 weeks. Even after this time, beetles exposed to cypermethrin from the UV-opaque treatment were still affected by the insecticide, and only showed near-normal mobility after 24 months of pesticide exposure to the UV-opaque film. These results have implications for the recommended intervals between cypermethrin treatment and crop harvest, and {{on the time of}} introduction of insect-based biological control agents, when UV-opaque films are used in commercial horticulture...|$|E

40|$|Sulfamic acid, in {{polyvinyl}} alcohol envelopes, makes {{a safe and}} convenient preservative for urine, 10 g/Iiter of urine being a satisfactory con-centration. Of several chemical procedures for urine, this preservative altered the results only for steroids. Urine samples must be acidified if accurate calcium analyses are to be obtained (1). In many institutions the nursing staff is not permitted to dispense the strong acids traditionally used to decrease the pH of urine, so that the acid must be transferred into the collection vessels in the clinical laboratory. To avoid the dangerous practice of using a caustic liquid acid as a preservative, we have enclosed a dry strong acid in a water-soluble <b>plastic</b> <b>envelope,</b> which can be included with the urine container. In this way a predetermined quantity of acid may be dispensed safely. The package may be formed from any heat-sealable water-soluble polymer film that does {{not interfere with the}} common laboratory test procedures. Several strong acids are available in dry form. Boric acid has been used extensively as a urine preservative, but it is relatively weak, and large quantities are required to decrease the pH. Sulfamic acid is a stable dry acid that is strongly acid in aqueous solution (pK 9, 1. 0). It is readily obtained in purified form and is safe to handle in water-soluble plastic envelopes...|$|E
40|$|A new <b>plastic</b> <b>envelope</b> culture {{test that}} is {{selective}} for Gardnerella vaginalis was {{compared with a}} conventional method. Vaginal specimens from 92 women were cultured. Results from both methods were compared {{with the results of}} pelvic examinations and clinic screening tests used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV). G vaginalis was isolated more often in the envelope than by the conventional method from patients with BV and those without, though the difference was not significant. Isolation and identification of G vaginalis was completed in 18 - 24 hours by the envelope method; the conventional method took a mean of 72 hours (range two to six days). Polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) occurred significantly more in specimens from the patients without BV than from those with BV. Both clue cells and a positive amine test reaction were found significantly more in specimens from patients with BV than from those without BV. Clue cells and G vaginalis isolation correlated best with BV (in 47 women), followed by clue cells and positive amine test results (in 39). Adherence of G vaginalis in the envelope also correlated more with BV, clue cells, and positive amine test results (32) than with patients without BV (14). When there were no clue cells and amine test results were negative the results correlated totally with a prediction of no BV. The use of the rapid envelope culture test would have confirmed BV in 20 % of the cases where clue cell and amine test results were discordant...|$|E
40|$|Colourful {{feathers}} {{are important}} traits in female mate choice in birds because the colour {{properties of the}} feathers are often correlated with individual condition during moult. Feather colour can change after moult, and dirt accumulation has been suggested to contribute to this variation. However, we still know little {{about the influence of}} dirt on feather colour change, possibly because it is difficult to experimentally manipulate the level of feather dirtiness. We investigated whether reflectance properties of feathers exposed to naturally deposited soil (atmospheric particle deposition such as dust, pollution and smoke) differ from feathers for which this contact was prevented. To achieve this, we compared the spectral colour of throat-breast feathers of European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, kept in the open air (dirty group) with those preserved within a <b>plastic</b> <b>envelope</b> (clean group). Before treatment and three and six weeks after the beginning of the treatment we measured the plumage reflectance of the two groups of feathers. While clean feathers did not change their reflectance spectra, the dirty group showed a reduced reflectance along the entire spectrum (300 - 700 nm). The reduction in reflectance was particularly pronounced in the UV range (300 - 400 nm). These preliminary results are consistent with the idea that feather colours are not static signals but are plastic traits. However, much work remains to determine the role of soil and air pollution in altering plumage colouration. © 2011 Unione Zoologica Italiana...|$|E

40|$|Bag stacks are a {{familiar}} feature of grain storage systems in developing countries. The conventional means of preserving grain in such bag stacks involves fumigation under a gas-tight sheet, with the gases methyl bromide or phosphine, and surface spraying with insecticides. However, if grain {{is to be}} stored for longer periods, then a new technique is available that offers considerable improvements in quality preservation. This is achieved by sealing bag stacks into air-tight <b>plastic</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Good quality preservation is ensured by introducing carbon dioxide or phosphine into the envelopes {{at the time of}} sealing. As long as the envelopes remain sealed {{there is no need to}} add further gas and quality preservation is superior to the conventional system using fumigation under gas-tight sheets. Grain can be stored in sealed stacks for periods of at least two years. As a training aid for pest control personnel their managers, the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) has produced a 20 -minute video on sealed stack storage. In addition, a poster has been prepared as an aide-memoire. The focus for these training materials is large-stack storage systems, where stocks of grain run into many hundreds of tonnes. Special attention is given to important management considerations for the planning and maintenance of sealed stack programmes and their cost-effectiveness compared with conventional techniques.

40|$|Reference {{materials}} for particulate matter (PM) on filter media {{are not available}} for the quantification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air. This {{is due to the}} difficulty of obtaining reference material that has a homogeneous distribution on a filter surface that is large enough for characterization and distribution. High volume sample filters from different locations and seasons were considered to validate the feasibility of the use of quartz filters as reference material for PAH concentrations. A rapid thermal desorption (TD) technique coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy was applied to characterise the material for the content of fifteen different PAHs. TD technique allowed for rapid and accurate analysis of small sections of filter (5 mm diameter), leaving enough material for the production of twenty sub-filter cuts (42 mm diameter) {{that could be used for}} distribution and control. Stability and homogeneity tests required for material certification were performed as indicated by the ISO guide 34 : 2009 and ISO 35 : 2006. The contribution of the heterogeneous distribution of PAHs on the filter surface resulted generally lower than 10 % and higher for more volatile PAHs. 1 year of storage at - 18 ºC indicated no significant variation in PAH concentrations. Nevertheless, a methodology for shipping and storing of the filter material at ambient temperature in especially designed <b>plastic</b> <b>envelopes,</b> was also shown to allow for stabile concentrations within twenty days. The method accuracy was confirmed by the analysis of NIST SRM 1649 a (urban dust) and PAH concentrations were validated against the reference values obtained from an inter-laboratory exercise. In case of benzo[a]pyrene for masses quantified between 100 pg and 10 ng the TD method provided expanded uncertainties of circa 10 %, while the inter-laboratory reference value uncertainties ranged between 15 and 20 %. The evaluation of these results supports the use of the presented methodology as a valid approach for the certification of PAH concentrations in PM 10 quartz filters. The methodology allows for the production of a certificate of analysis for a single high volume filter, the concentration of which can easily be adjusted by selecting an appropriate sampling location.
