40|$|Provably correct {{algorithms}} for meshing difficult domains {{in three}} dimensions have been recently developed in the literature. These algorithms handle the problem of sharp angles (< pi/ 2) between segments and between facets by constructing <b>protective</b> <b>collars</b> around these regions. The collars are approximately sized according to the local fea-ture size of the input. With the eventual goal of developing time-efficient algorithms for the same mesh generation problems, we give a method for estimating the feature size of a 3 D piecewise-linear-complex of size n on domain Ω in time O(n log∆+m), where ∆ is {{the spread of the}} in-put.

50|$|When gases are {{supplied}} in gas cylinders, {{the cylinders}} have a stop angle valve {{at the end}} on top. Often, gas cylinders are somewhat long and narrow and may stand upright on a flattened bottom at one end with the valve at the top. During storage, transportation, and handling when the gas is not in use, a cap may be screwed over the protruding valve {{to protect it from}} damage or breaking off in case the cylinder were to fall over. Instead of a cap, cylinders commonly have a <b>protective</b> <b>collar</b> or neck ring around the service valve assembly.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} to mesh an arbitrary piecewise linear complex in three dimensions. The algorithm achieves an O(n log ∆ + m) runtime where n, m, and ∆ are the input size, the output size, and spread respectively. This represents the first non-trivial runtime guarantee for {{this class of}} input. The new algorithm extends prior work on runtime-efficient meshing by allowing the input to have acute input angles (called creases). Features meeting at creases are handled with <b>protective</b> <b>collars.</b> A new procedure is given for creating these collars in an unstructured fashion, {{without the need for}} expensive sizing precomputation as in prior work. The collar surface dividing these two regions is represented implicitly using surface reconstruction techniques. This new approach allows the collar to be dynamically generated, allowing the whole algorithm to run in a single pass. For inputs with ∆ bounded by a polynomial in n, this runtime is optimal. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{model test}} {{program has been}} carried out to investigate the key ice load issues on offshore wind turbines in Danish waters. Tests were performed using a compliant structure that had scaled structural characteristics. The test program investigated seven configurations of model structures and dynamic characteristics. Both first- and second-mode vibration issues were investigated. Forty-one ice sheets were used giving information on 144 different experimental set-ups. The parameters that were changed in the tests included the ice velocity, ice thickness, shape of the structure, water level on the structure, structure stiffness and the natural frequency of the structure. Measurements were made of forces, accelerations and displacement of the model during the interaction with ice. Four different ice failure modes were identified [...] flexure, crushing, mixed mode, and lock-in. The results gave information on the anticipated ice loads and the likelihood of ice-induced vibrations for both the first-mode and second-mode vibration frequencies. They also provided guidance on the optimum angle and cone-size for a <b>protective</b> ice <b>collar</b> for the wind turbines. This paper provides the results of the model tests. A companion paper [Cold Reg. Sci. Technol., (2004) ], provides information on the application of the results to the design of an offshore wind turbine farm.

40|$|Suspended {{particulate}} matter (SPM) plumes {{associated with the}} monopile foundations of the Belgian offshore wind farm (OWF) Belwind I were acoustically profiled {{by means of a}} Doppler current profiler (ADCP). Together with the analysis of a bottom lander dataset of optical and acoustic backscatter sensors (OBSs and ADPs respectively), the spatiotemporal SPM plume dynamics were inferred. The fieldwork comprised (1) near-bed measurements of hydrodynamics and SPM concentrations in the direct vicinity of the wind turbines, by means of a bottom lander over a spring–neap cycle in May 2010; this dataset represents a typically tide-driven situation because there was no significant meteorological forcing during the measurement period; (2) additional vessel-based measurements conducted in May 2013 to capture the SPM plumes inside and outside the OWF over part of a tidal cycle. Both in situ datasets revealed that the SPM plumes were generated at the turbine piles, consistent with aerial and space-borne imagery. The SPM plumes are well aligned with the tidal current direction {{in the wake of the}} monopiles, concentrations being estimated to reach up to 5 times that of the background concentration of about 3 mg/l. It is suggested that the epifaunal communities colonizing the monopile surface and the <b>protective</b> rock <b>collar</b> at the base play a key role as source of the suspended matter recorded in the plumes. The organisms filter and trap fine SPM from the water column, resulting in predominant accumulation of SPM, including detritus and (pseudo-) faeces, at the base of the piles. When tidal currents exceed a certain velocity, fine particles in the near-bed fluff layer are re-suspended and transported downstream in the wake of the piles...|$|R

During their conquest of Latin America, Spanish conquistadors used Mastiffs to kill warriors in the Caribbean, Mexico and Peru. Mastiffs, as well as Great Danes, were used in England during the Middle Ages, where their large size was used to scare horses to throw off their riders or to pounce on knights on horseback, disabling them until their master delivered the final blow. More recently, canines with explosives strapped to their backs saw use during World War II in the Soviet Army as anti-tank weapons. In all armies, they were used for detecting mines. They were trained to spot trip wires, as well as mines and other booby traps. They were also employed for sentry duty, and to spot snipers or hidden enemy forces. Some dogs also saw use as messengers.|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{radiation}} doses {{for medical}} {{workers from the}} departments of diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine, and radiotherapy at the university hospital of King Abdul-Aziz University (KAU) were measured and analysed. A total of 100 medical radiation workers were monitored to determine the status of their average annual effective dose. The analysis and the calibration procedures {{of this study were}} carried out at the Center for Radiation Protection and Training-KAU. The monitored workers were classified into subgroups, namely, medical staff/supervisors, technicians, and nurses, according to their responsibilities and specialties. The doses were measured using thermo luminescence dosimeters (TLD- 100 (LiF:Mg,Ti)) placed over the lead apron at the chest level in all types of workers except for those in the cath lab, for whom the TLD was placed at the thyroid <b>protective</b> <b>collar.</b> For nuclear medicine, a hand dosimeter was used to measure the hand dose distribution. The annual average effective doses for diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine, and radiotherapy workers were found to be 0. 66, 1. 56, and 0. 28 mSv, respectively. The results of the measured annual dose were well below the international recommended dose limit of 20 mSv. Keywords: Occupational radiation dose, radiation workers, TLD, radiation protectio...|$|E
30|$|The thyroid {{protection}} used in {{this study}} significantly reduced the air kerma, which was assumed to be proportional to the scattering dose to the thyroid. Due to scatter, the air kerma behind the <b>protective</b> <b>collar</b> was higher than expected from the lead equivalent value (16 [*]±[*] 2 μGy in average for all patients; see Table 2). According the thickness of the lead of 0.25  mm, the incident beam was expected to be attenuated by a factor of 15.10 – 5. The dose we estimated behind the collar is in agreement with the findings reported by Ramalho et al. (18 μGy) [11]. Measurements with phantoms revealed scatter contributions (50 %) from upside (collimator system) and downside (backscatter form breast and detector system, 50 % of the total contribution; see Fig. 3, green triangle), resulting in air kerma values up to >[*] 100 μGy for 6 -cm compression at the surface of thyroid position. This value is clearly greater than the values found in the MCS but corresponds to the values we found in the patient study. In the MCS, 85 % of the dose came from backscatter of breast and detector system and only 15 % was caused by collimator scatter.|$|E
40|$|Arctic {{exploration}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} trends in today’s oil and gas industry. In shallow waters jack-up mobile drilling units are often used for drilling outside the ice season. The operating period of the jack-ups is strictly limited by the ice conditions.

Gudmestad (University of Stavanger) is considered in this thesis. The concept comprises a hull with icebreaking capabilities and four columnar legs placed on outrigger arms and equipped with protective collars so the jack-up can withstand ice loads in the early ice period. Drilling through one of the jack-up legs is suggested to protect the drill string from the ice impact. The leg should have a telescopic design so that the derrick could be skidded over it before drilling. The purpose of the thesis is to evaluate the feasibility of a concept suggested for extended drilling season in Arctic waters. The important design issues i. e. <b>protective</b> <b>collar</b> geometry, required air gap, telescopic leg design, collar fixation system etc. are discussed.

40|$|AIMS: Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the role of gender and both area-level and individual socio-economic status (SES) as independent predictors of alcohol-related aggression (ARA) in and around licensed venues. METHODS: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between gender, area-level SES and individual SES (operationalised as occupational category) and ARA in and around licensed venues. The sample comprised 697 men and 649 women aged 16 - 47, who completed a patron intercept survey as part of a larger study assessing trends in harm and stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 views surrounding local community level interventions in dealing with alcohol-related problems in the night-time economy. RESULTS: Binary logistic regression analyses showed that age, gender, occupational category, area-level SES and level of intoxication at time of interview were all significant predictors of involvement in ARA. Being male doubled the odds of involvement in ARA, while age was a <b>protective</b> factor. Blue <b>collar</b> workers had more than double the odds of ARA involvement of professionals, while those living in the most socio-economically disadvantaged areas were over twice as likely to report experiencing ARA compared to those living in the most advantaged areas. However, assessment of the predictive model by gender revealed that effects of age, occupational category and area-level SES were restricted to male participants, with greater intoxication no longer predictive. CONCLUSIONS: ARA among patrons was significantly more likely to occur among men, those in blue collar occupations, and individuals living in low SES areas, suggesting both individual and area-level disadvantage may play a role in ARA...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{radiation}} load and its impacts on the patient and doctor during the interventional medical help under skiascopy control. The content of the theoretical part describes the medical operations which are carried out, together {{with the issue of}} radiation protection within this field with regard to the medical and professional radiation exposure. The main objective of this work determines the estimation of efficient doses of the patient and doctor resulting in the conclusions leading to the decreasing level of radiation load for both parties. For these purposes one-year data were collected into the general database. The PCXMC program was used for calculating efficient doses of the patients collected from the DAP meter. Consequently, collected information regarding the dosage of the patient and doctor were elaborated in the form of charts and graphs. The conclusions were deduced on the basis of available data concluding the hypothesis related to the dependence of radiation rate on the type of medical treatment. It was proved that the highest dosage was achieved with regard to the patients during the embolic medical operations. The lowest dosage for the examining person is during PTD and nefrostomy. The doctors are maximally exposed to the radiation during the liver intervention ? especially during TIPS. The lowest doses received by the doctor were shown during the thrombolytic medical operations. The recommendation leading to the reduction of radiation load at the given workplace of interventional radiology was thus concluded from available information. Besides the correct parameter setting of the appropriate equipment, such as voltage, C-arm´s displacement or OK distance, consistent shielding is also important, especially the use of <b>protective</b> equipment (apron, <b>collars</b> and glasses) and more frequent switching shifts of the personne...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBitumen-aggregate {{adhesion}} {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} characteristics related to an asphalt mix. It affects the mix durability mainly in terms of its moisture susceptibility. Wide range of adhesion promoters is available to the market and can be used in regular practice, nevertheless usually only limited attention is paid to the long term activity (mainly the effective substances) and stability of the additives in the bitumen and the asphalt mix. Research done at the Czech Technical University in Prague is focused on studying the impact of differently aged asphalt mix using selected procedures defined in prEN 12697 - 52 as well as developing a self-defined procedure by applying the PAV equipment used since many years for long-term bitumen ageing. The results of aged mixtures were always compared to unaged control mixes. In parallel use of aged bitumen was assessed as well. The results were further compared to a simple adhesion test to get a more complex understanding of the activity of selected additives. In total more than 5 additives were selected and tested on one type of asphalt concrete with the application on a more hydrophilic aggregate type. Results gained during this experimental study are presented in the paper using as a criterion indirect tensile strength ratio determined either by EN 12697 - 12 or by modified procedure according to AASHTO T 283. In parallel because of elevated temperatures used during ageing suitable covering of cylindrical test specimens was analyzed as well to avoid unnecessary deformations or even disintegration of the tested specimens. For this reason two types of <b>protective</b> <b>collar</b> were chosen – PVC and thin steel mash – in both cases fixed by plastic belts. It is assumed that steel mash can better simulate the effect of ageing keeping the envelope partly free for direct contact with hot air and pressure. Results of this comparison are presented in this paper as well...|$|E
