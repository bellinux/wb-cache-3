40|$|We {{develop a}} {{mesoscopic}} dislocation dynamics model for vacancy-assisted dislocation climb by upscalings from a stochastic model on the atomistic scale. Our models incorporate microscopic mechanisms of (i) bulk diffusion of vacancies, (ii) vacancy exchange dynamics between bulk and dislocation core, (iii) vacancy pipe diffusion along the dislocation core, and (iv) vacancy attachment-detachment kinetics at jogs {{leading to the}} motion of jogs. Our mesoscopic model consists of the vacancy bulk diffusion equation and a dislocation climb velocity formula. The effects of pipe diffusion and the jog structure on dislocations are incorporated by a Robin boundary condition near the dislocations for the bulk diffusion equation and a new contribution in the dislocation climb velocity due to vacancy pipe diffusion driven by the stress variation along the dislocation. Our climb formulation is able to quantitatively describe the translation of prismatic loops at low temperatures when the bulk diffusion is negligible. Using this new formulation, we derive analytical formulas for the climb velocity of a straight edge dislocation and a <b>prismatic</b> <b>circular</b> loop. Our dislocation climb formulation can be implemented in dislocation dynamics simulations to incorporate all the above four microscopic mechanisms of dislocation climb.

30|$|The {{objects are}} usually picked through <b>prismatic</b> or <b>circular</b> {{precision}} grasps [24]. The prismatic precision grasp is a grasp {{in which the}} opposing faces of the target object are grasped with two fingers (or virtual fingers; as there are cases where one surface may be grasped {{by more than one}} fingers, all those fingers can be considered as one virtual finger). The circular precision grasp is a grasp in which the circumference of a spherical or cylindrical object is grasped using three fingers (or virtual fingers).|$|R

5000|$|The heading {{indicator}} works using a gyroscope, tied by an erection mechanism to the aircraft yawing plane, i. e. the plane {{defined by the}} longitudinal and the lateral axis of the aircraft. As such, any configuration of the aircraft yawing plane that does not match the local Earth horizontal results in an indication error. The {{heading indicator}} is arranged such that the gyro axis is used to drive the display, which consists of a <b>circular</b> <b>compass</b> card calibrated in degrees. The gyroscope is spun either electrically, or using filtered air flow from a suction pump (sometimes a pressure pump in high altitude aircraft) driven from the aircraft's engine. Because the Earth rotates (ω, 15° per hour, apparent drift), and because of small accumulated errors caused by imperfect balancing of the gyro, the heading indicator will drift over time (real drift), and must be reset using a magnetic compass periodically. [...] The apparent drift is predicted by ω sin Latitude and will thus be greatest over the poles. To counter for the effect of Earth rate drift a latitude nut can be set (on the ground only) which induces a (hopefully equal and opposite) real wander in the gyroscope. Otherwise {{it would be necessary}} to manually realign the direction indicator once each ten to fifteen minutes during routine in-flight checks. Failure to do this is a common source of navigation errors among new pilots. Another sort of apparent drift exists in the form of transport wander, caused by the aircraft movement and the convergence of the meridian lines towards the poles. It equals the course change along a great circle (orthodrome) flight path.|$|R

A <b>compass</b> plane is {{a plane that}} is convex, length-ways, on the underside, for {{smoothing}} the concave faces of curved woodwork. A compass saw is a narrow-bladed saw that cuts a curve. A compass timber is a curved (or crooked) timber, sometimes used in shipbuilding. A compass brick is a curved brick. A compass wall is a curved wall. A compass window is a circular bay window (or oriel window).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTIn recent practices, a half <b>circular</b> <b>prismatic</b> bar {{protruding}} {{beyond the}} concave {{surface of the}} horn facing the gap has been formed along the centerplane of a rudder to lessen the gap flow between the horn and the movable portion of the rudder system. If a flow through the gap of a rudder is reduced considerably through this approach, previous numerical studies indicate that not only the gap flow but also the rudder cavitation can be noticeably diminished. In the present study, numerical simulations on two-dimensional rudder sections were performed {{to show that the}} blocking ability of the single centre bar can be improved by the proper choice of sectional shape. Moreover, a pair of blocking bars attached symmetric to the centerplane on the opposite convex surface of the movable portion is suggested in the study as well, to circumvent the difficulties arising from the practical application of the single centre bars. The bars are placed near the outer edges of the gap easily accessible at the maximum rudder angle to allow simple installation of the device during a maintenance period of a ship. It is found that the pair of blocking bars further improves the blocking effects and application to a practical three-dimensional rudder also backs up the fact...|$|R
