5000|$|In 1982 Smirnov et al. {{reported}} {{similar results}} to that achieved by Lin in 1978. Using multimode <b>phosphosilicate</b> <b>fibres</b> pumped at 0.53 and 1.06 μm, {{they saw the}} normal Stokes components and a spectrum which extended from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. They calculated that the spectral broadening due to self-phase modulation should have been 910 cm−1, but their continuum was greater than 3000 cm−1. They concluded that [...] "an optical continuum cannot be explained by self-phase modulation alone." [...] They continued by pointing out the difficulties of phase-matching over long lengths of fibre to maintain four wave mixing, and reported an unusual damage mechanism (with hindsight this would probably be considered a very short fibre fuse). Interestingly, they note a much earlier suggestion by Loy and Shen that if the nanosecond pulses consisted of sub-nanosecond spikes in a nanosecond envelope, it would explain the broad continuum.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical investigation on applications of Raman effect in optical fibre communication {{as well as}} the design and optimisation of various Raman based devices and transmission schemes. The techniques used are mainly based on numerical modelling. The results presented in this thesis are divided into three main parts. First, novel designs of Raman fibre lasers (RFLs) based on <b>Phosphosilicate</b> core <b>fibre</b> are analysed and optimised for efficiency by using a discrete power balance model. The designs include a two stage RFL based on <b>Phosphosilicate</b> core <b>fibre</b> for telecommunication applications, a composite RFL for the 1. 6 μm spectral window, and a multiple output wavelength RFL aimed {{to be used as a}} compact pump source for fiat gain Raman amplifiers. The use of <b>Phosphosilicate</b> core <b>fibre</b> is proven to effectively reduce the design complexity and hence leads to a better efficiency, stability and potentially lower cost. Second, the generalised Raman amplified gain model approach based on the power balance analysis and direct numerical simulation is developed. The approach can be used to effectively simulate optical transmission systems with distributed Raman amplification. Last, the potential employment of a hybrid amplification scheme, which is a combination between a distributed Raman amplifier and Erbium doped amplifier, is investigated by using the generalised Raman amplified gain model. The analysis focuses on the use of the scheme to upgrade a standard fibre network to 40 Gb/s system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Boron and {{germanium}} doped highly photosensitive cladding {{is used in}} a novel {{design to}} achieve photosensitive Er/Yb doped fibres, enabling short strong gratings (length = 1 cm, reflectivity> 99 %) to be written without hydrogenation. The high absorption at 980 nm in Er/Yb fibres allows efficient pump absorption over a short device length, ideal for achieving highly efficient single frequency fibre lasers. Both single frequency Bragg grating reflector and distributed feedback lasers with slope efficiencies of 25 % with respect to launched pump power have been realised in such fibres [...] ., iii Single frequency fibre lasers using UV written fibre Bragg gratings are a very promising competing technology to semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) lasers for use in optical fibre telecommunications as well as sensor systems. They are potentially inexpensive, of high performance and tunable over the whole erbium band, as demonstrated {{in a number of}} publications [l- 3]. Two types of fibres have been used to construct such lasers: erbium-doped germanosilicate fibres and erbium/ytterbium doped <b>phosphosilicate</b> <b>fibres.</b> In an Er/Yb doped fibre, the 980 nm pump energy i...|$|R
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} chemical vapour-deposition technique, {{developed for}} the preparation of <b>phosphosilicate</b> glass <b>fibres,</b> is described. The properties of the binary phosphosilicate glass are outlined and details of preform fabrication and fibre drawing are given. Multimode graded-index fibres have been produced in lengths up to 4 km, with numerical apertures up to 0. 25, attenuations as low as 2 dB/km and with pulse dispersions of below 1 ns/km depending on the source used. Single-mode fibres have also been made with attenuations close to that of pure bulk silica at the design wavelength and with a pulse dispersion of less than 0. 1 ns/k...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} made of both the {{manufacture}} and the characteristics of low-loss cladded optical fibres {{for use in the}} telecommunications network. A description is given of the evolution of the fibre drawing technology and of the development of several types of low-loss fibre. These include fibres having core materials composed of commercially available compound glasses, a specially-produced high-purity lead glass, an organic liquid and a vapour-deposited phosphosilicate glass. Attenuation figures range from 150 dB/km to 1 dB/km respectively. The propagation characteristics of the fibres are considered and it is shown that partial excitation of multimode step-index waveguides is both advantageous and practicable. Particular emphasis is placed on an investigation of the effect on pulse dispersion of preferential mode filtering and mode conversion. The thesis includes three new measurement techniques for the characterisation of optical fibres. The first is a method for the determination of the material dispersion in phosphosilicate glass over a wide wavelength range. Resulting from the measurement it is shown that a wavelength region exists in <b>phosphosilicate</b> <b>fibres</b> where the material dispersion is zero and the loss is small. It is suggested that operation at this wavelength would be preferable to that currently envisaged for optical communications. The second is a means for evaluating the waveguide parameters of a single-mode fibre. The method relies on observations of the far-field radiation pattern and permits the simultaneous measurement of both core diameter and refractive-index difference...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the fabrication, characterisation, and {{applications}} of ytterbium: erbium codoped fibres. The fibres are fabricated by modified chemical vapour deposition (MCVD) combined with the solution doping technique. The properties of phosphate glasses are reviewed and we show that the fabrication process must be adapted {{to cope with the}} low viscosity of the phosphate glass. We identify the three major pitfalls which initially plagued the fabrication process and show how they can be avoided. We also describe how all glass double-clad fibres can be fabricated. The composition of the core glass is measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The latter technique offers sufficient accuracy to evaluate erbium and ytterbium absorption cross-sections. Raman and infrared spectroscopy are also used to gain insight into the structure of the glass. Techniques to evaluate the suitability of our fibres for efficient devices are presented and some loss mechanisms are investigated. Addition of aluminium to Er/Yb codoped <b>phosphosilicate</b> <b>fibres</b> in the region [Al]<[P] is studied {{for the first time to}} our knowledge. We show that the ternary Al/P/Si system is not a simple juxtaposition of the binary Al/Si and P/Si systems. Nevertheless, we find evidence that the rare-earths remain essentially coupled to phosphate sites for the region [Al] < [P], although addition of aluminium still appears to reduce rare-earth clustering. Finally, we present a model of Er/Yb devices based on the formalism of the rate equations, and give examples of how it can be useful to predict the effect of modifications in fibre design. To conclude we present the devices which have benefited from this work, particularly single frequency grating feedback lasers and cladding pumped lasers...|$|R
50|$|In 1987 Gomes et al. {{reported}} cascaded stimulated Raman scattering in {{a single}} mode <b>phosphosilicate</b> based <b>fibre.</b> They pumped the fibre with a Q-switched and mode-locked Nd:YAG, which produced 130 ps pulses with 700 kW peak power. They launched up to 56 kW into the fibre {{and as a result}} of the phosphorus achieved a much broader and flatter continuum than had been achieved to that point with silica fibre. A year later Gouveia-Neto et al. from the same group published a paper describing the formation and propagation of soliton waves from modulation instability. They used a 1.32 μm Nd:YAG laser which produced 100 ps pulses with 200 W peak power to pump 500 m of single mode fibre with a 7 μm core diameter. The zero dispersion wavelength of the fibre was at 1.30 μm, placing the pump just inside the anomalous dispersion regime. They noted pulses emerging with durations of less than 500 fs (solitons) and as they increased the pump power a continuum was formed stretching from 1.3 to 1.5 μm.|$|R
