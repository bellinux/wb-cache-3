50|$|The spores of Melanoleuca are 7.0-11.0 x 4.0-6.0 µm, thin-walled, ellipsoid, amyloid with ornamented warts. They {{look very}} similar to the spores of Leucopaxillus, however, Melanoleuca spores present a plage. Basidia are usually 4-spored, {{cylindrical}} to clavate. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are present or absent, if present they are urticoid, thin-walled or fusiform to lageniform, thick-walled. They can have crystals incrusted at the apex. Cystidia are very important to separate species within this genus. Pileipellis is a trichoderm, sometimes a cutis.

30|$|A {{suitable}} {{range of}} clearances based on forces, energies and sheared surfaces was 0.10 h to 0.20 h for shearing with one <b>clamp</b> (<b>parallel</b> and angled tools) and 0.15 h to 0.40 h for shearing with two <b>clamps</b> (<b>parallel</b> tools). Consequently, larger clearances {{could be used}} when shearing with two clamps than with one clamp.|$|R

5000|$|Albomagister has a tricholomatoid {{stature and}} white gills with adnexed attachment. The spores are smooth, {{thin-walled}} and inamyloid. It {{is unique in}} the Tricholomataceae due {{to the presence of}} long and conspicuous cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia, which arise from below the hymenium and are clear and thin-walled. The lamellar trama is <b>parallel</b> and <b>clamp</b> connections are present. Macroscopically, it resembles Tricholoma and Leucopaxillus, however the presence of prominent lamellar cystidia separate it from Tricholoma and the smooth inamyloid spores distinguish it from Leucopaxillus.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new strategies for detecting microRNAs (miRNAs) has become a crucial step in the diagnostic field. miRNA profiles depend greatly on the sample and the analytical platform employed, leading sometimes to contradictory results. In this work, we study the use of modified parallel tail-clamps to detect a miRNA sequence involved in tumor suppression by triplex formation. Thermal denaturing curves and circular dichroism (CD) measurements have been performed to confirm that <b>parallel</b> <b>clamps</b> carrying 8 -aminoguanine form the most stable triplex structures with their target miRNA. The modified tail-clamps have been tested as bioreceptors in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor {{for the detection of}} miRNA- 145. The detection limit was improved 2. 4 times demonstrating that a stable triplex structure is formed between target miRNA and 8 -aminoguanine tail-clamp bioreceptor. This new approach is an essential step toward the label-free and reliable detection of miRNA signatures for diagnostic purposes.

40|$|We have {{reported}} that insulin exerts two vascular actions in muscle; it both increases blood flow and recruits capillaries. In <b>parallel</b> hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic <b>clamp</b> studies, we compared the insulin dose response of muscle microvascular recruitment and femoral blood flow as well as hindleg glucose uptake in fed, hooded Wistar and fasted Sprague-Dawley rats. Using insulin doses between 0 and 30 mU � 1 � min � 1 � kg � 1, we measured microvascular recruitment at 2 hby 1 -methylxanthine (1 -MX) metabolism or contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU), and muscle glucose uptake was measured by either arteriovenous differences or using 2 -deoxyglucose. We also examined the time course for reversal of microvascular recruitment following cessation of a 3 mU � min � 1 � kg � 1 insulin infusion. In bot...|$|R

The problem is formulated {{in terms of a}} system of singular integral equations and the asymptotic behavior of the stress state near the corners is investigated.

40|$|Membrane {{potential}} measurements using fluorescent {{membrane potential}} indicator dyes report on relative changes but {{usually do not}} result in an absolute value of the measured parameter. The method developed in this paper {{is based on the}} assumption that the negatively charged bis-oxonol distributes across the cytoplasmic membrane according to the Nernst equation. It is further supposed that the fluorescence intensity measured from a given stained cell is a single-value function of the intracellular dye concentration. The protocol suggested incorporates the construction of a calibration curve (fluorescence intensity measured from stained cells vs. extracellular dye concentration). This allows the evaluation of the membrane potential in millivolts using fluorescence readings of the cells both in the depolarized state and in the state of interest. Good agreement was found between absolute membrane potential data of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by our method and results of <b>parallel</b> patch <b>clamp</b> measurements. újratöltve - BIBFORM 00492...|$|R

The aim of control is to regulate properly the {{voltage and frequency}} generation of induction machine during load power changes. A "decoupled" control technique has been proposed. The voltage and frequency have been controlled separately by means of prime torque and continuous variable capacitive impedance connected in <b>parallel</b> to generator <b>clamps.</b> Numerical results have given evidence of good performance of algorithm control in terms of steady state precision and time transient...|$|R
5000|$|The Stockbridge damper {{was invented}} in the 1920s by George H. Stockbridge, who was an {{engineer}} for Southern California Edison. Stockbridge obtained US patent 1675391 on 3 July 1928 for a [...] "vibration damper". His patent described three means of damping vibrations on lines: a sack of metal punchings tied to the line; a short length of cable <b>clamped</b> <b>parallel</b> to the main cable; and a short (30 in, 75 cm) cable with a concrete mass fixed at each end. It would be this last device that developed into the widely used Stockbridge damper.|$|R
40|$|Automated patch {{clamping}} is {{well established}} within academic research and drug discovery efforts. Still, there is a longstanding desire to have gold standard electrophysiology compatible with primary ion channel drug screening requirements. We here present a chip-based, modular approach for massively <b>parallel</b> patch <b>clamp</b> recordings. Using microstructured glass bottom microtitre plates, recordings from 384 cells are performed in an automated fashion. The recording system contains 384 patch clamp amplifiers and is integrated into existing, state-of-the-art 384 head pipetting robots, so all experiments are done in parallel, resulting in a throughput of several thousand data point per hour. Such a robust and modular approach is themselves easily integrable into HTS environment. Finally patch clamp has gone HTS! Success rates achieved are routinely over 85 %. A complete run takes less than 15 minutes. From single point application to cumulative dose responses, there are no limitations {{with the number of}} additions. Solution onset is fast, < 50 ms, current responses are highly reproducible and brief compound exposures, < 1 s, can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|DE 19809675 C UPAB: 19991221 NOVELTY - The {{apparatus}} incorporates filaments (30), clamping units (10, 20) for the filaments, and adjustable holding devices (40) for {{the hollow}} components (50). One (10) of the clamping units is positionally fixed, {{while the other}} (20) is movable relative to it. The hollow components are threadable onto the filaments. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for carrying out the above method which includes the following steps: (a) the filaments (30) are positioned <b>parallel</b> and <b>clamped</b> at their ends; (b) they are carburized if necessary and then released from their clamps; (c) the hollow components (50) are threaded and aligned onto the filaments; (d) the latter are clamped anew and connected to an electricity supply; and (e) they are heated while a gas is supplied at the same time. As a result, the component inner surfaces (51) become uniformly diamond coated. USE - For production of tubular components applicable as grinding elements. ADVANTAGE - The coating is hard and highly uniform over {{the entire length of}} the tubular component. It is of such a quality that subsequent grinding or some other mechanical process on it is unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|Present-day {{interest}} in the thermal analysis of electronic circuit boards arises {{mainly because of the}} failure of such components as a result of thermal fatigue. A thermal/structural ANSYS model was integrated in this study to enable the predictions of the temperature and stress distribution of vertically <b>clamped</b> <b>parallel</b> circuit boards that include series of symmetrically mounted heated electronic modules (chips). The board was modeled as a thin plate containing heated flush rectangular areas representing the heat generating modules. The ANSYS model was required to incorporate the effects of mixed convection on surfaces, heat generation in the modules, and conduction inside the board. Appropriate convection heat transfer coefficients and boundary conditions resulted in a temperature distribution in the board and chips. Then structural analyses were performed on the same finite element mesh with structural elements capable of handling orthotropic material properties. The stress fields were obtained and compared for the two models possessing different fiber orientations...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{two-dimensional}} <b>clamped</b> <b>parallel</b> elastic sheets {{which are}} partially immersed in liquid {{as a model}} for elasto-capillary coalescence. In the existing literature this problem is studied via minimal energy analysis of capillary and elastic energies of the post-coalescence state, yielding the maximal stable post-coalescence bundle size. Utilizing modal stability analysis and asymptotic analysis, we studied the stability of the configuration before the coalescence occurred. Our analysis revealed previously unreported relations between viscous forces, body forces, and the instability yielding the coalescence, thus undermining a common assumption that coalescence will occur as long as it will not create a bundle larger than the maximal stable post-coalesced size. A mathematical description of the process creating the hierarchical coalescence structure was obtained and yielded that the mean number of sheets per coalesced region is limited to the subset 2 ^N where N is the set of natural numbers. Our theoretical results were illustrated by experiments and good agreement with the theoretical predictions was observed...|$|R
40|$|Printed {{circuit boards}} made of {{composites}} in working environments such as avionics or transportation are susceptible of structural failure or irreversible damage under the vibration of the equipment. Structural modal/harmonic {{finite element models}} in ANSYS are integrated in this study to enable the predictions of resonance frequency shifts and failure stress for vertically <b>clamped</b> <b>parallel</b> circuit boards with inclusion of series of mounted electronic modules (chips). The board is modeled as a thin plate made of layers of E-glass composite with different fiber orientations and inter-fiber angles. Appreciable differences in maximum failure stress and resonance frequency shifts are observed by changing the above parameters in the fabrication of the boards. Mathematical approximations (metamodels) are provided to describe the complex trend of resonance frequencies in terms of angular design parameters. The model equations would simplify the parametric effects on frequency shifts and provide insight into any subsequent design optimization {{in the absence of}} access to FE codes, or readiness to devote more resources on FE analysis. Overall this study presents feasible ANSYS models that render successfully an optimal design for composite circuit boards under vibration loads, and without weight increase by modifications or material additions. This would lead to board designs that are more durable and reliable under noise, shock, and vibration loads...|$|R
