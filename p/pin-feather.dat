60|$|The Tamtonians {{are very}} proud of their form of government, which gives them so much power in {{selecting}} their rulers. This power consists in the privilege of choosing between two men whom but a few had a voice in selecting from among many millions, any one of whom the rest might have preferred to either. Yet every Tamtonian is as vain of possessing this incalculably small influence {{as if he were a}} Warwick in making kings and a Bismarck in using them. He gives himself as many airs and graces as would be appropriate to the display of an honest <b>pin-feather</b> upon the pope's-nose of a mooley peacock.|$|E
60|$|When I {{peered at}} last {{over the edge}} of the big nest, after a desperately hard climb, there was a bundle of dark gray down in a little hollow in the middle. It touched me at the time that the little ones rested on a feather bed pulled from the mother bird's own breast. I brushed the down with my fingers. Instantly two heads came up, fuzzy gray heads, with black pointed beaks, and {{beautiful}} hazel eyes, and a funny long <b>pin-feather</b> over each ear, which made them look like little wise old clerks just waked up. When I touched them again they staggered up and opened their mouths,--enormous mouths for such little fellows; then, seeing that I was an intruder, they tried to bristle their few pin-feathers and snap their beaks.|$|E

60|$|And so the gossips departed, {{leaving a}} sting under the <b>pin-feathers</b> {{of the poor}} little hen mamma, who {{began to see that}} her darlings had curious little spoon-bills, {{different}} from her own, and to worry and fret about it.|$|R
6000|$|Seated {{around her}} were {{various members of}} that rising race with which a Southern {{household}} abounds, engaged in shelling peas, peeling potatoes, picking <b>pin-feathers</b> out of fowls, and other preparatory arrangements,--Dinah {{every once in a}} while interrupting her meditations to give a poke, or a rap on the head, to some of the young operators, with the pudding-stick that lay by her side. In fact, Dinah ruled over the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron, and seemed to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to [...] "save her steps," [...] as she phrased it. It was the spirit of the system under which she had grown up, and she carried it out to its full extent.|$|R
6000|$|... "The grain {{seems to}} have {{strengthened}} him already, for see how lively he is, and how his yellow down stands out on him, so puffy and warm! You are looking for some more grain, are you? Well, you cannot have it just yet, and keep away from those pieces of eggshell, which, by the way, I will put back into the box. Now, sir, try to avoid {{the edge of the}} table, and, to quiet you, I will give you a little tap on the back with my wand. Now, then, please observe closely. The down which just now covered him has almost gone. He is really a good deal bigger, and ever so much uglier. See the little <b>pin-feathers</b> sticking out over him! Some spots here and there are almost bare, but he is ever so much more active. Ha! Listen to that! He is so strong that you can hear his beak as he pecks at the table. He is actually growing bigger and bigger before our very eyes! See that funny little tail, how it begins to stick up, and quills are showing {{at the end of his}} wings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another tap {{will take}} still {{more of the}} conceit out of him. Look at him! There are his <b>pin-feathers,</b> and his bare spots. Don't try to get away; I can easily tap you again. Now then. Here is a lovely little chick, fluffy with yellow down. He is active enough, but I shall quiet him. One tap, and {{now what do you}} see? A poor, feeble chicken, {{scarcely}} able to stand, with his down all packed close to him {{as if he had been}} out in the rain. Ah, little chick, I will take the two halves of the egg-shell from which you came, and put them on each side of you. Come, now get in! I close them up. You are lost to view. There is nothing to be seen but a crack around the shell! Now it has gone! There, my friends; as I hold it on high, behold the magic egg, exactly as it was when I first took it out of the box, into which I will place it again, with the cloth and the wand and the little red bag, and shut it up with a snap. I will let you take one more look at this box before I put it away behind the scenes. Are you satisfied with what I have shown you? Do you think it is really as wonderful as you supposed it would be?" ...|$|R

You know what a grist of years it took you to come here from the earth--and yet you were booming along faster than any cannon-ball could go. Suppose you had to fly that {{distance}} with your wings--wouldn't eternity have been over before you got here? Certainly. Well, angels {{have to go to}} the earth every day-- millions of them--to appear in visions to dying children and good people, you know--it's the heft of their business. They appear with their wings, of course, because they are on official service, and because the dying persons wouldn't know they were angels if they hadn't wings--but do you reckon they fly with them? It stands to reason they don't. The wings would wear out before they got half-way; even the <b>pin-feathers</b> would be gone; the wing frames would be as bare as kite sticks before the paper is pasted on. The distances in heaven are billions of times greater; angels have to go all over heaven every day; could they do it with their wings alone? No, indeed; they wear the wings for style, but they travel any distance in an instant by WISHING. The wishing-carpet of the Arabian Nights was a sensible idea--but our earthly idea of angels flying these awful distances with their clumsy wings was foolish.|$|R
