5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately {{was carried out by}} the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should {{have nothing to do with}} it. On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Nero then {{appointed}} Vespasian to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, who {{landed in}} Judaea with fifth and tenth legions in 67. He was later joined {{by his son}} Titus at Ptolemais, who brought with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across Galilee and by 69 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} the 384th {{regiment}} of the Russian 7th Army, helped <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Kronstadt uprising in March 1921, and {{he served as a}} platoon commander during anti-guerrilla fighting in the Caucasus in 1922. Having graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1930, Novikov moved to the air force in 1933, and served as chief of operations until 1935, when he took command of a light bomber squadron.|$|E
5|$|In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was {{the site}} of the Red River Rebellion, a {{conflict}} between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. Métis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1095, an English noble, Robert de Mowbray, who was Earl of Northumbria, {{challenged}} the bishop's {{authority in the}} north. When Mowbray rebelled again in 1095, St-Calais helped the king <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, and Mowbray was captured. The death of Malcolm and the capture of Mowbray did much to make the north more secure.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus reaped {{political}} {{benefit for}} having <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion. Both Crassus and Pompey returned to Rome with their legions {{and refused to}} disband them, instead encamping outside Rome. Both men stood for the consulship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because of his youth and lack of service as praetor or quaestor. Nonetheless, both men were elected consul for 70 BC, {{partly due to the}} implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.|$|E

5|$|The next {{rebellion}} against royal power in Transylvania {{broke out in}} 1467. Irritated by a new tax that King Matthias Corvinus had just introduced, representatives of the Three Nations concluded an alliance against the monarch and declared the three incumbent voivodes (the brothers Counts John and Sigismund Szentgyörgyi and Berthold Ellerbach) their leaders. The king <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> revolt in a week, but did not sentence the three voivodes, because their {{active role in the}} revolt was never proven.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Conqueror, Thomas was loyal to the third son, William Rufus, who had {{inherited}} England instead of the eldest brother, Robert Curthose. Thomas supported Rufus despite a rebellion led by his old mentor Odo of Bayeux, and the Archbishop accompanied the King on his campaigns to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> revolt. Thomas attended the subsequent trial for rebellion in 1088 of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, who had sided with Odo. William was Thomas' sole suffragan bishop, but it was Thomas who pronounced the sentence of the court.|$|E

They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> uprising, resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges to be brought against her of furthering the aims of the banned SACP and African National Congress (ANC), and of aiding and abetting the students' revolt.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Germany's African colonies and in Asia and the Pacific. Their service lives were generally uneventful, apart from the normal routine of colonial policing. They were both sent to German East Africa to help <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Abushiri Revolt in 188990, and Schwalbe joined the Eight Nation Alliance against the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. Both ships were decommissioned by 1911 and were thereafter used for secondary roles: Schwalbe as a training ship and Sperber as a target ship. After World War I, both vessels were sold and broken up for scrap by 1922.|$|E
5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{submission}} of the English nobles, resistance continued for several years. There were rebellions in Exeter in late 1067, an invasion by Harold's sons in mid-1068, and an uprising in Northumbria in 1068. In 1069 William faced more troubles from Northumbrian rebels, an invading Danish fleet, and rebellions {{in the south}} and west of England. He ruthlessly <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> various risings, culminating in the Harrying of the North in late 1069 and early 1070 that devastated parts of northern England. A further rebellion in 1070 by Hereward the Wake was also defeated by the king, at Ely.|$|E
5|$|In 1521, Portuguese {{explorer}} Ferdinand Magellan's expedition {{arrived in}} the Philippines, claimed the islands for Spain and was then killed at the Battle of Mactan. Colonization began when Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first Hispanic settlements in Cebu. After relocating to Panay island and consolidating a coalition of native Visayan allies, Hispanic soldiers and Latin-American recruits, the Spaniards then invaded Islamic Manila, therein they <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Tondo Conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to Guam and Guerrero. Under Spanish rule, they established Manila as {{the capital of the}} Spanish East Indies (1571).|$|E
5|$|In 1802, France sent {{most of the}} disgruntled legionnaires (two demi-brigades, 5,280 strong) to Haiti to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Haitian Revolution (on the Caribbean {{island of}} Haiti, known then as Saint Domingue, the French West Indies). Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue, but {{preferred}} to save his main French army for more important matters, closer to home.
