40|$|Access <b>policy</b> <b>violations</b> by {{organizational}} insiders {{are a major}} security {{concern for}} organizations because these violations commonly result in fraud, unauthorized disclosure, theft of intellectual property, and other abuses. Given the operational demands of dynamic organizations, current approaches to curbing access <b>policy</b> <b>violations</b> are insufficient. This study presents a new approach for reducing access <b>policy</b> <b>violations,</b> introducing both the theory of accountability and the factorial survey to the information systems field. We identify four system mechanisms that heighten an individual's perception of accountability: identifiability, awareness of logging, awareness of audit, and electronic presence. These accountability mechanisms substantially reduce intentions to commit access <b>policy</b> <b>violations.</b> These results not only point to several avenues for future research on access <b>policy</b> <b>violations</b> but also suggest highly practical design-artifact solutions {{that can be easily}} implemented with minimal impact on organizational insiders. © 2013 M.

40|$|Abstract—The {{emergence}} of new capabilities such as virtualization and elastic (private or public) cloud computing infrastructures {{has made it possible}} to deploy multiple applications, on demand, on the same cloud infrastructure. A major challenge to achieve this possibility, however, is that modern applications are typically distributed, structured systems that include not only computational and storage entities, but also policy entities (e. g., load balancers, firewalls, intrusion prevention boxes). Deploying applications on a cloud infrastructure without the policy entities may introduce substantial <b>policy</b> <b>violations</b> and/or security holes. In this paper, we present PACE: the first systematic framework for Policy-Aware Application Cloud Embedding. We precisely define the policy-aware, cloud application embedding problem, study its complexity and introduce simple, efficient, online primal-dual algorithms to embed applications in cloud data centers. We conduct evaluations using data from a real, large campus network and a realistic data center topology to evaluate the feasibility and performance of PACE. We show that deployment in a cloud without considering in-network policies may lead to a large number of <b>policy</b> <b>violations</b> (e. g., using tree routing as a way to enforce in-network policies may observe up to 91 % <b>policy</b> <b>violations).</b> We also show that our embedding algorithms are very efficient by comparing with a good online fractional embedding algorithm.

40|$|Network {{operators}} spend significant {{effort in}} ensuring that the network meets their intended policies. While re-cent work on checking reachability and isolation policies have taken giant strides in this regard, they do not handle context-dependent policies that operators implement via stateful data plane elements. To address this challenge, we present the design and implementation of BUZZ, a testing framework {{to ensure that a}} network with stateful data plane elements meets complex context-dependent policies. In designing BUZZ, we address significant chal-lenges in: (1) modeling stateful data plane elements, and (2) tackling the state-space explosion problem in gener-ating test scenarios. We also implement practical heuris-tics to resolve interference from background traffic and to localize sources of <b>policy</b> <b>violations.</b> We demonstrate the scalability of BUZZ in localizing <b>policy</b> <b>violations</b> on networks with more than 100 nodes. ...|$|R
