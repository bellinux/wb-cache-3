40|$|Background: The {{frequency}} of lymph node metastases in stage IA 2 cervical cancer {{is reported to}} range from 0 % to 9. 7 %. Treatment recommendations vary likewise from a cone biopsy to a Wertheim radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. The objective {{of this study was}} to gel insight into the true {{frequency of}} lymph node metastages and/or parametrial involvement in stage IA 2 cervical cancer. Methods: The hospital records of 48 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> 2 cervical carcinoma who registered from 1994 to 2006 were reviewed, and a literature search was performed. Results: Of 48 registered patients, 14 were confirmed to have stage IA 2. No lymph node metastases or parametrial invasion and recurrences were found. The collated literature data showed a risk of lymph node metastases of 4. 8 % (range, 0 %- 9. 7 %). The presence of adenocarcinoma and the absence of lymph vascular space invasion resulted in a low risk on lymph node metastases (0. 3 % and 1. 3 %, respectively). Parametrial involvement has not been reported. Conclusions: The risk of he selected <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> 2 cervical cancer oil lymph node metastases is low. In <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> 2 squamous cell cancer with lymph vascular space invasion, a standard pelvic lymph node dissection should be recommended.

30|$|Carcinoma of the {{endometrium}} is {{the most}} common gynecologic malignancy [1]. It is usually diagnosed as an organ-confined disease, with 5 -year disease-free survival rates of 90 % and 80 % for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stages</b> <b>IA</b> and B disease, respectively [2]. Among the clinicopathologic factors that can be evaluated pre- and intraoperatively, myometrial invasion and tumor grade are well-recognized prognostic factors and predictors of extrauterine spread [3, 4]. Although there is some debate on whether a positive peritoneal cytology worsens the prognosis in the absence of further extrauterine disease, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> organ-confined endometrial carcinoma who present with malignant cells in the peritoneal washing must be classified as stage IIIA according to the current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging classification [5].|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveAlthough {{lobectomy}} is {{the standard}} surgical procedure for operable non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), sublobar resection also has been undertaken for various reasons. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify risk factors of locoregional recurrence and poor disease-specific survival in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clinical <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC undergoing sublobar resection. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 328 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clinical <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC who underwent segmentectomy or wedge resection. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic factors were analyzed using the log-rank test as univariate analyses, and all factors were entered into a Cox proportional hazards regression model for multivariate analyses to identify independent predictors of locoregional recurrence and poor disease-specific survival. ResultsThe 5 - and 10 -year locoregional recurrence–free probabilities were 84. 8 % and 83. 6 %, respectively, and the 5 - and 10 -year disease-specific survivals were 83. 6 % and 73. 6 %, respectively. Four independent predictors of locoregional recurrence were identified: wedge resection (hazard ratio [HR], 5. 787), microscopic positive surgical margin (HR, 3. 888), visceral pleural invasion (HR, 2. 272), and lymphatic permeation (HR,  3. 824). Independent predictors of poor disease-specific survival were identified as follows: smoking status (Brinkman Index; HR, 1. 001), wedge resection (HR, 3. 183), microscopic positive surgical margin (HR, 3. 211), visceral pleural invasion (HR, 2. 553), and lymphatic permeation (HR, 3. 223). All 4 predictors of locoregional recurrence also were identified as independent predictors of poor disease-specific survival. ConclusionsSegmentectomy should be the surgical procedure of first choice in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clinical <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC who are being considered for sublobar resection.

40|$|This {{study was}} to define {{preoperative}} predictors from radiologic findings for the pathologic risk groups based on long-term surgical outcomes, in the aim to help guide individualized patient management. We retrospectively reviewed 321 consecutive <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clinical <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> lung adenocarcinoma <b>with</b> ground glass component on computed tomography (CT) scanning. Pathologic diagnosis for resection specimens {{was based on the}} 2011 IASLC/ATS/ERS classification of lung adenocarcinoma. Patients were classified into different pathologic risk grading groups based on their lymph node status, local regional recurrence and overall survival. Radiologic characteristics of the pulmonary nodules were re-evaluated by reconstructed three-dimension CT (3 D-CT). Univariate and multivariate analysis identifies independent radiologic predictors from tumor diameter, total volume (TV), average CT value (AVG), and solid-to-tumor (S/T) ratio. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) studies were carried out to determine the cutoff value(s) for the predictor(s). Univariate cox regression model was used to determine the clinical significance of the above findings. A total of 321 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clinical <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> lung adenocarcinoma <b>with</b> ground glass components were included in our study. Patients were classified into two pathologic low- and high- risk groups based on their distinguished surgical outcomes. A total of 134 patients fell into the low-risk group. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified AVG (HR: 32. 210, 95 % CI: 3. 020 - 79. 689, P< 0. 001) and S/T ratio (HR: 12. 212, 95 % CI: 5. 441 - 27. 408, P< 0. 001) as independent predictors for pathologic risk grading. ROC curves studies suggested the optimal cut-off values for AVG and S/T ratio were- 198 (area under the curve [AUC] 0. 921), 2. 9 (AUC 0. 996) and 54 % (AUC 0. 907), respectively. The tumor diameter and TV were excluded for the low AUCs (0. 778 and 0. 767). Both the cutoff values of AVG and S/T ratio were correlated with pathologic risk classification (p< 0. 001). Univariate Cox regression model identified clinical risk classification (RR: 3. 011, 95 %CI: 0. 796 - 7. 882, P = 0. 095) as a good predictor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clinical <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> lung adenocarcinoma. Statistical significance of 5 -year OS and RFS was noted among clinical low-, moderate- and high-risk groups (log-rank, p = 0. 024 and 0. 010). The AVG and the S/T ratio by reconstructed 3 D-CT are important preoperative radiologic predictors for pathologic risk grading.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the risk of late recurrence in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who remained recurrence-free for more than 5 years after resection. MethodsBetween August 1992 and December 2002, a total of 519 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC underwent complete resection at our institution. Recurrence-free probability was measured from the benchmark of 5 years after primary tumor resection to the date of first recurrence or last follow-up using the Kaplan-Meier method. ResultsOf a total of 519 patients, 434 remained recurrence-free for 5 years. Among these, 21 (4. 8 %) developed late recurrence more than 5 years after resection. Recurrence-free interval ranged from 1 to 53 months, and the median recurrence-free interval was 14 months from the benchmark of 5 years after primary tumor resection. The 5 -year recurrence-free probability from the benchmark was 93 %. Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that vascular invasion significantly influenced late recurrence (p = 0. 038). The 5 -year recurrence-free probability from the benchmark was 84 % for patients with vascular invasion and 95 % for patients without vascular invasion (p < 0. 001). ConclusionsPatients with stage IA NSCLC with vascular invasion harbor a significant risk of late recurrence more than 5 years after complete resection. In <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC with vascular invasion, 5 years without recurrence is not sufficient to conclude that NSCLC is cured.

40|$|BackgroundMost <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> {{pathologic}} <b>stage</b> <b>Ia</b> non–small cell lung carcinoma {{have a good}} prognosis, and adjuvant chemotherapy {{is currently}} not {{being used in the}} management of this stage of the disease. However, if significant negative prognostic factors become evident in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pathologic <b>stage</b> <b>Ia</b> non–small cell lung carcinoma, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> negative prognostic factors should have adjuvant treatment after surgery. MethodsWe analyzed 335 cases of pathologic <b>stage</b> <b>Ia</b> non–small cell lung carcinoma treated between 1988 and 2003 by complete resection. The pathologic <b>stage</b> <b>Ia</b> non–small cell lung carcinomas comprised 259 adenocarcinomas, 65 squamous cell carcinomas, and 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The prognostic impact of various clinical variables was investigated by the Cox proportional hazards multivariable regression model.

Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma had a significantly poorer prognosis than other non–small cell carcinomas. Multivariate analysis revealed that large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma was predictive of poorer overall survival (P =. 0200, hazard ratio 2. 787).

40|$|Introduction:Although {{lobectomy}} {{is considered}} the standard surgical treatment for stage IA non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), wedge resection or segmentectomy are frequently performed on patients who are not lobectomy candidates. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare survival among <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC, who are undergoing these procedures. Methods:Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry, we identified 3525 patients. We used logistic regression to determine propensity scores for patients undergoing segmentectomy, based on the patient’s preoperative characteristics. Overall and lung cancer-specific survival of patients treated with wedge resection versus segmentectomy was compared after adjusting, stratifying, or matching patients based on propensity score. Results:Overall, 704 patients (20 %) underwent segmentectomy. Analyses, adjusting for propensity scores, showed that segmentectomy was associated with significant improvement in overall (hazard ratio: 0. 80, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 69 – 0. 93) and lung cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio: 0. 72, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 59 – 0. 88) compared with wedge resection. Similar results were obtained when stratifying and matching by propensity score and when limiting analysis to patients with tumors sized less than or equal to 2 cm, or aged 70 years or younger. Conclusions:These results suggest that segmentectomy should be the preferred technique for limited resection of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC.

Methods:We identified 176 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pathological <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> AC who had undergone a lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection at the Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai, China, between 2000 and 2006. No patient had preoperative treatment. The histologic subtypes of all patients were classified according to the 2011 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) /American Thoracic Society (ATS) /European Respiratory Society (ERS) international multidisciplinary lung AC classification. Patients’ 5 -year overall survival (OS) and 5 -year disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses. Results:One hundred seventy-six <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pathological <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> AC had an 86. 6 % 5 -year OS and 74. 6 % 5 -year DFS.

40|$|Abstract Background Surgery {{can cure}} a {{significant}} percentage of ovarian carcinoma confined to the pelvis. Nevertheless, there is still a 10 – 50 % recurrence rate. We administered paclitaxel/carboplatin as adjuvant treatment in early-stage ovarian carcinoma. Methods <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stages</b> <b>Ia</b> or Ib, Grade 2 or 3 and Ic to IIb (any grade) were included. <b>Patients</b> were treated <b>with</b> 4 cycles of Paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 and Carboplatin [area under the curve (AUC) 6 (Calvert Formula) ] every 3 weeks. Results Sixty-nine <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> no residual disease following cytoreductive surgery and minimal or modified surgical staging were included in this analysis.

40|$|Introduction:The {{appropriate}} {{therapeutic strategy}} and postoperative management for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) still remain {{a matter of}} debate because of the prognostic heterogeneity of this population, including the risk of cancer recurrence. The objective of the current study was to identify the clinicopathological factors that affect overall prognosis and cancer recurrence of stage IA NSCLC. Methods:We reviewed the data of 532 patients in whom complete resection of stage IA NSCLC had been performed. Overall survival and recurrence-free proportion (RFP) were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. RFP was estimated from the date of the primary tumor resection to the date of the first recurrence or last follow-up. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the independent prognostic factors. Results:On multivariate analyses, three variables were shown to be independently significant recurrence risk factors: histological differentiation (hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 925), blood-vessel invasion (HR = 1. 712), and lymph-vessel invasion (HR = 1. 751). On subgroup analyses combining these risk factors, the 5 -year RFP was 91. 3 % for patients with no risk factors, 79. 5 % for those with either poorly differentiated carcinoma or vascular invasion, (p < 0. 001 for both), and 62. 9 % for those with both poorly differentiated carcinoma and vascular invasion (p = 0. 068). Conclusion:These results indicated that vascular invasion and tumor differentiation {{have a significant impact on}} the prediction of cancer recurrence in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> NSCLC.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the incidences of LNM in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> 2, IB 1, and IIA 1 {{cervical}} {{squamous cell cancer}} were 0  % (0 / 8), 17.4  % (36 / 207), and 29.5  % (18 / 61), respectively. The result {{is similar to the}} previous studies that LNM in cervical cancer was found in 0 – 20.3  % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> 2 -IB 1 and in 16 – 38.6  % of patients with stage IIA 1 (Hongladaromp et al. 2014; Togami et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2015). In patients without LNM, the number of removed lymph nodes in pelvic lymphadenectomy was not associated with 5 -year disease-free survival (Suprasert et al. 2012). But there are some long-term postoperative complication of pelvic lymphadenectomy, the overall incidence of symptomatic postoperative lymphocysts was 34.5  % (Achouri et al. 2013), and the incidence of lower-limb lymphedema increased over time, 12.9  % at 1  year, 20.3  % at 5  years, and 25.4  % at 10  years (Hareyama et al. 2015), both of which significantly harmed the quality-of-life. However, compared to undergoing open surgery, pelvic lymphadenectomy had a less impact on patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, less blood loss, a lower transfusion rate, less lymphocele infection and other complications (Xiao and Zhang 2015; Bogani et al. 2014). Nevertheless, it means more than 60  % of patients in early stage cervical cancer without LNM will derive no benefit from pelvic lymphadenectomy and that it may be safely avoided in such patients. It is important to identify factors associated with the risk of LNM to reduce unnecessary pelvic lymphadenectomy.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether lymph node metastases or prognosis can be predicted by initial serum Cyfra 21 - 1, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) levels in squamous cell cervical cancer. METHODS: Pretreatment serum levels of 92 <b>patients</b> were correlated <b>with</b> clinicopathologic parameters and prognostic data. The clinical performance of the tests was evaluated by their receiver operating characteristic curves. The prognostic power of the variables was assessed using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Serum levels of each marker were significantly related to tumor stage, size, and depth of infiltration. The clinical performance of each marker in predicting lymph node metastases or parametrial involvement was poor. In the stepwise Cox regression analysis, regarding <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> early <b>stage</b> cervical cancer (stage Ib/IIa, n = 63), tumor size (P = 0. 0005) was the only independent prognostic factor for disease-free interval. Lymph node status (P = 0. 0014), tumor size (P = 0. 004), and parametrial involvement (P = 0. 025) were independent risk factors for survival. Considering all <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stages</b> <b>Ia</b> through IVb disease, tumor size (P = 0. 0001) and TPA level (P = 0. 026) were independent risk factors for disease-free interval, whereas tumor size (P = 0. 0001) and parametrial involvement (P = 0. 0002) were risk factors for survival. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment Cyfra 21 - 1, TPA, and SCC-Ag levels were strongly related to tumor burden, but insufficiently reliable for identifying patients at risk of the presence of lymph node metastases or parametrial involvement. Serum levels of each marker showed no independent prognostic value in early stage cervical cance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} different treatment modalities used in microinvasive adenocarcinoma (AC) of the uterine cervix (FIGO stage IA 1 and IA 2), and review the literature. METHODS: Medical and histopathological records of 38 patients treated for microinvasive AC of the cervix were studied retrospectively, and compared with the literature. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients had stage IA 1 and nine stage IA 2 cancers. Treatment modalities ranged from radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) to conization only. Eighteen patients underwent a conization, including two <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> 2 disease, of whom 11 had 18 pregnancies in total, resulting in 13 live births, two terminations and three spontaneous abortions. In two patients a hysterectomy was performed after pregnancy. No recurrences were noted during an average follow-up of 72 months. In the literature 1565 patients were reported. Of the 814 patients undergoing PLND, 12 had positive nodes. Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) was present in 25 patients, all without node involvement. None of the 356 described parametria were involved. Twenty-nine recurrences occurred. In total, 21 pregnancies with 16 live births occurred in those patients treated to preserve fertility. CONCLUSIONS: There is no uniformity {{in the treatment of}} microinvasive AC of the uterine cervix. For stage IA 1 disease, conization seems to be safe and PLND is only recommended where LVSI is present. Although the number of reported cases is small, for stage IA 2 disease, conization with PLND in case of LVSI seems advisable. More studies are desirable to define the optimal treatment for patients with microinvasive AC of the cervix, especially with regard to those <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> 2 disease...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveUsing a {{national}} cancer registry, we determined the postoperative survival of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> non–small cell lung {{cancer in the}} United States from 1988 to 1997 and identified factors that affect survival. MethodsWithin the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program database, 10, 761 patients were identified as having stage IA non–small cell lung cancer and underwent curative surgical resection from 1988 to 1997. Univariate analyses were performed by the log–rank test to determine predictors of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed by a Cox regression model. ResultsOverall 5 -year survival was 58 %. On univariate analysis, tumor size, gender, age, and extent of resection were significant predictors of survival. Five-year survival of patients with tumors 2. 1 to 3. 0 cm was lower than that for patients with tumors 2. 0 cm or smaller: 55 % versus 60 % (P <. 0001). Men faired significantly worse than women, with a 5 -year survival of 53 % versus 63 % (P <. 0001). Patients older than {{the median age of}} 67 years had worse 5 -year survival than had those under the median age: 52 % versus 65 % (P <. 0001). Patients undergoing sublobar resections showed poorer 5 -year survival than patients undergoing anatomic resections: 44 % versus 61 % (P <. 0001). On multivariable analysis with a Cox regression model, all 4 variables remained statistically significant. ConclusionThe survival of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> non–small cell lung cancer within the United States is significantly worse than survival reported from single-institution studies. This study identifies 4 factors that may affect survival in resected stage IA non–small cell lung cancer: tumor size, gender, age, and extent of resection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimTo {{assess the}} role of {{fertility}} preserving surgery in treatment of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA,</b> G 1 or G 2 ovarian carcinoma without adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients and methodsFrom 2006 to 2008, a prospective non-randomized study recruited 150 women, with suspicious early malignant ovarian mass. ResultsAmong the 150 explored patients, only 43 (28. 6 %) patients underwent exploration. Only 32 / 150 (21. 3 %) patients had proven stage IA, either G 1 or G 2, epithelial ovarian cancer. Among the 32 patients, 22 (68. 7 %) patients were nullipara while 10 (32. 1 %) had one child. All patients had unilateral tumors; 26 (81. 25 %) patients had G 1 and 6 (18. 75 %) patients had G 2 tumors; 24 / 32 (75. 0 %) tumors were serous, 6 / 32 (18. 7 %) were mucinous and 2 / 32 (6. 2 %) were endometrioid, and none was clear cell type. The median follow up period was 58. 5 months (ranged: 48 – 72 months). Two patients (6. 7 %) were lost during follow up; data will be presented for the remaining 30 patients. One patient, at 27 th month of follow up, had open abdominal exploration to investigate abnormal pelvic mass on routine ultrasound follow up examination. Frozen section revealed recurrent invasive mucinous tumor. She underwent radical surgery with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, and remained free of disease, for the remaining 29 months of the follow up period. Neither distant metastases nor mortality were reported among our patients. ConclusionFertility preserving surgery {{can be considered a}} safe treatment strategy in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>stage</b> <b>IA,</b> G 1 or G 2 ovarian carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Bone marrow {{involvement}} by Hodgkin lymphoma is rare {{with an average}} incidence of 10 %. However, the incidence of bone marrow involvement {{has been shown to}} be less than 1 % in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> clinical <b>stage</b> <b>IA</b> or IIA disease. The involvement of the marrow in a <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> Hodgkin lymphoma represents stage IV disease. We report our experience wherein three cases of marrow involvement were picked up on bone marrow aspirates/ -imprints and confirmed on trephine biopsy. In this paper we wish to highlight the significance of bone marrow examination in the initial diagnosis and staging of even clinically early stage Hodgkin lymphoma.
