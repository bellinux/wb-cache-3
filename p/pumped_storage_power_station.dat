40|$|Abstract- Due to {{the opening}} or closing of circuit {{breakers}} and disconnect switches in Gas Insulated Substations (GIS), especially in the <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> Very Fast Transient Over-voltages (VFTO) are generated. This paper describes the 500 kV and 750 kV GIS. The variations of VFTO magnitudes {{at different points in}} 500 kV and 750 kV GIS during different switching operations have been calculated and compared by using Mat lab/Simulink. In this paper the effective factors on the level of VFTO is investigated and the beneficial approaches for the industry to finding the optimum approaches for VFT mitigation is presented. These factors are included residual charges, resistance, spark resistance and entrance capacitance of transformer. the range of 4 to 100 ns, and are normally followed by oscillations having frequencies in the range of 1 to 50 MHz. During the operation of the DS, a small capacitor connecting to the breaker will be switched. The velocity of DS contacts is small (generally more than 0. 6 s), before the completely switching, the arc reignition or prestrike occurs, which is the main cause of VFTO.
