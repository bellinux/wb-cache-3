Since retinoic acid can induce ectopic <b>polarizing</b> activity, we examined whether this molecule {{plays a role in}} the establishment of the endogenous zone of <b>polarizing</b> activity, Grafts of wing bud mesenchyme treated with physiologic doses of retinoic acid had weak <b>polarizing</b> activity but inclusion of a retinoic acid-exposed apical ectodermal ridge or of prospective wing bud ectoderm evoked strong <b>polarizing</b> activity, Likewise, <b>polarizing</b> activity of prospective wing mesenchyme was markedly enhanced by co-grafting either a retinoic acid-exposed apical ectodermal ridge or ectoderm from the wing region, This equivalence of ectoderm-mesenchyme interactions required for the establishment of <b>polarizing</b> activity in retinoic acid-treated wing buds and in prospective wing tissue, suggests a role of retinoic acid in the establishment of the zone of <b>polarizing</b> activity, We found that prospective wing bud tissue is a high-point of retinoic acid synthesis. Furthermore, retinoid receptor-specific antagonists blocked limb morphogenesis and down-regulated a <b>polarizing</b> signal, sonic hedgehog.

25|$|First {{note that}} a quarter-wave plate always {{transforms}} circularly <b>polarized</b> light into linearly <b>polarized</b> light. It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the linearly <b>polarized</b> light that {{is determined by the}} orientation of the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate and the handedness of the circularly <b>polarized</b> light. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> light entering the polarizer is transformed into linearly <b>polarized</b> light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the linear polarizer and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> light would have been transformed into linearly <b>polarized</b> light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer, which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked.|$|E
50|$|In New York City, {{he invented}} the first {{inexpensive}} filters capable of <b>polarizing</b> light {{which he called}} Polaroid film.

25|$|Unpolarized {{light can}} be {{described}} as a mixture of two independent oppositely <b>polarized</b> streams, each with half the intensity. Light is said to be partially <b>polarized</b> when there is more power in one of these streams than the other. At any particular wavelength, partially <b>polarized</b> light can be statistically described as the superposition of a completely unpolarized component and a completely <b>polarized</b> one. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarization and the parameters of the <b>polarized</b> component. That <b>polarized</b> component {{can be described}} in terms of a Jones vector or polarization ellipse, as is detailed above. However, in order to also describe the degree of polarization, one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.|$|E
