50|$|The {{reaction}} {{begins with}} the excitation {{of a pair of}} chlorophyll molecules similar to those in the bacterial reaction center. Due to the presence of chlorophyll a, as opposed to bacteriochlorophyll, photosystem II absorbs light at a shorter wavelength. The pair of chlorophyll molecules at the reaction center are often referred to as P680. When the photon has been absorbed, the resulting high-energy electron is transferred to a nearby <b>phaeophytin</b> molecule. This is above and {{to the right of the}} pair on the diagram and is coloured grey. The electron travels from the <b>phaeophytin</b> molecule through two plastoquinone molecules, the first tightly bound, the second loosely bound. The tightly bound molecule is shown above the <b>phaeophytin</b> molecule and is coloured red. The loosely bound molecule is to the left of this and is also coloured red. This flow of electrons is similar to that of the bacterial reaction center. Two electrons are required to fully reduce the loosely bound plastoquinone molecule to QH2 as well as the uptake of two protons.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a direct}} {{correlation}} between pollution and theabundance and distribution of lichen. Foliose lichens are extremely sensitiveto sulphur dioxide, which is a by-product of atmospheric pollution. Sulphurdioxide reacts with the chlorophyll in lichen, which produces <b>phaeophytin</b> andmagnesium ions. When this reaction occurs in plants the lichen will then haveless chlorophyll causing a decrease in respiration which eventually kills thelichen (Hill 831-836).|$|E
50|$|Pheophytin or <b>phaeophytin</b> (abbreviated Pheo) is a {{chemical}} compound {{that serves as}} the first electron carrier intermediate in the electron transfer pathway of Photosystem II (PS II) in plants, and the photosynthetic reaction center (RC P870) found in purple bacteria. In both PS II and RC P870, light drives electrons from the reaction center through pheophytin, which then passes the electrons to a quinone (QA) in RC P870 and RC P680. The overall mechanisms, roles, and purposes of the pheophytin molecules in the two transport chains are analogous to each other.|$|E

50|$|A {{photosynthetic}} reaction centre is {{a complex}} of several proteins, pigments and other co-factors that together execute the primary energy conversion reactions of photosynthesis. Molecular excitations, either originating directly from sunlight or transferred as excitation energy via light-harvesting antenna systems, give rise to electron transfer reactions along {{the path of a}} series of protein-bound co-factors. These co-factors are light-absorbing molecules (also named chromophores or pigments) such as chlorophyll and <b>phaeophytin,</b> as well as quinones. The energy of the photon is used to excite an electron of a pigment. The free energy created is then used to reduce a chain of nearby electron acceptors, which have subsequently higher redox-potentials. These electron transfer steps are the initial phase of a series of energy conversion reactions, ultimately resulting in the conversion of the energy of photons to the storage of that energy by the production of chemical bonds.|$|E
50|$|When an {{electron}} rises {{to a higher}} energy level, there is a corresponding decrease in the reduction potential of the molecule in which the electron resides occurs. This means that the molecule has a greater tendency to donate electrons, which {{is key to the}} conversion of light energy to chemical energy. In green plants, the electron transport chain has many electron acceptors including <b>phaeophytin,</b> quinone, plastoquinone, cytochrome bf, and ferredoxin, which result finally in the reduced molecule NADPH and the storage of energy. The passage of the electron through the electron transport chain also results in the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) from the chloroplast's stroma and into the lumen, resulting in a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP using the ATP synthase molecule. Both the ATP and NADPH are used in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon dioxide into triose sugars.|$|E
50|$|The D1 and D2 {{proteins}} {{occur as}} a heterodimer that form the reaction core of PSII, a multisubunit protein-pigment complex containing over forty different cofactors, which are anchored in the cell membrane in cyanobacteria, and in the thylakoid membrane in algae and plants. Upon absorption of light energy, the D1/D2 heterodimer undergoes charge separation, and the electrons are transferred from the primary donor (chlorophyll a) via <b>phaeophytin</b> to the primary acceptor quinone Qa, then to the secondary acceptor Qb, which like the bacterial system, culminates {{in the production of}} ATP. However, PSII has an additional function over the bacterial system. At the oxidising side of PSII, a redox-active residue in the D1 protein reduces P680, the oxidised tyrosine then withdrawing electrons from a manganese cluster, which in turn withdraw electrons from water, leading to the splitting of water and the formation of molecular oxygen. PSII thus provides a source of electrons that can be used by photosystem I to produce the reducing power (NADPH) required to convert CO2 to glucose.|$|E

Both field and laboratory studies were employed to identify important seasonal sources and sinks of DOC in these two ecosystems.

Regression analyses of DOC and ancillary parameters suggested that major DOC sources changed seasonally in the Bays. In spring months (February-April), surface DOC was negatively correlated with distance- 1 from Boston Harbor (r 2 = 0. 26, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and positively correlated with <b>phaeophytins</b> (r 2 = 0. 23, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001).

40|$|There {{are many}} details about limnological {{parameters}} which may jeopardise {{the use of}} satellite images to estimate them. Two or the major factors affecting surface water quality, suspended sediments and chlorophylls, produce visible changes in reflected solar radiation. However, depending on the concentration, the mineral suspended sediments in the euphotic zone can mask completely the spectral response due to the chlorophyll. Another problem is the degradation products of the chlorophylls, the <b>phaeophytins,</b> which are structurally so similar to chlorophyll that absorb red light at the same wavelengths. Since both pigments occur in fresh watre in variable amounts and from two different origens (autochthonous and allochthonous), {{it is impossible to}} determine the spectral influence of each pigment in the radiance registered by satellite. The intention {{of this paper is to}} meet some of these aspects in order to help decision-makers wheather they should use or not satellite images to estimate limnological parameters like algal biomass and trophic state.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether global warming affects phytopigments within Symbiodinium spp. of coral is central to understanding the process of coral bleaching. In this study, corals A cropora hyacinthus, Porites solida, and Favites complanata were exposed to elevated temperatures (28, 30, 32, and 34 o C) for 48 h and the responses of Symbiodinium chl a, chl c, total carotenoids, total <b>phaeophytins,</b> and fucoxanthins were examined. In A. hyacinthus, the phytopigment concentrations at 28 and 30 o C were significantly different from 32 and 34 o C, implying a step-function response initiated between 30 and 32 o C. In P. solida, all phytopigments varied significantly between the temperatures, except {{in the case of}} total carotenoids which had no significant response. In F. complanata, all phytopigments decreased linearly as temperature increased.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of experiments to determine the influence of selected physico-chemical factors - oxygen, visible light and temperature - on the decomposition of (1) chlorophylls a, b and c, chlorophyll a derivatives and beta-carotene in acetone solution, and (2) chlorophyll a and beta-carotene in axenic cultures of the blue-green algae Anabaena variabilis. The results indicate that both in acetone extracts and in blue-green algae cultures these pigments were most sensitive to light and oxygen; temperatures of up to 25 o C had no marked influence on these compounds. Under anoxia in acetone solution, the stability towards light decreased in the order chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophylls c. Chlorophyll a, moreover, was less stable than its derivatives - phaeophorbides, <b>phaeophytins,</b> pyrophaeophytins and steryl chlorins - but more stable than beta-carotene, in the last case also in the blue-green algae cultures. Decomposition of all the pigments proceeded mainly via the breakdown of the porphyrin macrocycle, since the decomposition products were not detected in the VIS range. On the basis of these experiments one can state that while light and oxygen may have a decisive direct influence on the distribution of chlorophylls and beta-carotene in sediments, in the natural environment, temperatures of up to 25 o C may have very little immediate effect...|$|R

In addition, the biomonitor performance of Tillandsia capillaris Ruiz & Pav. f. capillaris was studied {{in relation to the}} accumulation of heavy metals and to its physiologic response to air pollutants. A sampling area of 50, 000 km 2 was selected in the central region of the Argentine Republic. This area was subdivided into grids of 25 x 25 km. Pools of T. capillaris, where present, were collected at each intersection point. From each pool three sub-samples were analyzed independently. Furthermore, five replicates were collected at 20 % of the points in order to analyze the variability within the site. The content of Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn, Pb and Zn was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Chemical-physiological parameters were also determined to detect symptoms of foliar damage. Chlorophylls, <b>phaeophytins,</b> hydroperoxy conjugated dienes, malondialdehyde and sulfur were quantified in T. capillaris. Some of these parameters were used to calculate a foliar damage index. Data sets were evaluated by one-way ANOVA, correlation analysis, principal component analysis and mapping. Geographical distribution patterns were obtained for the different metals reflecting the contribution of natural and anthropogenic emission sources. According to our results it can be inferred that Fe, Mn and Co probably originated in the soil.

Ni showed mainly an anthropogenic origin, with higher values found in places next to industrial centers. For Zn the highest values were in areas of agricultural development. The same was observed for Cu, whose presence could be related to the employment of pesticides.

40|$|Joint {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} isotope measurements {{were made from}} chlorins (chlorophyll a, <b>phaeophytin</b> a and pyrophaeophytin a) extracted from the last glacial-interglacial transition sediments of Lake Suigetsu, central Japan. These data highlight both the potential and difficulty of using chlorin-specific isotopes to track aquatic change from lake sediments. δ 13 C and δ 15 N of the three chlorins show coherent patterns with time, supporting the theory that <b>phaeophytin</b> a and pyrophaeophytin a are early diagenetic products of chlorophyll a and that despite this transition, their isotopic signatures remain intact. However, our {{data suggest that the}} isotopic composition of <b>phaeophytin</b> a and pyrophaeophytin a can be imprecise proxies for the isotope composition of chlorophyll a, possibly owing to the complex array of factors which affect the synthesis, transformation and sedimentation of these phaeopigments in nature. The total accumulation of organic matter in Lake Suigetsu appears to be controlled by the balance of allocthonous and authocthonous material as reflected by the C/N ratio. However, both bulk organic and chlorin-specific δ 13 C show similar changes, suggesting that the first order variability in bulk organic δ 13 C reflects aquatic change. By contrast, there is no similarity between chlorin and bulk δ 15 N, suggesting that interpretation of bulk δ 15 N in this setting is compromised by diagenetic alteration. The isotopic composition of chlorins are interpreted to reflect the response of aquatic primary productivity to post-glacial environmental change. However, further research into the synthesis and transformation of chlorins in the modern environment is required in order to facilitate a more rigorous approach to interpreting isotope ratios in chlorins extracted from sediments...|$|E

Its formation under the conditions used suggests that the reduction of the C- 3 vinyl substituent, required for transformation of chlorophyll a to a number of sedimentary porphyrins and chlorins, is a process which involves anaerobic bacterial communities...|$|E
40|$|The fruticose lichen Ramalina ecklonii (Spreng.) Mey. and Flot was transplanted to 28 {{biomonitoring}} {{sites in}} Córdoba, Argentina. Pigments, hydroperoxy conjugated dienes, malondialdehyde, soluble protein and sulphur were quantified in the lichen samples. The biomonitoring sites were determined according to different environmental conditions: traffic, industries, buildings, trees and altitude. Redundancy analysis (RDA) {{was applied to}} detect the variation of the pattern on the lichen variables that can be «best» explained by the environmental variables considered. The quantified chemical parameters that showed variations were sulphur accumulation, <b>phaeophytin</b> a concentration, soluble protein concentration and the phaeophytina/chlorophyllaand chlorophyllb/chlorophyllaratios. The biomonitor chemical response {{was associated with the}} emission sources in the area, and also with some of the environmental variables such as the presence of trees, buildings and altitude, that affect the spread of pollutants...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the water quality in an urban eutrophic reservoir in Northeastern Brazil, considering the influence of seasonality. Monthly, samples were collected in the sub-surface reservoir. The following abiotic variables were analyzed: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, apparent color, turbidity, conductivity, fluoride, total nitrogen, chlorides, total dissolved solids, total hardness, iron, copper, manganese, aluminum, chlorophyll-a and <b>phaeophytin.</b> Total and thermotolerant coliforms were analyzed according to APHA (2012). Cyanobacteria density was quantified through its biomass. The {{data were analyzed using}} one- way ANOVA and Pearson correlation test. Higher values mean phytoplankton biomass (26. 3 mm 3. L– 1) occurred in the dry season, especially Planktothrix agardhii and Geiterinema amphibium, which occurred in 100 % of samples. High trophic state index was detected throughout the year. Seasonality exerted some influence on both biotic and abiotc variables, leading to changes in water quality of the reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Transparent exopolymer {{particle}} (TEP) {{concentrations were}} {{measured in the}} turbidity maximum (ETM) region of Chesapeake Bay during eight research cruises over a two-year period. TEP concentrations ranged from 2500 µg XG eq l- 1 and accounted for an estimated average of 31 % ± 14 of POC. Spatially averaged TEP and chl-a concentrations were positively correlated over the two-year period, although these parameters were rarely correlated within cruises. Peak TEP concentrations were often separated from chl a maxima, suggesting that formation and concentration processes are more responsible for TEP concentrations than the proximity to precursor source material. Significant correlations between TEP and <b>phaeophytin,</b> POC, DOC, TSS and level of stratification were observed during some sampling periods. Settling tube experiments revealed {{a positive correlation between}} TEP concentration and the fraction of settling particulate matter. A hypothetical model fo...|$|E
40|$|Aspidochirotida are {{distributed}} through the reef flat of Heron Island, contributing 34 - 44 g wet biomass per square metre. On the reef flat, feeding by Holothuria edulis and Stichopus chloronotus is concentrated on sediments 2 - 5 cm from coral outcroppings, while Holothuria atra and Holothuria leucospilota feed at 5 - 16 cm from coral outcroppings. Reef flat sediments actively fed upon by Aspidochirotida {{do not differ}} significantly (p> 0. 05) in total organis, chlorophyll a, or <b>phaeophytin</b> from sediments not fed upon. Spatial variation in the apparent food quality of sediment is low and probably does {{not contribute to the}} distribution of Aspidochirotida on the reef flat. In the lagoon, Aspidochirotida are highly aggregated around the bases of coral patch reefs, where their biomass is 214 g wet weight per square metre. Biomass of Aspidochirotida approaches zero beyond 15 m from coral patch reefs. Sediments at the bases of coral patch reefs in the lagoon do not differ in total organic, chlorophyll a, or <b>phaeophytin</b> from sediments at 20 m distant. However, sediments at the bases of coral patch reefs contain significantly more protein and are significantly skewed toward the coarser grain sizes (phi - 1. 5 to 1. 0). This suggests either that Aspidochirotida in the lagoon aggregate in areas of higher quality sediment, or that intense feeding by Aspidochirotida alters the composition of sediment near coral patch reefs. Most Aspidochirotida feed continuously. Holothuria atra, H. edulis, H. leucospilota and Stichopus variegatus do not exhibit any diel rhythm in feeding or the passage of sediment through the gut, whereas S. chloronotus demonstrates a clear diel rhythm, extending oral tentacles more frequently and passing more sediment late in the day. The aggregated spatial distribution of Aspidochirotida, and the spatial separation of some species, is not driven by resource availability and niche partitioning, but rather some other factor, such as the availability of shelter...|$|E
40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, {{we investigated}} {{the effect of}} five individual Fe-binding ligands: <b>phaeophytin,</b> ferrichrome, desferrioxamine B (DFOB), inositol hexaphosphate (phytic acid), and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) on the Fe(II) photoproduction using seawater of the open Southern Ocean. Addition of 10 - 100 nM Fe(III) to open Southern Ocean seawater without the model ligands and containing; 1. 1 nM dissolved Fe(III), 1. 75 +/- 0. 28 equivalents of nM Fe of natural ligands with a conditional stability constant (log K) of 21. 75 +/- 0. 34 and a concentration DOC of 86. 8 +/- 1. 13 M C leads {{to the formation of}} amorphous Fe(III) hydroxides. These amorphous Fe(III) hydroxides are the major source for the photoproduction of Fe(II). The addition of the model ligands changed the Fe(II) photoproduction considerably and in various ways. <b>Phaeophytin</b> showed higher Fe(II) photoproduction than ferrichrome and the control, i. e., amorphous Fe(III) hydroxides. Additions of phytic acid between 65 and 105 nM increased the concentration of photoproduced Fe(II) with 0. 16 nM Fe(II) per nM phytic acid, presumably due to the co-aggregation of Fe(III) and phytic acid leading via an increasing colloidal surface to an increasing photoreducible Fe(III) fraction. DFOB and PPIX strongly decreased the photoproduced Fe(II) concentration. The low Fe(II) photoproduction with DFOB confirmed reported observations that Fe(III) complexed to DFOB is photo-stable. The PPIX hardly binds Fe(III) in the open Southern Ocean seawater but decreased the photoproduced Fe(II) concentration by complexing the Fe(II) with a binding rate constant of k(Fe(II) PPIX) = 1. 04 x 10 (- 4) 1. 53 x 10 (- 5) s(- 1) nM(- 1) PPIX. Subsequently, PPIX is suggested to act as a photo sensitizing producer of superoxide, thus increasing the dark reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Our research shows that the photochemistry of Fe(III) and the resulting photoproduced Fe(II) concentration is strongly depending on the identity of the Fe-binding organic ligands and that a translation to natural conditions is not possible without further characterization of the natural occurring ligands.
