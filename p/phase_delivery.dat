40|$|Breaking {{bad news}} is a complex and {{frequent}} clinical task for physicians working in oncology. It can {{have a negative impact}} on patients and their relatives who are often present during breaking bad news consultations. Many factors influence how the delivery of bad news will be experienced especially the communication skills used by physicians. A three-phase process (post-delivery <b>phase,</b> <b>delivery</b> phase, pre-delivery phase) has been developed to help physician to handle this task more effectively. Communication skills and specific breaking bad news training programs are both necessary and effective. A recent study conducted in Belgium has shown their impact on the time allocated to each of the three phases of this process, on the communication skills used, on the inclusion of the relative in the consultation and on physicians' physiological arousal. These results underscore the importance of promoting intensive communication skills and breaking bad news training programs for health care professionals.

40|$|The {{location}} management {{ability of a}} mobile agent system which enables a mobile agent to interact with others accurately by message passing beyond doubts stands important for the mobile agent system. At present, the {{location management}} of mobile agent consists of tracking <b>phase</b> and message <b>delivery</b> <b>phase,</b> both of which dutifully create or incur plenty of update messages and interaction messages separately in order to guarantee the effectiveness of mobile agent location management scheme. However, the transmission of messages not only affects the overall performance of mobile agent location management scheme, but also causes the network overhead. Previous studies have devoted to achieve a balance of the trade-off between the costs in tracking <b>phase</b> and message <b>delivery</b> <b>phase</b> in designing a mobile agent location management scheme. This paper argues that the interaction messages in message <b>delivery</b> <b>phase</b> produce the major overhead of overall performance.

40|$|Objectives: A liquid chromatographic-tandem {{mass spectrometric}} method (LC-MS/MS) for {{determination}} of opiates, cocainics and amphetamines, without time-consuming sample pre-treatment was developed. The method used acid deproteinization and on-line solid phase extraction followed by LC-MS/MS. Methods: The system {{consisted of two}} pumps for mobile <b>phase</b> <b>delivery</b> (Alliance 2795 and 1525 Micro, Waters), a six-port switching valve, a pre-column (Oasis HLB, Waters) and a reversed phase column (C 18 Atlantis, Waters). The analytes were trapped on the pre-column, and after the valve was switched, the retain analytes were flushed on the analytical column for chromatographic separation. The total analysis time for a single analysis run was 16 minutes. The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Results: The method was accurate and precise across a linear dynamic range of 2, 5 to 200 ng/mL, and of 5 to 200 ng/mL for glucuronides. The detection limits ranged from 0, 2 to 1, 3 ng/mL depending on the analyte, and from 1, 5 to 2, 5 ng/mL for glucuronide metabolites. Conclusion: The present method allowed on-line clean-up and enrichment, leading to improved sensitivity. This LC-MS/MS method proved to be suitable for the quantification of opiates and glucuronide metabolites, amphetamines, cocainics, buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, in plasma, serum, whole blood or urine...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{design and}} test a {{wideband}} multi-channel amplifier system for time reversal (TR) microwave hyperthermia, {{operating in the}} frequency range 300 MHz- 1 GHz, enabling operation in both pulsed and continuous wave regimes. This is to experimentally verify that adaptation of the heating pattern with respect to tumour size can be realised by varying the operating frequency of the antennas and potentially by using Ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse sequences instead of pure harmonic signals. Materials and methods: The proposed system consists of 12 identical channels driven by a common reference signal. The power and phase settings are applied with resolutions of 0. 1 W and 0. 1 degrees, respectively. Using a calibration procedure, the measured output characteristics of each channel are interpolated using polynomial functions, which are then implemented into a system software algorithm driving the system feedback loop. Results: The maximum output power capability of the system varies with frequency, between 90 and 135 W with a relative power error of +/- 6 %. A phase error {{in the order of}} +/- 4 degrees has been achieved within the entire frequency band. Conclusions: The developed amplifier system prototype is capable of accurate power and <b>phase</b> <b>delivery,</b> over the entire frequency band of the system. The output power of the present system allows for an experimental verification of a recently developed TR-method on phantoms or animals.

40|$|Metal-based {{drugs are}} largely undeveloped in pharmacology. One {{limiting}} {{factor is the}} systemic toxicity of metal-based compounds. A solid-phase, sequestratable delivery agent for local delivery of metals could reduce systemic toxicity, facilitating new drug development in this nascent area. Amorphous peroxotitanates (APT) are ion exchange materials with high affinity for several heavy metal ions, and have been proposed to deliver or sequester metal ions in biological contexts. In the current study, we tested a hypothesis that APT are able to deliver metals or metal compounds to cells. We exposed fibroblasts (L 929) or monocytes (THP 1) to metal-APT materials for 72 h in vitro, then measured cellular mitochondrial activity (SDH-MTT method) to assess the biological impact of the metal-APT materials vs. metals or APT alone. APT alone did not significantly affect cellular mitochondrial activity, but all metal-APT materials suppressed the mitochondrial activity of fibroblasts (by 30 - 65 % of controls). The concentration of metal-APT materials required to suppress cellular mitochondrial activity was below that required for metals alone, suggesting that simple extracellular release of the metals from the metal-APT materials was not the primary mechanism of mitochondrial suppression. In contrast to fibroblasts, no metal-APT material had a measurable effect on THP 1 monocyte mitochondrial activity, despite potent suppression by metals alone. This latter result suggested that 'biodelivery' by metal-APT materials may be cell type-specific. Therefore, it appears that APT are plausible solid <b>phase</b> <b>delivery</b> agents of metals or metal compounds to some types of cells for potential therapeutic effect...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the mechanism of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in javelin throwing and javelin throwing techniques relevant to this ACL injury. Methods: The patient in this study was an elite female javelin thrower who completed the first three trials and sustained a non-contact ACL injury on her left knee in the fourth trial of javelin throwing during a recent track and field meet. Three-dimensional kinematic data were collected in the injury and non-injury trials. The kinematic data of 52 male and 54 female elite javelin throwers were obtained from a javelin throwing biomechanical database. Results: The patient had greater forward center of mass velocity and less vertical center of mass velocity after the first 25 % of the <b>delivery</b> <b>phase</b> in the injury trial compared to non-injury trials. The patient had less left knee flexion angle and angular velocity but similar left knee valgus and internal rotation angles during the first 21 % of the <b>delivery</b> <b>phase</b> in the injury trial compared to non-injury trials. The video images showed an obvious tibia anterior translation at the 30 % of the <b>delivery</b> <b>phase</b> in the injury trial. The left knee flexion angle and angular velocity at the time of the left foot landing and the maximal left knee flexion angle during the <b>delivery</b> <b>phase</b> were not significantly correlated to the official distance for 52 male and 54 female elite javelin throwers. Conclusion: The ACL injury in this study occurred during the first 30 % of the <b>delivery</b> <b>phase,</b> most likely during the first 25 % of the <b>delivery</b> <b>phase.</b> A stiff landing of the left leg with a small knee flexion angle was the primary contributor to this injury.

40|$|Gene {{transfer}} {{has many}} potential applications in basic and applied sciences, including functional genomics, gene therapy, and tissue engineering. Substrate- mediated delivery, also termed solid <b>phase</b> <b>delivery,</b> describes the immobilization of DNA, complexed with nonviral vectors, to a biomaterial or substrate that supports cell adhesion. A critical component {{to this process}} is designing the appropriate interactions between the DNA complexes and substrate. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate gene transfer as a function of i) complex formation and deposition conditions and ii) non-specific and specific binding interactions between the complexes and substrate. The volume and time of complex formation, and incubation time and volume were investigated for their effects on transfection efficiency. While nonspecific immobilization strategies have been used to enhance transfection in vitro, translating the substrate-mediated delivery approach to biomaterials for in vivo applications requires that the complexes be more effectively retained at the biomaterial surface. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold were used to study the mechanisms of transfection by complexes nonspecifically immobilized on chemically specific substrates, to determine appropriate biomaterial surface properties for efficient gene delivery. Surface hydrophilicity and ionization were found to mediate both immobilization and transfection. Furthermore, the ability of specifically tethered complexes to mediate transfection was investigated. DNA, complexed with polyethylenimine (PEI), was covalently linked to SAMs presenting appropriate functional groups through a fraction of the functional groups available on the PEI present in the complex. Complexes were directly coupled to the SAMs through degradable and non-degradable tethers. Covalently tethered complexes provide an approach to retain the complexes at the surface, particularly following exposure to serum. SAMs provide a versatile approach to identify covalent tethering strategies with the potential to be translated to biomaterial surfaces for use in tissue engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|Developing systems {{capable of}} {{controlled}} and efficient gene transfer {{is a fundamental}} goal of biotechnology, with applications including functional genomics, gene therapy, and tissue engineering. Substrate-mediated delivery, also termed solid <b>phase</b> <b>delivery,</b> describes the immobilization of DNA, complexed with nonviral vectors, to a biomaterial or substrate through specific or nonspecific interactions. Cells cultured on the substrate are exposed to elevated DNA concentrations within the local microenvironment, which enhances transfection. We investigated transfection resulting from DNA complexes immobilized to a substrate through specific interactions introduced through complementary functional groups on the vector and surface or through nonspecific interactions. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold were used to provide a controlled surface to investigate transfection following specific and non-specific immobilization. DNA, complexed with polyethylenimine (PEI), was immobilized to SAMs through nonspecific mechanisms or covalently linked to SAMs presenting appropriate functional groups through {{a fraction of the}} functional groups available on the PEI present in the complex. Nonspecific immobilization of DNA complexes and subsequent transfection was mediated by the hydrophilicity and ionization of the substrate, while covalent tethering resulted in immobilized quantities similar to nonspecific conditions, but provided no transfection. Subsequent studies incorporated polyethylene glycol (PEG) -terminated alkanethiols into the SAMs to reduce nonspecific complex adsorption. Covalent tethering of complexes to PEG/carboxylic acid monolayers resulted in statistically less complex immobilization and no transfection. Nonspecific immobilization to monolayers containing 40 % PEG resulted in statistically less DNA complexes immobilized, but substantially greater transfection. Cell adhesion was not affected at this percentage of PEG. Similarly, the addition of Pluronic block copolymers (of polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide) to surfaces also enhanced transfection. We hypothesize that the presence of PEG in the monolayer may better preserve complex conformation upon binding to substrates, thereby enhancing the activity of substrate-mediated delivery of DNA complexes...|$|E
