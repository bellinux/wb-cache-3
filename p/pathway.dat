40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graph-based algorithm for identifying complex metabolic <b>pathways</b> in multi-genome scale metabolic data. These complex <b>pathways</b> are called branched <b>pathways</b> {{because they can}} arrive at a target compound through combinations of <b>pathways</b> that split compounds into smaller ones, work in parallel with many compounds, and join compounds into larger ones. While most previous work has focused on identifying linear metabolic <b>pathways,</b> branched metabolic <b>pathways</b> predominate in metabolic networks. Automatic identification of branched <b>pathways</b> {{has a number of}} important applications in areas that require deeper understanding of metabolism, such as metabolic engineering and drug target identification. Our algorithm utilizes explicit atom tracking to identify linear metabolic <b>pathways</b> and then merges them together into branched metabolic <b>pathways.</b> We provide results on two well-characterized metabolic <b>pathways</b> that demonstrate that this new merging approach can efficiently find biologically relevant branched metabolic <b>pathways</b> with complex structures...|$|R

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a <b>pathway</b> is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the <b>pathway</b> (the flux through the <b>pathway).</b> For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic <b>pathway,</b> then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the <b>pathway.</b>|$|E

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic <b>pathway.</b> This catabolic <b>pathway</b> consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the <b>pathway</b> catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E

5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} <b>pathway</b> in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic <b>pathway.</b> This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a <b>pathway</b> without being released into solution. Channeling can make a <b>pathway</b> more rapid and efficient {{than it would be}} if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{biological}} <b>pathways</b> have been assembled in later years, and are being stored in databases.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} that during brain development, emerging thalamocortical (TC) and corticothalamic (CT) <b>pathways</b> converge in some brain regions and follow each other's trajectories to their final destinations. Corpus callosal (CC) <b>pathways</b> also emerge {{at a similar}} developmental stage, and are known to converge with TC <b>pathways</b> in specific cortical regions in mature brains. Given the functional relationships between TC and CC <b>pathways,</b> anatomical convergence of the two <b>pathways</b> are likely important for their functional integration. However, it is unknown (1) where TC and CT subcortically converge in the human brain, and (2) where TC and CC converge in the cortex of the human brain, due to the limitations of non-invasive methods. The goals {{of this study were}} to describe the spatio-temporal relationships {{in the development of the}} TC/CT and CC <b>pathways</b> in the human brain, using high-angular resolution diffusion MR imaging (HARDI) tractography. Emerging cortical, TC and CC <b>pathways</b> were identified in postmortem fetal brains ranging from 17 gestational weeks (GW) to 30 GW, as well as in vivo 34 – 40 GW newborns. Some <b>pathways</b> from the thalami were found to be converged with <b>pathways</b> from the cerebral cortex as early as 17 GW. Such convergence was observed mainly in anterior and middle regions of the brain until 21 GW. At 22 GW and onwards, posterior <b>pathways</b> from the thalami also converged with cortical <b>pathways.</b> Many CC <b>pathways</b> reached the full length up to the cortical surface as early as 17 GW, while <b>pathways</b> linked to thalami (not only TC axons but also including <b>pathways</b> linked to thalamic neuronal migration) reached the cortical surface at and after 20 GW. These results suggest that CC <b>pathways</b> developed earlier than the TC <b>pathways.</b> The two <b>pathways</b> were widespread at early stages, but by 40 GW they condensed and formed groups of <b>pathways</b> that projected to specific regions of the cortex and overlapped in some brain regions. These results suggest that HARDI tractography has the potential to identify developing TC/CT and CC <b>pathways</b> with the timing and location of their convergence in fetal stages persisting in postnatal development...|$|R
