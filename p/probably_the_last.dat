5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were still largely intact. During the next hundred years city and town walls across England began to be demolished to make way for new developments, and Worcester proved no exception. By {{the end of the century}} the walls and gates were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> to be demolished, early in the 19th century. Only a few tracts of wall survived, often concealed behind other buildings and new constructions.|$|E
5|$|Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed {{greatly to}} the {{rebuilding}} of the cathedral, {{as evidenced by the}} inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). <b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.|$|E

5|$|Ambondro mahabo was {{described}} {{from the middle}} Jurassic (Bathonian, about 167million years ago) of northwestern Madagascar in 1999. It is known from a single lower jaw fragment with three teeth, <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> premolar and first two molars. The molars have been interpreted as showing the tribosphenic pattern that is characteristic of modern mammals; Ambondro is the oldest known mammal with such a pattern. This led its discoverers to propose that the ancestors of tribosphenic mammals arose in the south (Gondwana), not, as generally assumed, in the north (Laurasia). In 2001, however, paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo and colleagues alternatively proposed that Ambondro {{was part of a}} clade with Ausktribosphenos from the Cretaceous of Australia and the monotremes that developed tribosphenicity independently from other mammals (Boreosphenida). This clade, Australosphenida, has since been expanded with more recently discovered species from Argentina (Asfaltomylos and Henosferus) and Australia (Bishops). Other paleontologists have disagreed with this interpretation and proposed different models; for example, in 2001 Denise Sigogneau-Russell and colleagues proposed that although Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were related, Ambondro was not and was in fact more similar to boreosphenidans, and in 2003 Michael Woodburne and colleagues excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to placentals. The deposits that produced Ambondro have yielded some reptiles, but no other mammals.|$|E

25|$|An anti-Soviet guerrilla {{movement}} {{known as}} the Metsavennad ("Forest Brothers") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48. It {{is hard to tell}} how many people were in the ranks of the Metsavennad; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000–35,000 people. <b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.|$|E

That mine was connected through an underground tunnel with the now shut-down (since 1994) salt mine Kochendorf in Bad Friedrichshall. Extraction had extended the Heilbronn mine far to the west so that in 2004 a new shaft, Konradsberg, was added — <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> mining shaft that was constructed in all of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Trearne House {{had been}} built about 1870, almost on the 'footprint' of an older mansion house. Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick lived for some time in Burnhouse Manor until their new house was ready for them. By 1877 Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick {{were living in the}} new Trearne. Jenny Kerr was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> person born at Trearne Lodge; her mother was living there with her parents when her father was a Lieutenant in the Glasgow Highlanders, and was {{fighting}} in France during the first World War. Over Hessilhead was on the Trearne Estate along with Hessilhead, Townend of Hessilhead and an estate saw mill with its water wheel driven by the Dusk Water. During WW2 Trearne House was used by the army, following which it became Gresham House Boarding School. The school had a cook, a matron and five or six teachers up. There would be about thirty boys in the private boarding school, many of whom had parents who worked abroad.|$|E
25|$|Though Nocedal {{calibrated}} all {{his political}} activity according to religious principles {{and though he}} intended to be the Church’s most loyal son, he enjoyed significant support only amongst lower parochial vasco-navarrese clergy and in Compaña de Jesus. His relations with the hierarchy were a series of misgivings. The episcopate, keen to stay on good terms with all governments, were alienated by intransigent Integrist strategy and clear anti-establishment profile of the party. Denied the exclusive Catholic license, Nocedal {{more often than not}} clashed with the bishops on politics-related issues. When in early 20th century Vatican changed its strategy, the new semi-democratic format of policy-making suited Integros even less. Nocedal vehemently opposed the related malmenorismo; the ensuing public debate triggered the 1906 encyclical, Inter Catolicos Hispaniae, while nuncio Rinaldini blamed Nocedal for failure of a grand Catholic coalition. Though at this point even the Jesuits turned away from Integrism, as <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> political initiative of his life Nocedal joined forces with the Carlist pundit Juan Vázquez de Mella and set up Alianza Católico-Antiliberal, a diehard electoral platform he did not endure to test.|$|E

25|$|Malevich {{exhibited}} {{his first}} Black Square, {{now at the}} Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, at the Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in Petrograd in 1915. A black square placed against the sun appeared {{for the first time}} in the 1913 scenery designs for the Futurist opera Victory over the Sun. The second Black Square was painted around 1923. Some believe that the third Black Square (also at the Tretyakov Gallery) was painted in 1929 for Malevich's solo exhibition, because of the poor condition of the 1915 square. One more Black Square, the smallest and <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last,</b> may have been intended as a diptych together with the Red Square (though of smaller size) for the exhibition Artists of the RSFSR: 15 Years, held in Leningrad (1932). The two squares, Black and Red, were the centerpiece of the show. This last square, despite the author's note 1913 on the reverse, is believed to have been created in the late twenties or early thirties, for there are no earlier mentions of it.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the 1666 hearth tax survey, Ordsall Hall was the largest house in Salford, with 19 hearths. The Oldfield family of Leftwich, near Northwich, bought the estate {{at the end of the}} 17th century, and in 1704 it was sold again, to John Stock, a trustee of Cross Street Chapel. His family were <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> owners to reside at the hall. The Stocks lived in the hall's central section, {{comprising}} [...] "a large hall, lounge dining room, a chapel, six rooms on a floor, with brewhouse, large courts, stable, etc", while the two wings were leased tenants from about 1700. In 1756 the hall was sold to Samuel Hill of Shenstone, Staffordshire. Two years later, on Hill's death, the house passed to his nephew, Samuel Egerton of Tatton.|$|E

Shenton explained that the stalker had a key to Mitzeee's flat and had been watching her every move, and said that [...] "not only has the stalker come back, but they've come back {{on a whole new}} level". Shenton added that at this point [...] "Mitzeee definitely has no idea that it's Mercedes - in fact, Mercedes is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> person that she'd suspect.

On 5 June, she suffered through another typhoon, Louise, this one with [...] winds. Five days later, she bombarded Minamidaitō. 1 July saw the Third Fleet and Massachusetts set course for Japan; the battleship protected carriers while they launched raids on Tokyo, then moved closer to land to hit targets with gunfire. Massachusetts attacked Japan's second largest iron and steel center, Kamaishi on Honshū, on 14 July; Hamamatsu on 28 July; and Kamaishi on 9 August.
