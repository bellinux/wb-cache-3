Following a short flying refresher he was posted to Ottawa and placed in charge of the <b>personnel</b> <b>branch</b> where he was responsible for documenting Canadians with First World War experience in the RAF then recruiting them into the provisional air force and setting up an air training centre at Camp Borden. By 1924, the Canadian Air Force had grown sufficiently to acquire permanent status as a component of the new Department of Defence. On 1 April 1924, Canada's national air force was accorded royal assent and officially established as the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E

25|$|The PNGDF {{originated}} from the Australian Army land {{forces of the}} Territory of Papua New Guinea before independence, coming into being in January 1973 and having its antecedents in the Pacific Islands Regiment. At independence it numbered 3,750 all ranks, while another 465 Australian personnel augmented the force to assist in training and technical support. In the mid 1990s, the PNG economy was in crisis with financial support provided by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the proviso of economic reform with the first phase in 1996 to include defence. Successive attempts {{to reduce the size}} of the PNGDF in response to the country's economic problems provoked fierce resistance. In 2000, the World Bank and the IMF provided loans with economic reform conditions and a Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group (CEPG) report recommended to government that the PNGDF strength be reduced by more than half. In March 2001, soldiers mutinied after learning the government had approved the CEPG report. The government capitulated after 10 days to the mutineers' demands, agreeing not to cut the army's strength. However, in 2002 it was announced that the PNGDF would be reduced from 4,000 to around 2,100 personnel. In early 2004 the government reaffirmed its commitment to implement cuts within the armed forces, with a definitive restructuring expected to take place. Chief of Staff Captain Aloysius Tom Ur told troops in January 2004 that the 2004 strength of 3,000 would be reduced by one-third, and that during 2004, the force's <b>personnel</b> <b>branch</b> would merge with the support branch into a new organisation. Ultimately the reduction-in-size target was reached in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Bell was {{appointed}} to the RAAF's <b>Personnel</b> <b>Branch</b> as Staff Officer (Administrative) with the probationary rank of section officer (acting flight officer) on 24February 1941, in order to [...] "get the organisation going". Formally established on 25March, the WAAAF was the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in Australia, predating similar organisations in the Army and Navy. Bell led the WAAAF for {{the first three months of}} its existence, recruiting approximately two hundred women by June; of the first six officers she appointed, five were former members of the WATC. On 21May 1941, Berlei corporate executive Clare Stevenson {{was appointed}} Director WAAAF with Bell as her Deputy Director, effective from 9June. The Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, chose Stevenson on the basis of her management background and because she was not a [...] "socialite". Notwithstanding her aviation experience and familiarity with the RAAF, he considered Bell to be [...] "tangled up with the WATC", where she [...] "waved the flag and obtained a great deal of publicity for herself". [...] She may also have alienated Burnett by not including his daughter Sybil-Jean, a founding member of the WAAF, among the initial intake of staff.|$|E
500|$|Hely became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 28March 1960, {{taking over}} from the acting AMP, Air Commodore Frank Headlam. Responsible for the <b>Personnel</b> <b>Branch</b> of the RAAF, the {{position}} of AMP occupied {{a seat on the}} Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS). The Air Force expanded greatly during Hely's term as AMP, owing to Australia's increasing commitment to the security of South East Asia, and the most significant rearmament program the RAAF had undertaken outside of World WarII. Its permanent establishment increased from a steady 15,000 or so in the 1950s to over 18,000 by 1966. Hely himself initiated a scheme to attract staff from the Royal Air Force, which was suffering cutbacks, by opening a recruitment office in London and taking advantage of the Australian government's assisted passage scheme to import trained personnel and their families. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1964 New Year Honours for his [...] "tactful and careful handling of personnel matters", and for having [...] "done much to improve the manning level of the Air Force". As AMP, Hely put forward proposals {{to increase the number of}} diploma-qualified engineering and equipment officers in the Air Force. He was also closely involved in deliberations concerning the balance of academic and military studies at the RAAF Academy (previously RAAF College), the outcome of which is considered to have left the course biased towards pure science, rather than its applications to air power.|$|E
