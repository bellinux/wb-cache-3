50|$|In general, {{males are}} larger than females. A male's head-body length ranges from 46 to 65 cm in length. A female's head-body length ranges from 46 to 58 cm in length. The tail length of the gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> is on average from 66 to 68 cm in length. The male gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> weighs an average of 9.5 kg.

50|$|The yellow-tailed <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> (Oreonax flavicauda) is a New World monkey {{endemic to}} Peru. It {{is a rare}} primate species found only in the Peruvian Andes, in the {{departments}} of Amazonas and San Martin, as well as bordering areas of La Libertad, Huánuco, and Loreto. The yellow-tailed <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> was at first under the Lagothrix genus along with other <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys,</b> but due to debatable primary sources, they {{have been placed in}} Oreonax. Oreonax has been proposed to be a subgenus of Lagothrix, but others have acknowledged it to be a full genus. A recent extensive study proves that the yellow-tailed <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> may indeed be in Lagothrix.|$|R
40|$|Several {{reports have}} {{indicated}} {{the presence of}} type-C viral antigens in human tumors and of viruses closely related {{to those of the}} <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> and gibbon ape in cultured human cells. In the present studies, attempts to detect <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> viral antigens in human tissues, or antibodies directed against structural polypeptides of <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> viruses in human sera, were unsuccessful, In contrast, it was possible to demonstrate viral antigens in tissues and antibodies reactive to viral components in several animal and even primate model systems. Further evidence against the presence of <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> viruses in humans is our failure to identify spontaneous or chemically induced viruses of this group in more than 200 individual cultures of human origin examined. These findings argue against the likelihood that viruses closely related to the <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> virus are associated with human tumors or are common infectious agents of man...|$|R
50|$|Brown <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{are large}} {{compared}} to most other tree-dwelling primates, with a head-body length of 40-60cm, a tail length of 55-75cm, and a weight of 5.5-10.8kg. Contrary to their name, {{they may also}} be a shade of grey or black as well as brown, and are darker on the head and underparts. The face is naked of any fur and is typically black. Most male <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are larger than the females, also having larger canines. Brown <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are also diurnal.|$|R

40|$|<b>Woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> Lagothrix spp are {{difficult}} to maintain and breed successfully. These species are threatened in the wild and conservationists {{need to be aware}} of their plight in captivity if attempts to sustain the species are ultimately required. Written survey reports, International Species Information System record analysis and <b>Woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> studbook record analysis were completed to gather data on the survivability of the <b>Woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> population in captivity from 1990 to 2005. The <b>Woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> population decreased by 11 % and the number of institutions holding these species also decreased. In addition, the birth to death ratio is negatively inverted (0 · 65 : 1 · 00). This is most pronounced in ¿¿ (0 · 47 : 1 · 00). The primary causes of death were infant mortality and complications during pregnancy, heart and hypertension disease, and bacterial and protozoan disease. The primary known causes of death in <b>Woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> and both the genetic and nutritional relationship to reproductive success need further examination to conserve these species in both captivity and the wild...|$|R

An animal model has been established for <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> hepatitis B virus (WMHBV) by using spider <b>monkeys,</b> since <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are endangered. In this study, a greater-than-genome length construct was prepared without amplification by using covalently closed circular DNA extracted from the liver of an infected <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey.</b> Transfection of the human liver cell line Huh 7 with WMHBV DNA resulted {{in the production of}} viral transcripts, DNA replicative intermediates, and secreted virions at levels similar to those obtained with an infectious human HBV clone, demonstrating that the host range restriction of WMHBV is not at the level of genome replication. WMHBV particles from the medium of transfected cultures initiated an infection in a spider monkey similar to that obtained with virions derived from <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> serum. In an attempt to adapt the virus for higher levels of replication in spider monkeys, immunosuppressed and newborn animals were inoculated.

50|$|The gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> (Lagothrix cana) is a <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> {{species from}} South America. It {{is found in}} Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. Lagothrix cana gets its common name, gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey,</b> from its thick gray coat. Its hands, feet, face and {{the inside of the}} arms are dark in color. Two {{subspecies}} of Lagothrix cana are known: L. c. cana and L. c. tschudii. L. c. cana is found in both Brazil and Peru and L. c. tschudii is found only in southeastern Peru. An isolated population was discovered by Wallace and Painter in the Madidi National Park in Bolivia. This population is distinctively darker and could soon be a new subspecies. The gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> has been considered endangered by IUCN since 2008. The species is listed as endangered because the it suffered a 50% decrease in population over the past 45 years due to deforestation and hunting.|$|R
50|$|Theories abound {{about the}} {{evolution}} of the atelines; one theory is they are most closely related to the <b>woolly</b> spider <b>monkeys</b> (Bractyteles), and most likely split from such <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> as (Lagothrix and Oreonax) in the South American lowland forest, to evolve their unique locomotory system. This theory is not supported by fossil evidence. Other theories include Brachyteles, Lagothrix and Ateles in an unresolved trichotomy, and two clades, one composed of Ateles and Lagothrix and the other of Alouatta and Brachyteles. More recent molecular evidence suggests the Atelinae split in the middle to late Miocene (13 Ma), separating spider <b>monkeys</b> from the <b>woolly</b> spider <b>monkeys</b> and the <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like {{all species}} of <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey,</b> brown <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are omnivorous, but mainly frugivorous. Their diet consist mainly of fruits {{containing}} 1 or 2 large seeds and fruits that are lower {{in fat and}} higher in sugar and water.While they prefer certain fruits, such as fruits from the Fabaceae (Legume), Moraceae (fig), Convolvulaceae, and Sapotaceae families, which represents roughly 50% of consumption time;fruit abundance and production influence their diet more than preference. As such, during periods of scarcity, fruit consumption tends to decrease and leaf and insect consumption increases. Females with dependents tend to eat more leaves, most likely because the leaves contain more protein, helping the female produce more milk;while juvenile <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are shown to eat more arthropods then {{other members of the}} group.|$|R

40|$|<b>Woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Lagothrix sp.) are {{threatened}} species and numerous zoos {{have failed to}} sustain successful populations. The most common causes of death in captive <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are related to pregnancy and hypertension. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate serum concentrations {{of a large number}} of captive <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> to establish baseline means and compare these concentrations with their closest related species to determine potential abnormalities. Serum analyses from 30 <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> housed at two institutions (Apenheul, The Netherlands and The Louisville Zoo, KY, USA) over 12 yr were collected. The statistical model included gender, age group (young, 0 - 4 yr of age; middle, 5 - 9 yr; and old, 10 + yr), and zoological institution. All panel result means were similar to previously reported concentrations for howler (Alouatta sp.) and spider monkeys (Ateles sp.) with the possible exception of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl-transferase being higher, whereas creatinine and phosphorus were lower. The serum glucose mean of 6. 7 mmol/L is above the baseline range for humans and spider monkeys. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase, and sodium (Na) were higher in females and magnesium (Mg) was higher in males (P < 0. 05). ALP, Mg, and phosphorus were highest (...|$|R
