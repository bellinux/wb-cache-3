Some took refuge in narrow courts and lanes, and on the roofs of the houses--for the citadel was so large that it formed of itself quite a little town--and fought desperately till they were brought down by the arrows of the Monguls. The governor took his <b>position,</b> <b>in</b> <b>company</b> with two men who were with him, on a terrace of his palace, and refused to surrender, but fought on furiously, determined to kill any one who attempted to come near him. His wife was near, doing all in her power to encourage and sustain him.|$|E

When Rev. Alexander Crummell petitioned to be allowed to move to Pennsylvania to establish another church (besides the peripatetic St. Thomas congregation) to serve Philadelphia's African American community, Bishop Onderdonk reportedly replied, [...] "I will receive you into this diocese on one condition: No negro priest can sit in my church convention and no negro church must ask for representation there."

50|$|For instance, a {{hedge fund}} holds a large <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>Company</b> X {{and would like to}} sell it completely. If this were put into the market as a large sell order, the price would sharply drop—by definition, the stake was large enough to affect supply and demand. Instead, the fund may arrange for a block trade with another company through an {{investment}} bank, benefiting both parties: the selling fund gets a more attractive purchase price, while the purchasing company can negotiate a discount off the market rates. Unlike large public offerings, for which it often takes months to prepare the necessary documentation, block trades are usually carried out at short notice and closed quickly.|$|E

40|$|Executives often blame {{external}} factors {{for their own}} bad performance. I propose a textual analysis-based measure to detect when corporate executives blame bad performance on {{external factors}} such as industry and economy (referred as BLAME measure). Using this methodology to analyze quarterly earn-ings announcement conference call transcripts, I find that: (1) these attribution behaviors are negatively related to the financial performance, indicating a higher desire to attribute bad performance to external factors; (2) a high BLAME measure predicts low returns subsequent to the conference call date after controlling for {{the tone of the}} transcripts and other known predictive variables. The hedged portfolio that takes long <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>companies</b> with low BLAME measure and short <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>companies</b> with high BLAME measure generates abnormal returns as high as 7 % per year; (3) BLAME measure negatively predicts SUE and analyst recommendation revision in the subsequent quarter, indicating underreaction to firm-specific negative information; (4) a high BLAME measure reduces turnover performance sensi-tivity. Overall, the evidence suggests that investors underreact to negative information when managers attribute bad performance to negative external factors...|$|R
