25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997—approximately six months after JonBenét's death—the Ramseys left Boulder and their summer home in Charlevoix, Michigan and moved back to Atlanta, Georgia. <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> died of ovarian cancer at age 49 in 2006 and was interred next to her daughter.|$|E
25|$|According to {{statements}} that <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> gave to authorities on December 26, 1996, {{she realized that}} her daughter was missing after she found a two-and-a-half-page ransom letter on the kitchen staircase. The ransom note demanded $118,000 for the child's safe return—almost the exact value of a bonus her husband had received earlier that year.|$|E
2500|$|Experts, media commentators, and the Ramseys have {{identified}} potential {{suspects in the}} case. [...] Boulder police initially focused almost exclusively upon John and <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> but by October 1997 had over 1,600 people in their index of the case.|$|E

25|$|JonBenét {{was born}} in 1990 in Atlanta, Georgia, the {{youngest}} of two children of <b>Patsy</b> and John <b>Ramsey.</b> Her older brother, Burke, was three years older. Her first name is a feminized portmanteau of her father's first and middle names. At {{the time of her}} death, JonBenét was enrolled in kindergarten at High Peaks Elementary School in Boulder, Colorado.|$|R
2500|$|Fitzgerald {{said that}} the note {{appeared}} to be written by a [...] "maternal" [...] person. Previous handwriting analysis had concluded that the handwriting {{was similar to that}} of <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> but it was not conclusively Patsy who wrote the note.|$|E
2500|$|It was in Boulder that <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> {{entered her}} {{daughter}} in various child beauty pageants. JonBenét had won the titles of America's Royale Miss, Little Miss Charlevoix, Little Miss Colorado, Colorado State All-Star Kids Cover Girl, and National Tiny Miss Beauty. JonBenét's active role in child beauty pageants and Patsy Ramsey's reported [...] "pageant mother" [...] behavior were reported on by the media after the murder.|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Mail Australia {{reported}} that, {{according to}} Jim Clemente, JonBenét 's nine-year-old brother Burke had a [...] "history of scatological problems". [...] Investigators claimed that Burke had covered his sister's walls and her Christmas present with feces, which was found when her room was sealed off and examined {{as a crime}} scene. The team speculate that Burke had become angry when JonBenét [...] took a piece of pineapple, which angered her brother, {{in the middle of}} the night. They further contend that their parents, John and <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> then covered up the reason for the death of their daughter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only people}} {{known to be}} in the house on the night of JonBenét's death were the victim and her {{immediate}} family: Burke, <b>Patsy</b> and John <b>Ramsey.</b> Despite specific instructions in the ransom note that police and friends should not be contacted, Patsy [...] telephoned the police at 5:52a.m. MST. She also called family and friends.|$|R

2500|$|John and <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> were sued in two {{defamation}} lawsuits {{arising from}} the publication of their book, The Death of Innocence. These suits were brought by two persons named in the book who {{were said to have}} been investigated as suspects by Boulder police. The Ramseys were defended in those lawsuits by Lin Wood and three other Atlanta attorneys, James C. Rawls, Eric P. Schroeder, and S. Derek Bauer. They obtained the dismissal of both lawsuits, including an in-depth decision by U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes that [...] "abundant evidence" [...] in the murder case pointed to an intruder having committed the crime.|$|E
2500|$|The note demanded $118,000, {{the rounded}} amount of John Ramsey's bonus that year. Fitzgerald {{said that the}} note was not written by a {{kidnapper}} or a [...] "real criminal", but someone who had written the note on a pad of paper used by <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> in their home. The note was unusually long, most ransom notes are 50 to 60 words. It took the experts 21 minutes or more to copy the ransom note and it noted {{that it would take}} more time to think about what to write. The pen and paper were not left out, but returned to their rightful place by the note's author. Many lines from the letter were taken from Speed, [...] Dirty Harry and other films.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second group}} of {{theories}} is that a family member was involved in her death. Boulder police initially concentrated almost exclusively upon John and <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey.</b> According to Gregg McCrary, a retired profiler with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, [...] "statistically, it is a 12-to-1 probability that it's {{a family member or}} a care giver" [...] who is involved in the death of a child. From the police's perspective, they did not see evidence of a forced entry, saw evidence of staging, such as the ransom note, and did not find the Ramseys cooperative in helping them solve the death of their daughter. The Ramseys had stated that their reluctance was due to their fear that there would not be a full investigation for intruders and that they would be hastily selected as the key suspects in the case, according to Daily Camera.|$|E
2500|$|The autopsy also {{revealed}} a [...] "vegetable or fruit material which may represent pineapple" [...] which JonBenét had eaten {{a few hours}} before her death. Photographs of the home taken on the day when JonBenét's body was found show a bowl of pineapple on the kitchen table with a spoon in it. However, both <b>Patsy</b> and John <b>Ramsey</b> said they did not remember putting the bowl on the table or feeding pineapple to JonBenét. Police reported that they found JonBenét's nine-year-old brother Burke Ramsey's fingerprints on the bowl. The Ramseys have always maintained that Burke slept through the entire episode until he was awakened several hours after the police arrived.|$|R
5000|$|On July 9, 2008, nearly 12 {{years after}} their daughter's death and two years after <b>Patsy's</b> death, John <b>Ramsey</b> and his late wife were officially cleared in the death by the Boulder District Attorney's office based on new DNA {{evidence}} collected from JonBenét's clothing; this particular type of DNA analysis did not exist {{at the time of}} the killing. Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy said new DNA tests point to an [...] "unexplained third party" [...] as possibly responsible for the killing. Modern [...] "touch DNA" [...] suggests that a male of Hispanic origin (per updates on DNA and DNA found under JonBenét's fingernails two weeks after the murder which Hunter had access to) left traces on two separate clothing articles: the undergarment panties and leggings. This was done against normal practice and police still believe them to not be cleared of all charges. (Mark Beckner, retired Boulder Chief of Police, has claimed that Mary Lacy had always strongly believed that a mother could not possibly be responsible for the death of her daughter in that fashion so sought to exonerate Ramsey, and that the [...] "trace DNA" [...] found on JonBenét's underwear by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation was in such minute quantities nanograms that it could have come from the clothing's [...] "manufacturing process." ...|$|R
2500|$|JonBenét Patricia Ramsey ( [...] ; August 6, 1990 – December 25 or 26, 1996) was an American child {{beauty pageant}} queen {{who was killed}} in her family's home in Boulder, Colorado, on the night of December 25–26, 1996, at the age of six. A lengthy ransom note was found in the house, and her father, John Ramsey, found JonBenét's body in the {{basement}} of their house about eight hours after she was reported missing. She sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled; a garrote was found tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that the official cause of death was [...] "asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma". Her death was classified as a homicide. The case generated nationwide public and media interest, in part because her mother <b>Patsy</b> <b>Ramsey</b> (herself a former beauty queen) had entered JonBenét in a series of child beauty pageants. The case still remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department.|$|E
