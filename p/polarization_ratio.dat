5000|$|The {{use of the}} <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> {{generally}} {{includes an}} implicit assumption that the particles in the volume are randomly oriented. The polarization properties of oriented particles cannot be properly represented by the depolarization ratio. Ice crystals are known to horizontally orient when they are large enough that drag forces overcome the randomizing effects of Brownian motion. Rain is also generally oriented, where drag forces flatten the drops along the fall direction. In such cases, the measured depolarization ratio may depend on the particular polarization state used by the lidar system. Some polarization lidar systems can measure the entire backscatter phase matrix, thereby avoiding the ambiguity of the depolarization ratio when oriented particles are present.|$|E
50|$|Beam park is a radar mode {{used for}} space surveillance, {{particularly}} tracking space debris. In beam-park mode, a radar beam {{is kept in}} a fixed direction {{with respect to the}} Earth, while objects passing through the beam are tracked. In 24 hours, {{as a result of the}} Earth’s rotation, the radar effectively scans a narrow strip through 360° of the celestial sphere. The scattered waves are detected by a receiver and the measurements obtained during the observations can be used to determine object radar cross-section, time of peak occurrence, <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio,</b> doppler shift and object rotation. The obtained information for each object is then processed and matched against data from previously catalogued objects.The beam-park mode can be used to detect both previously known and uncatalogued objects at any altitude, provided that the reflected power captured by the receiver can be distinguished from the noise. This limits the use of radar-based beam park observations to objects in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). Optical instruments, in turn, have very good performance for objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and in Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). The radar technique typically outperforms optical facilities in LEO and can conduct observations for longer periods, both during day and night, independently of the weather and object illumination by sunlight.|$|E

50|$|There is {{an ongoing}} effort to use the 32 meter dish as a {{receiver}} for radar-based tracking system artificial satellites and space debris in Earth orbit. The system functions as a bistatic radar, where an emitter located in a different location sends a signal, which bounces off objects in orbit and the echo is {{picked up by a}} receiver. The 32 meter dish acts as receiver, while usually the Yevpatoria 70 meter located in Crimea, functions as a transmitter. The systems can either actively track debris to determine their orbit more precisely or utilize a technique called beam park, where the transmitting and receiving antennas are kept fixed at a given position and the debris pass {{in and out of the}} observed area. The measurements obtain through such a system can be used to determine object radar cross-section, time of peak occurrence, <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio,</b> bistatic doppler shift and target rotation. In one of the carried-out tests, Yevpatoria-Medicina system was able to detect an object with an estimated radar cross section of 0.0002 square meter, which was created by the Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 satellite collision.

50|$|Similarly, {{spectra of}} weakly trapped {{molecular}} excitons are also {{strongly influenced by}} adjacent exciton bands. It is an important property of typical molecular crystals with two or more symmetrically-equivalent molecules in the elementary cell, such as benzine and naphthalene, that their exciton absorption spectra consist of doublets (or multiplets) of bands strongly polarized along the crystal axes as was demonstrated by Antonina Prikhot'ko. This splitting of strongly polarized absorption bands that originated from the same molecular level and {{is known as the}} 'Davydov splitting' is the primary manifestation of molecular excitons. If the low-frequency component of the exciton multiplet is situated {{at the bottom of the}} exciton energy spectrum, then the absorption band of an impurity exciton approaching the bottom from below is enhanced in this component of the spectrum and reduced in two other components; in the spectroscopy of molecular excitons this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the 'Rashba effect'. As a result, the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> of an impurity exciton band depends on its spectral position and becomes indicative of the energy spectrum of free excitons. In large organic molecules the energy of impurity excitons can be shifted gradually by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules. Building on this option, Vladimir Broude developed a method of studying the energy spectrum of excitons in the host crystal by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules. Interchanging the host and the guest allows studying energy spectrum of excitons from the top. The isotopic technique has been more recently applied to study the energy transport in biological systems.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the paper}} by Fraser-Smith et al. (1990), many {{scientists}} have focused their {{research on the}} ULF geomagnetic field pulsations {{in the hope of}} finding possible anomalous signals caused by the seismic activity. Thereafter, many papers have reported ULF geomagnetic field <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases which have been claimed {{to be related to the}} occurrence of moderate and strong earthquakes. Even if there is no firm evidence of correlation between the <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increase and seismic events, these publications maintain that these ‘‘anomalous’’ increases are without doubt precursors of pending earthquakes. Furthermore, several researchers suggest that these seismogenic signals may be considered a promising approach towards the possibility of developing short-term earthquake prediction capabilities based on electromagnetic precursory signatures. On the contrary, a part of the scientific community emphasizes the lack of validation of claimed seismogenic anomalies and doubt their association with the seismic activity. Since earthquake prediction is a very important topic of social importance, the authenticity of earthquake precursors needs to be carefully checked. The aim of this paper is to investigate the reliability of the ULF magnetic <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> changes as an earthquakes’ precursor. Several <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases of the geomagnetic field, which previous researchers have claimed to have a seismogenic origin, are put into question by a qualitative investigation.

Running averages of the geomagnetic index Kp are plotted onto the original figures from previous publications. Moreover, further quantitative analyses are also reported. Here, nine cases are investigated which include 17 earthquakes. In seven cases it is shown that the suggested association between the geomagnetic field <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases and the earthquake preparation process seems to be rather doubtful. More precisely, the claimed seismogenic <b>polarization</b> <b>ratio</b> increases are actually closely related to decreases in the geomagnetic activity level.
