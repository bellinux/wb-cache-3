Where the term 'sales value' is the base unit, it has to be very strictly defined; whether it is the 'gross sales value' or 'net sales value' (NSV), and if the latter, what components of the price need to be subtracted (for instance, <b>packing</b> <b>cost,</b> sales taxes, transportation costs, etc.).

40|$|The {{direction}} of fertilizer distribution {{is no longer}} based on the allocation {{of the needs of}} customers but already based on the magnitude of the benefits. This condition is very influenced by the selling price and the cost of fertilizer distribution. The use of distribution channels and pricing are very important, because it can affect the sales volume, the level of capital gains, risks, and the benefits. The general objective of each industry is certain to make a profit, and it will be achieved if the sales activities can be carried out successfully as planned. Cost element in the distribution of activity became an important thing because without the cost, the distribution will not running. This research will explain more about the influence of distribution channel cost on sales volume in Sarana Tani Manado that sell and provide the fertilizers, usually marketed in the field of agriculture in the region. This research method used associative group analysis. From the financial report that was taken from Sarana Tani Manado, there are three independent variables in distribution channel cost (transportation cost, warehouse cost and <b>packing</b> <b>cost)</b> that influence the sales volume. The findings showed that transportation cost and <b>packing</b> <b>cost</b> are the significant variables of distribution channel cost that influence sales volume, while warehouse cost is not the significant variable of distribution channel cost that influence sales volume in Sarana Tani, Manado.

40|$|The basic {{characteristic}} of packing {{is to protect}} the product from external factors while the product is delivering to consumers. However, recently packing has become an indispensable aspect of marketing. Because, packing is considered as a silent dealer which directly reaches consumers. Packing {{is one of the most}} important factor of product sales. Consumers assess a product with its packing and make up a purchasing decision accordingly. In addition to its protective function, packing also performs functions such as selling and communication. Recently, firms have begun attaching great importance on packing investments. A high-quality and attractive packing means expenditure. A firm can increase its sales as much as it creates difference with its packing. Therefore, it is required to take a risk of increasing the packing costs for increasing sales. Increasing <b>packing</b> <b>cost</b> is an important factor of prices. In this study, the relation between the <b>packing</b> <b>cost</b> and price has been researched by making regression analysis...|$|E

40|$|For a {{traditional}} amine-based CO 2 capture system, the absorber column {{accounts for a}} significant part of the overall capital- and operating cost. One important design factor of absorber columns is the gas velocity through the absorber packing. Higher gas velocity leads to higher energy cost due to increased pressure drop, but at the same time lower <b>packing</b> <b>cost</b> due to increased effective interfacial area. By utilizing available correlations in the new version 9. 0 of the simulation program Aspen HYSYS, the cost optimum gas velocity can be determined. This work evaluated six types of structured packings: Mellapak 250 X, 250 Y, 2 X, 2 Y, Mellapak Plus 252 Y and Flexipac 2 Y. The simulation results show that for all the packings, the cost-optimum gas velocity is in the range of 2. 0 to 2. 5 m/s giving a pressure drop through the absorber in the range of 10 to 15 mbar...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in demand for the wafer-level test techniques that evaluates the functionality and performance of the wafer chips before packaging them, since the trend of integrated circuits are getting more sophisticated and smaller in size. Throughout the wafer-level test, the semiconductor manufacturers are able to avoid the unnecessary <b>packing</b> <b>cost</b> and to provide early feedback on the overall status of the chip fabrication process. A probe card is a module of wafer-level tester, and can detect the defects of the chip by evaluating the electric characteristics of the integrated circuits(IC's). A probe card analyzer is popularly utilized to detect such a potential probe card failure which leads to increase in the unnecessary manufacture expense in the packing process. In this paper, a new probe card analysis strategy has been proposed. The main idea in conducting probe card analysis is to operate the vision-based inspection on-the- y while the camera is continuously moving. In doing so, the position measurement from the encoder is rstly synchronized with the image data that is captured by a controlled trigger signal under the real-time setting. Because capturing images from a moving camera creates blurring in the image, a simple deblurring technique has been employed to restore the original still images from blurred ones. The main ideas are demonstrated using an experimental test bed and a commercial probe card. The experimental test bed has been designed that comprises a micro machine vision system and a real-time controller, the con guration of the low cost experimental test bed is proposed. Compared to the existing stop-and-go approach, the proposed technique can substantially enhance the inspection speed without additional cost for major hardware change. 1 yea...|$|E
