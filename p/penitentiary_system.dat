2500|$|Several events {{caused the}} {{downfall}} of the local sugarcane business. Sugarcane required an enormous amount of manual labor to cut and load into wagons. Since the local population could not meet the demand for workers, the planters leased convicts from the Texas <b>penitentiary</b> <b>system.</b> In 1898 about 700 prisoners were harvesting sugarcane. Mutinies among the convict crews occurred because of the harsh conditions in the cane fields. Molasses imported from abroad and sugar beets grown in the United States proved to be cheaper to convert into sugar. In 1910 the Texas legislature passed a law forbidding the leasing of convicts on humanitarian grounds. In December 1911 there was a hard freeze which destroyed half of the sugarcane crop. The Lakeside sugarcane refinery closed in 1911 and in 1918 its machinery was sold to a producer in Jamaica. By the 1920s the local sugarcane crop dwindled to insignificance.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1971, Foucault co-founded the Group d'Information sur les Prisons (GIP) {{along with}} {{historian}} Pierre Vidal-Naquet and journalist Jean-Marie Domenach. The GIP aimed {{to investigate and}} expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was {{highly critical of the}} penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents. The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971, alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced police crack down and repeated arrest. The group became active across France, with 2,000 to 3,000, members, but disbanded before 1974. Also campaigning against the death penalty, Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the executed murderer Pierre Rivière. After his research into the penal system, Foucault published Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison (Discipline and Punish) in 1975, offering a history of the system in western Europe. In it, Foucault examines the penal evolution away from corporal and capital punishment to the <b>penitentiary</b> <b>system</b> that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century. Biographer Didier Eribon described it as [...] "perhaps the finest" [...] of Foucault's works, and it was well received.|$|E

50|$|The {{first major}} prison reform {{movement}} in the United States came after the American Revolution, {{at the start of}} the nineteenth century. According to historians Adam J. Hirsch and David Rothman, the reform of this period was shaped less by intellectual movements in England than by a general clamor for action in a time of population growth and increasing social mobility, which prompted a critical reappraisal and revision of penal corrective techniques. To address these changes, post-colonial legislators and reformers began to stress the need for a system of hard labor to replace ineffectual corporal and traditional punishments. Ultimately, these early efforts yielded the United States' first <b>penitentiary</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Southern {{penitentiaries}} {{from the}} antebellum period {{by and large}} continued to fall into disrepair in the post-war years as they became mere outposts of the much larger convict labor system. One by one, Southern <b>penitentiary</b> <b>systems</b> had disintegrated during the American Civil War. Mississippi sent its prisoners to Alabama for safekeeping {{in the midst of}} a Northern invasion. Louisiana concentrated its prisoners into a single urban workhouse. Arkansas dispersed its convicts in 1863 when the Union Army breached its borders. Occupied Tennessee hired its prisoners out to the United States government, while Georgia freed its inmates as General William Tecumseh Sherman headed for Atlanta with his armies in 1864. With the fall of Richmond, most of Virginia's prisoners escaped.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Eisenman, an Art History {{professor}} and activist, {{who is involved}} in many “stop max” movements centered in Illinois, studies solitary confinement and explains its eventual decline. Since the 1800s solitary confinement was practiced in the <b>penitentiary</b> <b>systems</b> and its implementation and popularity at various prisons grew throughout the centuries. The practice of solitary confinement grew partly because of stigmatizing language {{used to refer to}} certain prisoners like ‘the worst of the worst,’ which became a form of “self-justifying the logic of torture”. Yet, as the use of solitary confinement progressed, public discourse around solitary confinement transitioned from a legitimate form of punishment to torture. Because many prisoners in solitary confinement suffered severe mental and physical illnesses, Eisenman describes {{that by the end of}} the nineteenth century “prisoner isolation and sensory deprivation were widely understood to be forms of torture”. Therefore, human rights groups condemned the use of solitary confinement or ‘supermax’ systems, and national and local ‘stop max’ movements have initiated in America and worldwide to stop the use of solitary confinement.|$|R

In this he was eminently successful. For several years past he held the office of Master in Chancery for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Judge Mallery was at the time of his death the oldest practicing member of the bar of Philadelphia. To such an extent did he retain his vigor, that only six weeks before his death he conducted a most important and hotly contested jury trial, lasting more than a week. He received in 1840 the degree of LL. D. from Lafayette College.|$|R
