40|$|Clozapine, an {{atypical}} neuroleptic, {{has been}} found measurable with high sensitivity by gas chromatography with surface ionization detection (GC-SID) using <b>perlapine</b> as internal standard. The calibration curve for clozapine showed excellent linearity {{in the range of}} 1. 25 to 40 ng / ml whole blood (25 to 800 pg on-column), and the detection limt was about 1 ng / ml body fluid (20 pg on-column). Solid-phase extraction with Sep-Pak C 18 was useful for rapid purification of drugs from body fluids; the recoveries were above 88 % for whole blood or urine samples. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method for {{isolation}} of carbamazepine, piroheptine, <b>perlapine,</b> chlorprothixen, metixene, clothiapine, zotepine, dosulepin, amoxapine, melitracen and mianserin from urine and plasma samples, is presented: Urine and plasma samples containing the drugs were mixed with weakly alkaline buffer solution, and poured into a pretreated Sep-Pak C 18 cartridge; the cartridge was washed with water, and chloroform/isopropanol (9 : 1) was passed {{through it to}} elute The drugs: the drugs were detected by capillary gas chromatography with a flame thermionic detector: Separation of the 11 drugs {{from each other and}} from impurities was satisfactory. The detection limit for the drugs was 100 - 500 pg in an injected volume. The recovery of the drugs from urine and plasma samples was 60 - 65 %. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
