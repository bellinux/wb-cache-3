50|$|The {{defendant}} is {{not entitled to}} take any further procedural steps until he has satisfied the <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment</b> or the plaintiff has failed to furnish security when called upon to do so.|$|E
50|$|A {{provisional}} sentence simply entails {{that the}} judgment {{obtained by the}} plaintiff {{at this early stage}} is provisional and cannot prevent the defendant from proceeding to the principal case. The defendant may choose to satisfy the <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment</b> and subsequently, within two months, and by notification to the plaintiff, enter into the principal case.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the {{security}} is to ensure that, should the defendant succeed in the principal case, the defendant will receive repayment of the amount which was paid out {{in terms of the}} <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment.</b> A plaintiff who fails to provide security is not entitled to provisional relief; he must proceed to the principal case and request a grant of final judgment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{defendant}} who {{intends to}} proceed to trial and enter the principal case must give notice to the plaintiff within two months from {{the date of the}} <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment.</b> He must file a plea within ten days of such notice. The provisional summons is subsequently converted into a High-Court combined summons or a Magistrate's-Court ordinary summons, as the case may be.|$|E
50|$|A {{provisional}} sentence summons is one whereby a creditor {{in possession}} of a liquid document may sue speedily. If the debtor cannot dispute the validity of the liquid document, a <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment</b> will be entered against him. Only once he has paid the judgment debt as security will the debtor be able to enter into the merits of the case. In a recent Constitutional Court decision, it was held that various aspects of the provisional summons procedure were inconsistent with the Constitution.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, the {{defendant}} may {{choose not to}} proceed to trial, either by failing to deliver a notice of intention to enter the principal case, or by failing to file a plea within the required time periods. If {{the defendant}} does not request condonation for such a failure, or if the court refuses such condonation, the provisional sentence becomes the final judgment. Security lapses when a <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment</b> becomes final. The court is empowered to extend these time periods {{despite the fact that}} the judgment has become final. A stay of execution may be granted in exceptional circumstances; a final judgment may even occasionally be rescinded.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} {{orthodox}} Catholic theological experiments that I am conducting within the theology of relationship of Catholic faith to other religions. Each experiment attempts to ask a positive, existential question {{of one of the world}} religions about the reality of one of their reality assertions. Catholic orthodox theologies have almost always answered these questions in the negative, but in my tentative and <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment</b> the negative answers may be unnecessary. To re-ask the questions using the “eyes of faith,” 1 the full weight and depth of orthodoxy must be brought to bear, not as a defensive posture that protects the faith, but instead as an exercise in confident Catholic inclusivity that will see how far it can go, in other words, to explore how inclusive Catholicity and orthodoxy can get...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the uses of}} copulative perception verb construction (abbreviated as "CPVC", e. g. He looks happy.), {{especially in terms of}} evidentiality and factivity and analyzes them utilizing the control cycle model. With respect to evidentiality, Gisborne (2010) recognizes three uses: 'attributary use', 'evidential- 1 use', and 'evidential- 2 use' on the semantico-pragmatic basis. In Section 2, previous studies on evidentiality and perception verbs are examined; after reviewing the definition on evidentiality argued in Palmer (2001) and Aikhenvald (2004), the literature regarding CPVC and the related construction such as the experiencer-based perception verb construction is critically examined. It is argued that the previous studies have attempted to capture the phenomenon itself, although it lacks investigations on the fundamental mechanism, that is, motivation on the development of CPVC. In Section 3, I introduce a theoretical model, the Control Cycle, which is a general cognitive model advocated by Langacker (2002). In this model, a variety of processes are schematized as a cycle in which an entity (an actor) becomes aware of the existence of a target entity (a target), captures it and takes it under control. This model is highly generalized to describe many kinds of processes, from physical processes to perceptual, epistemic, and social processes. The model consists of four basic "phases": Baseline, Potential, Action, and Result. In particular, the Epistemic Control Cycle is used to describe epistemic processes, which consists of three potential stages: Formulation, Assessment, and Inclination. The analysis adopting the control cycle shows that the attributary use is located in the result phase, whereas both evidential use (Evidential- 1 use and Evidential- 2 use) are located in the inclination phase, which indicates that the process profiles a <b>provisional</b> <b>judgment.</b> This view is supported {{by the fact that the}} phenomenon "negative raising", which pertains only to the inclination phase, can be seen in both evidential uses. It is important to mention that the distinction of inclination and result is also reflected in the presence vs. the absence of a modal...|$|E
