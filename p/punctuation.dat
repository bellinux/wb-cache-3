5|$|Python is {{intended}} to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use <b>punctuation.</b> Python does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional, in contrast to many other programming languages. Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E
40|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} theory (PET) is an agenda-based {{theory that}} offers a theoretical foundation for large budget shifts. PET emphasizes that the static, incremental nature of agendas is occasionally interrupted by <b>punctuations.</b> These <b>punctuations</b> indicate shifts in priority among the agenda items, and with those agenda shifts come trade-offs. This article expands the discussion of punctuated budgets {{to the level of}} local government by determining that local government expenditures have the characteristics espoused by the punctuated equilibrium theory. The article also determines the frequency of <b>punctuations</b> and the probability for future <b>punctuations.</b> The findings show that some budget functions and policy types are more prone to <b>punctuations</b> and, therefore, have a less stable agenda. The practical significance of extending PET to local government budgeting is the implication on planning, forecasting, and the agenda-setting process. © 2003 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we argue}} that policy <b>punctuations</b> differ {{from each other in}} ways that reflect {{distinct}} types of political change. We identify three main kinds. The first are procedural changes that have unique unrelated policies within the same issue area. Within the remaining large policy changes, high-salience <b>punctuations</b> are associated with increased attention in the media, whereas low-salience <b>punctuations</b> do not attract such scrutiny. The analysis applies the typology to data from the UK Policy Agendas Project, identifying <b>punctuations</b> from the content of Acts of the UK Parliament between 1911 and 2008. Using evidence from the historical record and the data series, the analysis places each observation within the typology. We claim that the typology has a more general application and could be replicated in other jurisdictions and time periods. We conclude that attention to the historical record and qualitative studies of <b>punctuations</b> can complement and inform the analysis of aggregate data series...|$|R

While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E
5|$|Orchestras {{continued}} to use noise {{in the form of}} a percussion section, which expanded though the 19th century: Berlioz was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of timpani. However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for <b>punctuation,</b> to highlight passages, or for novelty. But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as jazz and popular music, and began incorporating marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, bells, gongs, cymbals, and drums.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{continuous}} access control enforcement in dynamic data stream environments, where both data and query security restrictions may potentially change in real-time. We present FENCE framework that ffectively addresses this problem. The distinguishing characteristics of FENCE include: (1) the stream-centric approach to security, (2) the symmetric model for security settings of both continuous queries and streaming data, and (3) two alternative security-aware query processing approaches that can optimize query execution based on regular and security-related selectivities. In FENCE, both data and query security restrictions are modeled symmetrically in the form of security metadata, called 2 ̆ 2 security <b>punctuations</b> 2 ̆ 2 embedded inside data streams. We distinguish between two types of security <b>punctuations,</b> namely, the data security <b>punctuations</b> (or short, dsps) which represent the access control policies of the streaming data, and the query security <b>punctuations</b> (or short, qsps) which describe the access authorizations of the continuous queries. We also present our encoding method to support XACML(eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) standard. We have implemented FENCE in a prototype DSMS and present our performance evaluation. The results of our experimental study show that FENCE 2 ̆ 7 s approach has low overhead and can give great performance benefits compared to the alternative security solutions for streaming environments...|$|R

The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time.

The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, <b>punctuation,</b> line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes....|$|E
5|$|Chrysolina graminis and C. herbacea {{are similar}} in size and colour and may be {{confused}} in UK populations. Distinguishing the two species in the United Kingdom is particularly important as C. graminis is a vulnerable species whereas C. herbacea is much more common. This has previously led to the misidentification of C. herbacea as C. graminis. C. herbacea measures 7–11mm in length. It is coloured iridescent green on dorsal surface throughout. The <b>punctuation</b> on the pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar, unlike in C. graminis.

5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of <b>punctuation,</b> another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other <b>punctuation,</b> such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. <b>Punctuation</b> is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu.

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{demonstrate}} the StreamShield, a system designed {{to address the problem}} of security and privacy in the context of Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs). In StreamShield, continuous access control is enforced by taking a novel 2 ̆ 2 stream-centric 2 ̆ 2 approach towards security. Security policies are not persistently stored on the server, but rather are depicted by security metadata, called 2 ̆ 2 security <b>punctuations</b> 2 ̆ 2, and get embedded into streams together with the data. We distinguish between two types of security punctuations: (1) the 2 ̆ 2 data security <b>punctuations</b> 2 ̆ 2 (dsps) describing the data-side security policies, and (2) the 2 ̆ 2 query security <b>punctuations</b> 2 ̆ 2 (qsps) representing the query-side security policies. The advantages of such stream-centric security model include flexibility, dynamicity and speed of enforcement. Furthermore, DSMSs can adapt to not only data-related but also to security-related selectivities, which helps reduce the waste of resources, when few subjects have access to streaming data...|$|R

5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and <b>punctuation</b> revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
