Debt as a motif and theme is explained, especially in 19th century literature, with examples from [...] "The Devil and Tom Walker", Wuthering Heights, Vanity Fair, Madame Bovary, House of Mirth, and The Mill on the Floss. Atwood posits {{a theory that}} Charles Dickens' Ebenezer Scrooge is the reverse character of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus; although Scrooge is rich, he is unwilling to spend his money and is living miserably before he is saved., while Doctor Faustus is rich, happy, and generous but ends in hell.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bollywood Hungama, Chopra was quoted saying [...] "when <b>people</b> <b>play</b> multiple characters, they have structures, they are {{from different parts of}} the world, sometimes they are a twenty-year-old and then become a forty-year-old in the same film, some with eyes small, etc. I have no clutches [...] All the girls I play in the film are in the age group of eighteen and twenty-four." [...] Additionally, she found playing the Capricorn girl, a teenager, very tough, saying: [...] "To play a 15-year-old girl without make-up or special effects to make me look younger was the most challenging role for me. I had to look fifteen years old just through my body language. I didn't want any of the twelve girls to be caricatures." [...] Chopra also read Linda Goodman's Sun Signs and Love Signs to prepare for the parts. Initially, it was planned to film one character at a time, however, that did not happen.|$|E
500|$|Kim Newton {{wrote the}} episode, but fellow writer Darin Morgan {{provided}} assistance on the script. Several references to previous Morgan-penned episodes {{make an appearance}} in [...] "Quagmire". Scully's dog Queequeg, which {{first appeared in the}} episode [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] was killed in this episode. Story editor Frank Spotnitz stated that the dog was brought back in this episode simply to kill it, seeking to incorporate it in an episode in a grisly fashion. Furthermore, [...] "Stoner" [...] kid (Tyler Labine) and hesitant [...] "Chick" [...] (Nicole Parker) both first appeared in the episode [...] "War of the Coprophages". The episode also contained various series in-jokes and pop culture references. Millikan County, where the lake in the episode is located, is named after casting director Rick Millikan.

500|$|In early 2010, {{the success}} of Apple Inc.'s mobile App Store {{prompted}} concern among game developers that the medium was shifting to smart devices. That July, Iwata acknowledged competition from Apple Inc. and considered them the [...] "enemy of the future". However, during an interview the following year, Iwata appeared entirely against the idea of Nintendo moving into the mobile market, claiming the company would [...] "cease to be Nintendo" [...] if they did so. He reasoned that mobile gaming would lack integrity over the quality of games {{in an effort to}} turn a profit. A slow shift in this view ensued over the following years as the mobile gaming market continued to grow. In 2012 he acknowledged that mobile devices provided significant competition but remained confident in his company's abilities. In a message to shareholders in March2014 fiscal year, Iwata stated, [...] "...I believe that the era has ended when <b>people</b> <b>play</b> all kinds of games only on dedicated gaming systems." [...] He cited the convenience of mobile devices for quick entertainment and expansive capabilities over a handheld console's dedicated software. Criticism arose over his continued stubbornness in moving to the mobile market, with analysts and investors continually requesting a change in outlook. Yoshihisa Toyosaki, president of Architect Grand Design Inc., claimed that [...] "Nintendo is out of touch", referring to the company's history of ignoring outside input. This ultimately negatively influenced Nintendo's finances and popularity to a degree.|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} book, Calvin {{describes}} how the spiritual union of Christ and humanity is achieved. He first defines faith as the firm and certain knowledge of God in Christ. The immediate effects of faith are repentance and the remission of sin. This is followed by spiritual regeneration, which returns the believer {{to the state of}} holiness before Adam's transgression. Complete perfection is unattainable in this life, and the believer should expect a continual struggle against sin. Several chapters are then devoted to the subject of justification by faith alone. He defined justification as [...] "the acceptance by which God regards us as righteous whom he has received into grace." [...] In this definition, it is clear that it is God who initiates and carries through the action and that <b>people</b> <b>play</b> no role; God is completely sovereign in salvation. Near the end of the book, Calvin describes and defends the doctrine of predestination, a doctrine advanced by Augustine in opposition to the teachings of Pelagius. Fellow theologians who followed the Augustinian tradition on this point included Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, though Calvin's formulation of the doctrine went further than the tradition that went before him. The principle, in Calvin's words, is that [...] "All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death." ...|$|E
