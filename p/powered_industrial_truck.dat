50|$|A {{forklift}} (also called lift truck, fork truck, and forklift truck) is a <b>powered</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>truck</b> used to {{lift and}} move materials over short distances. The forklift {{was developed in}} the early 20th century by various companies, including Clark, which made transmissions, and Yale & Towne Manufacturing, which made hoists. Since World War II, the use and development of the forklift truck have greatly expanded worldwide. Forklifts have become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing. In 2013, the top 20 manufacturers worldwide posted sales of $30.4 billion, with 944,405 machines sold.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{workplace}} forklift {{training is}} governed federally by OSHA the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In 1999, OSHA updated its 29 CFR 1910.178 regulations governing [...] "Powered Industrial Trucks" [...] (the term OSHA uses to include forklifts among {{other types of}} industrial vehicles.) A major component of these regulations deals with forklift operator training. The standard requires employers {{to develop and implement}} a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation, the types of vehicle(s) being used in the workplace, the hazards of the workplace created by the use of the vehicle(s), and the general safety requirements of the OSHA standard. OSHA believes, that trained operators must know how to do the job properly and do it safely as demonstrated by workplace evaluation. Formal (lecture, video, etc.) and practical (demonstration and practical exercises) training must be provided. Employers must also certify that each operator has received the training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years. Prior to operating the truck in the workplace, the employer must evaluate the operator's performance and determine the operator to be competent to operate a <b>powered</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>truck</b> safely. Refresher training is needed whenever an operator demonstrates a deficiency in the safe operation of the truck.|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} forklifts {{have been used}} widely in industry. Unfortunately in some cases, proper {{training}} has not been given to operators. Each year forklifts are involved in accidents resulting in serious injuries or death. The need for safe operations training cannot be overemphasized. The company used for this research is Federal-Mogul Corporation, located in LaGrange, Georgia. Federal-Mogul produces Powertrain Systems, such as pistons and rings for engines. Federal-Mogul has 200 employees. Approximately 50 - 60 of the 200 employees operate forklifts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the losses associated with <b>powered</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> (PIT) at Company X from January 1996 through September 1999. This task was accomplished through loss tab analysis. A review of accident reports from PITrelated accidents was performed in attempt to identify possible root causes of the accidents. Seventy-seven PIT-related accidents were identified. These accidents resulted in significant economic losses for Company X. Medical and indemnity payments from Worker’s Compensation claims resulting from these accidents totaled $ 347, 966. 42. Employees 19 - 25 years of age and/or with under 5 years of employment were found to be at highest risk to be involved in PIT-related accidents. Accident claims involving these groups resulted in approximately 40 % of incurred losses from PIT-related accidents at Company X. Additional risk factors were identified, such as speed of PIT operation and uneven surfaces. To reduce the impact of these risk factors, several control measures were recommended including enhanced PIT operator training, workplace hazard assessments, and more thorough accident reporting methods. iii Acknowledgement...|$|R

5000|$|The Arrete of January 1989 {{provided}} for special medical surveillance of workers assigned to workplaces with a daily noise exposure of 85 decibels or above. Recommendations and technical Instructions for occupational physicians performing such medical surveillance are {{laid down in}} a document specifying the nature and frequency of the examinations. A Decree of February 1989 laid down the safety and health requirements in relation to <b>powered</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> and their equipment. The Arrete of April 1989 stipulated that occupational physicians should produce each year a schedule of activities based on employees' health and health requirements. The Arrete covered health risks, workplaces and working conditions and specified the studies to be undertaken and the minimum number and frequency of inspection visits to workplaces. In the same field, the Arrete of May 1989 stipulated that occupational physicians In enterprises and establishments with more than 10 employees must compile and keep up-to-date a register listing the occupational hazards in the enterprise and the numbers of employees exposed to such hazards. The register was to be transmitted to the employer, kept {{at the disposal of}} the administration, and presented to the works committee for safety, health and working conditions {{at the same time as}} the annual report. A law passed in August 1989 amended a scheme introduced under a law on redundancy passed in 1986. The new law introduced a [...] "prevention" [...] element providing for aid to encourage firms to provide facilities for retraining workers and for conducting economic audits in small and medium-sized firms. There was also a [...] "procedure" [...] element providing for the works council to be kept informed and to be consulted, while the obligation to implement redeployment and retraining agreements was made generally applicable to all cases of redundancy for economic reasons. Regarding Individual dismissals, the legislation aimed to put an end to certain fraudulent practices detrimental to workers (e.g. reducing working time before dismissing a worker so as to circumvent the need to give notice). The law also set out methods of calculating the special award payable to workers who lost their jobs as a result of an accident or an occupational illness. Facilities for assistance for workers called to an interview prior to dismissal were also included.|$|R

50|$|Following the war, Baker-Raulang {{found the}} market for their fork lifts and <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> was strong, but {{unfortunately}} by helping other manufacturers produce <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> for the war effort, they had unwittingly created competition where it had not existed previously. Additionally, too much of their products were custom-made for customers with peculiar handling problems, which {{put them in a}} weak position to compete with their mass-produced competition. However, by 1947 a number of new mass-produced electric and gasoline-powered fork-lifts and yard trucks were put into production, and a year later demand was so high that they decided to move their <b>industrial</b> <b>truck</b> manufacturing operations to their West 80th St. plant, which formerly made truck bodies. By 1950, a new addition to the West 80th St. plant had been completed and the original West 25th St factory was sold.|$|R
50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> are {{trucks that}} are not {{licensed}} to travel on public roads (commercial trucks are licensed to travel on public roads). <b>Industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> are used to move materials over variable paths and when there is insufficient (or intermittent) flow volume such {{that the use of}} a conveyor cannot be justified. They provide more flexibility in movement than conveyors and cranes because there are no restrictions on the area covered, and they provide vertical movement if the truck has lifting capabilities. Different types of <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> can be characterized by whether or not they have forks for handling pallets, provide powered or require manual lifting and travel capabilities, allow the operator to ride on the truck or require that the operator walk with the truck during travel, provide load stacking capability, {{and whether or not they}} can operate in narrow aisles.|$|R

Critical shortages of copper combined with a lack of manufacturing capacity led Baker-Raulang (and the government) to the realization that gasoline powered truck and forklifts were the answer. Baker-Raulang produced as many electric and gasoline-powered vehicles as possible and helped regional automobile manufacturers re-tool in order to produce enough gasoline-powered fork lifts and bomb handling equipment to meet the Government's requirements.|$|R
