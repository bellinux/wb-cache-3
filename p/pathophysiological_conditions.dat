Thus, continuous leakage due to persistent precipitating underlying causes and/or impairment of EVLW reabsorption may result in a poor outcome [20]-[22]. However, the maximum EVLWi value reached during an ICU stay or ARDS episode cannot be predicted on a given day in clinical practice; thus, evaluating changes in early EVLWi might be more useful for accurate evaluation of the <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>condition</b> [21].|$|R

Previous studies have reported that possible causes of exRML were associated with excessive eccentric contractions in high temperature, abnormal electrolytes balance, and nutritional deficiencies possible genetic defects. However, the underlying mechanisms of exRML have not been clearly established among health professionals or sports medicine personnel.

50|$|The {{normalization}} {{control is}} a protein that, ideally, is expressed constantly {{at the same level}} across different experimental conditions. As such, housekeeping genes and proteins are often used as internal normalization standards in quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blots. These proteins were designated as housekeeping because they are essential for the maintenance of basic cellular functions and are universally expressed in all cells of an organism. Some examples of classically used housekeeping proteins include ß-Actin, GAPDH, HPRT1, and RPLP1. Until recently, these proteins were considered to be expressed at a consistent, stable level under normal or <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>conditions</b> in any cell or tissue type. However, recent studies have shown that expression of housekeeping proteins can change across different cell types and biological conditions. It is critical to carefully validate any housekeeping protein chosen as a normalization standard against the sample type and experimental condition.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSepsis is {{a complex}} {{pathophysiological}} disorder arising from a systemic inflammatory response to infection. Patients are clinically classified {{according to the presence}} of signs of inflammation alone, multiple organ failure (MOF), or organ failure plus hypotension (septic shock). The organ damage that occurs in MOF is not a direct effect of the pathogen itself, but rather of the dysregulated inflammatory response of the patient. Although mechanisms underlying MOF are not completely understood, a disruption in cellular energetic metabolism is increasingly implicated. In this review, we describe how various factors affecting cellular ATP supply and demand appear to be altered in sepsis, and how these vary through the timecourse. We will emphasise the need for an integrated systems approach to determine the relative importance of these factors in both the failure and recovery of different organs.

Low Ca2+ buffering in {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) vulnerable hypoglossal MNs exposes mitochondria to higher Ca2+ loads compared to highly buffered cells. Under normal physiological conditions, the neurotransmitter opens glutamate, NMDA and AMPA receptor channels, and voltage dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) with high glutamate release, which is taken up again by EAAT1 and EAAT2. This results in a small rise in intracellular calcium that can be buffered in the cell. In ALS, a disorder in the glutamate receptor channels leads to high calcium conductivity, resulting in high Ca2+ loads and increased risk for mitochondrial damage. This triggers the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then inhibit glial EAAT2 function. This leads to further increases in the glutamate concentration at the synapse and further rises in postsynaptic calcium levels, contributing to the selective vulnerability of MNs in ALS.

5000|$|A polypill is a {{medication}} {{that is a}} drug product in pill form (i.e., tablet or capsule) that combines multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients. The prefix [...] "poly" [...] means [...] "multiple", referring to the multiplicity of distinct drugs in a given [...] "pill". An occasional synonym is combopill.

[...] Polypills may be aimed to be consumed by healthy people {{as a means of}} preventive medicine, and/or treating actual <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>condition(s),</b> the former typically involving lower dosages than the latter. Polypills can reduce the number of tablets or capsules (generally orally administered) that need to be taken, which in turn may facilitate handling and administration of pharmaceuticals as well as alleviate patient pill-burden. Sometimes the multiple drugs in a given polypill might all be aimed at a single underlying condition (or, group of related conditions), partly because this expands the pool of potential patients for whom a given combination of drugs/dosages might be appropriate (particularly in the case of mass-produced polypills, i.e. FDCs). The term polypill was first coined in the context of cardiovascular disease prevention, but has since gained broader acceptance, including now for combinatorial drug products that existed before the term was actually coined (as the bare term without any modifiers is now quite generic).|$|E
50|$|The microneurography {{technique}} {{allows the}} recording of impulse activity of individual nerve fibers with absolute resolution in attending human subjects. Hence the subject is able to cooperate in various kinds of tests while the exact and complete information carried by the individual nerve fiber is monitored and offered for analysis of correlations between neural activity and physical or mental events. On the other hand, the particular physical conditions involving a microelectrode freely floating in the tissue preclude brisk and large movements because the exact electrode position is easily jeopardized. The experiment is often time-consuming because the search procedure can be particularly demanding. Hence it is not suited as a diagnostic test in clinical routine whereas its strength is in its unique power for exploration of normal neural mechanisms as well as <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>conditions</b> of various neurological disorders. Microneurography records intact axons in vivo and is minimally invasive. There have been no reports of persistent nerve damage. As a result, repeated recordings with the same subject are possible and longitudinal observations can be made. In the experiment, {{it is important to}} create an atmosphere of psychological confidence and to observe carefully the subject´s reactions so that the procedure can be adjusted accordingly. The technique requires considerable training and skill and it is highly recommended that scientists who are interested to take up the method are trained in a laboratory where the method is running and that the scientist her-/himself has participated as the subject in a couple of experiments.|$|E
