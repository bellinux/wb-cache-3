The results obtained were as follows. (1) The symmetry in motion between θ and exp(iθ) was shown when θ was kept in motion. The symmetry breakdown in motion between θ and cosh(θ), between θ and sinh(θ), and between θ and exp(θ) was shown when θ was kept in motion. (2) There were some properties that were common to these three functions.

Knowing that the dependence is linear simplifies computations; so, is is desirable to detect linear dependencies. If {{we know the}} joint probability distribution, we can detect linear dependence by computing Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient. In practice, we often have a copula instead of a full distribution; in this case, we face a problem of detecting linear dependence based on the copula.

An alternative tool is provided by means of molecular simulation. Here, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the Gibbs ensemble are used to compute the VLE of multicomponent natural gas mixtures. Two multicomponent systems, one containing a mixture of six components ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (<b>Formula</b> presented.) <b>S,</b> (<b>Formula</b> presented.)

More recently, Robert Alexy has defended a version of Radbruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>formula,</b> offering arguments for it that are different from and more sophisticated than those that were adduced by Radbruch himself. Alexy also placed Radbruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>formula</b> within a larger context of conceptual analysis and theories about the nature of law. Both Radbruch and Alexy claim that their positions are incompatible with legal positivism, and therefore count as a rejection (and perhaps, refutation) of it. This paper, presented at a Conference on the work of Gustav Radbruch, looks at Radbruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>formula</b> and Alexy 2 ̆ 7 s version of it. It focuses not so much on the merit of the Radbruch-Alexy formula, as on its proper characterization, and its appropriate placement within the larger context of legal philosophy.

In practice, people 2 ̆ 7 s choices are often probabilistic, especially for similar alternatives: the same decision maker can sometimes {{select one of them}} and sometimes the other one. In many practical situations, an adequate description of this probabilistic choice can be provided by a logit model proposed by 2001 Nobelist D. McFadden. In this model, the probability of selecting an alternative a is proportional to exp(β * u(a)), where u(a) is the alternative 2 ̆ 7 s utility.
