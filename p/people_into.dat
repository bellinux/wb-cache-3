His belief in the superiority of French culture and lifestyle is evident in his 1943 poem [...] "Pleurs sincères", which [...] "laments the indignities imposed on French citizens during German occupation" [...] but {{makes no mention of}} cruel practices of French colonials in Cameroun, such as the imposition of forced labour on Africans.|$|R

The current Coast Guard workforce meets both diversity goals and operational demands for having Spanish-speaking workers on hand to communicate with apprehended illegal immigrants and human traffickers.

5|$|Annie Jane, a three-masted {{immigrant}} {{ship out}} of Liverpool bound for Montreal, Canada, struck rocks off the West Beach of Vatersay during a storm on Tuesday 28 September, 1853.

5|$|By {{the late}} 4th century, the Empire had become chronically {{deficient}} in raising sufficient troops from amongst its own population. As an alternative, taxation raised internally was increasingly used to subsidise {{growing numbers of}} barbarian recruits. The Romans had, for some time, recruited individual non-Roman soldiers into regular military units. In 358AD, this practice was accelerated by the wholescale adoption of the entire Salian Franks <b>people</b> <b>into</b> the Empire, providing a ready pool of such recruits. In return for being allowed to settle as foederatii in northern Gallia on the near side of the Rhine, the Franks were expected to defend the Empire's borders in their territory and provide troops to serve in Roman units.|$|E
5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani {{but using}} Basque grammar, {{similar to the way}} the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela <b>people</b> <b>into</b> Basque society and the resultant bilingualism in Basque. The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern Basque Country.|$|E

5|$|Late in its duration, Gert passed just {{southeast}} of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4ft (23.6m) offshore and 30ft (9m) onshore. In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a wharf, destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along the wharf, a wave swept three <b>people</b> <b>into</b> the ocean, hospitalizing one of them. The wharf required $2million (1999CAD, $1.9million 1999USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove. Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland, {{and in the}} Grand Banks a station reported winds of 74mph (120km/h). Onshore, the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, the adverse conditions from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.|$|E

Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing {{it to be a}} teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E

The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to Oregon’s and the Midwest’s, forcing <b>people</b> <b>into</b> town.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations <b>people</b> <b>into</b> an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{logistical}} operations {{take place}} to bring <b>people</b> <b>into</b> the festival by public transport each year. Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station, mostly from London Paddington. The station operates as a mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required. This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days. Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.|$|E
