25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} African members of the colonial legislatures, when in 1960 the colonial {{government}} ordered a nationwide election for 14 African Legislators to the colonial parliament. Khasakhala was the winner of the combined counties of Marama, Kisa, Maragoli, Tiriki and Bunyore; he became the first Legislator for the combined region. In 1962 Khasakhala together with the other 13 Members of Parliament were taken to Britain for one month edification on <b>political</b> <b>governance</b> and the parliamentary system. Upon their return to Kenya, they spearheaded a campaign that increased the number of legislators from 14 to 150. Eventually, new constituencies were created nationwide. The four regions Khasakhala had represented were split into four legislative constituencies. During the 1963 embryonic postcolonial era elections, he became the first Nyore to represent Bunyore in the national parliament.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows for}} {{a panel of}} 32 {{developing}} countries that <b>political</b> and <b>governance</b> institutions matter for private investment decision. This linkage is empirically verified for a broad number of institutions. This {{is the case for}} corruption, quality of bureaucracy, judiciary, security of property rights, regulations and taxation, political stability, as well as political rights and civil liberties. This result is obtained by estimating a simultaneous model of private investment and <b>political</b> and <b>governance</b> quality, where economic policy and other variables explain concurrently both variables. In MENA, the deficiencies in the administration quality, the political instability and the low public accountability contributed significantly to the low investment decisions of the 1980 s and the 1990 s. This paper shows as well that, although <b>political</b> and <b>governance</b> institutions constitute first order importance for private investment, economic reforms in the form of financial development and trade openness, and human capital affect private investment decision directly, as well as by enhancing the quality of <b>political</b> and <b>governance</b> institutions...|$|R

2500|$|According to the World Bank, {{the protests}} were {{damaging}} Hong Kong's economy while China remained largely unaffected. Although the Hang Seng Index fell by 2.59% during the [...] "Golden Week", it recovered and trading volume rose considerably. Shanghai Daily published on 4 October {{estimated that the}} protests had cost Hong Kong HK$40billion ($5.2billion), with tourism and retail reportedly being hardest hit. However, tourist numbers for the [...] "Golden Week" [...] (beginning 1 October) were 4.83% higher than the previous year, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. While substantial losses by retailer were predicted, some stores reported a marked increase in sales. Triad gangs, which had reportedly suffered a 40% decline in revenues, were implicated in the attacks in Mong Kok, {{where some of the}} worst violence had occurred. Economic effects seemed either to be extremely localised or transient, and in any event much less than the dire predictions of business lobbies. One of the hardest hit may have been the Hong Kong Tramways Company, which reported a decline in revenues of US$1million. An economist said that the future stability will depend on <b>political</b> <b>governance,</b> namely if political issues such as income gaps and political reforms will be addressed.|$|E

According to the reports, Mbeki believed that review of <b>political</b> <b>governance</b> was something for the African Union. Jean Chrétien, then president of the G8, sent a letter to Mbeki demanding clarifications and expressing his concern that these AU organs are ‘politicized’ and will therefore not produce credible reviews. In a public letter Mbeki denied the charges and stated that countries would voluntarily subject themselves to review of all aspects of good governance, including political, under the APRM, but that other AU institutions might be more appropriate to deal with some issues.|$|E
