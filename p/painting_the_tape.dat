40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} mutual fund manager’s investment decision that incorporates three well-known observations: (i) past fund performance influences subsequent net fund inflows; (ii) fund manager compensation rises with total assets under management; (iii) trading has short-run price impacts. These observations provide fund managers the incentive to distort investment of new cash inflows toward stocks in which the fund holds larger positions. We show that {{this leads to the}} empirically observed short-run persistence and long-run reversal in fund performance. It also explains why mutual funds tend to be relatively undiversified and appear to exhibit clairvoyant stock selection. turn-of-quarter effect, <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> mutual fund performance, investment distortion...|$|E

Later, Gordon tries to convince Batman {{that he does not}} have to fight villains by himself, but Batman refuses. When Gordon locates Martha Wayne (this continuity's version of the Joker) in old Wayne Manor, he goes in without backup. Gordon is then tricked into shooting Harvey Dent's daughter, having been disguised as Joker, as she had been taped to a chair and had her mouth taped shut with a smile <b>painted</b> on <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Martha then appears and slashes Gordon's throat, and Gordon dies by Joker venom.|$|R

50|$|By {{the time}} Ryman began working, older artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and Philip Guston had already reduced {{painting}} to its essences. In 1955 Ryman began {{what he considers}} his earliest professional work, a largely monochrome painting titled Orange <b>Painting</b> (1955-59). In <b>the</b> late 1960s he created his Classico series of compositions consisting of multi-panel paintings on {{a specific type of}} paper called Classico. For each work in the series, Ryman attached a configuration of heavy, creamy white sheets of the paper to a wall with masking <b>tape,</b> <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> sheets with a shiny white acrylic <b>paint,</b> removed <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> when <b>the</b> sheets were dry, mounted them on foamcore, and reattached them to the wall. <b>The</b> built-up <b>paint</b> edge tracing <b>the</b> outline of masking <b>tape</b> and <b>the</b> ripped paper left behind give witness to the process of creation. The various works in the Classico series differ in the organization of paper sheets, <b>the</b> configuration of <b>tape</b> traces, and <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> shape. Just as the Classico works were titled after the type of paper used as a medium, the so-called Surface Veil works from 1970 were named for the brand of fiberglass upon which the smaller pieces in this group were <b>painted.</b> Some of <b>the</b> 12-foot square paintings from the series were executed not on fiber-glass but on cotton or linen. In each of these works the pigment appears to form a membrane over the support due to the differing degrees of opacity and translucence in <b>the</b> white <b>paint</b> juxtaposed with areas where less of it has been applied, leaving the fabric exposed. These disruptions in the painting’s skin often mark the literal pauses between the artist’s working sessions.|$|R
5000|$|Masking {{tape was}} invented in 1925 by 3M {{employee}} Richard Drew.

50|$|Masking tape, {{also known}} as sticky tape, {{is a type of}} {{pressure-sensitive}} tape made of a thin and easy-to-tear paper, and an easily released pressure-sensitive adhesive. It is available in a variety of widths. It is used mainly in painting, to mask off areas that should not be <b>painted.</b> <b>The</b> adhesive is the key element to its usefulness, as it allows <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to be easily removed without leaving residue or damaging the surface to which it is applied. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is available in several strengths, rated on a 1-100 scale based on the strength of <b>the</b> adhesive. Most <b>painting</b> operations will require a <b>tape</b> in <b>the</b> 50 range. Household masking tape is made of an even weaker paper and lower-grade adhesive.|$|R
40|$|For {{this project}} I used tape as both an artistic process {{and as a}} tool to answer the {{following}} questions: what effects can be achieved with thicker tape? What effect does a clean line versus a messy line have on the quality of <b>the</b> <b>painting?</b> What material works best to create space in interesting ways? In order to answer these questions and more, I created this multi-step plan to explore this method. I was originally going to make four 12 ”x 12 ” paintings for each tape type, masking, scotch, and duct, but as my project evolved I decided to cut it down to three of each. I also limited myself to a specific number of layers to <b>tape</b> onto <b>the</b> canvas, this being three, six, and nine layers. I created these limitations in order to test each material separately and explore <b>the</b> number of <b>paint</b> layers each can withstand. After testing each material on the small paintings, I ended my project with three large ones. I planned on making a painting for each tape type but instead my final paintings became an exploration of what can be achieved by utilizing multiple or all three varieties together. For these final paintings I used both masking and duct tape to play with the relationships between line size, space, and color. What I discovered with this experiment is that each tape creates a different line quality. Scotch <b>tape</b> is <b>the</b> least successful of the materials; it does not hold a clean line well. <b>The</b> duct <b>tape</b> was interesting; it holds a clean line, so clean that when lines are placed next to each other paint pools and creates a physical surface. <b>The</b> masking <b>tape</b> was my favorite among the materials, largely because the wide range of available sizes makes for more varied line qualities, and smaller areas for <b>paint</b> accretion. <b>The</b> masking <b>tape</b> worked best when creating space and texture, and when working on a large scale <b>the</b> masking <b>tape</b> and <b>the</b> duct <b>tape</b> together made for the most interesting compositions. While this was a tiresome experiment (I gave myself a lot of paintings to make), it was useful in that it helped me add variation to this method of <b>painting.</b> I discovered <b>the</b> types of <b>tape</b> that can withstand multiple layers without tearing <b>paint</b> off <b>the</b> canvas, and which line qualities I prefer. Qualities that I can bring with me when I use <b>tape</b> in <b>the</b> future to create these abstract spaces that lead the eye in interesting ways, and creates stimulating interplays among line, color, and space...|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} of the head at program switch point could sometimes pull <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> up or down, causing <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to fold over and start playing {{the back side of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> would continue to play, albeit muffled and barely audible. Continued playing would flip <b>the</b> entire <b>tape</b> over, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> would be wound on the reel inside with the backside showing. Many vintage tapes can be found with the back side of <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> facing forward. <b>The</b> program switch point is often the place where <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> would be ingested into the player i.e. [...] "eaten", when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> head moved from program 4, to program 1- its furthest track change movement.

5000|$|In February 2005, {{a report}} by CBS News' 60 Minutes II raised {{questions}} about whether Marla created the paintings on her own. 60 Minutes {{enlisted the help of}} Ellen Winner, a child psychologist who studies cognition in the arts and gifted children. Winner was impressed with Marla's work, and indicated that Marla was the first child prodigy she'd seen <b>paint</b> abstractly. <b>The</b> Olmsteads agreed to permit CBS crews to set up a hidden camera in their home to tape their daughter painting a single piece in five hours {{over the course of a}} month.

50|$|The {{original}} beep {{test was}} initially available on audio tape format.

Most versions of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> had a one-minute recorded interval for calibrating <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and tape player. Digital audio formats replaced <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> but checks were still required on the CD/player due to some tone controls possibly affecting the playback speed.|$|R
50|$|Some tapes may {{deteriorate}} {{because of}} a breakdown in the binder (the glue) that holds the oxide particles on <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> or <b>the</b> back coating on the reverse side, if <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was from any of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> manufacturers who had inadvertently used an unstable binder formulation. That binder contained polyurethane that soaks up water and causes the urethane to rise to <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. This problem {{became known as the}} 'sticky-shed syndrome'. One explanation was offered that short strands of urethane were most commonly used in tapes - until it was discovered that middle-sized strands are better and were good at absorbing moisture. Baking <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> temporarily restores <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> by driving <b>the</b> water molecules from the binder {{so that it can be}} safely copied to another tape or a different format. After baking, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> usually remains in good condition for approximately a month. If <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> re-deteriorates, it may be possible to bake <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> again.|$|R
5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads, instead of moving across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at almost 90° to {{the direction of}} motion as in the quadruplex system, move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> transport mechanism, allowing <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|R
50|$|Tape baking is a {{somewhat}} risky procedure, {{since there is}} a risk of damaging <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> from <b>the</b> heat. However, there are some important signs that show when a <b>tape</b> needs baking. <b>The</b> typical symptom is squealing when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> passes <b>the</b> playback head or other fixed parts of a <b>tape</b> player. <b>The</b> squealing is audible directly from <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and also transmitted electronically through the output of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> recorder. Continuous use of a squealing tape risks permanently damaging <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> as oxide is sometimes torn off <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This flaking residue can be seen and can feel gummy while still on <b>the</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. There is also a risk of damage to the player. Another symptom is <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> sounding dull and distorted. In a video recording, degradation can be represented by audio-visual dropouts.|$|R
50|$|Tabletop or desk {{dispensers}} {{are frequently}} {{used to hold}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and allow <b>the</b> operator {{to pull off the}} desired amount, tear <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> off, and take <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to <b>the</b> job.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>the</b> drive {{reversed}} <b>the</b> {{direction of}} <b>tape</b> motion, moved <b>the</b> read and write heads slightly vertically across <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> and continued to write (or read) more data {{until the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was reached. This process could be repeated many times, laying down several track sets on <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> media in a serpentine recording mode. The Storage Tek 9840, 9940 and T10000 drives are all serpentine recording drives.|$|R
50|$|With a reel turning at a {{constant}} rate, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> around <b>the</b> hub has a lower linear velocity than <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> outside of the reel, so <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> layers must slip past {{each other as they}} approach <b>the</b> center. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> was coated with a slippery backing material, usually graphite and patented by Bernard Cousino, to ease the continuous slip between <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> layers. While <b>the</b> design allowed simple, cheap, and mobile players, unlike a two-reel system, it did not permit rewinding of <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Some players offered fast-forward by speeding up the motor while cutting off the audio; but rewinding was never offered, because it was technically impossible.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Spectra T950 <b>tape</b> library stores media <b>tapes</b> in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> library {{bundled in}} trays called TeraPacks.

5000|$|Stiction {{may also}} {{manifest}} itself on computer tapes (9 track <b>tape</b> etc.). <b>The</b> magnetic surface of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> would be heated against the read head in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> deck, and when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> stopped moving would cool slightly and [...] "glue" [...] onto the read head.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tape</b> {{is totally}} {{enclosed}} {{when not in}} use. Unlike competing formats that have spaces in the cassette for <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> loading mechanism to be inserted, thus exposing <b>the</b> delicate magnetic <b>tape</b> surface, VCCs have a retractable sheath that covers such space. The sheath is retracted as a tape is inserted into the machine and only then can <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> cover be raised to fully expose <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{shift left}} and shift right {{operations}} may shift <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> head across <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> but when actually building a Turing machine {{it is more}} practical to make <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> slide back and forth under the head instead.|$|R

50|$|In the {{technique}} used in all transverse-scan video <b>tape</b> recorders, <b>the</b> recording heads are mounted {{in a rapidly}} spinning drum which is pressed against <b>the</b> moving <b>tape,</b> so <b>the</b> heads move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> in a transverse or nearly vertical path, recording the video signal in consecutive parallel tracks sideways across <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This allows use of the entire width of <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> storing much more data per inch of <b>tape,</b> compared to <b>the</b> fixed head used in audio tape recording, which records a single track down <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> heads move across <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> high speed necessary to record the high-bandwidth video signal, but <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> moves at a slower speed through the machine. In addition, three ordinary tracks are recorded {{along the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> by stationary recording heads. For correct playback, the motion of the heads has to be precisely synchronized with the motion of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> through <b>the</b> capstan, so a control track of synchronizing pulses is recorded. The other two tracks are for the audio channel, and a cuing track.|$|R
50|$|Cassette tape {{players can}} cause skips when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> being played is worn {{or in some}} other way damaged. Since <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> is rolled into a reel, it depends on how <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> runs across <b>the</b> roll as to how the skip affects playback. Indeed, some early artists such as the Beatles {{deliberately}} rearranged <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> reels in order to produce loops used in their recordings.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} played continuously {{using an}} auto-reverse mechanism. As <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> reaches one end, the reverse mechanism activates and changes the drive direction. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> head {{moves to the}} other side and the mechanism shifts pinch rollers. The design does not require the head to turn over; instead, the entire head changes position to play <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> at <b>the</b> other side of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> path.|$|R

50|$|Travan uses {{a linear}} track technology, with data written onto {{individual}} tracks over several successive passes. Fully reading or writing a tape to full capacity may require moving <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> from reel to reel many times. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is not {{attached to the}} hubs, but is wrapped and held by friction. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is prevented from coming off at the ends using small holes punched in <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> which are detected by optical sensors in <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> drive using a 45-degree mirror inside and {{a window on the}} side the cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly all 1/2" [...] tape formats {{today are}} a single hub design, whereby <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> is wound onto a single hub, entirely within the {{external}} shell and presents one end for <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> drive to engage and thread into <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> drive for reading or writing. The mechanical design of this loading mechanism varies between {{different types of}} tape media and is a common source of failures. Usually <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> cartridge incorporates a switch that can be set to permit or forbid writing of data to <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{also uses}} an {{indirect}} tension-band drive system, consisting of an elastic band that presses {{on the exterior}} of both reels, and also over an idler wheel {{on the edge of}} the case. A motor in the drive contacts the idler to move <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> Because <b>the</b> reels wind and unwind at unequal speeds there is always some slippage occurring when <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> is in motion; frequent retensioning of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> (achieved by winding <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> fully forwards and then backwards at high speed) is required to prevent this problem. Old tapes used many times tend to have a visibly marked stripe down the center of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> where <b>the</b> band has pressed into <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The capstan is a {{rotating}} spindle used to move recording <b>tape</b> through <b>the</b> mechanism of a <b>tape</b> recorder. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> is threaded between the capstan {{and one or}} more rubber-covered wheels, called pinch rollers, which press against the capstan, thus providing friction necessary for the capstan to pull <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>The</b> capstan is always placed downstream (in <b>the</b> direction of <b>tape</b> motion) from <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads. To maintain the required tension against <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> heads and other part of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> transport, {{a small amount of}} drag is placed on <b>the</b> supply reel. <b>Tape</b> recorder capstans have a function similar to nautical capstans, which however have no pinch rollers, the line simply being wound around them.|$|R
