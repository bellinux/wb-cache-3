50|$|Catel-Manzke {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} genetic disorder characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the index fingers; the classic features of Pierre Robin syndrome; occasionally with additional physical findings. <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome</b> refers to a sequence of abnormalities that may occur as a distinct syndrome {{or as part of}} another underlying disorder. <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome</b> is characterized by an unusually small jaw (micrognathia), downward displacement or retraction of the tongue (glossoptosis), and incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). It is also linked to hyper mobility syndrome.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to present}} the {{variable}} appearance of micrognathia in fetuses by three-dimensional ultrasonography and to describe practical methods for analysis of these volume data. Methods: three-dimensional multiplanar imaging and surface-rendering techniques were used to show various syndromes and diagnostic approaches {{for the evaluation of}} fetal micrognathia. Results: nine cases of fetal micrognathia are presented. Orthogonal multiplanar views were used to obtain a midsagittal facial profile. Examples of micrognathia include 3 cases of <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> sequence, cerebrocostomandibular <b>syndrome,</b> Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and hypochondrogenesis. Diagnostic pitfalls for micrognathia are also shown. Conclusions: three-dimensional multiplanar imaging increases the likelihood that a true midline sagittal view of the facial profile is being analyzed. Surface rendering provides another way to qualitatively evaluate the fetal chin from different viewing perspectives. Three-dimensional ultrasonographic methods are useful adjuncts to the preliminary diagnostic impression from two-dimensional ultrasonography...|$|R

40|$|Orofacial clefts {{are among}} the most common craniofacial {{deformities}} and could be associated with serious anomalies. The rare condition - <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> sequence is classified into these deformities, due to presence of isolated cleft palate. <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> sequence is defined as a triad of symptoms: micrognathia, glossoptosis and airway obstruction. These symptoms were described in 1923 by French stomatologist <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin.</b> In 70 s the original name" <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> syndrome" was changed in "Pierre Robin sequence" because of the sequence of defects development. Today, many authors use modified definition of the sequence. They add the "U" or "V" shaped cleft palate and feeding disorders to original triad of symptoms. <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> sequence is usually classified into 3 groups: isolated form, syndromatic form and form additional to other malformations without knowing syndrome diagnosis. The treatment therapy in patients with <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> sequence is divided into conservative or invasive approach. Choosing the approach needs cooperation of many specialists, who should be part of multidisciplinary team. Although it is not usual or frequent, the physical therapist should be involved.

50|$|<b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome</b> (abbreviated to PRS, {{and also}} known as Pierre Robin sequence, Pierre Robin malformation, Pierre Robin anomaly or Pierre Robin anomalad) is a {{congenital}} condition of facial abnormalities in humans. PRS is a sequence, i.e. a chain of certain developmental malformations, one entailing the next. The three main features are cleft palate, retrognathia (abnormal positioning of the jaw or mandible) and glossoptosis (airway obstruction caused by backwards displacement of the tongue base). A genetic cause to PRS was recently identified. Pierre Robin sequence {{may be caused by}} genetic anomalies at chromosomes 2, 11, or 17.|$|E
50|$|The {{most severe}} problem {{associated}} with Stickler syndrome is <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This {{refers to a}} cleft palate resulting from a very small lower jaw. During early fetal life, {{the roof of the}} mouth is normally open and the sides of the palate have to come together to close. If the jaw is too small, there is not enough room for the tongue which is then pushed up and {{gets in the way of}} the closing palate. Sometimes the chin is so small the baby has problems with eating and breathing if the tongue blocks the back of the throat. Cleft palate is found less frequently in Marshall Syndrome than in Stickler syndrome but still more frequently than in the general population.|$|E

30|$|In a {{more recent}} series, Ville et al. [13] {{reported}} two cases in which 11 -week fetuses presented with increased nuchal translucency (4 and 6  mm, respectively) and generalized edema. In both cases, chorionic villi sampling (CVS) sampling showed a normal 46 xx karyotype. However, the ultrasound features of early hydrops led the parents to request further examination by embryoscopy. In the first case, transabdominal intraamniotic embryoscopy revealed facial dysmorphia with a short, flat, and upturning nose with a long filtrum. In the second case, embryoscopy revealed the association of clinodactyly and multiple, mainly frontal, angiomas. This couple had a previous history of having a child with unexplained mental retardation and a large cutaneous angioma. The parents in both cases opted for terminating the pregnancies. In another case, the same team performed transabdominal embryoscopy at 13 weeks after an ultrasound finding of micrognathia. This couple already had a child affected by <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome</b> with severe mental retardation. Embryoscopy confirmed mandibular hypoplasia, which is associated with recurrence of <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and this pregnancy was also terminated.|$|E

40|$|Patients with <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome</b> are {{characterized}} by micrognathia, retrognathia, glossoptosis, and respiratory ob-struction and are prone to have a difficult-to-intubate airway. The McGrath Ⓡ MAC video laryngoscope provides a bet-ter view of the glottis than a Macintosh laryngoscope, {{but it is not}} easy to insert an endotracheal tube through the vocal cords because a video laryngoscope has a much greater curvature than that of a conventional direct laryngoscope and an endotracheal tube has a different curvature. The Frova Intubating Introducer is used as a railroad for an endotracheal tube in cases of a difficult airway. We thought that a combination of these two devices would make it easy to insert an endotracheal tube through the vocal cords, as a McGrath Ⓡ MAC video laryngoscope provides a better glottic view and the Frova Intubating Introducer is a useful device for placing an endotracheal tube through the glottis.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe <b>Pierre</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or sequence, is a triad characterised by micrognathia, glossoptosis {{and upper}} {{respiratory}} obstruction, {{with or without}} cleft palate. Most patients respond to postural treatment, although tracheotomy is necessary on extreme occasions. Mandibular distraction is currently an effective therapeutic alternative that elongates the jaw and resolves the respiratory obstruction. The choice of vector for distraction is essential for modifying {{the dimensions of the}} airways. Patients and methodsThe objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the changes produced in the dimensions of the upper airways in eight children with Pierre Robin sequence, treated with mandibular distraction, depending on the vector of distraction planned. To this end, a lateral cranial X-ray was performed pre- and post-distraction, tracing a line from the mandibular plane to the base of the tongue and as far as the posterior pharyngeal wall, measuring the millimetres of separation between the two structures. Results and conclusionsThe results showed that the horizontal distraction vector, in the first place, and the oblique vector in the second place, would be the procedures of choice in view of their positive effects on the airways...|$|E
