40|$|Disorder {{can have}} remarkably {{disparate}} consequences in superconductors, driving superconductor-insulator transitions in ultrathin films by localizing electron pairs and boosting the supercurrent carrying capacity of thick films by localizing vortices (magnetic flux lines). Though the electronic 3 D-to- 2 D crossover at material thicknesses d ∼ξ (coherence length) is well studied, a similarly consequential magnetic crossover at d ∼ L_c (<b>pinning</b> <b>length)</b> that should drastically alter material properties remains largely underexamined. According to collective pinning theory, vortex segments of length L_c bend {{to adjust to}} energy wells provided by point defects. Consequently, if d truncates L_c, a change from elastic to rigid vortex dynamics should increase the rate of thermally activated vortex motion S. Here, we characterize the dependence of S on sample thickness in Nb and cuprate films. The results for Nb are consistent with collective pinning theory, whereas creep in the cuprate is strongly influenced by sparse large precipitates.

40|$|Size {{dependencies}} of {{the peak}} effect and irreversibility field in superconducting Sm- 123 powder specimens were investigated. The peak effect {{was found to}} disappear in the two-dimensional pinning regime in which powder size is smaller than <b>pinning</b> correlation <b>length.</b> This shows that the peak effect does not originate directly from elementary pinning mechanisms, but from a cooperative phenomenon of flux lines, as proposed by the pinning-induced disorder transition model. In addition, when powder size is smaller than virtual <b>pinning</b> correlation <b>length</b> in the ideal creep-free case, irreversibility field decreases with powder size. This supports the hypothesis that longitudinal flux bundle size is given by this length, as predicted by flux creep theory.

Three figure-eight shaped bronze fittings of 41 mm length, 15 mm width and thicknesses of 2 mm with line ornaments wearing a gold metal insert at the waist.

Two rectangular bronze plates of 38 mm in length, 7 mm in width and about 1.8 mm thickness are entirely covered with gold foil and bent around the edges for fixation. Furthermore, there are five rectangular fitting plates whose broken edges were put together. It is most likely that some of their fragments are still missing.

40|$|AbstractFriction stir welding (FSW) has {{produced}} a great impact in several industries due to the advantages that this process presents. In particular, the automotive industry has developed {{a variant of the}} original process, called Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW), which has a strong interest related to the welding of aluminum alloys and dissimilar materials in thin sheets. Aluminum-steel welding is an actual challenge, being FSSW an alternative to produce these joints. However, the information available related to the influence of process parameters on the characteristics of aluminum-steel joints is scarce. The aim of this work was to study the effect of the <b>pin</b> <b>length</b> of the welding tool and its penetration depth, during friction stir spot welding (FSSW) of overlaps joints of AA 6063 with galvanized low carbon steel. FSSW was done by changing the pins length between 0. 65 and 1. 5 mm, and also by modifying the tool penetration depth in the welded joints. On the welded spots macro and microstructural characterization was performed, Vickers microhardness profiles were determined and Peel and Cross Tension Tests were also done.

The increased security we get from using system-generated PINs, however, comes at the cost of memorability. And while banks are increasingly adopting system generated, and longer (than traditional 4 -digit) PINs, the impact on memorability of such PINs is not really known. We conducted a large-scale online user study to investigate how memorability can be affected by increasing the <b>PIN</b> <b>length,</b> and how number chunking techniques (breaking a single number into multiple smaller numbers) can be applied to improve memorability. Our study shows that system-generated 4 -digit PINs outperform 6 -, 7 -, and 8 -digit PINs in long-term memorability, but that there is no significant difference between 6 -, 7 -, and 8 -digit PINs. Our results also show that chunking can improve memorability of system-generated PINs. For example, 8 -digit PINs broken into three chunks of 2 - 2 - 4 digits (00 — 00 — 0000) outperformed non-chunked 6 -, 7 -, and 8 -digit PINs in long-term memorability, without much increase in the time taken to authenticate.
