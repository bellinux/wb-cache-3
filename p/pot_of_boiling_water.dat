5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards {{around the kitchen table}} until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water,</b> the water is then reduced to a simmer, and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E

500|$|String hoppers, {{which are}} made of rice flour and look like knitted {{vermicelli}} neatly laid out in circular pieces about [...] in diameter, are frequently combined with tomato sothi (a soup) and curries for breakfast and dinner. Another common item is puttu, a granular, dry, but soft steamed rice powder cooked in a bamboo cylinder with the base wrapped in cloth so that the bamboo flute can be set upright over a clay <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water.</b> This can be transformed into varieties such as ragi, spinach, and tapioca puttu. There are also sweet and savoury puttus. Another popular breakfast or dinner dish is Appam, a thin crusty pancake made with rice flour, with a round soft crust in the middle. It has variations such as egg or milk Appam.|$|E
500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> {{for as long as it}} takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

Captain Kent, thirty men of your troop will hold the other three walls; but if you hear my dog-whistle, every man is to leave his post and come on here at a run. Thirty men more will man this front wall and towers. They are to direct their fire to check the crowd pushing forward behind those {{immediately}} assaulting. The remaining forty will fire through the loopholes as long as possible, and will then form round the breastwork and hold it to the last.

5000|$|The {{following}} day, {{there will}} be a kind of starch-paste {{on the bottom of the}} bowl, with a more or less clear liquid on top, which has to be discarded. Once the liquid has been removed, a small amount of the paste can then be poured into a flat plate or tray, and spread evenly in a thin layer.

50|$|Roxborogh's earlier works contain much biographical material. Many of the {{situations}} her characters find themselves dealing with are sourced from specific events {{in her own}} life. For example, the car accident Jeremy suffered in Runaway is exactly what she experienced. In Third Degree, {{a story about a}} 19-year-old university student Ruth, memories of a 10-year-old self are lifted straight from the memories of the time Roxborogh ran into her stepfather who was carrying a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> hot <b>water.</b> She was scalded very badly and suffered third degree burns. During her time in hospital she was not just scarred physically but was also subjected to a medical experiment.|$|R

60|$|This {{used to be}} {{a common}} and much-practised ordeal in Madagascar in days but {{recently}} past. It consisted in the administration of poison.

50|$|Several {{methods were}} {{applied in the}} {{preparation}} of locusts, prior to eating them. One of the more popular ways was to take the locusts after gathering them and to throw them into a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> salt <b>water.</b> After cooking for a few minutes, they were then removed from the pot and placed within a heated oven in order to dry them, or else spread out in the sun to dry. Once dry, they would take up the locusts and break off their heads, wings and legs and discard them, eating only the thorax and abdomen. Another method was to stoke an earthenware stove and, when fully heated, to cast them while alive into the cavity of the stove. Once roasted, they were taken out and a brine solution was sprinkled over them, before spreading them out in the sun to dry, usually upon one’s rooftop.|$|R
5000|$|Another popular {{account is}} {{the legend of}} a Potawatomi named Fleet Foot. In order to win his bride, he was {{required}} to run from his settlement to a point on the river and back before a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>boiled</b> away. This event {{is thought to have}} occurred in 1810, a couple of decades before the first permanent white settlers. The Potawatomi word kikalamezo appears on an 1823 atlas of the area. The word translates as [...] "boiling pot" [...] or [...] "place where the water boils," [...] and refers to the Fleet Foot legend.|$|R
60|$|Alric did {{not wait}} to hear {{the end of this}} answer, but pushing past the old man, hastened to the trap-door under the eaves and opened it. He found, however, that he could not use his bow in the {{constrained}} position necessary to enable him to shoot through the hole. In desperation he seized a barrel that chanced to be at hand, and overturned its contents on the heads of the foe. It happened to contain rye-flour, and the result was that two of the assailants were nearly blinded, while two others who stood beside them burst into a loud laugh, and, seizing the battle-axes which the others had been using, continued their efforts to drive in the door. By this time old Ivor had joined Alric. He set down the <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> {{by the side of the}} hole, and at once emptied its contents on the heads of the vikings, who uttered a terrific yell and leaped backward as the scalding water flowed over their heads and shoulders. A similar cry from the other door of the house told that the defence there had been equally successful. Almost at the same moment Alric discovered a small slit in the roof through which he could observe the enemy. He quickly sent through it an arrow, which fixed itself in the left shoulder of one of the men. This had the effect of inducing the attacking party to draw off for the purpose of consultation.|$|E

60|$|The {{first visit}} he paid {{was to the}} hyaenas, who trembled {{at the sight of}} him, and whispered to each other, 'How shall we escape from this terrible beast?' Meanwhile the little hare did not trouble himself about them, but just asked where the king of the hyaenas lived, and made himself quite at home there. Every morning each hyaena thought to himself, 'To-day he is certain to eat me;' but several days went by, and they were all still alive. At length, one evening, the little hare, looking round for {{something}} to amuse him, noticed a great <b>pot</b> full <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water,</b> so he strolled up to one of the hyaenas and said, 'Go and get in.' The hyaena dared not disobey, and in a few minutes was scalded to death. Then the little hare went the round of the village, saying to every hyaena he met, 'Go and get into the boiling water,' so that in a little while there was hardly a male left in the village.|$|R
40|$|The Pool Boiling Experiment (PBE) is {{designed}} to improve understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that constitute nucleate pool boiling. Nucleate pool boiling is a process wherein a stagnant pool of liquid is in contact with a surface that can supply heat to the liquid. If the liquid absorbs enough heat, a vapor bubble can be formed. This process occurs when a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>boils.</b> On Earth, gravity tends to remove the vapor bubble from the heating surface because it is dominated by buoyant convection. In the orbiting space shuttle, however, buoyant convection has much less of an effect because the forces of gravity are very small. The Pool Boiling Experiment was initiated to provide insight into this nucleate boiling process, which has many earthbound applications in steamgeneration power plants, petroleum plants, and other chemical plants. In addition, by using the test fluid R- 113, the Pool Boiling Experiment can provide some basic understanding <b>of</b> the <b>boiling</b> behavior <b>of</b> cryogenic fluids without the large cost of an experiment using an actual cryogen...|$|R

Even though the wind cools the temperature, the beauty of the Alaska landscape is cause enough for celebration. What a day this is! The ocean and the scenery are magnificent. A seafood feast planned for mid-afternoon has members of your party busy harvesting shellfish from the rocky beach. In less time than expected, buckets of harvested shellfish arrive {{at the feet of the}} chef. A steamer <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> salt <b>water</b> quickly cooks the bounty, and a few minutes later the harvest is devoured with gusto. What qualities could better represent a day in the Great Land? Reluctant to disrupt the excitement of the outing, George tells you that he feels a strange tingling on his lips and face. Your spouse is also experiencing the same strange numbness on her face. You, too busy to eat much, don’t understand as each guest complains of this strange ailment. Your spouse stumbles as she carries more food to the table. George becomes dizzy and nauseous. While helping him to a beach chair, you notice the volleyball team is leaving the playing area as each person becomes listless. The game is over, and unfortunately, so is the party. What is happening to these people? Could seafood fresh from the ocean cause such a serious condition? The problem is paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and there is little you can do at this point except to get these victims to a medical facility and fast. A potentially lethal event, PSP is a crisis no one wants to experience. As many coastal residents know, eating personally harvested shellfish is risky. As Alaskans you need to know about PSP, what health dangers it presents, and how you can reduce your risk of contracting this dreaded ailment...|$|R

60|$|When {{they reached}} shore the common sorts of fish were {{thrown to the}} dogs; {{a dozen of the}} best picked out, and with these two of the men started at once for the nearest village, where they would be sold for a few kopecks; the rest were handed over to the women, while the men {{proceeded}} to throw themselves down by the fire and smoke. Godfrey went to see how the women were getting on with the boat. They had already made a great deal of progress. The skins, which had been chosen by Luka from a pile in the hut, were already prepared by having fat rubbed into them. The hair was left on them, as that would come inside. The bad skins had been taken off, the others cut to fit, and now only required sewing into their places. As a matter of course Godfrey and Luka took their meals with the Ostjaks and greatly enjoyed the change of diet. They gladdened the hearts of their hosts by producing a packet of tea, of which a handful was poured into a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>boiling</b> over the fire.

6000|$|The Somal hold {{mainly to}} the Shafei school of El Islam: their {{principal}} peculiarity is that of not reciting prayers over the dead even in the towns. The marriage ceremony is simple: {{the price of the}} bride and the feast being duly arranged, the formula is recited by some priest or pilgrim. I have often been requested to officiate on these occasions, and the End of Time has done it by irreverently reciting the Fatihah over the happy pair. [18] The Somal, as usual amongst the heterogeneous mass amalgamated by El Islam, have a diversity of superstitions attesting their Pagan origin. Such for instance are their oaths by stones, their reverence of cairns and holy trees, and their ordeals of fire and water, the Bolungo of Western Africa. A man accused of murder or theft walks down a trench full of live charcoal and about a spear's length, or he draws out of the flames a smith's anvil heated to redness: some prefer picking four or five cowries from a large <b>pot</b> full <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>water.</b> The member used is at once rolled up in the intestines of a sheep and not inspected for a whole day. They have traditionary seers called Tawuli, like the Greegree-men of Western Africa, who, by inspecting the fat and bones of slaughtered cattle, [...] "do medicine," [...] predict rains, battles, and diseases of animals. This class is of both sexes: they never pray or bathe, and are therefore considered always impure; thus, being feared, they are greatly respected by the vulgar. Their predictions are delivered in a rude rhyme, often put for importance into the mouth of some deceased seer. During the three months called Rajalo [19] the Koran is not read over graves, and no marriage ever takes place. The reason of this peculiarity is stated to be imitation of their ancestor Ishak, who happened not to contract a matrimonial alliance at such epoch: it is, however, a manifest remnant of the Pagan's auspicious and inauspicious months. Thus they sacrifice she- camels in the month Sabuh, and keep holy with feasts and bonfires the Dubshid or New Year's Day. [20] At certain unlucky periods when the moon is in ill-omened Asterisms those who die are placed in bundles of matting upon a tree, the idea being that if buried a loss would result to the tribe.
