50|$|The patent {{describes}} Burt's machine {{as having}} a set of typeface characters that were arranged on the under side {{of a set of}} parts that had a lever pivoted to swing vertically and horizontally. The desired typeface character is brought to the <b>printing</b> <b>point</b> by moving this lever horizontally to a position over the same character in the index, and the impression on the paper is made by then depressing the lever. Different styles of typeface characters could be used. They were arranged in two rows on a lever. The rows of typeface characters could be shifted on the lever to bring either one to the <b>printing</b> <b>point.</b> The paper was carried in an endless band that traveled crosswise of the machine and the band was moved for letter space by the impression lever every time the lever is depressed to print. The line space was made by shifting the frame carrying the printing mechanism toward the front or rear of the machine, with the paper remaining stationary. Ink-pads were located at each side of the impression point, and all the typeface characters, except the one in the printing position, were inked every time the impression lever was depressed. Upper and lower case typeface letters could be used. A dial was provided that indicated the length of paper (inches) which had passed the <b>printing</b> <b>point</b> in printing each line. The operator knew the width of the paper being used each time. There was a stop printing indicator for end of the line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the [...] "Type Writer" [...] had two flaws that made the product susceptible to jams.Firstly, characters were mounted on metal arms or typebars, which would clash and jam if neighboring arms were pressed {{at the same time}} or in rapid succession. Secondly, its <b>printing</b> <b>point</b> was located beneath the paper carriage, invisible to the operator, a so-called [...] "up-stroke" [...] design. Consequently, jams were especially serious, because the typist could only discover the mishap by raising the carriage to inspect what had been typed. The solution was to place commonly used letter-pairs (like [...] "th" [...] or [...] "st") so that their typebars were not neighboring, avoiding jams.|$|E

The early Blickensderfer's [...] "Ideal" [...] keyboard was also non-QWERTY, instead having the sequence [...] "DHIATENSOR" [...] in the home row, these 10 letters being capable of composing 70% of the words in the English language.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} central {{goal for}} a player of STCCG is to obtain 100 points, primarily by completing missions or objectives. This is done by bringing personnel, ships and equipment into play, then moving an attempting team to a mission. Once a mission attempt starts, the personnel will create away teams to encounter dilemmas which will challenge them in some way. Often if the personnel have the required skills or attributes they can overcome certain dilemmas' effects. Once the required dilemmas are passed, the personnel still active in the attempt must have the skills and/or attribute totals required by the mission to solve it. If the mission is solved, the player earns the <b>printed</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The Ingenuity {{time-of-flight}} (TF) PET/MR is {{a recently}} developed hybrid scanner combining the molecular imaging capabilities of PET with the excellent soft tissue contrast of MRI. It is becoming common practice {{to characterize the}} system's point spread function (PSF) and understand its variation under spatial transformations to guide clinical studies and potentially use it within resolution recovery image reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, due to the system's utilization of overlapping and spherical symmetric Kaiser-Bessel basis functions during image reconstruction, its image space PSF and reconstructed spatial resolution could {{be affected by the}} selection of the basis function parameters. Hence, a detailed investigation into the multidimensional basis function parameter space is needed to evaluate the impact of these parameters on spatial resolution. Methods: Using an array of 12 x 7 <b>printed</b> <b>point</b> sources, along with a custom made phantom, and with the MR magnet on, the system's spatially variant image-based PSF was characterized in detail. Moreover, basis function parameters were systematically varied during reconstruction (list-mode TF OSEM) to evaluate their impact on the reconstructed resolution and the image space PSF. Following the spatial resolution optimization, phantom, and clinical studies were subsequently reconstructed using representative basis function parameters. Results: Based on the analysis and under standard basis function parameters, the axial and tangential components of the PSF were found to be almost invariant under spatial transformations (similar to 4 mm) while the radial component varied modestly from 4 to 6. 7 mm. Using a systematic investigation into the basis function parameter space, the spatial resolution was found to degrade for basis functions with a large radius and small shape parameter. However, it was found that optimizing the spatial resolution in the reconstructed PET images, while having a good basis function superposition and keeping the image representation error to a minimum, is feasible, with the parameter combination range depending upon the scanner's intrinsic resolution characteristics. Conclusions: Using the <b>printed</b> <b>point</b> source array as a MR compatible methodology for experimentally measuring the scanner's PSF, the system's spatially variant resolution properties were successfully evaluated in image space. Overall the PET subsystem exhibits excellent resolution characteristics mainly {{due to the fact that}} the raw data are not under-sampled/rebinned, enabling the spatial resolution to be dictated by the scanner's intrinsic resolution and the image reconstruction parameters. Due to the impact of these parameters on the resolution properties of the reconstructed images, the image space PSF varies both under spatial transformations and due to basis function parameter selection. Nonetheless, for a range of basis function parameters, the image space PSF remains unaffected, with the range depending on the scanner's intrinsic resolution properties.

40|$|The book {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} relationships between gender and power. Although the subject has been analysed on many occassions and {{in a variety of}} fashions, the volume does not duplicate the well-known views, but points to the limitations of the previous approaches and suggests possibilities of overcoming those. For the authors of the featured texts, gender also denotes sex in the biological sense, while power does not mean the omnipotent techniques of control, but also strategies of active resistance and emancipation. Having applied a different interpretative paradigm, the authors pose new questions to the already known research material: How to define the category of gender/sex in today's (trans) gender world? In what way do the deliberations on the nature and essence of power affect gender? Do men and women function equally within the machinery of power, assuming the roles of clearly defined cogs, i. e. the dominant (men) and the dominated (women) ones? Answering such questions requires a broad perspective, ranging from antiquity, when power was “invented” by being attributing one gender (though not without exceptions) and when the canon of speaking of what is “female” and “male” was devised, to the contemporary times, in which both categories and their mutual relationships undergo radical reevaluation.
