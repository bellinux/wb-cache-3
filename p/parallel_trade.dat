50|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>trade</b> {{activities}} have redistributed supplies {{of a lot}} of goods between Hong Kong and the mainland, increasing prices of the goods, for example, milk powder prices increased by 0.4 - 12% from 2009 to 2011. Apart from milk powder, prices of daily necessities in the New Territories also increased. Due to the appreciation of Renminbi against Hong Kong dollar, branded goods sold in Hong Kong which are denominated in Hong Kong dollars gave rise to big discounts for mainlanders who settle bills in Renminbi. Also, the Hong Kong government does not levy any custom tariff on both imports and exports of most products. Therefore, Hong Kong goods are cheaper compared to those in China. Moreover, competition for shop space to open pharmacies, cosmetics and jewellery shops to support <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> in the New Territories has driven rent in the New Territories up by two to three times from 2010 to 2012. Small shops catering to local needs are forced to close down and residents have fewer choices. Regional prices rise and increase residents' cost of living.|$|E

50|$|According to {{intellectual}} property expert and professor, Ariel Katz, S. 27(2)(e) {{is not meant}} to prevent parallel importation and the resulting market arbitrage. Rather, its purpose is to prevent regulatory arbitrage (protecting the integrity of Canada’s regulatory sovereignty). Section 3 of the Copyright Act does not give a general distribution right; it only gives the right to make copies and publish a work if it is unpublished. This means that a copyright owner does {{not have the right to}} prevent parallel importation if he owns the copyright in both countries, since he does not have the general right to distribute (so cannot exclude others). Thus, he should not be able to prevent parallel importation merely by assigning his copyright. He cannot assign a right that did not exist in the first place. Moreover, Canadian law does not prevent <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> domestically (that is, between provinces), so there is no reason to prevent it internationally.|$|E

40|$|Different {{from the}} {{economic}} approach predominantly adopted in many foreign studies in relation to grey market economy, this research aims at studying the rampant <b>parallel</b> <b>trading</b> activities in the North District of Hong Kong {{as well as the}} associated public disorder from criminological perspective. By applying relevant criminological theories, it serves to offer understanding and explanation of the operation of such quasi-criminal activities. Although the illegality of such activities is generally undefined in the existing laws of Hong Kong, its unique social and criminological nature, which has been rarely studied, would be subject to in-depth exploration in this research. Site observation was conducted with a view to obtaining first-hand information on the ground-level operation and social disturbance at selected timings. In-depth interviews with various stakeholders involved in the <b>parallel</b> <b>trading</b> were also conducted to seek better understanding of the couriers’ background motive and concerns, {{at the same time to}} examine the corresponding policing strategies and practices adopted by different law enforcement agencies (LEAs) such as Police, Customs and Immigration. Not only the drives and process of this kind of grey market operation will be analyzed, the unprecedented and serious social, political and public order impacts associated with the <b>parallel</b> <b>trading</b> in the North District will be investigated as well via the media content analysis, since the issues have been periodically gaining the attention of the general public.

However, <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> freedom is likely to be beneficial to consumers in the country with the larger market.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> {{has become a}} critical issue in the global trading system, as the welfare effects of <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> freedom are generally ambiguous. In this paper we investigate the welfare effects of <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> freedom for low, intermediate, and high trade costs and different levels of market size. By analyzing a game played between a domestic monopolistic manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and a foreign exclusive distributor we, first, show that <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> reduces the profit of the manufacturer and his incentives to invest in R&D. In addition to this first finding, we show, secondly, that {{the question as to}} whether <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> freedom has positive or negative welfare properties depends on the level of trade cost and the heterogeneity of countries in terms of market size. In particular, we find that <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> freedom has a positive effect on global welfare if countries are sufficiently heterogeneous in terms of market size and if trade costs are intermediate and low, respectively. Surprisingly, this result even holds in a situation where <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> freedom implies the closure of the smaller market. If, however, countries are virtually homogenous in terms of market size, <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> freedom may be detrimental to global welfare for specific levels of trade costs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>trade</b> is the resale of {{a product}} by a {{wholesaler}} in a market other than that intended by the manufacturer. One of its consequences is that manufacturers may be prevented from price discriminating between markets that have different willingness {{to pay for the}} product in question. Some legal regimes give the manu-facturer the right to prohibit <b>parallel</b> <b>trade,</b> but others do not. We examine the policy implications of <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> {{in a world in which}} manufacturers invest in product quality, and have the possibility to develop different quality variants of their goods. We also consider the possibility that the authorities may impose price caps and compulsory licensing (as commonly occurs for some pharmaceutical products). We find that taking investment incentives into account makes <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> much less likely to enhance overall welfare, which implies that <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> in products intensive in R&D, such as pharmaceuticals, is less desirable than in fields such as branded consumer products. We also find that, somewhat surprisingly, the threat of <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> does not induce firms to market inferior versions of their products in poor countries. However, <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> is less likely to be detrimental to welfare when there are price caps, since compulsory licensing can mitigate the major cost of <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> (namely a refusal to supply a poor country market) ...|$|E

We follow a game-theoretic approach and employ descriptive statistics and econometric methods to {{study the effects of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> on competition from a theoretic and empirical perspective. The theoretic approach suggests that there is a unique Nash equilibrium, and the parallel trader sets prices at the same level as the locally sourced product, while the price of the latter remains unaffected by <b>parallel</b> <b>trade.</b> However, there may be deviations from this equilibrium in the presence of particular policies or generic competition, in which case the parallel traded product may be priced at lower levels than the locally sourced product. Empirical analysis confirms the predictions of the theory. Descriptive statistics show that there is no gap between locally sourced and parallel traded products, unless generics or policies encouraging <b>parallel</b> <b>trade</b> are present.
