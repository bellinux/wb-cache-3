40|$|SummaryAn in vivo <b>plant</b> <b>screen</b> {{that allows}} for the {{analysis}} of exogenously applied substrates against transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing individual cytochrome P 450 s has been developed. By deploying this screen with a subset of 91 P 450 s, we have identified an original substrate for members of the CYP 82 C subfamily. The therapeutic compound 8 -methoxypsoralen was hydroxylated by plants overexpressing CYP 82 C 2 or CYP 82 C 4, forming 5 -hydroxy- 8 -methoxypsoralen. Additionally, plants further modified this product to create a glycosylated compound, likely the compound 5 -O-β-D-glucopyranosyl- 8 -methoxypsoralen. The discovery of adducts of therapeutic compounds demonstrates the potential of this biocatalysis screening approach to create compounds that may be of pharmacological value. Additionally, this platform provides a means to expand the general knowledge base of P 450 enzyme/substrate combinations and may provide valuable tools for a vast array of biocatalytic and bioremediation processes...|$|E

50|$|Somaclonal {{variation}} is not restricted to, but is particularly common in, plants regenerated from callus. The variations can be genotypic or phenotypic, {{which in the}} latter case can be either genetic or epigenetic in origin. Typical genetic alterations are: changes in chromosome numbers (polyploidy and aneuploidy), chromosome structure (translocations, deletions, insertions and duplications) and DNA sequence (base mutations). A typical epigenetics-related event would be gene methylation. If no visual, morphogenic changes are apparent, other <b>plant</b> <b>screening</b> procedures must be applied. There are both benefits and disadvantages to somaclonal variation. The phenomenon of high variability in individuals from plant cell cultures or adventitious shoots has been named somaclonal variation.|$|R
40|$|Aq. exts. of 46 plants {{belonging}} to 32 different {{families of the}} <b>plant</b> kingdom were <b>screened</b> for antifungal activity against eight important species of Fusarium viz., Fusarium equiseti, F. moniliforme, F. semitectum, F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. solani and F. lateritium. The test fungi were isolated from maize, paddy and sorghum seeds collected from Mysore district, Mysore, India. Among the several <b>plants</b> <b>screened</b> only 12 <b>plants</b> have recorded significant antifungal activity. The antifungal activity of aq. exts. varied among the test pathogens and was {{compared with that of}} the synthetic fungicides Blitox, Captan, Dithane M- 45 and Thiram. F. proliferatum, which showed high susceptibility for the aq. exts., was tested using different solvent exts. viz., petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, methanol and ethanol exts. of all the 12 plants. The results revealed that these plants could be exploited for ecofriendly management of the diseases caused by the test fungal pathogens and seed biodeterioration during storage.

40|$|In 1974 {{the first}} {{resistance}} screening trials for smut (Ustilago scitaminea H&P Sydow) were planted at the Pongola Research Station in northern KwaZulu Natal. Since then, with the continued breeding, selection and adoption of more smut resistant genotypes, {{there has been}} a gradual decrease in smut susceptible varieties grown in the Pongola area and, presumably, a decrease in smut spore inoculum. Certainly, increasingly low levels of infection had been recorded in the autumn (March) <b>planted</b> smut <b>screening</b> trials that rely on natural infection, even in the susceptible standard variety NCo 376. The timing of the autumn <b>planted</b> <b>screening</b> trials has been a matter of convenience, being related to the availability of suitable planting material. However, previous observations had indicated that the susceptibility to smut was greater in cane planted in spring or summer than in autumn or winter. A trial was therefore conducted to compare the susceptibility of genotypes planted in March with the same genotypes planted in September. Results from the two planting dates, covering the plant crop and the first and second ratoon crops, confirm that higher and more consistent levels of smut infection are obtained when the cane is planted in spring...|$|R
