40|$|When {{studying}} structural vibrations {{resulting from}} a concentrated source, many structures may be modelled as a finite beam excited by a point source. The theoretical limit on cancelling the resulting beam vibrations by utilizing another point source as an active controller is explored. Three different types of excitation are considered, harmonic, random, and transient. In each case, a cost function is defined and minimized for numerous parameter variations. For the case of harmonic excitation, the cost function is obtained by integrating the mean squared displacement over a region of the beam in which control is desired. A controller is then found to minimize this cost function in the control interval. The control interval and controller location are continuously varied for several frequencies of excitation. The results show that control over the entire beam length is possible only when the excitation frequency is near a resonant frequency of the beam, but control over a subregion may be obtained even between resonant frequencies {{at the cost of}} increasing the vibration outside of the control region. For random excitation, the cost function is realized by integrating the expected value of the displacement squared over the interval of the beam in which control is desired. This is shown to yield the identical cost function as obtained by integrating the cost function for harmonic excitation over all excitation frequencies. As a result, it is always possible to reduce the cost function for random excitation whether controlling the entire beam or just a subregion, without ever increasing the vibration outside the region in which control is desired. The last type of excitation considered is a single, transient pulse. A cost function representative of the beam vibration is obtained by integrating the transient displacement squared over a region of the beam and over all time. The form of the controller is chosen a priori as either one or two delayed pulses. Delays constrain the controller to be causal. The best possible control is then examined while varying the region of control and the controller location. It is found that control is always possible using either one or two control pulses. The two <b>pulse</b> <b>controller</b> gives better performance than a single <b>pulse</b> <b>controller,</b> but finding the optimal delay time for the additional controllers increases as the square of the number of control pulses...|$|E

40|$|HIPIMS/HPPMS as {{promising}} sputter technology uses highly ionized particles to grow {{thin films}} from metallic or ceramic targets. [1, 2, 3, 4]. The ionization degree of the plasma is {{strongly related to}} the discharge parameters and can be tuned to values higher than 100 percent by producing double and even higher charged ions at elevated discharge current densities of 1 A/cm 2 and more. The benefit of the high ionization degree {{can be seen in}} the fact that the majority of the particles inside the process chamber is ionized and can contribute to the situation at the substrate surface, where thin films can be grown with new material mixtures and properties. A multi channel <b>pulse</b> pattern <b>controller</b> produced by IfU Diagnostic Systems GmbH is used to control the pulse power supply, which drives single or double magnetro in a modified industrial deposition chamber. The magnetic field strength of the magnetrons was increased to achieve a better HIPIMS/HPPMS performance.

The pulse patterns easily can be edited by PC based user interaction. All of the pulse pattern parameters like on-time, off-time, number and position of the pulses as well as the position of the sync pulse can be adjusted by the user in time steps of 0. 1 microsecond.

The MPS needs to monitor the status of all devices that could enter the beam path, the beam loss monitors (BLMs), magnet settings, beam dump status, etc. This information is then presented to the electron source controller, which must limit the beam power or shut down the beam completely. The MPS for the energy recovery linac (ERL) at the Jefferson Lab Free Electron Laser [1] generates eight different power limits, or beam modes, which are passed to the drive laser <b>pulse</b> <b>controller</b> (DLPC) (photocathode source controller).

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} misfire detection. In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). Misfire detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective ignition plugs, leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of misfire detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a misfire detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for misfire detection. The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for misfire detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed misfire detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.

40|$|Cortisol is {{released}} to relay information to cells to regulate metabolism and reaction to stress and inflammation. In particular, cortisol {{is released}} {{in the form of}} pulsatile signals. This low-energy method of signaling seems to be more efficient than continuous signaling. We hypothesize that there is a controller in the anterior pituitary that leads to pulsatile release of cortisol, and propose a mathematical formulation for such controller, which leads to impulse control as opposed to continuous control. We postulate that this controller is minimizing the number of secretory events that result in cortisol secretion, which is a way of minimizing the energy required for cortisol secretion; this controller maintains the blood cortisol levels within a specific circadian range while complying with the first order dynamics underlying cortisol secretion. We use an l 0 -norm cost function for this controller, and solve a reweighed l 1 -norm minimization algorithm for obtaining the solution to this optimization problem. We use 4 examples to illustrate the performance of this approach: (i) a toy problem that achieves impulse control, (ii) two examples that achieve physiologically plausible pulsatile cortisol release, (iii) an example where the number of pulses is not within the physiologically plausible range for healthy subjects while the cortisol levels are within the desired range. This novel approach results in impulse control where the impulses and the obtained blood cortisol levels have a circadian rhythm and an ultradian rhythm that are in agreement with the known physiology of cortisol secretion. The proposed formulation is a first step in developing intermittent controllers for curing cortisol deficiency.

Based on a voltage-source converter, the STATCOM regulates system voltage by absorbing or generating reactive power. This paper deals with a cascaded multilevel converter model, which is a 48 -pulse (three levels) GTO converter. The simulation studies are carried for sending end, middle and receiving end of the transmission line. The objective is to define the reactive power generated and voltage control at different locations (at sending end, middle, receiving end) of transmission line using STATCOM...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{technology}} offers various opportunities for solar cell manufacturing. The key success factor {{for many of}} these is processing velocity. Applications such as surface texturing for light trapping and drilling for wrap through emitters require substantial amounts of features to be processed in the area of a cell with a small spacing. In many cases lasers struggle to deliver productivity required for in-line production and increasing the number of lasers for higher productivity is expensive and requires more space than is available. The more suitable way to extend processing capabilities is improving process efficiency. MOPA fiber lasers allow independent adjustment of pulse parameters, such as pulse energy and pulse width. Experiments showed that the material removal efficiency can be increased significantly by maintaining a proper intensity level by adjusting the pulse width. This resulted in an improvement in the efficiency of drilling and texturing. Through holes i n 200 m silicon wafers were drilled using only 6. 5 mJ per hole, resulting in a drilling rate of more than 150 holes per Joule. A FPGA-based <b>pulse</b> synchronization <b>controller</b> was developed for synchronizing the laser pulses with high velocity scanner movement. Using the parallel processing capabilities of the FPGA, the reached pulse positioning accuracy at 5 m/s indicated a temporal resolution of less than 400 nanoseconds. In actuality, the control has a higher resolution of less than 100 ns, as part of the positioning accuracy depends on the scanner. This paper describes the developed MOPA laser system, including the FPGA-based synchronization controller and processing results for high rate drilling and texturing of silicon...|$|R
5000|$|An {{external}} 5¼-inch {{floppy disk}} drive, the Disk II, attached via a controller card that plugged {{into one of}} the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by Steve Wozniak, was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components. While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic <b>pulses,</b> Wozniak's <b>controller</b> card had few chips; instead, the Apple DOS used software to perform these functions. The Group Coded Recording used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common MFM. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for proprietary software developers to copy-protect the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called [...] "recalibration", made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices.|$|R
40|$|Very compact 70 MeV pulse race-track {{microtron}} {{is under}} construction now. To acquire outputs of beam-current transformers on every orbit and pulses of high voltage and RF field a distributed multi-channel beam diagnostic system was developed. Each acquisition controller consists of four fast differential amplifiers and one DSP-based micro-controller with on-chip ADC and CAN-bus controller. Each amplifier is coupled with beam-current transformer and has bandwidth of up to 150 MHz and gain of up to 10. One of four channels is acquired during a measurement cycle. Another channel could be selected between two following <b>pulses.</b> All the <b>controllers</b> are connected via optically coupled CAN-bus with a host diskless PC running under Linux with the RTLinux extension. Dedicated software of the system consists of low level acquisition software for DSP, network software for controllers and host PC, application software for PC to present date for operator and control system. Standard CAN application layers were considered but refused because of the closed character of the whole system and centralised synchronisation of the whole system. ...|$|R
40|$|Power flow control, in an {{existing}} long transmission line, plays {{a vital role}} in Power System area. This paper employs the shunt and series connected compensation based FACTS device for the control of voltage and the power flow in long distance transmission line. The proposed devices were used in different locations for optimal allocation. The PWM control strategy is used to generate the firing <b>pulses</b> of the <b>controller</b> circuit. Simulations were carried out using MATLAB Simulink environment. The suitable location and the performance of the proposed model were examined. Totally three steps evolved in the proposed; firstly the transmission loadability can be calculated across each bus in IEEE 14 Bus system.

Henceforth the location of FACTS devices can enhanced the transmission loadability...|$|R
