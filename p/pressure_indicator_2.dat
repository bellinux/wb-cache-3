40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} the possibility to capture the physical effect on the flow via a hybrid piezoelectric-shape memory alloy actuation at high Reynolds numbers using Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> at the trailing-edge of morphing wing prototype. The aim is to identify both the highand low-frequent turbulent structures using distributed pressure indicators and thereby identify the actuation effect on the flow.  To this end the design of the PVDF based <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> as a function of the Reynolds number, desired frequency and maximum attenuation will be described.

40|$|<b>Indicators</b> {{of fishing}} <b>pressure</b> are {{necessary}} to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). We present a framework that distinguishes four levels of <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> that move from being a simple description of anthropogenic activity to more precisely describing the actual pressure on the ecosystem and its components, but which require increasingly more information to be quantified. We use {{the example of the}} Dutch beam trawl fleet in the North Sea to compare these <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators,</b> as the level of information used is increased. The first level is that of fleet capacity (e. g. number of vessels), the second is fishing effort, usually expressed as the number of hours fishing or days at sea, the third incorporates fishing parameters such as the proportion of time actually spent fishing, fishing speed, or gear characteristics, e. g. the size of the beam trawl {{in order to determine the}} frequency with which an area is fished, and at the fourth level, the most informative measure of fishing pressure, annual fishing mortality, is available for a few commercial species from stock assessments. For other species, it can be calculated from the lower level <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> through the incorporation of the chance of individuals of a species coming into contact with the fishing gear and the encounter mortality, which is the portion of mortality caused by the passing of the gear. Comparison of trends and absolute values shows that the <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> at different levels differ considerably in their description of both present and historical fishing impact in the North Sea. Therefore, for an EAFM, we advise using the highest level <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> that can be obtained with the data available...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{external}} {{political pressures}} calling for faster renminbi (RMB) appreciation have any statistically {{significant effect on}} both the daily returns and the conditional volatility of the RMB central parity rate. We construct various external <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> according to the sources of foreign political pressures pertaining to the RMB exchange rate, with a special emphasis on the pressures originated in the United States. After controlling for the underlying domestic factors, we find that neither the overall foreign <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> nor the US-specific <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> has any significant influence on RMB¡¦s daily returns. However, there is strong {{evidence to suggest that}} external pressures, and especially those from US sources, have a statistically significant impact on the conditional volatility of the RMB exchange rate. In other words, even though external pressures do not seem to have systematic influence on the speed of the RMB appreciation, they do seem to influence the uncertainty in the daily changes of the RMB exchange rate.

40|$|Ecological {{integrity}} (EI), {{a concept}} {{referring to the}} structural and functional components of ecosystems, which {{is closely related to}} the integrity and stability of biotic communities, has deteriorated markedly in freshwater ecosystems across the globe. In New Zealand, many deep lakes appear to have been affected to a lesser extent by anthropogenic activities. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify and quantify a range of key in-lake indicators that could be used to report EI for deep New Zealand lakes, many of which may be expected to have high EI values. Individual indicators of EI in the lakes were related statistically to selected anthropogenic <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators.</b> Values of EI were only weakly related to the anthropogenic <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators,</b> and catchment and lake morphometric and climate characteristics were strong moderators of the relationship and suggests that monitoring of EI requires careful consideration of natural variability amongst different lake ecosystems. Physico-chemical indicators of EI tended to be more closely related to anthropogenic <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> than biological EI indicators. Monitoring of physico-chemical and biological indicators in a set of reference lakes largely devoid of anthropogenic influences will help to better define elements of EI which include “nativeness”, “pristineness”, diversity and resilience.

40|$|High {{uncertainties}} {{may exist}} in the predrill pore pressure prediction in new prospects and deepwater subsalt wells; therefore, real-time pore pressure detection is highly needed to reduce drilling risks. The methods for pore pressure detection (the resistivity, sonic, and corrected d-exponent methods) are improved using the depth-dependent normal compaction equations {{to adapt to the}} requirements of the real-time monitoring. A new method is proposed to calculate pore pressure from the connection gas or elevated background gas, which can be used for real-time pore pressure detection. The pore pressure detection using the logging-while-drilling, measurement-while-drilling, and mud logging data is also implemented and evaluated. Abnormal pore <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> from the well logs, mud logs, and wellbore instability events are identified and analyzed to interpret abnormal pore pressures for guiding real-time drilling decisions.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of ecosystems alterations {{has become a}} crucial task {{in order to develop}} valuable habitats for rare and threatened species. The information extracted from hyperspectral remote sensing data enables the generation of highly spatially resolved analyses of such species’ habitats. In our study we combine information from a species ordination with hyperspectral reflectance signatures to predict occurrence probabilities for Natura 2000 habitat types and their conservation status. We examine how accurate habitat types and habitat threat, expressed by <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators,</b> can be described in an ordination space using spatial correlation functions from the geostatistic approach. We modeled habitat quality assessment parameters using floristic gradients derived by non-metric multidimensional scaling on the basis of 58 field plots. In the resulting ordination space, the variance structure of habitat types and <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> could be explained by 69 % up to 95 % with fitted variogram models with a correlation to terrestrial mapping of > 0. 8. Models could be used to predict habitat type probability, habitat transition, and <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> continuously over the whole ordination space. Finally, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate spectral information from AISA DUAL imagery to floristic pattern and related habitat quality. In general, spectral transferability is supported by strong correlation to ordination axes scores (R 2 = 0. 79 – 0. 85), whereas second axis of dry heaths (R 2 = 0. 13) and first axis for pioneer grasslands (R 2 = 0. 49) are more difficult to describe...|$|R

40|$|The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries {{requires}} that managers {{take account of}} the environmental impacts of fishing. We develop linked state and <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> that show the impact of bottomtrawling on benthic communities. The state indicator measures the proportion of an area where benthic invertebrate biomass (B) or production (P) is more than 90 % of pristine benthic biomass (B 0. 9) or production (P 0. 9). The <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> measures the proportion of the area where trawling frequency is sufficiently high to prevent reaching predicted B 0. 9 or P 0. 9. Time to recovery to B 0. 9 and P 0. 9 after trawling, depending on the habitat, was estimated using a validated size-based model of the benthic community. Based on trawling intensity in 2003, 53. 5 % of the southern North Sea was trawled too frequently for biomass to reach B 0. 9, and 27. 1 % was trawled too frequently for production to reach P 0. 9. As a result of bottom-trawling in 2003, in 56 % of the southern North Sea benthic biomass was below B 0. 9, whereas in 27 % of the southern North Sea benthic production was below P 0. 9. Modeled recovery times were comparable to literature estimates (2. 5 to more than 6 years). The advantages of using the area with an ecological impact of trawling as a <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> are that it is conceptually easy to understand, it responds quickly to changes in management action, it can be implemented at a relevant scale for fisheries management, and the necessary effort distribution data are centrally collected. One of this approach’s greatest utilities, therefore, will be to communicate to policy makers and fishing enterprises the expected medium- to long-term ecological benefits that will accrue if the frequency of trawling in particular parts of fishing grounds is reduced.
