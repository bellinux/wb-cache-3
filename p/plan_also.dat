5|$|In 1941, the New York City Planning Department {{proposed}} the Gun Hill Crosstown Highway as an upgrade, {{but nothing happened}} with this plan. In the mid-1960s, the Tri-State Transportation Commission proposed a new route just a mile north of Gun Hill Road called the City Line Expressway; this <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> did not advance.|$|E
5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance <b>plan,</b> <b>also</b> known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E

5|$|Government {{officials}} and businessmen from Paraguay began negotiations in 2007 with Brazilian automakers {{in order to}} import flex cars that run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol. If successful, Paraguay would become the first destination for Brazilian flex-fuel car exports. In May 2008, the Paraguayan government announced a plan to eliminate import taxes of flex-fuel vehicles and an incentive program for ethanol production. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{through the}} {{ambassador}} to the Ottoman Empire, Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie, and because of a long-standing Franco-Ottoman alliance, Charles and Catherine proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French Huguenots and French and German Lutherans in Ottoman-controlled Moldavia, {{in order to create}} a military colony and a buffer against the Habsburg. This <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from France, but it failed to interest the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, Presidency Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff {{announced}} plans to significantly {{reduce the number of}} flights operating at Congonhas. The plan included banning, within 60 days, all connection, stopover, charter, and international flights and the {{reduction in the number of}} private jets. The airport would only operate direct flights to certain cities in Brazil. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> called for a study of the expansion of São Paulo's two current airports and the construction of a third airport in the metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|The modern city of Ashdod {{city was}} built outside the {{historic}} settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan. The planners divided the city into seventeen neighborhoods of {{ten to fifteen}} thousand people. Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city. Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, and health and education infrastructure. The original <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> called for a business and administrative center, built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years.|$|E
5|$|The plan's aim was {{to rebuild}} the {{democratic}} and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery. One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US policy in the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Centralized {{buildings}} of circular or octagonal <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> became used for baptistries and reliquaries {{due to the}} suitability of those shapes for assembly around a single object. Baptisteries began {{to be built in}} the manner of domed mausolea during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran Baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. The Church of the Holy Apostles, or Apostoleion, probably planned by Constantine but built by his successor Constantius in the new capital city of Constantinople, combined the congregational basilica with the centralized shrine. With a similar plan to that of the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, four naves projected from a central rotunda containing Constantine's tomb and spaces for the tombs of the twelve Apostles. Above the center may have been a clerestory with a wooden dome roofed with bronze sheeting and gold accents.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{postponement}} {{the scale}} of Operation Tsurugi was expanded to include 60 G4Ms carrying 300 naval commandos from the 101st Kure Special Naval Landing Force and 300 Army commandos from the 1st Raiding Regiment. It was planned that 20 G4Ms would carry naval commandos to Guam, another 20 would carry army commandos to Saipan and the remaining 20 would transport a joint Army–Navy force to Tinian. The revised <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> called for a B-29 to be captured and flown back to Japan. This attack was scheduled to take place between August19 and 23. Allied intelligence became aware of Operation Tsurugi, however, and another carrier attack on Honshu destroyed 29 G4Ms and 20 P1Ys on August9. While the operation was not called off after this raid, it did not go ahead after the Japanese surrender on 15August. The Japanese military also developed a plan to attack Saipan using Mitsubishi Ki-167 suicide aircraft during August, but nothing came of this.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{launched}} an offensive against France and, {{adhering to the}} Manstein <b>Plan</b> <b>also</b> attacked the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940. That same day British forces landed in Iceland and the Faroes to preempt a possible German invasion of the islands. The U.S., in close co-operation with the Danish envoy to Washington D.C., agreed to protect Greenland, laying the political framework for the formal establishment of bases in April 1941. The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics {{in a few days}} and weeks, respectively. The French-fortified Maginot Line and {{the main body of the}} Allied forces which had moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes region, mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. As a result, the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten. The majority were taken prisoner, whilst over 300,000, mostly British and French, were evacuated from the continent at Dunkirk by early June, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the city}} drafted a new master <b>plan,</b> <b>also</b> {{known as the}} Growth Management Guide 2000, which would {{transform}} downtown Flagstaff from a shopping and trade center into a regional center for finance, office use, and government. The city built a new city hall, library, and the Coconino County Administrative Building in the downtown district, staking an investment by the local government for years to come. In 1992, the city hired a new manager, Dave Wilcox, who had previously worked at revitalizing the downtown areas of Beloit, Wisconsin and Missoula, Montana. During the 1990s, the downtown area underwent a revitalization, {{many of the city}} sidewalks were repaved with decorative brick facing, and a different mix of shops and restaurants opened up {{to take advantage of the}} area's historical appeal.|$|E

5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1957, the British {{territory}} of Malaya received {{its independence from}} the Crown {{as a part of}} Britain's colonial withdrawal from the Far East, after nearly a decade of tortuous counter-insurgency warfare by British and Commonwealth troops against Malayan rebels in the Malayan Emergency. British plans dictated that the new state would be federated with the British colonies of Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei in northern Borneo in order to better protect British military and economic interests in those regions. Brunei did not join, but Sarawak, Sabah, and Singapore had all agreed to join the new Federation by 1963. This project, labeled the 'Grand Design' by politician Malcolm MacDonald in the 1950s, became the cornerstone of British strategic thinking concerning Southeast Asia, and led to the initial federation of the numerous Malayan states in spite of their multifarious differences, with Singapore and the Borneo states to join later. This <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> earned the support of the Malaysian government, which hoped to forestall claims from Indonesia on Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Political {{conflicts}} in Vienna delayed Austria's {{entry into the}} Third Coalition until 1805. After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801, Archduke Charles—the emperor's brother—took advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan. He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803–04, but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack, Lieutenant Field Marshal and Quartermaster-General of the Army, implemented his own restructuring. Mack bypassed Charles' methodical approach. Occurring in the field, Mack's <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> undermined the overall command and organizational structure. Regardless, Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military's readiness. Furthermore, after misreading Napoleon's maneuvers in Württemberg, Mack reported to Vienna on the weakness of French dispositions. His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor, Francis II, to enter the conflict against France, despite Charles' own advice to the contrary. Responding to the report and rampant anti-French fever in Vienna, Francis dismissed Charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed his Francophobic brother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand, as commander.|$|E

5|$|The 2002–03 Australian region cyclone season {{included}} Cyclone Inigo, which {{tied with}} Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 {{as the most}} intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin. It began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003. The regional tropical cyclone operational <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> defines a tropical cyclone year separately from a tropical cyclone season, which runs from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region, which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90°E and 180°E. The season's ten tropical depressions existed within these dates, with the first, designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on 27 December 2002. The last system, Cyclone Epi, dissipated on 6 June 2003. Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane and one in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|The Generalplan Ost ("General Plan for the East") {{called for}} deporting the {{population}} of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered. To determine who should be killed, Himmler created the Volksliste, a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood. He ordered that those of Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away or be assigned to forced labour. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> included the kidnapping of children deemed to have Aryan-Nordic traits, who were presumed to be of German descent. The goal was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the invasion failed Hitler had to consider other options. One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland, Palestine or Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Rijeka {{development}} master plan, {{devised by}} Rotterdam Maritime Group, specifies further expansion of port facilities by 2030, including {{the construction of}} a large container terminal in Omišalj on Krk Island, near the JANAF Omišalj oil terminal. The container terminal would increase the annual capacity of the port by 2.5million TEUs. The plan requires construction of a high performance railway to Zagreb and a rail link planned by Croatian Railways to the proposed island terminal. The new line entails building a new bridge to Krk Island in addition to the existing Krk Bridge. The <b>plan</b> <b>also</b> includes expansion of the existing terminals, and is estimated to require an additional US$150 million. Likewise, an expansion of the Liquid Cargo Terminal is planned, as well as an expansion of the Bakar Bay facility, where a car terminal is planned. The expansion of the port, improvement of transportation links and the strategic partnership are aimed at establishing Rijeka as the largest container port on the Adriatic Sea.|$|E
