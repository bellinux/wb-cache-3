5000|$|The use of rabbit pelts in the {{commercial}} fur trade took off in the 1920s, when it was incorporated into everything from hats to stoles, coats and baby blankets. By 1924, it accounted for half the US fur trade. While it was considerably cheaper than furs from other animals, it had softness and density and could also be dyed, plucked or sheared to look like other furs - shearing was also known as blocking.White pelts commanded a premium since they could be most easily dyed and in their natural state bore a close resemblance to much <b>pricer</b> ermine (stoat). New Zealand white rabbit (actually bred in the US) was highly prized, but other rabbit varieties in different hues - including Havana, Lilac and Checkered Giant were also valuable because they {{could be used in}} their natural colouring.

Live and carcass <b>prices</b> from 1987 to 1992 were found to be highly correlated. The average monthly <b>price</b> spread between the Omaha live <b>price</b> and the USDA carcass <b>price</b> ranged from $ 14. 02 to $ 23. 18 cwt, with an average spread of $ 17. 53 cwt.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the possibility, {{heretofore}} unexplored in the marketing literature, that firms “invest funds” in their <b>pricing</b> processes.

To do this we undertook a two-year, cross- disciplinary, ethnographic study on the nature of investments made by senior managers to enhance the effectiveness of the <b>pricing</b> processes within their firms. We discovered at least three distinct types of investments that managers at these firms made to <b>price</b> more effectively, which we term as the three capitals of <b>pricing</b> - human capital, systems capital and social capital. Our evidence suggests that <b>pricing</b> is really about managing both <b>prices</b> and investments in the <b>pricing</b> capital used to set and adjust those <b>prices.</b> The existence of these three forms of <b>pricing</b> capital provides a new perspective on <b>pricing</b> strategy, suggesting that firms compete on <b>prices</b> simultaneously in three different ways within their organizations. First, they compete on whether to invest in <b>pricing</b> capital versus or other areas of capital investment, such as plant, equipment, etc. Second, they decide what form of <b>pricing</b> capital to invest in – human, systems or social. Third, they set and adjust <b>prices</b> constrained by the existing <b>pricing</b> capital they have in place {{at the time of their}} <b>pricing</b> actions.
