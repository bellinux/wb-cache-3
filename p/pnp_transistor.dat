40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} the nonidealities of temperature sensors based on substrate <b>pnp</b> <b>transistors</b> and shows how their {{influence can be}} minimized. It focuses on temperature measure-ment using {{the difference between the}} base-emitter voltages of a transistor operated at two current densities. This difference is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). The effects of series resistance, current–gain variation, high-level injection, and the Early effect on the accuracy of this PTAT voltage are discussed. The results of measurements made on substrate <b>pnp</b> <b>transistors</b> in a standard 0. 5 - m CMOS process are presented to illustrate the effects of these nonidealities. It is shown that the modeling of the PTAT voltage can be improved by taking the temperature dependency of the effective emission coefficient into account using the reverse Early effect. With this refinement, the temperature can be extracted from the measurement data with an absolute accuracy of 0. 1 C in the range of 50 to 130 C.

2500|$|The diagram shows a {{schematic}} representation of an NPN transistor connected to two voltage sources. ( [...] The same description applies to a <b>PNP</b> <b>transistor</b> with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.) [...] To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on {{the order of}} 1mA) from C to E, VBE must be above a minimum value {{sometimes referred to as}} the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage is usually about 650mV for silicon BJTs at room temperature but can be different {{depending on the type of}} transistor and its biasing. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, IB. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE=IB+IC).|$|E

40|$|Total dose {{damage in}} bipolar {{integrated}} circuits is investigated at low temperature, {{along with the}} temperature dependence of the electrical parameters of internal transistors. Bandgap narrowing causes the gain of npn transistors to decrease far more at low temperature compared to <b>pnp</b> <b>transistors,</b> due to the large difference in emitter doping concentration. When irradiations are done at temperatures of - 140 deg C, no damage occurs until devices are warmed to temperatures above - 50 deg C. After warm-up, subsequent cooling shows that damage is then present at low temperature. This {{can be explained by}} the very strong temperature dependence of dispersive transport in the continuous-time-random-walk model for hole transport. For linear integrated circuits, low temperature operation is affected by the strong temperature dependence of npn transistors along with the higher sensitivity of lateral and substrate <b>pnp</b> <b>transistors</b> to radiation damage...|$|R

Substrate <b>pnp</b> <b>transistors</b> {{are used for}} temperature sensing and for generating the ADC’s reference voltage. To obtain a high initial accuracy in the readout circuitry, chopper amplifiers and dynamic element matching are used. High linearity is obtained by using second-order curvature correction. With these measures, the sensor’s temperature error is dominated by spread on the base-emitter voltage of the <b>pnp</b> <b>transistors.</b> This is trimmed after packaging by comparing the sensor’s output with the die temperature measured using an extra on-chip calibration transistor. Compared to traditional calibration techniques, this procedure is much faster and therefore reduces production costs. The sensor is accurate to within 0. 5 C (3) from 50 C to 120 C.
