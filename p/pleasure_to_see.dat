5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

500|$|Karthi's third film in 2010 was Suseenthiran's thriller Naan Mahaan Alla, {{in which}} he played a middle class youth from Chennai whose life is {{disrupted}} when his father is killed. It received good reviews, was very popular, and Karthi's performances was praised by critics. Sreedhar Pillai wrote for Sify: [...] " [...] nails the character to perfection"...He is one good reason to see the film." [...] Bhama Devi Ravi of Times of India wrote: [...] "...what a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Karthi deliver his best performance to date...". Rediff wrote that [...] "Karthi has simply had a ball..." [...] and [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since you saw an actor who can be as convincing in sadness and rage, as in happiness." [...] Naan Mahaan Alla was dubbed into Telugu and released as Naa Peru Shiva in 2011; it was very successful and earned Karthi some Telugu film offers.|$|E

500|$|Barrymore's {{first film}} for MGM was the 1932 mystery Arsène Lupin, {{in which he}} co-starred with his brother Lionel. [...] In The New York Times, Hall called Barrymore's {{performance}} [...] "admirable" [...] and wrote that [...] "it is a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] again in something in a lighter vein." [...] The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with Greta Garbo in the 1932 film Grand Hotel, in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore's acting was divided; John Gilbert's biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming [...] "more like... affectionate father than her lover", while George Blaisdell of International Photographer praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be [...] "deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking." [...] Grand Hotel won the Academy Award for Best Picture {{and was one of}} the highest-grossing films of the year. It was later added to the National Film Registry.|$|E
500|$|Mason had {{submitted}} {{his plan}} sometime between June 8 and 10, 1776. It named {{the new state}} the [...] "Commonwealth of Virginia", a name chosen pointedly by Mason to indicate that power stemmed from the people. The constitution provided for a popularly elected House of Delegates, chosen annually by men who owned or leased property, or who had fathered three or more Virginians. Most governmental power resided in the House of Delegates—the governor could not even veto a bill, and could only act {{as head of the}} state militia on the advice of his Council of State, whose members were elected by the legislature. The draft was considered by the committee, and it issued a report on June 24, at which time Jefferson's preamble and several amendments authored by him were included—George Wythe, who advocated for Jefferson's draft before the committee, found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to Jefferson on a few points. The entire convention considered the document between June 26 and 28, and it was signed on the 29th. Richard Henry Lee wrote the day prior to the constitution's passage by unanimous vote, [...] "I have had the <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> our new plan of Government go on well. This day will put a finishing hand to it. 'Tis very much of the democratic kind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Răutu's {{last years}} {{were marked by}} panic and confusion: {{although}} it gave him <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ceaușescu executed during the Romanian Revolution of 1989, that event saw the formal destruction of a political and symbolic structure {{to which he had}} dedicated his life. An unverifiable rumor even places Răutu among the dejected old-generation communists who prepared their return under a [...] "Constantin Dăscălescu Government". Reportedly fearing anti-communist repression, he supported Ion Iliescu, a former PMR man and his former employee at the Agitprop Section, whom the Revolution had propelled to the rank of President. Iliescu later acknowledged that he felt respect for Răutu.|$|E
