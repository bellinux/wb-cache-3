2500|$|Primary {{metabolite}} enzymatic cofactors include {{members of}} the vitamin B family. Vitamin B1 as thiamine diphosphate is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase which are all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. [...] Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is a constituent of FMN and FAD which are necessary for many redox reactions. [...] Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan is {{a component of the}} coenzymes NAD and NADP which in turn are required for electron transport in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as many other redox reactions. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is a constituent of coenzyme A, a basic component of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and <b>pyridoxamine)</b> as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is a cofactor for many enzymes especially transaminases involve in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 (cobalamins) contain a corrin ring similar in structure to porphyrin and is an essential coenzyme for the catabolism of fatty acids as well for the biosynthesis of methionine.|$|E
5000|$|A patent {{application}} claiming pharmaceutical compositions of <b>pyridoxamine,</b> and methods to use <b>pyridoxamine</b> to treat diabetic complications, was filed by Biostratum and {{was published in}} 2004. [...] The application does not claim <b>pyridoxamine</b> itself.|$|E
5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (D-glutamate-forming). Other names in common use include <b>pyridoxamine</b> phosphate aminotransferase, <b>pyridoxamine</b> 5'-phosphate-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase, and <b>pyridoxamine</b> 5'-phosphate transaminase. This enzyme participates in vitamin B6 metabolism.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pyridoxamine</b> also {{inhibits}} {{the formation}} of advanced lipoxidation endproducts during lipid peroxidation reactions by reaction with dicarbonyl intermediates. In other preclinical research, <b>pyridoxamine</b> may be efficacious in treating diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy associated with diabetes and kidney stone disease. In one study, <b>pyridoxamine</b> was more effective at protecting from ionizing radiation-induced gastrointestinal epithelial apoptosis than amifostine (the only [...] currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved) due to <b>pyridoxamine</b> reactive oxygen species and reactive carbonyl species scavenging profile.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyridoxamine</b> was {{marketed as}} a dietary supplement, often as the {{hydrochloride}} salt, <b>pyridoxamine</b> dihydrochloride. However, in the United States, the FDA ruled in January 2009 that <b>pyridoxamine</b> must be regulated as a pharmaceutical drug {{because it is}} the active ingredient in Pyridorin, a drug designed by Biostratum, Inc., to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyridoxamine</b> {{can form}} fairly weak {{complexes}} {{with a number}} of transition metal ions, with a preference for Cu2+ and Fe3+. The 3'-hydroxyl group of <b>pyridoxamine</b> allows for efficient hydroxyl radical scavenging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyridoxamine</b> {{inhibits}} the Maillard {{reaction and}} can block {{the formation of}} advanced glycation endproducts, which are associated with medical complications of diabetes. <b>Pyridoxamine</b> is hypothesized to trap intermediates {{in the formation of}} Amadori products released from glycated proteins, possibly preventing the breakdown of glycated proteins by disrupting the catalysis of this process through disruptive interactions with the metal ions crucial to the redox reaction. One research study found that <b>pyridoxamine</b> specifically reacts with the carbonyl group in Amadori products, but inhibition of post-Amadori reactions (that can lead to advanced glycation endproducts) is due in much greater part to the metal chelation effects of <b>pyridoxamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{preclinical}} studies in animal models of diabetes indicated that <b>pyridoxamine</b> improved kidney histology comparable or superior to aminoguanidine. Because of these results, <b>pyridoxamine</b> {{has been investigated}} for clinical utility {{in the treatment of}} diabetic nephropathy.|$|E

50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are <b>pyridoxamine</b> and oxaloacetate, whereas its two {{products are}} pyridoxal and L-aspartate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyridoxamine</b> is {{one form}} of vitamin B6. Chemically {{it is based on}} a {{pyridine}} ring structure, with hydroxyl, methyl, aminomethyl, and hydroxymethyl substituents. It differs from pyridoxine by the substituent at the 4-position. The phenol at position 3 and aminomethyl group at position 4 of its ring endow <b>pyridoxamine</b> with a variety of chemical properties, including the scavenging of free radical species and carbonyl species formed in sugar and lipid degradation and chelation of metal ions that catalyze Amadori reactions.|$|E
5000|$|Compounds {{that have}} been found to inhibit AGE {{formation}} in the laboratory include Vitamin C, benfotiamine, <b>pyridoxamine,</b> alpha-lipoic acid, [...] taurine, pimagedine, aspirin, carnosine, metformin, pioglitazone, and pentoxifylline.|$|E
50|$|In plants, the YjeF N-terminal domain is {{fused to}} a C-terminal {{putative}} <b>pyridoxamine</b> 5'-phosphate oxidase. In eukaryotes, proteins that consist of (Sm)-FDF-YjeF N-terminal domains {{may be involved}} in RNA processing.|$|E
50|$|ALT (and all aminotransferases) {{require the}} {{coenzyme}} pyridoxal phosphate, which is converted into <b>pyridoxamine</b> {{in the first}} phase of the reaction, when an amino acid is converted into a keto acid.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin B6 {{is absorbed}} in the jejunum and ileum by passive diffusion. With the {{capacity}} for absorption being so great, animals are able to absorb quantities much greater than necessary for physiological demands. The absorption of pyridoxal phosphate and <b>pyridoxamine</b> phosphate involves their dephosphorylation catalyzed by a membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase. Those products and nonphosphorylated forms in the digestive tract are absorbed by diffusion, which is driven by trapping of the vitamin as 5′-phosphates through the action of phosphorylation (by a pyridoxal kinase) in the jejunal mucosa. The trapped pyridoxine and <b>pyridoxamine</b> are oxidized to pyridoxal phosphate in the tissue.|$|E
5000|$|Pyridorin {{had success}} in early {{clinical}} trials, {{found to be}} effective in slowing the progression of diabetic neuropathy in a phase II trial on 224 patients. However, in 2005 Biostratum ran out of money and so was unable to begin a Phase III trial. [...] Investors in Biostratum had realized that because Biostratum had no patent on <b>pyridoxamine</b> itself, and that <b>pyridoxamine</b> was commonly available for purchase as a dietary supplement, the company would be unable to charge enough money for the treatment (should it be approved as a prescription drug by the FDA) for the investors to get a reasonable return on the investment they had already made (about $100M) much less on the additional investment a Phase III trial would require. To solve this problem, Biostratum submitted a citizen petition to the FDA on July 29, 2005, seeking to disallow sales of pyridoxamine-containing supplements on the grounds that <b>pyridoxamine,</b> as the subject of an Investigational New Drug Application with the FDA, is a drug and not a dietary supplement. This petition was opposed by the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association of the dietary supplement industry.|$|E
5000|$|On January 12, 2009, the FDA {{ruled that}} {{products}} containing <b>pyridoxamine</b> {{are excluded from}} the definition of dietary supplements {{as defined by the}} Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. The FDA stated that the status of Pyridorin as an investigational new drug, {{as a result of an}} application filed by BioStratum in July 1999 and effective on September 1, 1999, meant that [...] "the marketing of <b>pyridoxamine</b> in a dietary supplement is essentially equivalent to the marketing of an investigational new drug as a dietary supplement" [...] because there was an [...] "absence of independent, verifiable evidence that the substance was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement prior to its authorization for investigation as a new drug." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Chicago in 1957, the second son of the organic chemist Howard Zimmerman. He {{attended}} public schools in Madison, Wisconsin where he received a B.S. degree in 1979 working for Hans J. Reich. In 1983 he received a Ph.D. at Columbia University in New York City where he worked with Ronald Breslow on <b>pyridoxamine</b> enzyme analogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{transaminase}} enzymes {{are important}} {{in the production of}} various amino acids, and measuring the concentrations of various transaminases in the blood is important in the diagnosing and tracking many diseases. Transaminases require the coenzyme pyridoxal-phosphate, which is converted into <b>pyridoxamine</b> in {{the first phase of the}} reaction, when an amino acid is converted into a keto acid. Enzyme-bound <b>pyridoxamine</b> in turn reacts with pyruvate, oxaloacetate, or alpha-ketoglutarate, giving alanine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid, respectively. Many transamination reactions occur in tissues, catalysed by transaminases specific for a particular amino/keto acid pair. The reactions are readily reversible, the direction being determined by which of the reactants are in excess. The specific enzymes are named from one of the reactant pairs, for example; the reaction between glutamic acid and pyruvic acid to make alpha ketoglutaric acid and alanine is called glutamic-pyruvic transaminase or GPT for short.|$|E
50|$|Temporary {{impairment}} of proprioception {{has also been}} known to occur from an overdose of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine and <b>pyridoxamine).</b> Most of the impaired function returns to normal shortly after {{the amount of the}} vitamin in the body returns to a level that is closer to that of the physiological norm. Impairment can also be caused by cytotoxic factors such as chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pyridoxamine</b> {{derivative}} of vinyl glyoxylate remains after the gamma elimination. The lone pair from the pyridine nitrogen pushes electron density to the gamma carbon, which is protonated by lysine. Lysine then attacks the external aldimine, pushing electron density to the beta carbon, which is protonated by a general acid. The imine is then hydrolyzed to release α-ketobutyrate. Deprotonation of the lysine residue causes ammonia to leave, thus completing the catalytic cycle.|$|E
50|$|All forms except pyridoxic {{acid and}} {{pyritinol}} can be interconverted. Absorbed <b>pyridoxamine</b> {{is converted to}} PMP by pyridoxal kinase, which is further converted to PLP by pyridoxamine-phosphate transaminase or pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase which also catalyzes the conversion of PNP to PLP. Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase is dependent on flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor which is produced from riboflavin (vitamin B2) i.e. in this biochemical pathway, dietary vitamin B6 cannot be used without vitamin B2.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, the Hungarian {{physician}} Paul György {{discovered a}} substance that was able to cure a skin disease in rats (dermititis acrodynia). He named this substance vitamin B6. In 1938, Samuel Lepkovsky isolated vitamin B6 from rice bran. Harris and Folkers in 1939 determined the structure of pyridoxine, and, in 1945, Snell was able to show the two forms of vitamin B6, pyridoxal and <b>pyridoxamine.</b> Vitamin B6 was named pyridoxine to indicate its structural homology to pyridine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{step in the}} {{biosynthesis}} of many α-amino acids is the {{reductive amination}} of an α-ketoacid, usually by a transaminase enzyme. The process is catalyzed by <b>pyridoxamine</b> phosphate, which is converted into pyridoxal phosphate after the reaction. The initial step entails formation of an imine, but the hydride equivalents are supplied by a reduced pyridine to give an aldimine, which hydrolyzes to the amine. [...] The sequence from keto-acid to amino acid can be summarized as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|In transamination, after {{deprotonation}} the quinoid intermediate {{accepts a}} proton {{at a different}} position to become a ketimine. The resulting ketimine is hydrolysed so that the amino group remains on the complex. In addition, PLP is used by aminotransferases (or transaminases) that act upon unusual sugars such as perosamine and desosamine. [...] In these reactions, the PLP reacts with glutamate, which transfers its alpha-amino group to PLP to make <b>pyridoxamine</b> phosphate (PMP). PMP then transfers its nitrogen to the sugar, making an amino sugar.|$|E
50|$|Gabaculine {{includes}} a comparable structure to GABA and a dihydrobenzene ring. This comparable GABA structure {{is used in}} order to be able to take the place of GABA during the first steps of transamination, including transaldimination and 1,3-prototrphic shift to the <b>pyridoxamine</b> imine. Following this, a proton from the dihydrobenzene ring is abstracted by an enzymatic base, thus causing the ring to become aromatic. The aromatic stabilization energy of the aromatic ring is what causes this reaction to be irreversible, thus causing the complex not to react further.|$|E
50|$|As a prototypical transaminase, AST {{relies on}} PLP (Vitamin B6) as a {{cofactor}} {{to transfer the}} amino group from aspartate or glutamate to the corresponding ketoacid. In the process, the cofactor shuttles between PLP and the <b>pyridoxamine</b> phosphate (PMP) form. The amino group transfer catalyzed by this enzyme is crucial in both amino acid degradation and biosynthesis. In amino acid degradation, following the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate, glutamate subsequently undergoes oxidative deamination to form ammonium ions, which are excreted as urea. In the reverse reaction, aspartate may be synthesized from oxaloacetate, which is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{products}} of vitamin B6 metabolism are excreted in the urine, the major product {{of which is}} 4-pyridoxic acid. An estimated 40-60% of ingested vitamin B6 is oxidized to 4-pyridoxic acid. Several {{studies have shown that}} 4-pyridoxic acid is undetectable in the urine of vitamin B6-deficient subjects, making it a useful clinical marker to assess the vitamin B6 status of an individual. Other {{products of}} vitamin B6 metabolism excreted in the urine when high doses of the vitamin have been given include pyridoxal, <b>pyridoxamine,</b> and pyridoxine and their phosphates. A small amount of vitamin B6 is also excreted in the feces.|$|E
50|$|In humans, the {{pyridoxine}} 5’-phosphate oxidase enzyme {{exhibits a}} low catalytic rate constant of 0.2 sec-1, with low Km values for both pyridoxine 5'phosphate and <b>pyridoxamine</b> 5'-phosphate. The enzyme {{also has a}} low turnover rate, meaning that it is relatively slow converting substrate to product. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is an effective product inhibitor. Since pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, {{is the product of}} the metabolic pathway, if it exists in excess, then the pathway need not proceed to keep making product. However, if it exists in low concentrations, then that is a signal for the pathway to synthesize more. This is an example of feedback inhibition.|$|E
5000|$|Snell {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on vitamin B6; he and Soviet {{scientist}} Alexander E. Braunstein have been cited as the [...] "fathers of vitamin B6". Snell discovered two novel forms of the substance - pyridoxal and <b>pyridoxamine</b> - and thus elaborated the underlying biochemistry of enzymes that rely on pyridoxal cofactors for catalysis. In a series of experiments beginning in the 1940s and later conducted with student David Metzler, a general mechanism for the catalytic cycle of pyridoxal-dependent enzymes was discovered. Recalling his own work with pyridoxal, French biophysicist Michel E. Goldberg described Snell as [...] "the pope of pyridoxal catalysis".|$|E
5000|$|A {{possible}} {{candidate for}} the base in the mechanism could be Lys280 that was just pushed off of PLP, which sequesters the newly formed amino group of the PLP-TYR molecule. In a similar mechanism of aspartate transaminase, the lysine that forms the initial imine to PLP later acts as the base that attacks the tyrosine in transimination. The electrons left behind {{from the loss of}} the proton move down to form a new double bond to the imine, which in turn pushes the already double bonded electrons through PLP and end up as a lone pair on the positively charged nitrogen in the six-membered ring of the molecule. Water attacks the alpha carbon of the imine of PLP-TYR and through acyl substitution kicks off the nitrogen of PLP and forming <b>pyridoxamine</b> phosphate (PMP) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin B6 {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in foods in both its free and bound forms. Cooking, storage, and processing losses of vitamin B6 vary {{and in some}} foods {{may be more than}} 50%, depending on the form of vitamin present in the food. Plant foods lose the least during processing, as they contain mostly pyridoxine, which is far more stable than the pyridoxal or <b>pyridoxamine</b> found in animal foods. For example, milk can lose 30-70% of its vitamin B6 content when dried. Vitamin B6 is found in the germ and aleurone layer of grains, and milling results in the reduction of this vitamin in white flour. The heating that occurs before most freezing and canning processes are other methods that may result in the loss of vitamin B6 in foods.|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of advanced glycation end products (AGE) {{is a key}} factor in diabetic nephropathy (DN). <b>Pyridoxamine</b> inhibits AGE formation and protects against type I DN. Herein we tested: (1) whether C 57 BL 6 db/db mice as a model of established type II DN resembled patients treated with drugs which inhibit angiotensin II action; (2) whether <b>pyridoxamine</b> was effective as a single therapy; and (3) whether <b>pyridoxamine</b> would add to the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) by enalapril. In first set of experiments mice were treated with ACEi (benazepril) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) combination for 16 weeks after the onset of diabetes. In second group, mice with established DN were treated with <b>pyridoxamine</b> for 8 weeks. In a third set, mice with established DN were treated with <b>pyridoxamine</b> and enalapril combination for 16 weeks. Benazepril and valsartan combination partially prevented the development and progression of DN. <b>Pyridoxamine</b> treatment, as single therapy, decreased the progression of albuminuria and glomerular lesions. The combination of <b>pyridoxamine</b> with enalapril reduced both mortality and the progression of DN. In conclusion, (1) C 57 BL 6 db/db mice are a model of progressive type II DN; (2) The combination of <b>pyridoxamine</b> with enalapril decreased progression of type 2 DN and overall mortality. Thus, <b>pyridoxamine</b> could be a valuable adjunct to the current treatment of established type II DN...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{activities of}} 11 water-soluble vitamins against heterocyclic amine formation {{were examined in}} a PhIP and a MeIQx producing chemical model. Six investigated vitamins (pyridoxiamine, pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, biotin, thiamine and l-ascorbic acid) out of the 11, exhibited significant inhibition (> 40 %) in both models. <b>Pyridoxamine</b> was the most potent inhibitor, and its inhibitory effect increased with increasing concentration in the model, although not in a linear manner. The activity of <b>pyridoxamine,</b> niacin and ascorbic acid was investigated using fried beef. Moderate inhibition (∼ 20 %) {{of the formation of}} PhIP, 4, 8 -DiMeIQx and MeIQx was found for niacin and ascorbic acid; whereas <b>pyridoxamine</b> reduced the levels of all three HAs by ∼ 40 %. GC-MS analysis showed that <b>pyridoxamine</b> significantly reduced the level of PhIP intermediate, phenylacetaldehyde. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealed that <b>pyridoxamine</b> directly reacts with phenylacetaldehyde to form an adduct, whose structure was characterised by MS and NMR spectroscopy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
