5|$|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) {{announced}} in early October 2005 that their January PPV would {{once again be}} called Final Resolution, until they pulled this release from their website. TNA later reinstated this <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> with the official date of the show being January15, 2006 at the TNA Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. TNA created a section of their website to promote the event. A promotional poster for the show was released prior by TNA featuring Christopher Daniels and Samoa Joe. A thirty-minute pre-show was scheduled to take place prior to the telecast featuring two wrestling matches.|$|E
25|$|ZMET {{draws on}} a variety of {{disciplines}} including neurobiology, psychology, semiotics, linguistics, and art theory to elicit metaphors that can reveal how a person conceptualizes a given topic. Metaphors are a way of learning or understanding a new <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> by comparing it to a known <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (see Conceptual metaphor).|$|E
25|$|The {{permutations}} {{of factor}} levels comprising a single treatment are so chosen that their responses are uncorrelated and hence each treatment gives a unique <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> The {{net effect of}} organizing the experiment in such treatments {{is that the same}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is gathered in the minimum number of experiments.|$|E
50|$|Santos uses {{multiple}} mnemonic techniques including {{using the}} phonetic alphabet and various visualization techniques. One visualization technique {{is called the}} Roman room, in which an individual associates <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> with objects in a familiar space. A similar technique Santos also uses is called the journey technique, where a person associates <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> with points <b>of</b> interest along a familiar or known route. When associating <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> with objects or points of interest, Santos engages as many senses as possible to increase memory retention. A third visualization technique used by Santos is the called the body list, where <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> are associated with parts of the body.|$|R
50|$|An {{effective}} way of encouraging elaborative rehearsal is by engaging with the material {{in more than one}} way. For instance, discussion or study groups provide an opportunity to make discrete <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> more personal by attaching stories to them and creating meaningful connections to things already learned. Elaborative rehearsal has strong support in learning, especially in its attention to meaningful connections across different concepts and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> More specifically, elaborative rehearsal is extremely beneficial when remembering larger <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> such as sentences or other larger chunks.|$|R

25|$|The Saga of the Skjöldungs is lost {{but in the}} end of the 16th century, Arngrímur Jónsson saved a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> {{from this}} saga in Latin. He wrote: There was {{animosity}} between king Adils of Sweden and the Norwegian king Áli of Uppland. They decided to fight on the ice of Lake Vänern. Adils won and took his helmet, chainmail and horse.|$|E
25|$|This <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{information}}</b> {{should contain}} {{the information that}} is relevant for managing the system at the customer site. In many cases this information is already part of the manual. However in particular situations this information is meant only {{for the management of}} the system and not for the users of the system and is therefore supplied as a separate document.|$|E

25|$|All {{the above}} offers great {{challenges}} to the marine archaeologist when attempting to bind the pieces of a certain shipwreck together. Despite these challenges, if the information retrieved {{does not appear to}} be sufficient, or a poor preservation is achieved, authors like J.A. Parker claim that it is the historical value of the shipwreck that counts, as well as any slight <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and/or evidence that is acquired.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the tube map as a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> design has led to many imitations of its format. What is {{probably}} the earliest example is the Sydney Suburban and City Underground railway map of 1939. Not only does it follow Beck's styling cues, but in size, design and layout it is a near-clone to the London map of the late 1930s, {{right down to the}} use of the Underground roundel.|$|E
25|$|Qatar Charity’s {{track record}} of terror {{financing}} includes support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya, an accusation publicly denied by Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani. In 1999 Qatar Charity supposedly funneled money to Chechnya-based al-Qaeda affiliates. Furthermore, Qatar Charity is among the NGOs allegedly channelling funds to Ansar Dine in North Mali, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> confirmed by French military intelligence reports dating back to France’s intervention {{in the country in}} early 2013. The group has long been suspected of having ties to al-Qaeda.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> {{important}} for the bowlers to consider prior to their deliveries {{is the state of}} pitch. The pitch is a natural ground and its state is subjected to variation {{over the course of the}} cricket, some of which are multi-day events such as test matches. Spinners find an old pitch, one that hasn't been frequently used, more suitable to their deliveries rather than a fresh pitch, one that hasn't come under use as much such as a pitch at the start of the match.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads into}} a {{discussion}} about the merits of the debate whether the universe is eternal or created. As in the first book, Aristotle's theory of the eternity of the universe is seen as the best, philosophically. However, this is because Maimonides considered the proofs that the universe was created to be inferior. He still points out supposed problems with the Aristotelian view and states that, while Aristotle's argument is the best, the possession of Divine Revelation from the Torah is the extra <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> necessary to decide the matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} speech {{perception}} {{is not necessarily}} uni-directional. That is, higher-level language processes connected with morphology, syntax, or semantics may interact with basic speech perception processes to aid in recognition of speech sounds. It {{may be the case}} that it is not necessary and maybe even not possible for a listener to recognize phonemes before recognizing higher units, like words for example. After obtaining at least a fundamental <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about phonemic structure of the perceived entity from the acoustic signal, listeners can compensate for missing or noise-masked phonemes using their knowledge of the spoken language.|$|E

5000|$|Whereas DST focuses {{primarily}} {{on how the}} state of a physical {{system as a whole}} (in this case, the brain) develops over time, both SIT and connectionism focus {{primarily on}} what a system does in terms <b>of</b> <b>information</b> processing (which, in this case, can be said to constitute cognition) and both assume that this information processing relies on interactions between <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in distributed representations, that is, in networks <b>of</b> connected <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Vedas {{represent}} some of {{the oldest}} historical records available (1500 – 500 BC) and they list the names of nearly 250 kinds of birds besides many other notes on various other fauna and flora. In the vedic texts, Aryavarta, {{the land of the}} Aryans, was considered to be co-terminous with the range of the blackbuck. Sometimes, these referred to the lands North of the Vindhyas; at others times, it included lands to the South. A notable <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> mentioned in the Vedas is the knowledge of brood parasitism in the Indian koel, a habit known well ahead of Aristotle (384 – 322 BC). This is possibly because both the Indian koel and its host the house crow were common and easy to observe.|$|E
25|$|Many puzzles {{in these}} games involve {{gathering}} and using items from their inventory. Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects in unexpected ways. For example, {{by putting a}} deflated inner tube on a cactus to create a slingshot, which requires a player to realize that an inner tube is stretchy. They may need to carry items in their inventory for a long duration before they prove useful, and thus it is normal for adventure games to test a player's memory where a challenge can only be overcome by recalling a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from earlier in the game. There is seldom any time pressure for these puzzles, focusing more on the player's ability to reason than on quick-thinking.|$|E
25|$|The Gesta Danorum also {{agrees with}} Beowulf in {{presenting}} Hrothgar (Ro) and Halga (Helgo) as brothers and {{the sons of}} Healfdene (Haldanus). Moroever, like the Chronicon Lethrense and the Annales Lundenses, it presents Hroðulf (Roluo) {{as the son of}} Halga and his own daughter. A striking difference is that the Swedish king Eadgils (Athisl) is pushed forward a generation, and instead Saxo introduces Hrothgar's killer Hothbrodd as the father of Eadgils, a place that other sources give to Ohthere. A similar <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is also found in the Chronicon Lethrense and the Annales Lundenses, where Halga had to kill a man named Hodbrod to win all of Denmark. However, Saxo also adds the god Höðr as the brother of Eadgils in order to present a euhemerized version of the Baldr myth, later.|$|E

40|$|Most information, {{which we}} use in our lives, was first {{acquired}} by vision. The vision {{is not a}} passive receptor simply registering the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in the environment, but it also involves a selection mechanism. We can investigate this process with eye trackers and estimate, which <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> the subject knew and which attracted him. This report introduces these methods and their possibilities in cognitive psychology...|$|R
25|$|But it was {{the site}} where that second <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> led us that {{contained}} dynamite. From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and we would find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E
25|$|Allegedly paid 100,000 francs (some sources state 500 pounds), Renée Garry's {{actions have}} been {{attributed}} by some, at least partially to Garry's suspicion she had lost the affections of SOE agent France Antelme to Inayat Khan. After the war, she was tried, but escaped conviction by one vote. On or around 13 October 1943, Inayat Khan was arrested and interrogated at the SD Headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris. During that time, she attempted escape twice. Hans Kieffer, {{the former head of}} the SD in Paris, testified after the war that she did not give the Gestapo a single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> but lied consistently. However, other sources indicate that she chatted amiably with an out-of-uniform Alsatian interrogator, and provided personal details that enabled the SD to answer random checks in the form of questions about her childhood and family.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suggested}} that the problem with building and maintaining larger, more complex, and more accurately replicated molecules can be circumvented if several information carriers, each of them storing a small <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> are connected such that they only control their own concentration. Studies of the mathematical model describing replicating molecules revealed that to observe a cooperative behaviour among self-replicating molecules, {{they have to be}} connected by a positive feedback loop of catalytic actions. This kind of closed network consisting of self-replicating entities connected by a catalytic positive-feedback loop was named an elementary hypercycle. Such a concept, apart from an increased information capacity, has another advantage. Linking self-replication with mutual catalysis can produce nonlinear growth of the system. This, first, makes the system resistant to so-called parasitic branches. Parasitic branches are species coupled to a cycle that do not provide any advantage to the reproduction of a cycle, which, in turn, makes them useless and decreases the selective value of the system. Secondly, it reinforces the self-organization of molecules into the hypercycle, allowing the system to evolve without losing information, which solves the error threshold problem.|$|E
