5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent on a piece of <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E
5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{currency}} does, however, bear several anti-counterfeiting features. Two of {{the most}} critical anti-counterfeiting features of U.S. currency are the <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ink. The composition of the paper is 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. The ink and paper combine to create a distinct texture, particularly as the currency is circulated. The <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ink alone have no effect on {{the value of the dollar}} until post print. These characteristics can be hard to duplicate without the proper equipment and materials. Furthermore, recent redesigns of the $5, $10, $20, and $50 notes have added EURion constellation patterns which can be used by scanning software to recognize banknotes and refuse to scan them.|$|E

30|$|The four {{relationships}} among two variables {{were observed in}} this study.

The third observation was the relationship between the number of publication of journals in all <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> impact in highly cited papers.

Even now, the Groat is archived in the public library in Wick, while the Courier is similarly archived in the library in Thurso. The Courier was printed, almost by hand, in a small shop in High Street, Thurso until the early 60's by Mr Docherty and his daughter. The Courier traditionally covers that week's sheriff court cases.|$|E
25|$|To print, {{the block}} is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round {{horsehair}} inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then {{laid on the}} block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done {{on one side of}} the <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.|$|E

It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies. Scholars today think that examination of surviving copies suggests that somewhere between 160 and 185 copies were printed, with about three-quarters on <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others on vellum.
