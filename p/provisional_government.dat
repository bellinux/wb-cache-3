5|$|Bowling Green, Kentucky, was {{designated}} the Confederate capital of Kentucky at a convention in nearby Russellville. Due {{to the military}} situation in the state, the <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> was exiled and traveled with the Army of Tennessee {{for most of its}} existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the Confederate Army controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General Braxton Bragg attempted to install the <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General Don Carlos Buell ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled <b>Provisional</b> <b>Government</b> of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{representing}} the <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> departed for Ottawa in March. Although they initially met with legal difficulties {{arising from the}} execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. An agreement enshrining the demands {{in the list of}} rights was quickly reached, and this formed the basis for the Manitoba Act of 12 May 1870, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation. However, the negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for the <b>provisional</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

25|$|Back in Portugal, Cunhal {{took charge}} of the newly legalised PCP and led the party through the {{political}} upheavals which followed the revolution. He was minister without portfolio in several of the <b>provisional</b> <b>governments</b> which followed the revolution. A faction of army officers seen as aligned with the PCP dominated the post-revolutionary <b>provisional</b> <b>governments,</b> with pro-communist prime minister Vasco Gonçalves leading four <b>provisional</b> <b>governments,</b> bringing accusations that the PCP was attempting to take power via the military. Cunhal was largely responsible for the PCP's hardline attitude, particularly its hostility towards the Socialist Party led by Soares, which prevented the formation of a united left.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{documentation}} detailing {{exactly when}} Kentucky's <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> ceased operation. It {{is assumed to}} have dissolved upon {{the conclusion of the}} Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Within Mexico, {{tensions}} continued between federalists and centralists. In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety. The unrest {{erupted into}} armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales. This launched the Texas Revolution, {{and over the}} next two months, the Texians defeated all Mexican troops in the region. Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a <b>provisional</b> <b>government.</b> The <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836.|$|E
5|$|After {{the alleged}} abdication of Nicholas II from the throne {{in favor of}} his brother Michael, Michael also abdicated, before the {{convening}} of the Constituent Assembly. On 1 September 1917, Russia was proclaimed a republic. At this period a <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> was formed, the Prime Minister {{was the head of}} state.|$|E

5|$|After the {{creation}} of the <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Curtis Piʻehu Iʻaukea (December 13, 1855 – March 5, 1940) {{served as}} a court official, army officer and diplomat of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

5|$|On 18 September 1944, the <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> {{formed by}} the National Committee of the Republic of Estonia in Tallinn re-declared the {{independence}} of Estonia. Estonian military units clashed with German troops in Tallinn, seizing the state offices at Toompea. The government appealed to the Soviet Union to recognize {{the independence of the}} republic.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union {{and within a}} week took control of all Lithuania. At first the Germans were greeted as liberators from the oppressive Soviet regime. The Lithuanians hoped that the Germans would re-establish their {{independence}} or at least allow some degree of autonomy (similar to the Slovak Republic). Organized by the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), Lithuanians rose in the anti-Soviet and pro-Nazi June Uprising, established the short-lived <b>Provisional</b> <b>Government,</b> and declared independence. However, the Germans did not recognize the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Government</b> and established their own civil administration, the Reichskommissariat Ostland. When the Red Army regained control of Lithuania in summer 1944–January 1945, the Lithuanian partisans began an armed struggle against the second Soviet occupation. An estimated 30,000 partisans and partisan supporters were killed during the guerrilla warfare between 1944 and 1953.|$|E
5|$|The February Revolution was {{positively}} {{accepted by the}} Armenians because it ended the autocratic rule of Nicholas II. The Special Transcaucasian Committee (known as OZAKOM) {{was set up in}} the South Caucasus by the Russian <b>Provisional</b> <b>Government.</b> In April 1917, Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper Hayastan (Armenia) in Tiflis. Vahan Totovents became the editor of this non-partisan, Ottoman Armenian-orientated newspaper. Until December 1917, Andranik remained in the South Caucasus where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire in their search for basic needs. The <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> decree of 9 May 1917 put Turkish Armenia under civil administration, with Armenians holding key positions. About 150,000 local Armenians began to rebuild devastated Turkish Armenia; however the Russian army units gradually disintegrated and many soldiers deserted and returned to Russia.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Provisional</b> <b>Government</b> also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Government</b> were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E
5|$|The Venizelist advance was not {{an attempt}} to {{undermine}} the king's pact with Bénazet, since it had been planned long before that. The failure of the secret agreement was caused by subversive activities within segments of the royalist government in Athens to paralyze and disrupt the Thessaloniki <b>provisional</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|The brigade traces its lineage {{back to the}} 95th Military Government Group, {{activated}} 25 August 1945. The {{group was}} assigned to Japan to provide <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> duties during the post-World War II occupation of Japan. Following its brief assignment, the group was inactivated on 30 June 1946.|$|E

50|$|<b>Provisional</b> <b>governments</b> {{maintain}} power until a {{new government}} can be appointed by a regular political process, which is generally an election. They may be involved with defining the legal structure of subsequent regimes, guidelines related to human rights and political freedoms, {{the structure of the}} economy, government institutions, and international alignment. <b>Provisional</b> <b>governments</b> differ from caretaker governments, which are responsible for governing within an established parliamentary system and serve as placeholders following a motion of no confidence, or following the dissolution of the ruling coalition.|$|R

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the monarchists that Michael {{might be able}} to assume the throne {{following}} the election of the Constituent Assembly were overtaken by events. His renunciation of the throne, though conditional, marked the end of the Tsarist regime in Russia. The <b>Provisional</b> <b>Government</b> had little effective power; real power was held by the Petrograd Soviet.|$|E
5|$|The <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> elected two governors. George W. Johnson {{was elected}} at the Russellville Convention and served {{until his death}} at the Battle of Shiloh. Richard Hawes was elected to replace Johnson and served through the {{remainder}} of the war.|$|E
5|$|A {{transport}} fleet {{protected by}} warships was organised; sixty ships sailed in all. Equipment, victuals, munitions and 1,300 horses {{had to be}} brought over, as well as arms, munitions and money for the Greek <b>provisional</b> <b>government</b> of John Capodistria. France wished to support free Greece as it came into being by helping it activate its army, {{with the aim of}} gaining influence in the region.|$|E

50|$|On November 3, 1918, the <b>Provisional</b> Siberian <b>Government</b> sacrificed own {{independence}} {{for the sake}} of consolidation of all possible forces to fight with Bolsheviks. Thereby it merged with the Ufa Directory, forming <b>Provisional</b> All-Russian <b>Government.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the Estado Novo {{the country}} would then {{experience}} a turbulent period of <b>provisional</b> <b>governments</b> and a nearly disintegrated state reminiscent of the First Republic, a condition that the Estado Novo had so assiduously attempted to avoid. These <b>provisional</b> <b>governments</b> also briefly censored newspapers and detained oppositionists. Historian Kenneth Maxwell considers that, for many reasons, Portugal, in its transition from authoritarian rule to a more democratic government, resembled Nicaragua {{more than any other}} among the South American nations. During the final months of Franco's dictatorship, which had survived to this point, Spain considered invading Portugal to check the perceived threat of communism caused by the Carnation Revolution.|$|R
