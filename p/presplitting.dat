Aimed at the drivage shaft working place of opening No. 13 - 1 Coal seam influenced by fault in Panyi Coal Mine, this paper comprehensively {{took advantage of the}} technology of deep-hole <b>presplitting</b> blast and intensified increasing permeability, the technology of reinforcing coal body using metal skeleton, as well as the technology damming and extracting gas of outside of metal skeleton, diminished the outburst risk only after 18 days, and got the purpose of rapidly diminishing outburst risk. And this provided an effective solution of rapidly diminishing outburst risk and safety opening coal seam for similar conditions...|$|E

40|$|Overburden strata {{movement}} in large space stope {{is the major}} reason that induces the appearance of strong mining pressure. <b>Presplitting</b> blasting for hard coal rocks is crucial for the prevention and control of strong pressure in stope. In this study, pressured water coupling blasting technique was proposed. The process and effect of blasting were analyzed by orthogonal test and field practice. Results showed {{that the presence of}} pressure-bearing water and explosive cartridges in the drill are the main influence factors of the blasting effect of cement test block. The high load-transmitting performance of pore water and energy accumulation in explosive cartridges were analyzed. Noxious substances produced during the blasting process were properly controlled because of the moistening, cooling, and diluting effect of pore water. Not only the goal of safe and static rock fragmentation by high-explosive detonation but also a combination of superdynamic blast loading and static loading effect of the pressured water was achieved. Then the practice of blasting control of hard coal rocks in Datong coal mine was analyzed to determine reasonable parameters of pressured water coupling blasting. A good <b>presplitting</b> blasting control effect was achieved for the hard coal rocks...|$|E
40|$|In {{extra-thick}} coal seams, {{mining operations}} {{can lead to}} large-scale disturbances, complex overburden structures, and frequent and strong strata behavior in the stope, which are serious threats to mine safety. This study analyzed the overburden structure and strata behavior and proposed the technique of confined blasting in water-filled deep holes as a measure to prevent strong rock pressure. It found {{that there are two}} primary reasons for the high effectiveness of the proposed technique in <b>presplitting</b> hard coal and rock. First, the fracture water enables much more efficient transfer of dynamic load due to its incompressibility. Second, the subsequent expansion of water can further split the rock by compression. A mechanical model was used to reveal how the process of confined blasting in water-filled deep holes presplit roof. Moreover, practical implementation of this technique was found to improve the structure of hard, thick roof and prevent strong rock pressure, demonstrating its effectiveness in roof control...|$|E
40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{is widely}} used in underground excavation projects, where the amount of damage to the surrounding rock mass is crucially important, due to {{its impact on the}} safety of working environment and operational costs,. The causes of overbreak in the Alborz Tunnel of Iran are evaluted. In this regard, ten rounds of <b>presplitting</b> and 11 rounds of smooth blasting methods were carried out to determine the dominancy of ground condition over the blasting pattern characteristics. Further study was undertaken to identify the most important parameters of ground condition affecting the overbreak area. These parameters include; joint condition, spacing, orientation, RQD and type of rock mass. As the characteristics of the blasting pattern have very little effect on the amount of overbreak, the smooth blasting technique was chosen for the future operations where the current ground condition is going to be dealt with for about 500 meters of length, based on the data acquired from the Alborz Exploratory Tunnel. Results of this investigation helped to solve disputes between contractors and clients over the issue of permissible overbreak...|$|E
40|$|Blast casting is a high-efficiency {{technique}} {{applied in}} surface mines for overburden removal {{and results in}} stripping cost savings. According to ballistic theory and center-of-mass frame basic movement principles, key factors influencing blast casting effect were analyzed, which include bench height and mining panel width, inclined angle of blast holes, explosive unit consumption (EUC), delay-time interval, <b>presplitting,</b> and blast hole pattern parameters. An intelligent design software was developed for obtaining better breaking and casting effect, and the error rates predicted with actual result can be controlled with 10 %. Blast casting technique was successfully applied in Heidaigou Surface Coal Mine (HSCM) with more than 34 % of material casted into the inner dump. A ramp ditch was set within the middle inner dump for coal transportation. The procedure of stripping and excavating was implemented separately and alternately in the two sections around the middle ramp ditch. An unconstrained-nonlinear model was deduced for optimizing the shift distance of the middle ramp. The calculation results show that optimum shift distance of HSCM is 480 [*]m, and the middle ditch should be shifted after 6 blast casting mining panels being stripped...|$|E
40|$|Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) {{computational}} techniques allow {{treatment of}} gases, liq- uids, and solids {{in the same}} simulation. ALE methods include the ability to treat shockwaves in gases, liquids, and solids and the interaction of shockwaves {{with each other and}} with media from one of the other categories. ALE codes can also treat explosive detonation and the expansion of the explosive gases and their interaction with air and solids. ALEGRA is a 3 -DALE code that has been developed at Sandia National Laboratories over the past few years. ALEGRA has been applied to a 2 -D simulation of <b>presplitting</b> using decoupled explosives in rock blasting with very interesting results. The detonation of the explosive at the bottom of the hole sends a shock wave up the borehole driven by the explosive gas expanding into air. The explosive gas compresses the air against the stemming column where it rebounds and recompresses at the bottom of the borehole. This type of ringing takes several cycles to damp out. The explosively induced expansion of the borehole is also treated by ALEGRA as well as the shock wave imparted to the rock. The presentation of this paper will include sev- eral computer animations to aid in understanding this complex phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} {{production of}} high-quality anthracite has attracted increasing global attention. Based on the coal occurrence in Yongxia Mining Area and mining conditions of a coalface in Xinqiao Coal Mine, {{we proposed a}} systematic study on the technical support {{for the production of}} high-quality anthracite. Six key steps were explored, including coal falling at the coalface, transport, underground bunker storage, main shaft hoisting, coal preparation on the ground, and railway wagon loading. The study resulted in optimized running parameters for the shearers, and the rotating patterns of the shearer drums was altered (one-way cutting was employed). Mining height and roof supporting intensity were reduced. Besides, loose <b>presplitting</b> millisecond blasting and mechanized mining were applied to upgrade the coal quantity and the lump coal production rate. Additionally, the coalface end transloading, coalface crush, transport systems, underground storage, and main shaft skip unloading processes were improved, and fragmentation-prevention techniques were used in the washing and railway wagon loading processes. As a result, the lump coal production rate was maintained at a high level and fragmentation was significantly reduced. Because of using the parameters and techniques determined in this research, high-quality coal production and increased profits were achieved. The research results could provide theoretical guidance and methodology for other anthracite production bases...|$|E
