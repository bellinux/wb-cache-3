50|$|Stamped asphalt is a {{decorative}} product {{which is made}} by transforming regular asphalt into imitation brick, stone, or slate. The process involves {{the creation of an}} impression into an asphalt surface using a combination of heat, a stamping template, and a <b>plate</b> <b>compactor.</b> Creating impressions in the asphalt can be achieved by working behind a paver or reheating the asphalt with reheating equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 it {{launched}} the first vibratory <b>plate</b> <b>compactor,</b> which weighed 1.5 tonnes, being nicknamed the frog. It opened its research laboratory in 1948 and manufactured the first vibratory road roller in 1953. The site in Karlskrona opened in 1960, which made heavy rollers {{and had the}} company's technical centre. The CA 25 road roller introduced in 1970 became the world's leading compaction roller. It {{changed its name to}} Dynapac Maskin AB in 1973; at this moment the company rapidly expanded its product range. Its main product range was vibratory road rollers. In 1980 it brought out its first planer.|$|E
50|$|After being {{spread by}} the dozer, the RCC was {{compacted}} {{by a pair}} of Ingersoll Rand rollers — a DD125 and, for working close to the edge forms, a DD24. Additionally, vibratory <b>plate</b> <b>compactors</b> were used to compact the mix near the edge forms and around various penetrations.|$|R
40|$|The {{inadequate}} of compaction of backfills near abutments, approach {{areas of}} culverts, and smaller widened portions of roads result in settlement of layers and premature failure of pavement. Compaction in these constrained areas {{is difficult because}} of the difficulty in maneuvering of compacting equipment such as heavy rollers. Various types of light compacting equipment like rammers, vibratory <b>plate</b> <b>compactors,</b> single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers are being used for compaction of the materials in constrained areas. Locally available loamy soil was compacted to different layer thicknesses of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm using selected <b>plate</b> <b>compactors,</b> single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers. Field moisture-density relationships for this equipment are established. The studies indicate that the roller optimum moisture content (ROMC) is higher than the optimum moisture content (OMC) of Proctor compaction even after 10 passes for all the light compacting equipment used. The regression equations developed for predicting field density as a function of compacting moisture content in the field, number of passes, and thickness of layer for all the light compacting equipment can be used during construction.

5000|$|In England {{the name}} [...] "wacker plate" [...] or just [...] "wacker" [...] is {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} <b>plate</b> <b>compactors,</b> derived from the name of Wacker Neuson, a well-known manufacturer of such devices. The name is pronounced in the English style as whacker as opposed to the correct German vacker. A [...] "Jumping Jack" [...] compactor is colloquially referred to as [...] "Paddy's Motorbike", due to the traditional resource of Irish construction labourers, and the way that the operator appears to [...] "ride" [...] the hammer holding the handles like a motorcycle.|$|R
5000|$|In construction, {{there are}} three main types of compactor: the plate, the [...] "jumping jack" [...] and the road roller. The roller type compactors are used for {{compacting}} crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The <b>plate</b> <b>compactor</b> (vibratory rammer) has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade, while the jumping jack compactor has a smaller foot. The jumping jack type is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water or gas supply pipes etc. Road rollers may also have vibrating rollers.|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{emissions}} from construction sites {{have a strong}} impact on local air quality. The chemical and physical characteristics of particles and trace gases emitted by earthworks (excavation and loading of soil as well as traffic on unpaved roads) and road works (asphalt sawing, smashing, soil compacting, asphalt paving) have therefore been addressed in this study by using a mobile set-up of numerous modern online aerosol and trace gas instruments including a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer. Fuel-based emission factors for several variables have been determined, showing that earthwork activities and compacting by use of a <b>plate</b> <b>compactor</b> revealed the highest median emission factors for PM 10 to 54 g l(- 1)). Construction activities were assigned to contribute about 17 % (36 000 t a(- 1)) to total PM 10 emissions and 3 % (13 500 t a(- 1)) to total traffic-related NO emissions in Germany. In particular, calculated PM 10 emissions by earthworks are about 15 800 t a(- 1) corresponding to 44 % of total PM 10 emissions by construction activities in Germany. Mechanical processes such as asphalt sawing (PM 1 /PM 10 = 18 +/- 31 %), soil compacting by a <b>plate</b> <b>compactor</b> (PM 1 /PM 10 = 5 +/- 6 %) and earthworks (PM 1 /PM 10 = 2 +/- 5 %) emit predominantly coarse mineral dust particles. Contrary to that, particle emissions by thermal construction processes (asphalt paving: PM 1 /PM 10 = 62 +/- 14 %) and by the internal combustion engines of heavy machinery (e. g. road roller PM 1 /PM 10 = 94 +/- 9 %) are mostly in the submicron range. These particles were mainly composed of organics containing non-polar saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons (e. g. asphalting: O:C 100 mu g m(- 3) and can easily breach the European limit level of PM 10. This study also shows that particulate mineral dust emissions are strongly dependent on soil moisture and can thus successfully {{be reduced to a}} high percentage by wetting the ground (for PM 10 up to 95 +/- 34 %) showing the importance of potential mitigation strategies.

40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} {{hydraulic}} conductivity tests {{have been conducted}} on soil samples to develop and verify the zone of acceptance for liner placement. Compaction testing and flexible wall hydraulic conductivity tests were performed on fifteen (15) samples to determine the dry unit weight, molding water content, and laboratory permeability. Five of the fifteen samples were compacted at Standard proctor energy, five were compacted at 75 percent of Standard proctor energy, and five were compacted at 50 percent of Standard proctor energy. The results obtained from the laboratory portion of the testing program (the zone of acceptance) are presented. A ten foot-long by ten foot-foot wide by four foot tall box was created in an environmentally controlled environment (indoor lab). Six inches of sand {{were placed in the}} bottom of the box and overlain with a geotextile filter fabric. An eight-inch thick loose lift of clay was then placed, and compacted into a six-inch thick lift using two passes of a vibratory <b>plate</b> <b>compactor.</b> Five nuclear density tests were conducted on the first lift to ensure the soil was compacted within the zone of acceptance. This procedure was then continued for the remaining three lifts. A two-stage borehole (TSB) hydraulic conductivity test was conducted at the center of the test pad. The first stage (vertical) was conducted at 10 inches below the top of the liner, and the second stage (horizontal) was conducted from 10 inches to 16 inches below the top of the liner. The results obtained from the environmentally controlled TSB test were compared against tests conducted on landfill liner tests pads constructed at three different landfills within the state of Missouri. Two of the landfill liner tests pads were covered with tents while one was not covered. The results obtained from the environmentally controlled TSB did not display the same changes in hydraulic conductivity associated with diurnal cycles of direct sunlight that were observed in the landfill test pads. These diurnal cycles may result in a placement technique being rejected...|$|E
