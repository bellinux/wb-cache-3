500|$|After {{commissioning}} the pilot, ITV Network Centre did not dictate to {{the producers}} {{who should be}} cast. John Thomson, a comedian known for his work with Steve Coogan, {{was the first to}} be cast. He had played Rick, a minor character in The Perfect Match, a role Bullen describes as [...] "proto-Pete". Bullen was impressed by Thomson's natural comedy and Langan asked him to write a role for him to play in Cold Feet. Thomson accepted the role because {{he did not want to}} be known forever for playing [...] "Fat Bob", the sidekick of Coogan's Paul Calf in a series of sketches. Lowney had been introduced to James Nesbitt through a mutual friend. He brought him in to audition for the part of Adam after seeing his [...] "wonderfully expressive face" [...] in a <b>Persil</b> advertisement. At the audition, Nesbitt asked to do the reading with his own accent, believing that Northern Irish characters rarely appeared in contemporary British drama without [...] "political baggage". Langan found Nesbitt's approach to be refreshing and he was cast as Adam.|$|E

5000|$|Henkel AG manufactures, distributes, {{and markets}} <b>Persil</b> in Germany, Poland {{and most of}} Europe, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria. <b>Persil</b> was {{introduced}} to Mexico in 2011. Henkel markets <b>Persil</b> under the name [...] "Dixan" [...] in Greece, Italy and Cyprus; and under the name [...] "Wipp" [...] in Spain and China. There are some national markets (Belgium,) where both Henkel's <b>Persil</b> and Dixan {{can be found at}} major retailers. In such cases, the <b>Persil</b> brand name is given priority by Henkel in its marketing. Henkel sells its <b>Persil</b> formulation in France under the name [...] "Le Chat", as Unilever owns the license to the <b>Persil</b> trademark in that country.|$|E
50|$|<b>Persil</b> {{made its}} BBC Radio 1 debut in 1998, when John Peel played a track from the band's first demo in his show.

50|$|Despite {{the large}} {{publicity}} campaign, {{the sales of}} <b>Persil</b> and <b>Persil</b> Power did not significantly increase, because <b>Persil</b> by itself was capable of dealing with most stains. The most serious problem was that after a few washes with <b>Persil</b> Power, clothes first started to lose their colour definition and then their structural integrity, ripping easily under any significant stress. Effectively, washing clothes in <b>Persil</b> Power had the same effect as adding bleach to the clothes. Further testing determined that while the effects weren't apparent on new clothes (which Unilever had performed most of <b>Persil</b> Power's testing with) they could become very quickly apparent on older clothes. The effects were largely determined {{to be due to}} <b>Persil</b> Power beinga little too powerful in the recommended quantities, and a chemical reaction (which Unilever had not detected) occurring between the catalyst agents and dyes used commonly in clothes. Subsequently, a hasty reformulation with less catalyst was released, but that too was suspected of causing problems and was equally mired by the bad publicity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Persil</b> is a {{brand of}} laundry {{detergent}} made by Henkel; but which is now also licensed for manufacture, distribution, and marketing in several countries by Unilever. Henkel and Unilever both manufacture their own formulations. Introduced in 1907, <b>Persil</b> is notable {{because it was the}} first commercially available [...] "self-activated" [...] laundry detergent. The name, <b>Persil,</b> is derived from two of its original ingredients, sodium perborate and sodium silicate. It is Unilever's premium brand in Ireland and the United Kingdom. <b>Persil</b> is sold in many forms, with several [...] "environment friendly" [...] products.|$|E
50|$|Today, <b>Persil</b> {{is sold in}} powder, liquid detergent, liquid capsule, liqui-gel, and tablet forms. There are biological, non-biological (with {{and without}} enzymes, respectively) and colour care (biological and bleach-free) {{formulations}} as well. The <b>Persil</b> line also includes specialist care products for wool and silk items. In the UK, Unilever uses the <b>Persil</b> brand to market {{a wide range of}} washing up liquids and dishwasher detergents.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Unilever's <b>Persil</b> {{detergent}} risked losing its market-leading position as independent tests were showing the major brands to have relatively similar performance in removing stains. Unilever {{decided that they}} needed a product with an edge in stain removal. Persil's main competitor, Ariel, had recently introduced Ariel Ultra, {{the first of the}} [...] "super compacts" [...] - washing powders equipped with chemical catalysts which (according to the advertising) cleaned better than ever, with less powder. Given Ariel Ultra's success, and with <b>Persil</b> Micro System lagging, Unilever needed a new super-compact <b>Persil</b> line. Thus, <b>Persil</b> Power was conceived.|$|E
