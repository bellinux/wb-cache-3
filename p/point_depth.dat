30|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} depths {{to the top and}} bottom of the magnetized crust and to characterize the heat flow within the Ikogosi Warm Spring area using Curie <b>point</b> <b>depth</b> (CPD) estimates from spectral analysis of aeromagnetic data. Results will be invaluable to electricity generation companies in Nigeria, especially now that alternative sources of power generation in Nigeria are being explored. The CPD is known as the depth at which the dominant magnetic mineral in the crust passes from a ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state under the effect of increasing temperature (Nagata [1961]). For this purpose, the basal depth (depth to the bottom) of a magnetic source from aeromagnetic data is considered to be the CPD (Dolmaz et al. [2005]).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} variational {{framework}} to generate super-resolved novel views from 4 D light field data sampled at low resolution, for exam-ple by a plenoptic camera. In contrast to previous work, we formulate {{the problem of}} view synthesis as a continuous inverse problem, which allows us to correctly take into account foreshortening effects caused by scene geometry transformations. High-accuracy depth maps for the input views are locally estimated using epipolar plane image analysis, which yields floating <b>point</b> <b>depth</b> precision {{without the need for}} expensive matching cost minimization. The disparity maps are further improved by increas-ing angular resolution with synthesized intermediate views.

30|$|We {{have applied}} {{spectral}} analysis to aeromagnetic anomalies {{in order to}} estimate the basal depth herein assumed Curie <b>point</b> <b>depth,</b> beneath the Ikogosi Warm Spring region - Ekiti State, Nigeria. We {{found out that the}} region is characterized by shallow Curie depths and high heat flow. The Ikogosi Warm Spring area is underlined by an average Curie <b>point</b> <b>depth</b> of 15.1 [*]±[*] 0.6  km. This shallow CPD implies a heat flow of 91.2 [*]±[*] 2.1  mW/m 2. We were however constrained by the lack of additional information about temperature measurements at depth so we compare our calculated heat flow result with the value expected in Precambrian basement complex. We observed that our value lies within the margins of the expected value of 37.6 [*]±[*] 50.2  mW/m 2 (Verheijen and Ajakaiye [1979]) and conclude that our calculations seem satisfactory. We also consider the relationship between heat flow density and radioactive heat production rate to further confirm our CPD results. Our estimated equivalent depth extent of heat flow density and radioactive heat production also falls within the margins of the CPD values for the region, despite that they were computed independent of each other. We conclude that the equivalent depth extent in this respect could represent the depth of change in mineralogy in the crust. Generally, we conclude that the shallow CPD observed is due to magmatic intrusion at depth. The seismic activities recorded close to this region, a major fault presence (Ifewara fault), multiple fractures in the rock units and low CPDs could be results of movement of, or within, thin magmatic intrusions. We therefore recommend detailed temperature measurement at various depths through a series of boreholes to be located at adequate intervals within the crystalline basement complex of Nigeria. This would provide the much needed data for further studies of the origin, emplacement, geophysical and geological characteristics of the basement complex. The results obtained in this work have provided important geophysical/geological inputs which are useful to further geothermal energy exploration in the region.|$|E
30|$|The {{method used}} for basal or Curie <b>point</b> <b>depth</b> (CPD) {{calculations}} is very subjective, needs great caution, {{and has to}} be constrained by independent information for a particular region. The theoretical basis of estimating the depth from Fourier spectra has been explained by several authors such as Spector ([1968]), Spector and Grant ([1970]), and Hahn et al. ([1976]) among others. The algorithm given by Spector and Grant ([1970]) directly estimates the depth of the causative body from the relationship between the logarithmic power and frequencies. For a single ensemble, the natural log of the power spectrum density as a function of wave number would have a linear slope approximately twice the maximum depth (Rabeh et al. [2008]). For multiple ensembles, one obtains a linear slope approximately twice the maximum depths to the various magnetic sources (Rabeh et al. [2008]; Trifonova et al. [2009]; Bansal et al. [2011]; Abraham et al. [2014]).|$|E
40|$|Neither of the {{classical}} visual servoing approaches, position-based and image-based, are completely satisfactory.

However, in some cases, singularities and local minima may arise, and the robot can go further from its joint limits.
