5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (<b>PCOS),</b> a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in <b>PCOS</b> was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with <b>PCOS</b> and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with <b>PCOS.</b> A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (<b>PCOS),</b> which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E

A decreased skin blood flow is known to influence the transcutaneous oxygen tension (tc PO 2), and tc <b>PCO</b> 2 might be affected in an equal way.

We conclude, that during stress situations with a low skin perfusion, as in the acutely instrumented guinea pig, re <b>PCO</b> 2 is higher than the arterial <b>PCO</b> 2 and can be influenced by changes in skin blood flow.

MethodsTo evaluate performed capsulotomy as a measurement of <b>PCO</b> a random sample ofcataract patients who had surgery in 1991 was studied 5 years after their surgery. Tofurther study quantification of <b>PCO</b> visual acuity, morphologic quantification of PCOand self-assessed visual function were compared in 21 patients with <b>PCO.</b> Effectsof treatment of <b>PCO</b> on functional outcome were investigated in 47 patients usingCatquest. In a retrospective study with a 3 -year follow up, patients who had receivedan acrylic IOL during cataract surgery were compared with patients who had receivedpolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) IOLs in terms of need for treatment of <b>PCO.</b> In aprospective clinical study with a 3 -year follow up patients who had received siliconeIOLs with two different designs were compared. <b>PCO</b> was evaluated using Evaluationof Posterior Capsule Opacification (EPCO), a morphological method of quantification,and the number of performed capsulotomies was recorded. ResultsThe estimated incidence of <b>PCO</b> 5 years after cataract surgery was 43 %, and the untreatedgroup with clinically significant <b>PCO</b> was approximately 9 %. The incidence ofperformed capsulotomy was higher in women than in men. The morphological methodof quantifying <b>PCO</b> correlated with visual acuity and self-assessed visual function asmeasured with Catquest. Seventy-seven per cent of the <b>PCO</b> patients benefited fromcapsulotomy according to Catquest. The relative risk of needing capsulotomy was 3. 6 times higher in the PMMA group than in the acrylic group.

40|$|Aims Soil {{waterlogging}} impedes {{gas exchange}} with the atmosphere, {{resulting in low}} PO 2 and often high <b>PCO</b> 2. Conditions conducive to development of high <b>PCO</b> 2 (5 – 70 kPa) during soil waterlogging and flooding are discussed. The scant information on responses of roots to high <b>PCO</b> 2 in terms of growth and metabolism is reviewed. Scope <b>PCO</b> 2 at 15 – 70 kPa has been reported for flooded paddy-field soils; however, even 15 kPa <b>PCO</b> 2 {{may not always be}} reached, e. g. when soil pH is above 7. Increases of <b>PCO</b> 2 in soils following waterlogging will develop much more slowly than decreases in PO 2; in soil from rice paddies in pots without plants, maxima in <b>PCO</b> 2 were reached after 2 – 3 weeks. There are no reliable data on <b>PCO</b> 2 in roots when in waterlogged or flooded soils. In rhizomes and internodes, <b>PCO</b> 2 sometimes reached 10 kPa, inferring even higher partial pressures in the roots, as a CO 2 diffusion gradient will exist from the roots to the rhizomes and shoots. Preliminary modelling predicts that when <b>PCO</b> 2 is higher in a soil than in roots, <b>PCO</b> 2 in the roots would remain well below the <b>PCO</b> 2 in the soil, particularly when there is ventilation via a well-developed gas-space continuum from the roots to the atmosphere.

However, little is known regarding the interactive effects of Cu and ocean acidification on macroalgae. In this study, a green tide macroalga, Ulva prolifera, was cultured at the conditions of three levels of Cu (control, 0. 5 µM, and 2 µM) and <b>pCO</b> 2 (ambient, 1000 µatm, and 1400 µatm) to investigate the responses of U. prolifera to interaction of Cu exposure and ocean acidification. The relative growth rate of thalli decreased with the rise of Cu for all <b>pCO</b> 2 conditions except the 1000 ?atm <b>pCO</b> 2. Compared with the control, 2 µM Cu reduced the net photosynthetic rate for all <b>pCO</b> 2 conditions while 0. 5 µM Cu only reduced it at 1400 µatm <b>pCO</b> 2. The inhibition rate of Cu on the relative growth rate and net photosynthetic rate was reduced at 1000 µatm <b>pCO</b> 2 but was magnified at 1400 ?atm <b>pCO</b> 2. Contrary to growth, the dark respiration rate was enhanced by 0. 5 µM Cu at ambient <b>pCO</b> 2 and by 2 µM Cu at ambient and 1000 µatm <b>pCO</b> 2, although it was reduced by 2 µM Cu at 1400 µatm <b>pCO</b> 2 compared to the control. The 0. 5 µM Cu did not affect the relative electron transport rate (rETR) for any <b>pCO</b> 2 condition but 2 µM Cu decreased it for all <b>pCO</b> 2 conditions except 1000 µatm <b>pCO</b> 2. The mute effect of 0. 5 µM Cu on the net photosynthetic rate and rETR at ambient <b>pCO</b> 2 may be due to more Chl a and Chl b being synthesized. In addition, 2 µM Cu and 1400 µatm <b>pCO</b> 2 led to branched thalli, which may be a defense mechanism against the stress of high Cu and <b>pCO</b> 2.

Taking advantage of this pre-experimental treatment, and to address the aims of this study, I firstly carried out a multi-generational selection experiment (six generations), in which present <b>pCO</b> 2 levels were my experimental treatment and elevated <b>pCO</b> 2 levels my control. Secondly, I carried out a reciprocal cross experiment with generation F 7 {{to determine the extent of}} adaptive recovery to present <b>pCO</b> 2 levels. Throughout the study I measured a range of life-history traits as well as metabolic rates. The only trait that was significantly affected by exposure to present <b>pCO</b> 2 levels was female fecundity. In generation F 1, female fecundity was significantly lower in the present <b>pCO</b> 2 treatment, thus indicating that the pre-experimental treatment had resulted in adaptation to elevated <b>pCO</b> 2 conditions. However, female fecundity significantly increased between generations F 1 and F 3, so that from generation F 3 -F 7 a significant difference was no longer present. In the reciprocal cross experiment, there was no significant difference in fecundity between the present- present <b>pCO</b> 2 cross and the present-elevated <b>pCO</b> 2 cross, thus indicating that acclimation was responsible for increasing and maintaining fecundity levels in the present <b>pCO</b> 2 treatment. This work has shown that rapid adaptation to elevated <b>pCO</b> 2 conditions is possible in a marine metazoan, and for the first time that once adapted to elevated <b>pCO</b> 2 conditions there is the potential for adaptive recovery to present <b>pCO</b> 2 conditions...|$|R
40|$|Reduction of lethal and {{compromised}} fetal {{outcome is}} a benefit of rising socio-economic standards and better health care, including {{technologies such as}} cardiotocography and fetal blood analysis. The pursuit of higher standards in obstetrics leads to new and improved techniques. The transcutaneously measured carbon dioxide tension (tc <b>PCO</b> 2) was proposed as a continuous and non-invasive method revealing the acid-base status of the fetus. Nonetheless, intrapartum surveillance by measuring tc <b>PCO</b> 2 is rarely used in clinical practice. To assess the value of fetal monitoring by tc <b>PCO</b> 2 during parturition, tc <b>PCO</b> 2 measurements were compared with the fetal acid-base status. Tc <b>PCO</b> 2 was measured by a recently developed electrode during 21 deliveries. The tc <b>PCO</b> 2 electrode was disinfected, calibrated and applied to the presenting part of the fetus after rupture of membranes. The acid-base status of the fetus was determined with a commercial blood gas analyser in capillary blood (n = 33) and umbilical artery samples (n = 15). Tc <b>PCO</b> 2 was correlated with the <b>PCO</b> 2 of the capillary blood (r = 0. 56; n = 33; P < 0. 001) {{as well as with}} the <b>PCO</b> 2 in the umbilical artery (r = 0. 75; n = 15; P < 0. 01). The pH value of capillary blood was related to tc <b>PCO</b> 2 (r = - 0. 56; n = 33; P < 0. 001). However, tc <b>PCO</b> 2 did not show a significant relation with the pH value in the umbilical artery (r = - 0. 34; n = 15). Variations in skin blood flow are known to decrease the transcutaneously measured oxygen tension (tc PO 2) below the PO 2 in the capillary and umbilical blood. The simultaneously measured tc <b>PCO</b> 2 approximately equalled the capillary and umbilical <b>PCO</b> 2. Hence, tc <b>PCO</b> 2 is rather independent of skin blood flow during uncomplicated deliveries. We conclude, that non-invasive and continuous measurement of fetal tc <b>PCO</b> 2 provides information about the acid-base status of the fetus. Tc <b>PCO</b> 2 cannot replace fetal blood analysis, though it may reduce the need for repeated fetal blood analysis during deliveries if signs of fetal distress occur...|$|R
