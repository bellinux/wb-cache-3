5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing <b>power,</b> <b>current</b> in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{electrical}} method is effective on detecting and locating leaks in geomembrane liners for landfills. If a leak {{exists in the}} liner, an anomaly in the measured potential is generated {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the leak through which electrical current is flowing. But the <b>power</b> supply <b>current</b> above the liner can affect the potential distribution. A current point source model for <b>power</b> supply <b>current</b> was set up in this paper. The potential equation induced by the point source was derived. The analysis of potential expression shows that: 1) the potential generated by the <b>power</b> supply <b>current</b> is proportional to the current size and the medium resistivity; 2) as the medium thickness increases, the potential reduces; 3) to reduce the influence of <b>power</b> supply <b>current,</b> the <b>power</b> supply electrode should be away from the detection area as far as possible...|$|R
