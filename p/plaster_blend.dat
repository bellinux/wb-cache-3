In that way, eco-design considering the life cycle of products, processes or services, plays a fundamental role in innovation driven companies, adding a sustainable value to the strategy of the firm. In this paper the results of a research concerning eco-design strategies are presented. The Italian medium size company in partnership with the Architecture and Design Department of Politecnico di Torino undertook the research which the aim is the environmental improvement of building materials and products. Therefore, the LCA method is been applied as a tool for integrating environmental criteria into the strategic plans in order to: - evaluate environmental impacts; - improve brand value on the market; - fulfill client demand; - make products more fashionable; - integrate eco-design into energy efficiency construction sector. A case study proposed in this paper shows a LCA-based analysis applied to a thermal plaster from different perspective of whole life cycle stages, including: row materials suppliers, manufacturing companies, building designers, installation company, end-user and end-of-life business. The main goal, from all the project partners points of view, is the development of an innovating product characterized by the combination of: low environmental impacts of production, high market competitiveness (in price, energy efficiency, installation features, etc.) and long expected service life. In particular, two different analysis are carried out to promote both the environmental benefits and the industrial feasibility. LCA methodology is applied to develop and improve a range of experimental prototypes of thermal plaster using natural material as a primary source including minerals and plants, often derived from agriculture by-products or scraps. This first step can be helpful for the industrial partner to evaluate environmental impacts of each <b>plaster</b> <b>blend</b> as well as assessing and optimizing every manufacturing process to formulate a final product that follows appropriate eco-design criteria in terms of energy and environmental impact and cost. A second step of the study concerns the comparison between existing thermal plasters with the eco-innovating product coming from the former analysis. In this context, the Life Cycle Assessment methodology can be applied to eco-design to promote circular economy and influencing decision makers towards sustainable choices. As a result, interlinked local companies can share by-products and process scraps to reduce environmental impact and support eco-innovatio...|$|E

[...] Friedrich Delitzsch among numerous other scholars suggested that the Jewish and Christian term Eden traced back to this term, though its etymology is now thought to lie elsewhere.|$|R

By mid-century, with Fort Gansevoort replaced by freight yards of the Hudson River Railroad, a neighborhood developed which was part heavy industry and part residential [...] - [...] a pattern which was more typical of an earlier period in the city's history but which was becoming less usual, as industry and residences began to be isolated in their own districts. In the western portion of {{the neighborhood}}, heavy industry such as iron works and a terra cotta manufacturer could be found, while lighter industry such as carpentry and woodworking, lumber yards, paint works, granite works and a <b>plaster</b> mill <b>blended</b> into the residential area. At the time of the Civil War the part of the district west of Ninth Avenue and Greenwich Street and above 10th Street was the location of numerous distilleries making turpentine and camphene, a lamp fuel.|$|R
5000|$|The plaster veneer method {{begins with}} the hanging of {{specially}} designated drywall ("blueboard"), in the conventional manner., N.B. In North America, {{the color of the}} face paper of drywall indicates its intended application: white for standard, green for moisture resistance, etc. Plaster veneer wallboard is blue or gray http://www.foardpanel.com/index_files/drywall%20color.pdf. Plaster veneer may also be applied to ordinary drywall, or over existing walls, but this requires [...] "gluing" [...] the existing wall surface by painting on a special adhesive compound, and then applying a thin layer of [...] "base coat" [...] plaster. After the blueboard or base coat covers the interior of a room, the finishing plaster is mixed in batches (typically about 5 gallons), by <b>blending</b> <b>plaster</b> powder with water, to the ideal consistency. Working quickly, a thin layer (usually one to three millimeters) of finish plaster is applied over a wall face before the plaster begins to congeal in the bucket. Over a period of a few hours, as the plaster chemically sets on the wall, it is periodically smoothed or textured using hand trowels, until the desired finish is achieved. When a wall face has sufficiently set, an adjoining face can be safely applied. After the plaster has fully set, it is allowed to cure for a period of days to weeks, permitting excess moisture to escape into the air. If the plaster is no more than about three millimeters thick, two to three days' cure time is usually sufficient. A skilled eye can see areas where moisture is lingering until the curing is complete. After the walls are fully cured, they are ideal for painting or papering.|$|R
