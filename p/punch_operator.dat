50|$|Though no perfect {{method to}} {{quantify}} the increase in revenue can be relied upon, yet there are clear evidences which suggested that substantial increase in revenue was registered due to improved custom processes. I will quote only one instance. Before WeBOC the exemption of withholding tax was used to be granted on submitting hard copy of exemption certificate to the PRAL key <b>punch</b> <b>operator,</b> who entered that number manually and importer used to get exemption. A large number of fake exemption certificates were detected in the past. In WeBOC system the exemption and concessions were being entered on line by the Commissioner (IRS). Commissioner Withholding Tax, Karachi had acknowledged the fact in a meeting that in new automated system collection of withholding tax at import stage had increased more than 15-20% (to the tune of 15-20 billion rupees) after its implementation. A chunk of this amount is attributed to automation.|$|E

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} world, the latter interpretation {{is by far}} the more common (although persons belonging to the former category of hacker would seek to more accurately define the latter group, particularly those with a malicious intent, as ‘crackers’). Hackers are by no means a new threat and have routinely featured in news stories during the last two decades. Indeed, they have become the traditional ‘target’ of the media, with the standard approach being to present the image of either a ‘teenage whiz kid’ or an insidious threat.

He relates how he first learned about computers in Air Force <b>punch</b> card <b>operator</b> school and ran IBM punched card machines during the Korean War. Vincent joined International Harvester after the war, operating an IBM 602 A and later {{one of the first}} IBM 705 computers. He discusses the problems with the 705 and the field support offered by IBM. In 1959 Vincent joined Montgomery Ward, where he operated an early drum computer, the IBM 650. Vincent describes the difficulties of operating a drum computer. In 1961 Vincent joined Pillsbury, where he converted the company from an IBM punched card system to a General Electric 225 computer. He describes subsequent computer acquisitions at Pillsbury, including the 1965 acquisition of a GE 625, one of the early multi-processing computers. In 1969 Vincent joined Standard Computer Corporation, founded by engineers from the Call-A-Computer Division of Pillsbury, where he worked with Lazlo Rocozi on an IBM 7090 take-off, the IC 7000. In 1971 Vincent returned to Pillsbury and programmed the GE 635 in Cobol. Vincent discusses the problems of integrating different computer systems both within Pillsbury and with other companies. He concludes by discussing why Pillsbury uses GE (now Honeywell) instead of IBM computers...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION All {{aspects of}} human-computer interaction, from the {{high-level}} concerns of organizational context and system requirements to the conceptual, semantic, and syntactic levels of user interface design, are ultimately funneled through physical {{input and output}} actions and devices. This chapter considers the input half of this physical level of human-computer interaction, the final {{means by which the}} user communicates information to the computer. It is also called the Lexical level of the design of an interactive system, in contrast to the successively higher Syntactic, Semantic, and Conceptual levels [Foley, 1990 a]. Computer input once consisted of such actions as setting switches and knobs and plugging and unplugging jumper wires in patch boards. For many years after that, the primary form of computer input was the punched card. Users or, more often, specialist keypunch <b>operators</b> <b>punched</b> the input information as holes in paper cards, which could then be read by comput...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the 1973 and 1975 {{vocational}} business and office education graduates trained in the intensive office laboratory, the data processing laboratory, and the cooperative office education programs in Region VI of the State of Indiana. Tables were constructed to display aggregate and detailed data pertaining to: 1. employment status of graduates 2. reasons for graduate unemployment 3. length of time graduates have beenemployed 4. satisfaction of the graduates withcurrent employment 5. perception of the graduates of thehigh school vocational programs 6. number of graduates continuing posthigh school training 7. type of institutions serving thegraduates post high school trainingneeds 8. occupational classification of the employed vocational business and office education graduates 9. graduate participation in the Office Education Association. So that the {{purpose of the}} study could be met, all 577 vocational business and office education graduates were surveyed. The data was based on a return of 365 questionnaires or a 68. 9 per cent return. A questionnaire was developed and field tested. After the graduates returned the questionnaire, questionnaires were mailed to the employers of the graduates employed in an office occupation to determine the validity of the data collected. Some of the findings are: 1. Sixty-nine per cent of the graduates were employed, twenty per cent were not seeking employment, and eleven per cent were seeking employment. 2. Over seventy-six per cent of the employed graduates were employed in office occupations and fifty-three per cent were still employed in the first employment position. 3. Fifty-four per cent of the employed graduates were employed within the same geographic area where the vocational training was provided and forty-six per cent had been employed longer than thirteen months. 4. Seventy-one per cent of the unemployed graduates had been employed since graduation. 5. Twenty per cent of the employed cooperative office education graduates and twenty per cent of the intensive office education graduates were employed as secretaries. 6. Twelve per cent of the data processing graduates were employed as computer operators and twelve per cent as key <b>punch</b> <b>operators.</b> 7. Fifteen per cent of the employed graduates and forty-three per cent of the unemployed graduates were enrolled in post high school training. Based on the data, some of the conclusions are: 1. The vocational programs currently underway must be meeting the needs of the graduates since more than ninety per cent of all vocational business and office education graduates within Region VI have been employed. 2. Vocational programs are training students for employment positions which meet the desires of graduates since more than seventy-five per cent of the respondents working in office occupations were satisfied with the current employment position. 3. The vocational programs must be providing the necessary training within the current vocational business and office education programs since more than ninety per cent of the graduates working in office positions indicated that they were adequately prepared for the position. Following are some of the recommendations of the study: 1. A comprehensive longitudinal follow-up study should be conducted on the vocational graduates that follows the progression of the graduatesin and out of the labor market and post-secondary education institutions. 2. Follow-up studies should be conducted every one and three years and a standard questionnaire should be adopted by the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction. 3. A follow-up study should be conducted with the employers of the vocational graduates to ascertain the extent of employer satisfaction with the job competence and performance of the graduates.

40|$|Information on {{geologic}} formations {{has always}} been needed by government agencies, industries, and individuals interested in mineral and water resources. Increasing interest in these resources and in the growing environmental problems caused by underground storage of materials and waste disposal has created a need for ready access to geologic data. Several government agencies in Minnesota collect {{a large amount of}} geologic data. Until the present time each agency maintained its own file, although exchange of data has occurred often and freely. However, to avoid duplication of effort and to establish the most efficient data storage and retrieval system it was decided that the Minnesota Geological Survey would maintain the central file of geologic data for the State and that the data should be stored in a digital computer system. A printout would then be provided of whatever geologic data was requested by other agencies and individuals. The first need in establishing a system for computer processing of geologic data is to store geologic logs on machine-readable punched cards. The purpose of this report is to provide instructions for recording and coding geologic log data in such a manner that it can be <b>punched</b> by keypunch <b>operators...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that Digital Humanities (DH) has, of late, gone from {{strength}} to strength. New teaching programmes in DH {{have been set}} up in institutions across the world; a flurry of new publications on the topic have recently appeared; and the numbers attending its annual Conference of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations grow year on year. It is also widely agreed that Digital Humanities has its finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist. By this I mean that its practitioners use a host of new – or at least newly applied – methods in order to carry out Humanities research that might otherwise be impossible, for example, text analysis, distant reading, 3 D imaging and so on. Why, then, should a discipline like DH, which is characterised so much by its present be aware of its past? The current dearth of literature on the history of Digital Humanities might indeed indicate that its practitioners are not convinced that it should. Indeed, until recently Digital Humanities has more or less ignored its disciplinary history. The application of computing to the Humanities {{can be traced back to}} 1949, at least, when Fr Roberto Busa S. J. (1913 – 2011), with funding from IBM began work on an index variorum of some 11 million words of Medieval Latin in the works of St Thomas Aquinas. It is astonishing to note that no comprehensive histories of DH and no book-length studies of such developments exist. This talk will explore ongoing research into the history of Digital Humanities in order to argue that its rich histories are ones that should urgently be addressed. In particular, I will give a detailed overview of research that I undertook during a recent visit to the archive of Busa, who is often identified as a pioneer of what is now known as Digital Humanities. While there we interviewed a number of the female <b>punch</b> card <b>operators</b> who worked for Busa in the 1950 s and 1960 s and whose names had disappeared from the historical record. As well as revealing their otherwise hidden stories I will reflect on how the findings of this project resonate with modern-day Digital Humanities, especially in terms of our understandings of issues like collaboration, gender and knowledge transfer...|$|R
