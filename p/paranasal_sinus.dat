40|$|BACKGROUND : The <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> and {{mastoid air cells}} vary {{considerably}} in size and shape from person to person. The main structures are pneumatic. In this study, we investigated the relationship between right and left sides and evaluated the volume changes according to age and sex. METHODS : Of all patients attending the radiology department, 91 cases without <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> and mastoid air cells pathology (i. e., inflammation, operation or trauma) were selected for evaluation. Axial computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained for both <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> and temporal bones. In all scans, the volumes of each area (maxillary sinus, frontal sinus, sphenoid sinus and mastoid air cell) were calculated and analyzed statistically. RESULTS : The volumes of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> and mastoid air cells increased with age and women had a lower mean volume. There was {{a positive correlation between}} right-left and ipsilateral structures (<b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> and mastoid air cells).

Anosmia may be temporary, but some anosmia (including traumatic anosmia) can be permanent. Anosmia is due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa, blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe.

50|$|Dysosmia is a {{disorder}} described as any qualitative alteration or {{distortion of the}} perception of smell. Qualitative alterations differ from quantitative alterations, which include anosmia and hyposmia. Dysosmia can be classified as either parosmia (also called troposmia) or phantosmia. Parosmia refers to a distortion {{in the perception of}} an odorant. Odorants smell different from what one remembers. Phantosmia refers to the perception of an odor when there's no actual odorant present. The cause of dysosmia still remains a theory. It is typically considered a neurological disorder and clinical associations with the disorder have been made. Most cases are described as idiopathic and the main antecedents related to parosmia are URTIs, head trauma, and nasal and <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease. Dysosmia tends to go away on its own but there are options for treatment for patients that want immediate relief.|$|E
40|$|Genotype-phenotype {{correlations}} in {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) {{have been found}} for lung and pancreatic function, but not for <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease. Because such correlations may have pathophysiological and clinical implications, the correlation of mutations, in particular DeltaF 508, with <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was investigated in 113 CF patients with known genotype. The clinical importance of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was evaluated using three parameters: polyps, overall clinical severity of upper airway problems, and surgery. Polyps were evaluated by nasal endoscopy and graded on a five-point scale. Four severity groups were distinguished based on history, clinical records, and examination: no upper airway problems; more problems than in control subjects; severe, recurrent or chronic problems; and <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> surgery cases. DeltaF 508 homozygosity correlated with clinical severity (p < 0. 02) and {{with the presence of}} polyps on endoscopy (p < 0. 05). The relative risk for <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> surgery in DeltaF 508 homozygous CF patients was 2. 33.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe study aims were {{to assess}} the {{association}} of microflora between the <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> and the lower airways of children attending a regional paediatric cystic fibrosis centre and to determine the performance of an eradication treatment protocol for positive <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> samples. MethodPaired nasal lavage and lower airway samples (cough swabs or sputum) were taken from 54 children with cystic fibrosis (median age 11 years). Positive <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> samples received eradication treatment, using oral and sinonasal nebulised antibiotics. ResultsA correlation between <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> and lower airways was detected in 33 / 54 paired timed samples (p< 0. 02). Of 4 / 54 children who reported sinus symptoms, only 2 had <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> positive samples. 28 positive nasal lavage samples cultured 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), 8 Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and 12 other bacterial pathogens. Eradication using sinonasal nebulised antibiotics and oral antibiotics showed a success of 14 / 21 (67 %) treated <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> positive samples at 1 month & 3 months after treatment. Success rate was 75 % in the PA group and 71 % in the SA group. Ongoing monitoring with nasal lavage will continue.

Background: The association between diabetes and <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We cross-sectionally investigated the association between diabetes and the presence of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease, which was confirmed by a head MRI scan in 1350 adults who underwent a health screening program focusing on brain diseases and metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression, which was adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension, smoking status, alcohol intake, and white blood cell count, was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of having <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease among adults with diabetes in relation to those without. The dose-response relationship between hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) levels and the presence of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was also investigated. Results: Of the 1350 participants (mean age, 61. 6 ± 10. 0 years; 71. 6 % men), 220 diabetes cases were identified. <b>Paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was diagnosed in 151 adults. The adjusted OR of having <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was 1. 74 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 12 – 2. 71) in those with diabetes. The odds of having <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease increased with HbA 1 c levels. Compared to those with HbA 1 c of ≤ 5. 4 %, those with HbA 1 c of 5. 5 %– 6. 4 %, 6. 5 %– 7. 9 %, and ≥ 8. 0 % {{were more likely to have}} <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease, with adjusted ORs of 1. 32 (95 % CI, 0. 88 – 1. 98), 1. 63 (95 % CI, 0. 86 – 3. 09) and 2. 71 (95 % CI, 1. 12 – 6. 61), respectively (P for trend = 0. 019). Conclusions: Diabetes may be significantly associated with higher prevalence of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease in Japanese adults.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: <b>Paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> pneumatization in {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) is less extensive compared {{to the general population}} and seems to be correlated to CF genotype. Interestingly, in CF patients temporal bone pneumatization (TBP) is more extensive compared to the general population, and middle ear pathology is generally uncommon in CF. It is debated whether TBP is influenced environmentally or genetically. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate pneumatization of the temporal bone {{in patients}} with CF and to correlate this with genotype and <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> volume. Study Design: Prospective collection of data. Methods: In 104 adult CF patients, computed tomography of the temporal bone and the paranasal sinuses was performed. TBP was graded using a validated scoring system. Patients were divided into two groups, mild and severe CF, based on their mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Results: Of the 31 patients with mild CF, 71 % had extensive TBP, and of the 73 patients with severe CF, 82 % had extensive pneumatization of the temporal bone. TBP did not differ significantly for CF genotype, and TBP was not correlated to <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> volume. Conclusions: Whereas <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> pneumatization in CF patients seems to be related to CF genotype among other influencing factors, this study showed no correlation between TBP and CF genotype. TBP was not correlated to <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> volume. Hypothetically, in CF, pneumatization of the temporal bone is under a different influence than <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> pneumatizatio...|$|E
