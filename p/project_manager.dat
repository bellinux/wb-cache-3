To date, there has been limited research that has examined how <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> cope with work-related stress. This paper investigates whether coping and affect (both negative and positive) influence adjustment (anxiety, depression and stress) among <b>project</b> <b>managers.</b> A sample of 100 male <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> from Australian contracting organizations completed a questionnaire that measured coping strategies, affect state and potential stressors. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that specific work-related characteristics such as work experience, project size, age and level of education influenced the psychological adjustment of the <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> sampled. Further, those who engaged in a more problem-focused style of coping, such as active coping {{were found to be}} better adjusted than those who engaged in more emotion-focused styles of coping such as cognitive avoidance coping, social coping, accepting responsibility and self-controlling coping. In addition, it was revealed that increased adjustment of <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> was associated with positive affect.

40|$|In such complex {{technological}} {{industry as}} constructions where contracts are estimated with million Euro budgets, where competition is fierce and penalties are high, it’s essential for contractors to ensure all management activities facilitate project success. Today many construction companies practice project management approach and employ <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> {{in charge of}} project success. This thesis aims {{to find out whether}} <b>project</b> <b>manager’s</b> leadership style has impact on construction project outcome, and if <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> should emphasize task-motivated or relationship-oriented leadership style in order to facilitate project success. As conducted theory review has shown there has been some prior research on leadership style impact on project outcome. Researchers have generally agreed that <b>project</b> <b>manager’s</b> leadership style is one of the project success’ factors. But studies of particular styles’ impact on construction project outcome mostly presented results with regard to transactional and transformational leadership which describe leader’s ability to cope with tasks when organizations are facing considerable change. However research lacks studies on task and relationship motivation of construction <b>project</b> <b>managers.</b> This study was conducted in order to fill in the blank in prior research and to provide basement for further studies. A sample of 24 Russian construction <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> was surveyed on their leadership style (task-motivated or relationship-oriented) and on success rate of construction projects completed by each respondent. Results have shown that there is moderate correlation between leadership style of construction <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> and that in order to facilitate construction <b>project</b> success, <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> should adhere to task accomplishment before establishing good interpersonal relationships with involved people. Findings of this study can be interesting both for researchers who are willing to further study impact of task-motivated leadership style on construction project success, and also for construction project owners/sponsors who hire <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> and for construction <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> themselves so that they could develop their leadership style in order to improve their projects’ success rate...|$|R

It was published worldwide by Square Enix. While originally scheduled for 2010, the game was shifted to beyond April the following year so the team could further polish the gameplay. It was released for PlayStation 3 (PS3), Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). The gameplay was identical across all platforms barring control schemes. Originally Eidos had intended to make the PC retail version of the game region locked. The reason behind this was due to DVD limitations which meant the languages on the game had to be split.

Unvoiced characters include Kingsglaive members Sonitus Bellum and Axis Arra. While both English and Japanese voicetracks were produced, lip syncing for all versions was matched to the English voice work. The lead voice actors, such as Paul, were chosen so they would be recognized and appeal to a wide audience, in addition to their acting abilities. The Japanese voice casting followed a similar model, choosing well-known actors for the lead roles. Casting was handled by Rui Kawada, who also acted as general <b>project</b> <b>manager.</b> The compartmentalization of the development meant that the characters were mostly voiced by different actors to Final Fantasy XV.

The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of Awakening returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings <b>project</b> <b>manager,</b> came on board as a producer.

For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor.
