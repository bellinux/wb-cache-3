40|$|Study of deactivating methods against ceder <b>pollenosis</b> antigen in vitro: Every spring season, {{there are}} {{numerous}} <b>pollenosis</b> patients, especially ceder <b>pollenosis,</b> in our country. However, the radical theraputics against the <b>pollenosis</b> has not been established yet. Some deactivating methods, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, wet heat treatment and adsorption method to the extracted solution of ceder pollen were examined. Deactivating effect against the <b>pollenosis</b> antigen was determined by measuring the changes of the specific antibody values (IgE antibody) in patient blood serum as the marker in vitro. It was cleared that the UV irradiation, the heat treatment over 60 ℃ and the adsorbent containing the acid site were effective on the deactivation against the antigen...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} with Japanese cedar <b>pollenosis</b> were examined for lower airway function. Flow-volume patterns obtained from flow-volume and volume-time curves during the pollen season (March) {{and outside of}} the pollen season (June) were evaluated. In a previous report we classified maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves in five patterns from A to E. In the present study, the patterns did not vary between the two periods except in one patient. Eleven patients out of 15 showed type E patterns, in which the flow-volume curve was concave along its entire course. In most of the {{patients with}} severe or moderate symptoms of allergic rhinitis only during the pollen season, the curve shifted to the right, but the parameters of the curves did not increase significantly outside of season. These findings suggest that patients with Japanese cedar <b>pollenosis</b> suffer from continuous latent peripheral airway obstruction. Extremely slight changes in the flow rate were detected by comparing the curves obtained during the two periods. </p...|$|E
40|$|Eight-hundred and one {{patients}} amongst 1912 {{referred for}} skin testing because of suspected allergies were found suffering from asthma {{due to the}} house-dust mite or from grass <b>pollenosis.</b> They were analysed in terms of sex, age of referral and age of onset of symptoms. Amongst children referred below the age of 10 with house-dust mite asthma the ratio of males to females was 3 : 1; with grass <b>pollenosis</b> 2 - 1 : 1, as expected. The sex ratio gradually became reversed with increasing age of referral, females overtaking males in the third decade. Female-male ratios increased to a mean of 1 - 8 : 1 in {{the fourth and fifth}} decades. Reliable ages of onset of symptoms were obtained in 388 males and 323 females. Of these, 280 males and 162 females experienced their first symptoms before the age of 10 whereas 96 males and 148 females first developed symptoms between 10 and 29 years of age. The remaining 12 males and 13 females showed their first symptoms after the age of 29...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} with seasonal allergic <b>pollenosis</b> and five controls were investigated to elucidate {{the role of}} the T gamma-cell population in the in vitro IgE response by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). In vitro IgE production by PBL of atopic patients after antigenic stimulation was measured in culture supernatants. The optimal dose for antigenic stimulation was found to be 0. 16 micrograms/ 20 X 10 (6) cells of purified antigen. No difference was found when comparing the percentages of T cells (E rosettes) between the two groups: mean per cent for controls was 69. 2 +/- 5. 76 versus 69. 54 +/- 4. 42 for the allergic group. With regard to the T gamma-cell population, the values obtained by rosetting with ox erythrocytes sensitized with IgG antibody were 12 +/- 0. 71 % in normals and 9. 8 +/- 1. 32 % in those with allergic <b>pollenosis.</b> This difference, although significant, {{may not be enough to}} explain the different pattern when the in vitro IgE production of both groups investigated was compared. In order to detect the role of T gamma cells in this system, lymphocyte cultures, depleted of T gamma cells, were performed and compared with unfractionated cultures from the same donors. Our results show no differences in the in vitro IgE production when T gamma cells were depleted as compared with the unfractionated cultures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Allergic {{reaction}} to Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae pollens {{appears to be}} on the increase in the last years in Italy. An epidemiological survey on this <b>pollenosis</b> was conducted in 12 Italian centers. The diagnostic panel consisted of seven Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae genus (Cupressus sempervirens, Cupressus arizonica, Cryptomeria japonica, Chamaecyparis obtusa, Thuja orientalis, Taxus baccata, and Juniperus oxycedrus). A total of 3057 pollen-sensitized outpatients were examined. The study took place from November 1999 to March 2000. At the same time pollen counts were carried out. The prevalence of positive skin tests to the diagnostic panel is different in northern (9. 2...|$|E
40|$|Summary: In {{the last}} decades {{qualitative}} and quantitative changes in the pollen sensitization pattern occurred. In all developed countries a steady increase in the prevalence of respiratory allergies has been observed, together with a rise of subjects producing specific IgE to different pollen families and who develops allergic symptoms. The allergological relevance of some “emerging" pollens was also discussed. This event has been analyzed both from an aerobiological and clinical point of view, {{with reference to the}} pollen families concerned. The differences of <b>pollenosis</b> prevalence in different geographical areas and the effects on the seasonality of symptoms have been reported. At last the issue of increasing relevance of molecular diagnostics for allergic disease has been considered...|$|E
40|$|EVIDENCE {{indicating}} that Loffler's syndrome is {{a manifestation of}} an allergic reaction in the lung tissue is steadily accumulating. From {{the time of its}} original description by Loffler x in 1932, this syndrome of transitory pulmonary infiltra-tions associated with blood eosinophilia received much attention in European countries; it has been only {{in the past five years}} that American medical litera-ture has reflected an equal degree of interest. Loffler and his co-workers 2 reproduced the syndrome in the guinea pig by the administration of ascaris eggs, and early reports stressed the relationship of this syndrome to parasitic infestation, 3 ' 4 > 5 ' 6 » 7 especially ascariasis, amebiasis, trichinosis, filariasis and hookworm infestation. Emphasis shifted away from the parasitic etiology when Herbut and Kinsey 8 in 1946 produced / the syndrome in rabbits sensitized to horse serum by instilling horse serum intratracheally. Jahiel and Jahiel 9 in 1950 likewise succeeded in producing the syndrome in rab-bits by intrapulmonary sensitizing doses of autogenous antigen followed by intra-venous shocking doses. The specific allergen responsible in individual clinical cases is not often identi-fied. Engel 10 in 1935 identified the privet plant pollen as the responsible allergen in a group of cases in China. Ragweed <b>pollenosis</b> has been indicted, 11 ' 12 as have Prontosil, 13 sulfadiazine, 14 para-aminosalicylic acid 15 and penicillin. 16 ' 17 The following case report is considered of special interest in that a clinica...|$|E
