We hypothesized that to achieve {{significant improvement in}} outcomes both interventions had to be concurrent. DesignRetrospective case-control studySettingsMajor academic tertiary referral medical centerParticipants 274 consecutive patients who underwent open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass 2009 - 2013. InterventionsThe outcomes of 86 patients who received <b>pulmonary</b> perfusion and <b>ventilation</b> during cardiopulmonary bypass were retrospectively compared to the control group of 188 patients. Measurements and Main ResultsRespiratory complications rates were similar in both groups (33. 7 % vs. 33. 5 %), as were the rates of postoperative pneumonia (4. 7 % vs. 4. 3 %), pleural effusions (13. 9 % vs. 12. 2 %) and re-intubations (9. 3 % vs. 9. 1 %). Rates of adverse postoperative cardiac events including ventricular tachycardia (9. 3 % vs. 8. 5 %) and atrial fibrillation (33. 7 % vs. 28. 2 %) were equivalent in both groups. Incidence of sepsis (8. 1 % vs. 5. 3 %), postoperative stroke (2. 3 % vs. 2. 1 %), acute kidney injury (2. 3 % vs. 3. 7 %) and renal failure (5. 8 % vs. 3. 7 %) were likewise comparable. Despite similar transfusion requirements, coagulopathy (12. 8 % vs. 5. 3 %, p= 0. 031) {{and the need for}} mediastinal re-exploration (17. 4 % vs. 9. 6 %, p= 0. 0633) were observed more frequently in the <b>pulmonary</b> perfusion and <b>ventilation</b> group, but the difference did not reach the statistical significance.

50|$|Artificial ventilation, {{also called}} {{artificial}} respiration is any means of assisting or stimulating respiration, a metabolic process {{referring to the}} overall exchange of gases in the body by <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilation,</b> external respiration, and internal respiration. It may {{take the form of}} manually providing air for a person who is not breathing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on their own, or it may be mechanical ventilation involving the use of a mechanical ventilator to move air {{in and out of the}} lungs when an individual is unable to breathe on their own, for example during surgery with general anesthesia or when an individual is in a coma.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{changes in}} lung volumes also occur during pregnancy. Functional {{residual}} capacity drops 18-20%, typically falling from 1.7 to 1.35 litres, {{due to the}} compression of the diaphragm by the uterus. The compression also causes a decreased total lung capacity (TLC) by 5% and decreased expiratory reserve volume by 20%. Tidal volume increases by 30-40%, from 0.5 to 0.7 litres, and minute ventilation by 30-40% giving an increase in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilation.</b> This is necessary to meet the increased oxygen requirement of the body, which reaches 50 mL/min, 20 mL of which goes to reproductive tissues. Overall, the net change in maximum breathing capacity is zero.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large number}} of {{functional}} neuroimaging {{studies have demonstrated that}} motor imagery is associated with the specific activation of the neural circuits involved in the early stage of motor control (i.e., motor programming). This circuits includes the supplementary motor area, the primary motor cortex, the inferior parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. Such physiological data gives strong support about common neural mechanisms of imagery and motor preparation.Measurements of cardiac and respiratory activity during motor imagery and during actual motor performance revealed a covariation of heart rate and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilation</b> with the degree of imagined effort.Motor imagery activates motor pathways. Muscular activity often increases with respect to rest, during motor imagery. When this is the case, EMG activity is limited to those muscles that participate in the simulated action and tends to be proportional to the amount of imagined effort.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade of {{research}} on acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) there has been heightened interest in measuring physio-logic dead-space fraction (VD/VT).

50|$|PBPK models try to rely {{a priori}} on the {{anatomical}} and physiological {{structure of the}} body, and to a certain extent, on biochemistry. They are usually multi-compartment models, with compartments corresponding to predefined organs or tissues, with interconnections corresponding to blood or lymph flows (more rarely to diffusions). A system of differential equations for concentration or quantity of substance on each compartment can be written, and its parameters represent blood flows, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilation</b> rate, organ volumes etc., for which information is available in scientific publications. Indeed, the description they make {{of the body is}} simplified and a balance needs to be struck between complexity and simplicity. Besides the advantage of allowing the recruitment of a priori information about parameter values, these models also facilitate inter-species transpositions or extrapolation from one mode of administration to another (e.g., inhalation to oral). An example of a 7-compartment PBPK model, suitable to describe the fate of many solvents in the mammalian body, is given in the Figure on the right.|$|E
50|$|Levels of CO2 rise in {{the blood}} when the {{metabolic}} use of O2,and the production of CO2 is increased during, for example, exercise. The CO2 in the blood is transported largely as bicarbonate (HCO3−) ions, by conversion first to carbonic acid (H2CO3), by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and then by disassociation of this acid to H+ and HCO3−. Build-up of CO2 therefore causes an equivalent build-up of the disassociated hydrogen ions, which, by definition, decreases the pH of the blood. The pH sensors on the brain stem immediately sense to this fall in pH, causing the respiratory center to increase the rate and depth of breathing. The consequence is that the PCO2 does not change from rest going into exercise. During very short-term bouts of intense exercise the release of lactic acid into the blood by the exercising muscles causes a fall in the blood plasma pH, independently of the {{rise in the}} PCO2, and this will stimulate <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilation</b> sufficiently to keep the blood pH constant at the expense of a lowered PCO2.|$|E
50|$|The {{normal range}} for pH is 7.35-7.45. As the pH {{decreases}} (<7.35), it implies acidosis, while if the pH increases (>7.45) it implies alkalosis. In {{the context of}} arterial blood gases, the most common occurrence will be that of respiratory acidosis. Carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood as carbonic acid, a weak acid; however, in large concentrations, it can affect the pH drastically. Whenever there is poor <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilation,</b> the carbon dioxide levels in the blood are expected to rise. This leads to a rise of carbonic acid, leading to a decrease in pH. The first buffer of pH will be the plasma proteins, since these can accept some H+ ions to try to maintain homeostasis. As carbon dioxide concentrations continue to increase (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg), a condition known as respiratory acidosis occurs. The body tries to maintain homeostasis by increasing the respiratory rate, a condition known as tachypnea. This allows much more carbon dioxide to escape the body through the lungs, thus increasing the pH by having less carbonic acid. If a patient is in a critical setting and intubated, one must {{increase the number of}} breaths mechanically.|$|E
40|$|Through {{the recent}} {{developments}} of new MRI sequences, MRI became an alternative modality for functional <b>pulmonary</b> imaging. <b>Ventilation</b> and perfusion maps from such dynamic MR image series are of great diagnostic interest. The calculation of those maps requires a precise registration of the image series. However, the registration of dynamic MR image series of the lung is challenging, since the images are often blurred and affected by intensity changes and sliding organ motion. In this paper, we adapt a group-wise spectral image metric to apply it on dynamic 2 d+t MR image series of the lung. The proposed image metric is then embedded in a parametric group-wise registration framework. For the evaluation we compared our method against three pairwise and two group-wise image metrics. All metrics are tested on nine dynamic MR image series of the lung. The results show that our metric extension performs statistically better than the state-of-the-art methods...|$|R

40|$|Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a {{functional}} imaging method {{that is being}} developed for bedside use in critical care medicine. Aiming at improving the chest anatomical resolution of EIT images we developed a fuzzy model based on EIT high temporal resolution and the functional information contained in the <b>pulmonary</b> perfusion and <b>ventilation</b> signals. EIT data from an experimental animal model were collected during normal ventilation and apnea while an injection of hypertonic saline {{was used as a}} reference. The fuzzy model was elaborated in three parts: a modeling of the heart, a <b>pulmonary</b> map from <b>ventilation</b> images and, a pulmonary map from perfusion images.

EIT images treated by the fuzzy model were compared with the hypertonic saline injection method and CT-scan images, presenting good results in both qualitative (the image obtained by the model was very {{similar to that of the}} CT-scan) and quantitative (the ROC curve provided an area equal to 0. 93) point of view. Undoubtedly, these results represent an important step in the EIT images area, since they open the possibility of developing EIT-based bedside clinical methods, which are not available nowadays. These achievements could serve as the base to develop EIT diagnosis system for some life-threatening diseases commonly found in critical care medicine. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
