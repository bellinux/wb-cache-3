40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum correlation via measurement-induced-nonlocality (MIN) for Dirac particles in Garfinkle–Horowitz–Strominger (GHS) dilation space–time. It is {{shown that the}} <b>physical</b> accessible quantum <b>correlation</b> decreases as the dilation parameter increases monotonically. Unlike the case of scalar fields, the <b>physical</b> accessible <b>correlation</b> is not zero when the Hawking temperature is infinite owing to the Pauli exclusion principle and the differences between Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics. Meanwhile, the boundary of MIN related to Bell-violation is derived, which indicates that MIN is more general than quantum nonlocality captured by the violation of Bell-inequality. As a by-product, a tenable quantitative relation about MIN redistribution is obtained whatever the dilation parameter is. In addition, it is worth emphasizing that the underlying reason why the <b>physical</b> accessible <b>correlation</b> and mutual information decrease {{is that they are}} redistributed to the physical inaccessible regions...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{mathematical}} formulation of cosmological perturbations is studied. First {{we discuss the}} gauge problem of general relativity: perturbations of the metric and matter fields in an expanding universe are dependent on the choice of coordinate system, i. e. gauge dependent, even though the complete, unperturbed theory is covariant. Secondly, we discuss the frame problem of perturbations: the action for a universe with scalar field matter can be formulated in two different ways, in the Jordan or Einstein frame. These formulations are related by redefinitions of the metric and scalar field, and are therefore physically equivalent. However, perturbations in one frame and another are related by non-linear redefinitions, which makes it complicated to see how to formulate <b>physical</b> <b>correlation</b> functions. In this thesis we show {{that it is possible}} to express the action for perturbations in terms of gauge invariant and frame independent perturbations. These perturbations are then used to compute <b>physical</b> <b>correlation</b> functions which are independent of coordinate reparametrizations or field redefinitions. We first compute the second order action for linear perturbations. Later we outline a procedure to compute the action for non-linear perturbations, and apply this to find the gauge invariant action for second order perturbations. We furthermore show that there are different gauge invariant variables related by non-linear redefinitions, but that their actions are only related by boundary terms, such that the evolution of non-Gaussianity is unique. Moreover, as a final application we use the formulation of the action in terms of gauge invariant and frame independent variables in order to readdress the naturalness in Higgs inflation. In this formulation, Higgs inflation does not suffer from unitarity problems...|$|E

In this paper we define natural bases for the space of conformal blocks in the presence of irregular singularities, describe how to calculate their series expansions, and how such conformal blocks can be constructed by some delicate limiting procedure from ordinary conformal blocks. This leads us to a proposal for the structure functions appearing in the decomposition of <b>physical</b> <b>correlation</b> functions with irregular singularities into conformal blocks.
