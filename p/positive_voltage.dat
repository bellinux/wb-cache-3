Several point mutations found in affected families (1290 M, R 317 Q, P 480 L, and G 1552 R) dramatically shift gating to <b>positive</b> <b>voltages</b> in mutant/WT heterooligomeric channels, and, when measurable, even more so in mutant homooligomers. These channels can no longer contribute to the repolarization of action potentials, fully explaining why they cause dominant myotonia. Most replacements of the isoleucine at position 290 shift gating toward <b>positive</b> <b>voltages.</b> Mutant/WT heterooligomers can be partially activated by repetitive depolarizations, suggesting a role in shortening myotonic runs. Remarkably, a human mutation affecting an adjacent residue (E 291 K) is fully recessive.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (Blaustein, R. O., T. M. Koehler, R. J. Collier, and A. Finkelstein, 1989. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 86 : 2209 - 2213) we {{described}} the general channel-forming {{properties of the}} PA 65 fragment of anthrax toxin in planar phospholipid bilayer membranes. In the present paper we extend our previous studies of the permeability properties of this channel, using a series of symmetric tetraalkylammonium (TAA) ions. Our main finding is that at micromolar concentrations on either the cis (toxin-containing) or trans side of a membrane containing many (greater than 1, 000) channels, these ions, {{ranging in size from}} tetramethylammonium to tetrahexylammonium, induce a voltage-dependent reduction of membrane conductance. (We attribute a similar voltage-dependent reduction of membrane conductance by millimolar concentrations of HEPES to a cationic form of this buffer present at micromolar concentrations.) In going from large negative to large <b>positive</b> <b>voltages</b> (on the TAA side) one sees that the conductance first decreases from its value in the absence of TAA, reaches a minimum, and then rises back at larger <b>positive</b> <b>voltages</b> toward the level in the absence of TAA. Our interpretation of this behavior is that these symmetric TAA ions block the cation-selective PA 65 channel in a voltage-dependent manner. We postulate that there is a single site within the channel to which TAA ions can bind and thereby block the passage of the major current-carrying ion (potassium). A blocking ion is driven into the site by modest <b>positive</b> <b>voltages,</b> but is driven off the site and through the channel by larger <b>positive</b> <b>voltages,</b> thus explaining the relief of block. (In the accompanying paper [Blaustein, R. O., E. J. A. Lea, and A. Finkelstein. 1990. J. Gen. Physiol. 96 : 921 - 942] we confirm this interpretation of the data by analysis at the single-channel level.)

25|$|A Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor {{consists}} of two wire cages, one inside the other, {{often referred to as}} grids, that are placed inside a vacuum chamber. The outer cage has a <b>positive</b> <b>voltage</b> versus the inner cage. Typically, deuterium gas is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its ionization temperature, making positive ions. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly {{through the center of the}} device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, they feel a Coulomb force that directs them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes conduct mass and energy away from the plasma.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{symmetric}} tetraalkylammonium ions affect, in a voltage-dependent manner, the conductance of membranes containing many channels formed by the PA 65 fragment of anthrax toxin. In this paper we analyze this phenomenon at the single-channel level for tetrabutylammonium ion (Bu 4 N+). We find that Bu 4 N+ induces a flickery block of the PA 65 channel when present {{on either side of the}} membrane, and this block is relieved by large <b>positive</b> <b>voltages</b> on the blocking-ion side. At high frequencies (greater than 2 kHz) we have resolved individual blocking events and measured the dwell times in the blocked and unblocked states. These dwell times have single-exponential distributions, with time constants tau b and tau u that are voltage dependent, consistent with the two-barrier, single-well potential energy diagram that we postulated in our previous paper. The fraction of time the channel spends unblocked [tau u/(tau u + tau b) ] as a function of voltage is identical to the normalized conductance-voltage relation determined from macroscopic measurements of blocking, thus demonstrating that these single channels mirror the behavior seen with many (greater than 10, 000) channels in the membrane. In going from large negative to large <b>positive</b> <b>voltages</b> (- 100 to + 160 mV) on the cis (PA 65 -containing) side of the membrane, one sees the mean blocked time (tau b) increase to a maximum at + 60 mV and then steadily decline for voltages greater than + 60 mV, thereby clearly demonstrating that Bu 4 N+ is driven through the channel by <b>positive</b> <b>voltages</b> on the blocking-ion side. In other words, the channel is permeable to Bu 4 N+. An interesting finding that emerges from analysis of the voltage dependence of mean blocked and unblocked times is that the blocking rate, with Bu 4 N+ present on the cis side of the membrane, plateaus at large <b>positive</b> cis <b>voltages</b> to a voltage-independent value consistent with the rate of Bu 4 N+ entry into the blocking site being diffusion limited...|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of a low pH environment, the channel-forming T domain of diphtheria toxin undergoes a conformational change that allows for both its own insertion into planar lipid bilayers and the translocation of the toxin's catalytic domain across them. Given that the T domain contributes only three transmembrane segments, and the channel is permeable to ions as large as glucosamine+ and NAD−, {{it would appear that the}} channel must be a multimer. Yet, there is substantial circumstantial evidence that the channel may be formed from a single subunit. To test the hypothesis that the channel formed by the T domain of diphtheria toxin is monomeric, we made mixtures of two T domain constructs whose voltage-gating characteristics differ, and then observed the gating behavior of the mixture's single channels in planar lipid bilayers. One of these constructs contained an NH 2 -terminal hexahistidine (H 6) tag that blocks the channel at negative voltages; the other contained a COOH-terminal H 6 tag that blocks the channel at <b>positive</b> <b>voltages.</b> If the channel is constructed from multiple T domain subunits, one expects to see a population of single channels from this mixture that are blocked at both <b>positive</b> and negative <b>voltages.</b> The observed single channels were blocked at either negative or <b>positive</b> <b>voltages,</b> but never both.
