25|$|Concurrent to the Second Intifada, Israeli <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon {{proposed}} the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2003, which {{was approved by}} the Israeli government in June 2004, and the Knesset in February 2005. The unilateral withdrawal plan was executed in August 2005 and completed in September 2005. Nonetheless, the ICRC, the UN and various human rights organizations consider Israel still to be the de facto occupying power due to its control of Gaza's borders, air space and territorial waters.|$|E
25|$|The Disengagement Plan was a {{proposal}} by Israeli <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon, {{adopted by the}} government and enacted in August 2005, to remove a permanent Israeli presence from the Gaza Strip and from four Israeli settlements in the northern West Bank.

In fulfillment of Peretz's pledge to withdraw Labor from the Likud-led coalition government, the party withdrew its support for the government on 11 November and all Labor Party cabinet ministers resigned. This action deprived the government of its majority in the Knesset and resulted in <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon calling a new election for 28 March 2006.

Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of Ariel Sharon, who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu. In 2002, after the Israeli Labor Party left the coalition and vacated the position of foreign minister, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon appointed Netanyahu as Foreign Minister. Netanyahu challenged Sharon for the leadership of the Likud party, but failed to oust Sharon.|$|E

A year previously, he had commented that the fate of the most far-flung settlements in Gaza, Netzararem and Kfar Darom, was regarded in the same light as that of Tel Aviv. The formal announcements to evacuate seventeen Gaza settlements and another four in the West Bank in February 2004 represented the first reversal for the settler movement since 1968. It divided his party. It was strongly supported by Trade and Industry Minister Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni, the Minister for Immigration and Absorption, but Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned it. It was also uncertain whether this was simply the beginning of further evacuation.|$|E

Fuad Shubaki was suspected by Israel as being the mastermind behind the Karine A affair of 2002.

Bush and Israeli <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon, in April 2002. The agreement allowed the prisoners to be transferred from Yasser Arafat's Mukataa in Ramallah, where they were hiding during Operation Defensive Shield of April 2002. The four cell members who actively participated in Ze'evi's assassination were Hamdi Quran, who pulled the trigger, Basel al-Amar, Majdi Rimawi and Ahed Gholami. In a quick military trial in Ramallah, headed by Brigadier-General Ribhi Arafat, they were sentenced to hard labor. Quran was sentenced to 18 years, Asmar to 12, Rimawi to eight and Gholami to one year. Saadat was never placed on trial. The prison was situated next to the Palestinian Authority (PA) government building. Israeli rightists opposed the deal, saying it allowed the assassin to escape justice, while Palestinians opposed the jailing of one of a senior militant leader under Israeli pressure.|$|E
