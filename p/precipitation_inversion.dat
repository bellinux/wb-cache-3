The formic acid and pure water were employed as solvent and non-solvent, respectively. The influences of additives on structure and permeation {{properties of the}} membranes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique and separation expriments using milk as the feed. In general the addition of water and for-mamide in the casting solution slightly improves the flux without a pronounced effect on the retention of protein. This behaviour is due to instantaneous demixing (for water) and swelling mechanism (for formamide). When acetone {{was added to the}} casting solution, flux was lower and rejection was higher in comparison with the addition of water and for-mamide. This is due to the establishment of hydrogen bonding between acetone and polyamide. The addition of acetic acid results in lower flux and higher retention due to delay demixing...|$|R

Application areas range from chemical, biomedical to biotechnology industries. Asymmetric membranes are mostly fabricated by a process called phase inversion which can be achieved through four principal methods: immersion <b>precipitation</b> (wet phase <b>inversion),</b> vapor-induced phase separation, thermally induced phase separation and dry-casting. In these techniques, an initially homogeneous polymer solution becomes thermodynamically unstable and phase separates into polymerlean and polymer-rich phases.

The effect of copolymer composition and PEG chain length {{on the structure}} and property of the block copolymer membranes were investigated. Compared with PAN membranes, PAN-b-PEG copolymer membranes possessed excellent hydrophilic surface due to the enrichment of PEG segments, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements. SEM images showed these PAN-b-PEG copolymer membranes had a typical asymmetric structure similar with PAN membranes, but the thinner skin layer was helpful for the membrane resistance reduction. The PAN-b-PEG copolymer membranes exhibited better antifouling ability for BSA than PAN membranes. The BSA absorption amount on the copolymer membrane could reduce 45 % than that on the PAN membrane, and its irreversible fouling extent could lower 7 times. The hydrophilicity and antifouling ability of the copolymer membranes increased with increasing PEG content in the copolymer. While the chain length of PEG {{had little effect on}} the hydrophilicity and antifouling ability of the copolymer membrane. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} {{membranes}} used for organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) are integrally skinned asymmetric membranes formed via the immersion <b>precipitation</b> phase <b>inversion</b> process. These membranes are flexible, durable {{and easy to}} produce. However control of the porous properties of these membranes is not possible on a molecular level. Integrally skinned asymmetric membranes always exhibit signs of a pore size distribution, which leads to rejections not being optimum. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) were added to polymeric OSN membranes {{in an attempt to}} improve the control over porous properties and separation properties above those achievable using integrally skinned asymmetric polymer membranes. MOFs are crystalline materials with regular porous structures. MOFs have been used for gas separation purposes. This thesis describes the fabrication of hybrid polymer/MOF membranes for OSN applications. MMM fabrication is the tradition approach to create a hybrid polymer/MOF membrane, and contains discrete particles of MOF in a continuous polymer phase. The advantage of MMMs is that they are easy to produce; however, due to the discrete nature of the MOF in the membrane; the permeation of molecules through the membrane is not completely controlled by the MOF. MMMs were shown to have little difference in performance to polymer nanofiltration membranes for OSN. In order for the MOF to exhibit more control over the permeation properties of membranes, in-situ growth (ISG) membranes were developed, whereby MOF material is grown within the pre-existing pores of polymer membranes. Using the MOF HKUST- 1 and ultrafiltration polyimide supports ISG membranes were produced and were shown to outperform MMMs in terms of both solute retention and flux decline. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to reveal the distribution of HKUST- 1 throughout ISG membranes, which was found to be even across the surface and throughout the cross-section, showing that a continuous phase of MOF had been grown.

At the same time a series of blocking anticyclones dominated the upper-level flow over western Russia and breaking waves i. e. equatorward extrusions of stratospheric high potential vorticity (PV) air formed along the downstream flank of the blocks.

Above-normal sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean led to an elevated lower-tropospheric moisture content.

As trees do that fixation after the penetration of the gas though the smart pores of the leaves, stomata, we call our pores as artificial stomata.

40|$|Abstract—Accurate soil {{moisture}} information {{is required for}} studying the global water and energy cycles {{as well as the}} carbon cycle. The AMSR-E sensor onboard NASA’s Aqua satellite offers a new means to accurately retrieve {{soil moisture}} information at a regional and global scale. However, the characterization of the factors such as precipitation, vegetation, cloud, ground roughness, and ice-snow packs is sensitive to the retrieval of the soil moisture content from the remotely sensed data. This paper examines the models that are used to generate soil moisture products from US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and to adapt the models to improve the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval in Xinjiang, northwest China. The ground truth data collected by the WET and WatchDog instruments in Xinjiang were used to derive the empirical parameters for the regressive model that are suited to the conditions in Xinjiang. To improve the accuracy of inversion, the impact of precipitation’s lag-effect on the surface soil moisture has been addressed using the param-eters monthly bases, daily variation and the lag-effect impact of precipitation in the improved model. The improved model is then used to retrieve the soil moisture information from the AMSR-E data. A comparative study between the result from the proposed model and the NSIDC products of May to September 2009 were performed with the AMSR-E data. Validation with ground truth and the comparison indicate that the improved model performs better and produces more accurate soil moisture maps than the NSIDC products in the study area.

40|$|This {{work has}} as {{objective}} generality {{to study the}} local circulations {{in the region of}} the estuary of the Amazonas river, more specifically on the estuary of the Amapá. Amongst the systems of local winds, the sea breezes, lacustrine and land are typical systems of littoral regions, or next the great bodies of water. This type of circulation is induced basically for the difference of daily heating between the surface of the land and the water, being also influenced by the topography, for the bending of the coast, the latitude of the place, beyond the synoptics conditions and the climatologic circulation of large scale. The study area is located in the region north of Brazil, between the latitudes of 30 S and 20 N and between the longitudes of 530 W and 490 W, formed for the inferior stretch of the Amazonas and Tocantins-Pará rivers and {{on the part of the}} adjacent continental platform to the mouth of a river of these rivers. For this study the atmospheric model of mesoescala BRAMS (Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modelling System) in its version 3. 2 was used. Simulation was carried through 24 -hour, using the option of horizontally homogeneous initial, with the data of the soundings of the 12 UTC of carried through day 28 of July of 2005 in the airport of Macapá (82099). In the simulation three grids had been used, the first with space resolution of 20 km, second with space resolution of 10 km and one third with 2, 5 km of space resolution. The first grid is centered in 00 of latitude and 510 of longitude, and the others two grids are centered in 0. 20 S and 50. 70 W. The data of direction and intensity of the wind had not been used in the initial, assuming that this, being part of the circulation of large scale, could inhibit the local circulations in the study region. This allowed to identify clearly the formation of the sea-land breeze, that had beginning to the 18 UTC of day 28 of July, causing the cloudiness formation, and generating <b>precipitation.</b> The <b>inversion</b> of the direction (land-water) occurred to the 2 UTC of day 29 of July, being that, after this schedule the breeze circulation had its intensity diminished until the end of the simulation, to the 12 UTC of day 29 of July. During this period also the fluvial breeze was observed, related to the difference of temperature between the Amazonas river and the continent. This circulation had its together beginning to the sea breeze, but with lesser intensity, disappearing to the 20 UTC of day 28 of July.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to develop a}} robust statistical method for the classification of ocean precipitation based on physical properties to which the SSM/I is sensitive and to examine how these properties vary globally and seasonally. A two step approach is adopted for the classification of oceanic precipitation classes from multispectral SSM/I data: (1) we subjectively define precipitation classes using a priori information about the precipitating system and its possible distinct signature on SSM/I data such as scattering by ice particles aloft in the precipitating cloud, emission by liquid rain water below freezing level, the difference of polarization at 19 GHz—an indirect measure of optical depth, etc.; (2) we then develop an objective classification scheme which is found to reproduce the subjective classification with high accuracy. This hybrid strategy allows us to use {{the characteristics of the}} data to define and encode classes and helps retain the physical interpretation of classes. The classification methods based on k-nearest neighbor and neural network are developed to objectively classify six precipitation classes. It is found that the classification method based neural network yields high accuracy for all <b>precipitation</b> classes. An <b>inversion</b> method based on minimum variance approach was used to retrieve gross microphysical properties of these precipitation classes such as column integrated liquid water path, column integrated ice water path, and column integrated min water path. This classification method is then applied to 2 years (1991 – 92) of SSM/I data to examine and document the seasonal and global distribution of precipitation frequency corresponding to each of these objectively defined six classes. The characteristics of the distribution are found to be consistent with assumptions used in defining these six precipitation classes and also with well known climatological patterns of precipitation regions. The seasonal and global distribution of these six classes is also compared with the earlier results obtained from Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Sets (COADS). It is found that the gross pattern of the distributions obtained from SSM/I and COADS data match remarkably well with each other. ...|$|R
40|$|The Lake C 2 {{watershed}} at Taconite Inlet (82 ∘ 50 'N; 78 ∘ 00 'W) was {{the site}} of a three year project (1990 - 92), to investigate hydrological processes in the context of contemporary climate. The watershed is 21 km 2 in area, and 9 percent glacierized. This study was done in conjunction with a larger research effort, aiming to reconstruct paleoclimate using laminated lake sediments. ^ A continuous record of discharge, determined by stage-discharge relations, and short-interval sampling of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), permitted the production of hourly time series. In addition, two weather stations logged hourly temperature, humidity, wind and complete radiation data at 7 m and 520 m a. s. l. The upper station was located close to the median watershed elevation. ^ Mean daily air temperatures were rarely higher than 5 ∘C during the study periods, and the two weather stations revealed frequent temperature <b>inversions.</b> <b>Precipitation</b> events were small in magnitude (3 ̆c 13 mm d- 1), and primarily in the form of snowfall. Streamflow began June 9, 4 and 22 for the three years, respectively. Discharge followed a pronounced diurnal rhythm, especially during the brief nival flood. Maximum discharge was 4. 0 m 3 s- 1. SSC fluctuated in close correspondence with discharge, and the highest measured concentration was 555 mg L- 1. Each year, approximately 50 percent of the suspended sediment discharge (SSQ) occurred during only 10 percent of the field season. Daily SSQ was strongly associated with air temperature at the median watershed elevation (r = 0. 70, 0. 92; entire field seasons 1991, 1992). These results demonstrate that sediment transfer to Lake C 2 is a response to snowmelt. ^ Among meteorological variables measured at weather station Alert (ca. 225 km east), rawinsonde sounding temperatures at 600 m were most closely associated with daily SSQ into Lake C 2. Accordingly, an exponential equation, based on pooled 1990 and 1992 data, was used to predict daily watershed SSQ for the period of record (1951 - 89). The series of annual predicted sediment loads were found to be in excellent agreement with a normalized varve thickness series. This study indicates that laminated sediments in Lake C 2 contain a high-resolution record of regional summer temperature. ...|$|R
