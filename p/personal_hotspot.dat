Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows Phone 7, Android (starting from version 2.2), and iOS 3.0 (or later) offer tethering over a Bluetooth PAN or a USB connection. Tethering over Wi-Fi, also known as <b>Personal</b> <b>Hotspot,</b> is available on iOS starting with iOS 4.2.5 (or later) on iPhone 4, 4S (2010), 5, iPad (3rd generation), certain Windows Mobile 6.5 devices like the HTC HD2, Windows Phone 7, 8 and 8.1 devices (varies by manufacturer and model), and certain Android phones (varies widely depending on carrier, manufacturer, and software version).|$|E
40|$|A {{smartphone}} user's <b>personal</b> <b>hotspot</b> (pH) {{allows him}} to share cellular connection to another (e. g., a traveler) in the vicinity, but such sharing consumes the limited data quota in his two-part tariff plan and may lead to overage charge. This paper studies how to motivate such pH-enabled data-plan sharing between local users and travelers in the ever-growing roaming markets, and proposes pricing incentive for a data-plan buyer to reward surrounding pH sellers (if any). The pricing scheme practically {{takes into account the}} information uncertainty at the traveler side, including the random mobility and the sharing cost distribution of selfish local users who potentially share pHs. Though the pricing optimization problem is non-convex, we show that there always exists a unique optimal price to tradeoff between the successful sharing opportunity and the sharing price. We further generalize the optimal pricing to the case of heterogeneous selling pHs who have diverse data usage behaviors in the sharing cost distributions, and we show such diversity may or may not benefit the traveler. Lacking selfish pHs' information, the traveler's expected cost is higher than that under the complete information, but the gap diminishes as the pHs' spatial density increases. Finally, we analyze the challenging scenario that multiple travelers overlap for demanding data-plan sharing, by resorting to a near-optimal pricing scheme. We show that a traveler suffers as the travelers' spatial density increases. Comment: 8 figures and Submission for possible journal publicatio...|$|E
40|$|Performance of data {{forwarding}} in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) benefits considerably if one {{can make}} use of human mobility {{in terms of social}} structures. However, it is difficult and time-consuming to calculate the centrality and similarity of nodes by using solutions for traditional social networks, this is mainly because of the transient node contact and the intermittently connected environment. In this work, we are interested in the following question: Can we explore some other stable social attributes to quantify the centrality and similarity of nodes? Taking GPS traces of human walks from the real world, we find that there exist two known phenomena. One is public hotspot, the other is <b>personal</b> <b>hotspot.</b> Motivated by this observation, we present Hoten (hotspot and entropy), a novel routing metric to improve routing performance in DTNs. First, we use the relative entropy between the public hotspots and the personal hotspots to compute the centrality of nodes. Then we utilize the inverse symmetrized entropy of the personal hotspots between two nodes to compute the similarity between them. Third, we exploit the entropy of personal hotspots of a node to estimate its personality. Besides, we propose a method to ascertain the optimized size of hotspot. Finally, we compare our routing strategy with other state-of-the-art routing schemes through extensive trace-driven simulations, the results show that Hoten largely outperforms other solutions, especially in terms of combined overhead/packet delivery ratio and the average number of hops per message.

This practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether.” Despite the substantial fine, Marriott continues to deny that its conduct is illegal, saying it was using FCC approved equipment to protect its customers from hackers.|$|R

50|$|Prefix {{delegation}} {{is generally}} not supported on cellular networks, for example 3G or LTE. Most cellular networks route a fixed /64 prefix to the subscriber. <b>Personal</b> <b>hotspots</b> may still provide IPv6 access to hosts on the network by using a different technique called Proxy Neighbor Discovery. One {{of the reasons why}} cellular networks may not yet support prefix delegation is that the operators want to use prefixes they can aggregate to a single route. To solve this, RFC 6603 defines an optional mechanism and the related DHCPv6 option to allow exclusion of one specific prefix from a delegated prefix set.|$|R
