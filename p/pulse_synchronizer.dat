40|$|A laser Doppler {{velocimeter}} multiplexer interface {{includes an}} event <b>pulse</b> <b>synchronizer</b> which synchronizes data pulses from events A, B, and C. Clock control {{is connected to}} receive timing information on the data pulses from the synchronizer. Displays are connected to receive clock signals from the clock control for indicating a data rate {{for each of the}} measured events A, B, and C. The display is connected to receive clock signals from the clock control to indicate a coincidence rate between data pulses for any selected combination of the measured events A, B, and C. A multiplexer receives the data pulses from the events A, B, and C and rate data from the clock control. The multiplexer has output for supplying the data pulses and rate data to a single input of a data processing system. A multiplexer control is connected to supply control signals to the multiplexer for selecting the event data pulses and the rate data for output from the multiplexer. The multiplexer control receives start signals from the <b>pulse</b> <b>synchronizer</b> and user selected inputs for desired outputs from the multiplexer...|$|E
40|$|This paper shows {{experimentally}} that it {{is possible}} synchronize several uncoupled Lorenz identical circuits controlling only one parameter independently; registered asynchrony is competitive with that of a typical synchronization. Although there is a price to pay, since the chaotic dynamics decreases {{and in the case of}} encryption that must be compensated by the addition of another chaotic signal or some function as the convolution with the message itself. The frequency control <b>pulses</b> (<b>synchronizers)</b> for the parameter and its working cycle are selected experimentally to achieve minimal errors in the timing, and the procedure is experimentally verified using two applications of encryption and recovery of low frequency audio signals with random noise. Finally, more experimentation is needed on this atypical synchronization regarding the changes in pulse parametric control, electrical noise and instability of the components to apply it in chaotic encryption of voice and audio signals from multiple users...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the <b>synchronizer</b> based on <b>pulse</b> comparation, between variable and fixed <b>pulses.</b> This <b>synchronizer</b> has two variants, one operating by both transitions {{at the bit}} rate and other operating by positive transitions at half rate. Each variant has two versions namely the manual and the automatic. The objective is to study the four synchronizers and evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a sequential symbol synchronizer, {{that is based}} on a comparation between variable pulse against a reference fixed <b>pulse.</b> This <b>synchronizer</b> has two types, namely the both data transitions and the positive data transitions. Each type has two versions: the manual and the automatic. Then, we apply a prefilter, with three bandwidths B, namely (B 1 =âˆž, B 2 = 2. tx, B 3 = 1. tx) to see its effects. Where tx is the bit rate. The objective is to study the synchronizers with the prefilter and evaluate the jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus the SNR (Signal Noise Ratio) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{will study}} {{the effects of}} the analog and digital {{previous}} <b>pulse</b> on the <b>synchronizer</b> jitter. We consider two previous pulse (analog or digital) with filter followed of the synchronizer. The synchronizer is one of four carrier PLL (phase lock loop) namely the analog, the hybrid, the combinational and the sequential. The main objective is to observe for the various carrier PLL, their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Squared) versus input SNR (signal to noise ratio) ...|$|R
