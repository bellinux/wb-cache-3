50|$|For the {{instance}} of magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin film growth, HPCVD process uses diborane (B2H6) as the boron <b>precursor</b> <b>gas,</b> but unlike conventional CVD, which only uses gaseous sources, heated bulk magnesium pellets (99.95% pure) {{are used as}} the Mg source in the deposition process. Since the process involves chemical decomposition of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> and physical evaporation of metal bulk, it is named as hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition.|$|E
5000|$|Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor Deposition (HPCVD) - This process {{involves}} both chemical {{decomposition of}} <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> and vaporization {{of a solid}} source.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between HPCVD and other CVD systems {{is in the}} heating unit. For HPCVD, both substrate and solid metal source are heated up by the heating module. The conventional HPCVD system usually has only one heater. The substrate and solid metal source sit on the same susceptor and are heated up inductively or resistively at the same time. Above certain temperature, the bulk metal source melts and generates a high vapor pressure {{in the vicinity of}} the substrate. Then the <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> is introduced into the chamber and decomposes around the substrate at high temperature. The atoms from the decomposed <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> react with the metal vapor, forming thin films on the substrate. The deposition ends when the <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> is switched off. The main drawback of single heater setup is the metal source temperature and the substrate temperature cannot be controlled independently. Whenever the substrate temperature is changed, the metal vapor pressure changes as well, limiting the ranges of the growth parameters. In the two-heater HPCVD arrangement, the metal source and substrate are heated up by two separate heaters. Thus it can provide more flexible control of growth parameters.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a simple and {{effective}} method to synthesis SiNWs on SiO 2 films by Cu catalyst-driven SLS mechanism during annealing process without using any toxic <b>precursor</b> <b>gases.</b> This method has two advantages. Firstly, the metal contamination of the SiNWs was decreased. Secondly, no toxic <b>precursor</b> <b>gases</b> were used.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{modification}} by plasma polymerization is {{an efficient}} method {{to change the}} surface properties of a membrane. Desirable functionality such as hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity can be obtained, depending on plasma chemistry of <b>gas</b> <b>precursors</b> and discharge conditions. In this work, RF magnetron plasma is produced using acetylene and nitrogen as <b>precursor</b> <b>gases.</b> Variations of RF power, particle flux, deposited time and pressure of the <b>precursor</b> <b>gases</b> {{have been made to}} observe coating effects on the cellulose membranes. When appropriated conditions are used, a thin brownish film of hydrocarbon was formed on the membrane, and the water contact angle increased from 35 to 130 degrees...|$|R
50|$|<b>Precursor</b> <b>gases</b> such as {{sulfur dioxide}} and {{hydrogen}} sulfide have been considered. Use of gaseous sulfuric acid appears {{to reduce the}} problem of aerosol growth. Materials such as photophoretic particles, titanium dioxide, and diamond are also under consideration.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the growth}} process of {{magnesium}} diboride thin films by HPCVD, the carrier gas is purified hydrogen gas H2 at a pressure of about 100 Torr. This H2 environment prevents oxidation during the deposition. Bulk pure Mg pieces are placed {{next to the}} substrate {{on the top of}} the susceptor. When the susceptor is heated to about 650°C, pure Mg pieces are also heated, which generates a high Mg vapor pressure in the vicinity of the substrate. Diborane (B2H6) is used as the boron source. MgB2 films starts to grow when the boron <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> B2H6 is introduced into the reactor chamber. The growth rate of the MgB2 film is controlled by the flow rate of B2H6/H2 mixture. The film growth stops when the boron <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> is switched off.|$|E
50|$|In the {{presence}} of the <b>precursor</b> <b>gas,</b> the electron beam is scanned over the substrate, resulting in deposition of material. The scanning is usually computer-controlled. The deposition rate depends on a variety of processing parameters, such as the partial precursor pressure, substrate temperature, electron beam parameters, applied current density, etc. It usually is in the order of 10 nm/s.|$|E
50|$|Dip coating {{is similar}} to spin coating in that a liquid {{precursor}} or sol-gel precursor is deposited on a substrate, {{but in this case}} the substrate is completely submerged in the solution and then withdrawn under controlled conditions. By controlling the withdrawal speed, the evaporation conditions (principally the humidity, temperature) and the volatility/viscosity of the solvent, the film thickness, homogeneity and nanoscopic morphology are controlled. There are two evaporation regimes: the capillary zone at very low withdrawal speeds, and the draining zone at faster evaporation speeds. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) generally uses a gas-phase precursor, often a halide or hydride of the element to be deposited. In the case of MOCVD, an organometallic gas is used. Commercial techniques often use very low pressures of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
50|$|High-altitude {{balloons}} {{can be used}} to lift <b>precursor</b> <b>gases,</b> in tanks, bladders or in the balloons' envelope. Balloons {{can also}} be used to lift pipes and hoses, but no moored balloon has ever been deployed to the necessary altitude.|$|R
25|$|Focused ion beams can {{directly}} remove material, or even deposit material when suitable <b>precursor</b> <b>gasses</b> {{are applied}} {{at the same}} time.

The films, thus, deposited have been characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS). Microstructural information has been obtained from SEM studies. Microhardness has been seen to decrease {{with the increase in}} carbon content and the highest microhardness observed in these films {{has been found to be}} similar to 5. 3 GPa...|$|R
5000|$|Aerosol delivery: There are two {{proposals}} {{for how to}} create a stratospheric sulfate aerosol cloud, either through release of a <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> (...) or the direct release of sulfuric acid (...) and these face different challenges. If [...] gas is released it will oxidise to form [...] and then condense to form droplets far from the injection site. Releasing [...] would not allow control over the size of the particles that are formed but would not require a sophisticated release mechanism. Simulations suggest that as the [...] release rate is increased there would be diminishing returns on the cooling effect, as larger particles would be formed which have a shorter lifetime and are less effective scatterers of light. If [...] is released directly then the aerosol particles would form very quickly and in principle the particle size could be controlled although the engineering requirements for this are uncertain. As direct [...] release would allow control over the particle size it could be possible to avoid some of the inefficiencies associated with [...] release.|$|E
50|$|FIB {{tools are}} {{designed}} to etch or machine surfaces, an ideal FIB might machine away one atom layer without any disruption of the atoms in the next layer, or any residual disruptions above the surface. Yet currently because of the sputter the machining typically roughens surfaces at the sub-micrometer length scales. A FIB {{can also be used}} to deposit material via ion beam induced deposition. FIB-assisted chemical vapor deposition occurs when a gas, such as tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)6) is introduced to the vacuum chamber and allowed to chemisorb onto the sample. By scanning an area with the beam, the <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> will be decomposed into volatile and non-volatile components; the non-volatile component, such as tungsten, remains on the surface as a deposition. This is useful, as the deposited metal can be used as a sacrificial layer, to protect the underlying sample from the destructive sputtering of the beam. From nanometers to hundred of micrometers in length, tungsten metal deposition allows metal lines to be put right where needed. Other materials such as platinum, cobalt, carbon, gold, etc., can also be locally deposited. Gas assisted deposition and FIB etching process are shown below.|$|E
40|$|The {{localized}} Cu deposition on Si by 30 keV Ga+ focused {{ion beam}} (FIB) using <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> has been investigated by a 300 keV Be 2 + nuclear microprobe with a beam spot diameter of 80 nm. The Cu deposition and impurity incorporation were compared at different temperatures of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas.</b> The distribution of deposited Cu, Ga from the ion beam itself and low-Z elements from the <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> was obtained at and nearby the deposited areas by RBS mapping images. An RBS mapping image of Cu atoms for FIB induced deposition indicated the uniform Cu films {{in the case of}} lower temperature (25 degrees C and 37 degrees C) of precursor. On the contrary in the case of higher temperature (43 degrees C and 50 degrees C) of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas,</b> the RBS mapping image of Cu atoms shows irregular distribution and incorporated impurities. The micro-RBS spectra indicated the deposition behavior that the thickness of Cu layers increased with the decrease in temperature of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> due to the enhancement in the adsorption of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> on the target surface...|$|E

40|$|Air pollutants, such as ozone, have adverse {{impacts on}} human health and cause, for example, {{respiratory}} and cardiovascular problems. In the United Kingdom (UK), peak surface ozone concentrations typically occur {{in the spring and}} summer and are controlled by emission of <b>precursor</b> <b>gases,</b> tropospheric chemistry and local meteorology which can be influenced by large-scale synoptic weather regimes. In this study we composite surface and satellite observations of summer-time (April to September) ozone under different UK atmospheric circulation patterns, as defined by the Lamb weather types. Anticyclonic conditions and easterly flows are shown to significantly enhance ozone concentrations over the UK relative to summer-time average values. Anticyclonic stability and light winds aid the trapping of ozone and its <b>precursor</b> <b>gases</b> near the surface. Easterly flows (NE, E, SE) transport ozone and <b>precursor</b> <b>gases</b> from polluted regions in continental Europe (e. g. the Benelux region) to the UK. Cyclonic conditions and westerly flows, associated with unstable weather, transport ozone from the UK mainland, replacing it with clean maritime (North Atlantic) air masses. Increased cloud cover also likely decrease ozone production rates. We show that the UK Met Office regional air quality model successfully reproduces UK summer-time ozone concentrations and ozone enhancements under anticyclonic and south-easterly conditions for the summer of 2006. By using established ozone exposure-health burden metrics, anticyclonic and easterly condition enhanced surface ozone concentrations pose the greatest public health risk...|$|R

40|$|Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of {{graphene}} on copper {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient technologies for producing high quality graphene for large areas. Nevertheless, still high pressures and big quantities of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> are currently required. The objective of this work is to deposit graphene using the monolayer-formation-time concept (t) from the kinetic theory of gases, which leads to an economization of the <b>precursor</b> <b>gas,</b> a minimization of the process pressure and the time needed to grow a graphene monolayer. Our process has been designed taking into account the dependence of t on the pressure, the mass particle of the gas, the sticking coefficient, and the growth temperature.

The distribution of deposited Pt, Ga from the ion beam itself, and C from the <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> was obtained at and nearby the deposited areas by micro-RBS spectra and RBS mapping. All of the beam processed areas showed a uniform Pt distribution at the deposited areas. The amount of Pt atoms increased {{with the increase in}} ion or electron dose due to the decomposition of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas.</b> The thickness or Pt layer by EB is considerably less than that by FIB due to the reduced deposition rate.

The reactor apparatus (10) includes an elongated reactor body (32) having graphite or carbon walls which are heated to a temperature exceeding the melting temperature of silicon. The <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> enters the reactor body (32) through an efficiently cooled inlet tube assembly (22) and a relatively thin carbon or graphite septum (44).

Besides, only few researchers have investigated on the growth of CNTs by CVD process. No systematic study has been reported so far to quantitatively assess the effect of CVD parameters on mean diameter of MWCNTs.

30|$|Song et al. [21], {{studied the}} Raman {{spectroscopy}} on the SWNTs’ rings, where the spectra split into several peaks. The Raman spectra obtained {{in this investigation}} are also split into more peaks (Fig.  4). The FTIR image (Fig.  6) shows a functional group attached with rings and peaks are shifted to higher wavenumbers due to the decrease in bond length. Since the curvature reduces the bond length of the tube which results in a higher shift in peak wavenumbers. Figure  2 e shows the FESEM image of nanotubes synthesized at a flow rate of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> 140  ml/min, and it has abundant of the straight nanotube {{and there is no}} evidence of curved nanotubes. This effect clearly clarifies that extrusion of carbon atoms on catalyst particle variation is not influenced as much as compared to 180  ml/min <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate, which results in straight nanotubes. Hence, as anticipated by Song et al. [13], the flow rate of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> has a significant effect on the curvature of CNTs.|$|E
30|$|The {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with controlled diameter distribution {{are useful}} in the fabrication of composite materials as reinforcement, due to their superior strength and toughness. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a viable process to synthesize MWCNTs.

The MWCNTs of controlled diameter distribution was selectively grown on NiO catalyst supported by Al 2 O 3 nano particles. The argon and acetylene were used as carrier and carbon <b>precursor</b> <b>gas,</b> respectively. The catalyst and carbon samples were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis. From this investigation, it is understood that the increase in reaction temperature and flow rate of <b>precursor</b> <b>gas</b> increased the mean diameter of MWCNTs but increase in process time decreased the diameter. The diameter distribution and quality of MWCNTs are strongly influenced by the diameter of the catalyst particles.|$|E
