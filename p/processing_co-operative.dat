50|$|The {{origin of}} HOPCOMS was in 1959 when Mari Gowda, the then {{director}} {{of the department of}} horticulture, founded the Bangalore Grape Growers’ Marketing and <b>Processing</b> <b>Co-operative</b> Society for promoting grape farming by providing farming know how to the grape farmers and arranging a marketing set up for their products. The society had its operations in Bangalore, Kolar, Mysore, Tumkur, Mandya and Mangalore districts. A few years later, the society started dealing in other farm produces and re-branded itself as the Horticultural Producers’ Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society in 1965, registering itself as a cooperative society.

The {{organisation}} working on principles of co-operative was found to mitigate the sufferings of arecanut and cocoa growers in Indian states of Karnataka and Kerala. CAMPCO has now extended its services to other states of India like Gujarat,Maharashtra,Utter Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh,New Delhi,Bihar,Tamilnadu,Odisha,Assam and Goa also. The CAMPCO has now become multi state co-operative under relevant Indian laws. The organisation is mainly into procurement, marketing, selling and processing of arecanut and cocoa.The company has now entered in Rubber and Black pepper market. The company also provides guidance for farmers for growing arecanut and cocoa.|$|E

40|$|The Irish dairy {{processing}} industry {{has undergone a}} profound process of spatial reorganisation since the original introduction of the creamery system {{in the late nineteenth}} century. This process is described in the form of six distinct but interwoven episodes: the elimination of the privately-owned creameries, the amalgamation of dairy co-operatives into larger units, internal rationalisation of processing within these units (including the closure of branch creameries), concentration of on-farm milk production and, most recently, internationalisation accompanied by the movement towards privatisation of the largest dairy <b>processing</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> Among the outcomes of these combined processes have been the widespread elimination of dairy farmers from the industry and the reduction of those remaining to the essential status of contract suppliers to large agribusiness enterprises whose primary orientation is now increasingly focused on private shareholders and overseas operations...|$|R
30|$|Other {{than the}} large players, {{there is a}} host of smaller <b>processing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> based {{in a number of}} {{different}} dairy basins supplying only their immediate geographical markets. This part of the processing sector is very complex and highly fragmented, as it gathers some 30 co-operatives representing less than 15 % of the milk volumes processed. Some of these small <b>co-operatives</b> were dairy <b>processing</b> pioneers in Morocco (“Le Bon Lait” in the Marrakech region, “Colait Extralait” in the Gharb, etc.) but they are currently struggling to survive as they face severe financial and technical problems such as increases in milk prices and other strategic inputs’ costs (such as imported milk powder, butter, energy, etc.). They produce only a narrow range of dairy products that is not usually stocked by supermarkets and they only have little know-how when it comes to milk processing. Some of them, in an attempt of resilience, like “Le Bon Lait” are currently establishing a joint venture with the French leading dairy co-operative group “Sodiaal” to market the brands Candia and Yoplait in the Moroccan market.|$|R

The establishment of HOPCOMS has an interesting background. First, the Bangalore Grape Growers ’ Marketing and <b>Processing</b> <b>Co-operative</b> Society was established in 1959, under the guidance of Dr. M. H. Mari Gowda, the then Director of the Department of Horticulture. The main objective of the society was to encourage grapevine cultivation by providing necessary inputs, technical know-how and marketing facilities to grape farmers. It had jurisdiction over Bangalore, Kolar, Mysore, Tumkur, Mandya and Mangalore districts. Since grape was a seasonal fruit, the society started handling all fruits and vegetables from 1965. Due to this change in operations, the name of the society was changed into Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society Ltd.

50|$|According to CSO 2016 census statistics, Killeshandra town {{population}} {{stands at}} 388 persons, {{an increase of}} 6.6% from the 2011 census which showed an 11% drop in population from the 2006 census. Compare population levels in 1911, when the town population was 566 persons (46% higher than present levels). However, in the electoral division, which includes the town and surrounding district, {{a slight increase in}} population up to 1,143 persons was recorded in 2011, denoting a marked preference for living outside the urban area. In previous centuries, when there were several thousand people living near Killeshandra, local industry and agriculture sustained the local population. Although the Killeshandra area is today regarded as an ideal place for retirement and leisure activity, what are the underlying causes for population decline compared {{with the rest of the}} county showing an overall increase in urban and rural population? Throughout the twentieth century, Killeshandra looked to its agriculture base to keep the wheels turning, while Killeshandra Creamery became one of Ireland's leading dairy and milk <b>processing</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> This too has seen significant rationalisation in recent years. At one time Killeshandra was the hub of industry in the region, with several flax and corn mills in addition to Fletcher's sawmill, which was built on the site of an earlier brewery. From the 1860s the town was serviced by a railway line to Crosdoney and Cavan. However the closure of the railway to goods and passengers in 1960 was the first significant result of population decline throughout the region. The eventual closure of Fletcher's sawmill and the demise of street market trading would also signal the end for Killeshandra's iconic linen market house, built around 1790 by then-landlord Robert H. Southwell. The market house fell into disrepair and was finally demolished in the late 1960s. Since this time, urban dilapidation and poor access roads are another notable factor affecting Killeshandra's potential for growth.|$|R
40|$|In many European countries, {{farmers are}} {{a member of}} a <b>processing</b> or {{marketing}} <b>co-operative,</b> and most of these farmers also deliver their products to that co-operative. However, an extensive dataset of Italian farmers shows that not all members deliver to their co-op, and that there are also non-members that deliver. Using theoretical arguments from the New Institutional Economics literature, a bivariate probit model is estimated to explain co-op membership and delivery jointly. Results show that membership and delivering are indeed related, but also that different factors influence farmers’ decisions on membership and deliver...|$|R

40|$|Regulating the {{transformation}} of co-operative societies into other social forms poses the problems of assessing the amount of funds {{that will not be}} part of the resources of the resulting society because they are allocated to be put to the use stipulated in the society by-laws or the legislation. The amount of allocated funds is regulated by the Co-operative Society Law 27 / 1999 and, with varying degrees of success, by different autonomous regional laws, as is the case of the Andalusian Co-operative Society Law (CAL).

40|$|In this work, {{programmable}} analog techniques using floating-gate transistors {{have been}} developed to design precision analog circuits, low-power signal processing primitives and adaptive systems that learn on-chip. Traditional analog implementations lack programmability with the result that issues such as mismatch are corrected at the expense of area. Techniques have been proposed that use floating-gate transistors {{as an integral part of}} the circuit of interest to provide both programmability and the ability to correct for mismatch. Traditionally, signal processing has been performed in the digital domain with analog circuits handling the interface with the outside world. Such a partitioning of responsibilities is inefficient as signal processing involves repeated multiplication and addition operations that are both very power efficient in the analog domain. Using programmable analog techniques, fundamental signal processing primitives such as multipliers {{have been developed}} in a low-power fashion while preserving accuracy. This results in a paradigm shift in signal <b>processing.</b> A <b>co-operative</b> analog/digital signal <b>processing</b> framework is now possible such that the partitioning of tasks between the analog and digital domains is performed in a power efficient manner. Complex signal processing tasks such as adaptive filtering that learn the weight coefficients are implemented by exploiting the non-linearities inherent with floating-gate programming. The resulting floating-gate synapses are compact, low-power and offer the benefits of non-volatile weight storage. In summary, this research involves developing techniques for improving analog circuit performance and in developing power-efficient techniques for signal processing and on-chip learning. Ph. D.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{key factors}} influencing membership of co-operative organisations in Mexico's coffee sector. We also determine {{the impact of}} membership on the incomes that are derived from coffee cultivation. Factors at all levels {{are found to be}} relevant: individual factors, family characteristics, farm type and regional factors. Data come from a survey of 1, 396 coffee farmers held in 2004 in eight major producer states in Mexico and complemented with information from the National Coffee Census. We apply regression models that control for selection bias and endogeneity to identify driving forces as well as the economic effects of co-operative membership. Co-operatives are typically joined by older male farmers, on medium sized farms, who have access to electricity and are located at higher altitudes and in larger municipalities. Private land ownership reduces the probability of co-operative membership. There is consistent evidence that participating in co-operatives has a positive effect on the individual coffee prices and per capita coffee income. This effect is mostly due to the additional coffee <b>processing</b> offered by <b>co-operatives...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Kantoher creamery was a {{major source}} of income for the parish. It was {{established}} in 1904 as a local <b>Co-operative</b> <b>processing</b> milk, and finding markets for by products such as cream, cheese, butter and later casein. The cooperative continued to diversify, opening up opportunities for its suppliers by setting up processing facilities for pigs, turkeys, ducks and later poultry. In 1991, Kantoher Creamery was taken over by locally based multinational Kerry Group. Kerry grew the business further but by 2005 decided to cease operations at the poultry plant, its final processing facility there, with the loss of over 300 jobs directly and a further 500 indirectly. Kerry Group continued to process the majority of the milk produced locally in Listowel.

5000|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Murgon butter factory, operations progressively expanded, reflecting the suitability and productivity of the South Burnett district for dairying. This growth is illustrated by {{the increase in the number}} of suppliers from 250 in 1913 to 800 by 1929, and in butter production from 252 tons in its first year at Murgon, to 1644 tons in 1928. By 1929, the Wide Bay district, in which the South Burnett was included, was second only to the Moreton district in Queensland milk production.The growth of the South Burnett <b>Co-operative's</b> <b>processing</b> activities necessitated the expansion of the factory in 1929. In order to increase production capacity, the South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Company commenced the construction of a new unit of 35 tons capacity to work in conjunction with the existing unit, and a power plant capable of running both components together or independently. The objective behind the dual factory system was to apply the churning capacity of both factories to the manufacture of butter before noon, with the remainder of the day geared towards the handling and treatment of cream deliveries from suppliers. The Murgon butter factory increased the overall production capacity to 64 tons of butter a week, or 128 tons using double shifts. The dual factory system, driven by a common power plant, was claimed at the time to be [...] "unique in the history of butter production in the Commonwealth".Brisbane architect George Hutton, supervised building plans and construction and Mr H. Taylor (also of Brisbane) was the builder. The cost of the remodelling was reported as exceeding £25,000. The largest of the new buildings, built to receive, process and churn cream, was constructed of reinforced concrete with a tubular truss roof, crowned by a lantern roof. The engine/plant room was built to the rear of the larger structure. The new buildings were officially opened on 9 March 1929 by William Forgan Smith, Minister for Agriculture and Stock, with over 1000 invited guests and the township [...] "en-fete" [...] for the occasion.The building of the new Murgon factory occurred during a period of modernisation for butter manufacturers. By the end of the 1920s most Queensland butter factories had been remodelled or were new buildings of brick and concrete, replacing earlier timber structures. The emphasis on producing high grade butter saw the need for more churns within factories, as the lower temperatures necessary meant churns were turning longer than previously. In addition to upgrading buildings and equipment, greater attention was paid to ensuring butter was of a high standard, through stricter grading and modern processes of pasteurisation and neutralisation. Increasing numbers of trained staff were also working in factories.|$|R
