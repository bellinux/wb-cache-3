40|$|PURPOSE: Growing {{numbers of}} studies have {{reported}} <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> after cancer, with inconsistent findings as to which variables {{have been associated with}} <b>positive</b> <b>growth.</b> Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the temporal relationship between <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> and benefit finding, and contextual and intrapersonal factors including age, gender, distress, resilience, hardiness, optimism, and coping. METHOD: Eighty-one individuals, predominantly with diagnoses of breast (n ¼ 45), and bowel cancer (n ¼ 20), were recruited within 18 months post-diagnosis and treatment. The participants completed measures at baseline (T 1) and three months later (T 2); demographic information, the Impact Event Scale Revised, Benefit Finding (BF), Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Brief Cope, Profile of Mood States, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Life Orientation Test, Hardiness Scale and the Resilience Scale. RESULTS: Baseline (T 1) : Significant correlations were found between benefit finding and cancer specific distress (r ¼ : 28; p 5. 001), active-hardiness (r ¼ : 31; p 5. 001), adaptive coping (r ¼ : 35; p 5. 001) and quality of life (r ¼ : 22; p 5. 05). Significant correlations were also found between <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> and cancer specific distress (r ¼ : 30; p 5. 001), active-hardiness (r ¼ : 20; p 5. 001), adaptive coping (r ¼ : 40; p 5. 001) and quality of life (r ¼ : 20; p 5. 05). There was a significant relationship between <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> and benefit finding with age (r ¼ _: 20; p 5. 05). Resiliency, gender and type of cancer were not related to either <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> or benefit finding. Linear regression analysis showed that adaptive coping (p 5. 05) and active-hardiness (p 5. 05) significantly predicted benefit finding (R 2 ¼ : 15). Adaptive coping (p 5. 01) was the only significant predictor that emerged for <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> (R 2 ¼ : 22). Three month follow-up (T 2) : There was no significant difference in participants’ <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> scores, benefit finding and coping between T 1 and T 2. There was however a significant change in active-hardiness scores (p 5. 001), decreasing over time. Regression analysis indicated that younger age at diagnosis (p 5. 05) was the only significant predictor of <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> at T 2 (R 2 ¼ : 19). No intra-personal variables including coping and active-hardiness at T 1 were predictive of <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> or benefit finding at T 2. CONCLUSION: The findings revealed that <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> and benefit finding are related yet distinct concepts. Active-hardiness, coping and younger age were associated with either or both <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> and benefit finding following cancer diagnosis, however resiliency was not related to either growth and benefit finding. Moreover, the level of growth and benefit finding remained constant over a 3 -month interval, although active-hardiness declined overtime. RESEARCH AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that enhancing the coping mechanisms of patients, with less ‘hardy’ dispositions may further facilitate their adjustment postcancer. In addition, further research is required to delineate the differences between <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> and benefit finding, as these terms have been used interchangeably within the literature. This may partly explain the inconsistent findings in the predictors of <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> and benefit finding following cancer.

Chapter one is a critical {{review of the literature}} relating to <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> in parents of children who have a developmental disability. Past studies have indicated that having a child with a developmental disability can be both stressful for parents and place increased pressures on their time, energy and resources. However, this review of more recent research about the experience of having a child with a developmental disability highlights the range of <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> experiences parents undergo and some of the possible processes involved. <b>Positive</b> <b>growth</b> experiences reported included changes in parental perceptions of their growth, changes in belief systems, increased sense of coherence and increased hope. Resilience, reframing coping strategies, meaning-making and social support were all implicated in this <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> process. Clinically, the value of strengths-based services for families emerged. Chapter two is an empirical study, focusing on the maternal experience of a family based Lego Therapy intervention amongst five families who have a child who is on the autism spectrum. Qualitative analysis of interview data resulted in themes of family specific factors (communication, new perspectives, deeper relationships), child-specific factors (impact of the child's ASD, child-specific developments) and intervention-specific factors (ambivalence about the intervention, time). Methodological· and clinical implications are discussed, alongside recommendations for future research.

Our estimates of per capita GDP suggest that the pattern of long run growth of the English economy can be interpreted with a periodization in three historical stages. The first stage, covering the period 1250 - 1580, is a Malthusian phase with no <b>positive</b> <b>growth.</b> The second stage, comprising the period 1580 - 1780, is an intermediate phase where the English economy is able to relax some of the Malthusian constraints, attaining a <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> rate (although our estimate of the growth rate for this period is lower than that proposed by Maddison and more recently by Broadberry, Campbell, Klein, Overton and van Leeuwen).

40|$|M. Comm. The {{subject of}} the growth effects of {{remittances}} is characterised by different and conflicting perspectives. While migration optimists believe in <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> effects of remittances, migration pessimists, on the other hand, challenge this position and claim that remittances have either a negative or statistically insignificant effect on economic growth. Those for remittances argue that remittances {{have a positive effect}} on economic growth mainly through subsequent increases in investment capital and human capital. Migration pessimists, however, stress that remittances negatively impact economic growth, mainly, because of inflationary pressures and moral hazards that result in reduced labour supply. Given such contrasting literature, this study makes an attempt to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the growth-effects of remittances in twenty-nine Sub-Saharan Africa countries over the period 1980 - 2008. The Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond GMM one-step estimator is used in the assessment. Empirical results from the study reveal evidence supporting for statistically significant <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> effects of remittances in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study further reveals that these <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> effects of remittances in Sub-Saharan Africa happen through the human capital channel. Even when heterogeneity of sub-regions is taken into account, there is still evidence showing <b>positive</b> <b>growth</b> effects of remittances in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results, however, reveal that in West Africa, remittances have a low positive effect on economic growth...|$|R
