50|$|The Law of <b>Political</b> <b>Responsibilities</b> {{was only}} {{nominally}} repealed in February 1945. A Comisión Liquidadora de Responsabilidades Políticas (Commission for the Discharge of <b>Political</b> <b>Responsibilities)</b> remained in operation until 1966 when {{the law was}} effectively abolished. Between 1939 and 1945, 500,000 persons out a population of 23,000,000 (2% {{of the population of}} Spain) were subject to <b>Political</b> <b>Responsibilities</b> proceedings.|$|R

50|$|Municipalities {{are also}} divided into {{a total of}} 2,512 parishes (församlingar).

25|$|<b>Political</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{for sport}} is a devolved matter. As England has no {{parliament}} of her own, the United Kingdom Department of Culture, Media and Sport which {{is headed by}} a cabinet minister -though the Minister for Sport and Tourism {{is not in the}} cabinet- deals with English sport in addition to United Kingdom-wide sports.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difference}} with similar offices {{is that the}} overall <b>political</b> <b>responsibility</b> for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: coordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, {{in violation of the}} law.|$|E
25|$|<b>Political</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{for sport}} in India {{is with the}} Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, which is headed by a cabinet {{minister}} and managed by National Sport Federations.

50|$|He {{returned}} to Moldavia in 1653, {{and became a}} trainee of the country's treasury. Valued by the administration, he rose quickly, becoming Vornic in 1669 (i.e.: overseer of the Court, with several <b>political</b> <b>responsibilities</b> both inside the state and abroad).|$|R
25|$|As the Northern Ireland Assembly {{was reduced}} {{in size and}} a number of {{departments}} removed it is not currently (March 2017) clear who holds <b>political</b> <b>responsibility</b> for Sport in Northern Ireland. However virtually every team sport is organised on either an all Ireland or United Kingdom-wide basis, with football and netball being the only exceptions. As such responsibility for most sports lies with either the United Kingdom minister or the Irish minister for Transport, Tourism & Sport.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, as {{democracy}} {{spread across}} much of Latin America, the realm of government more inclusive (a trend that proved conductive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying <b>political</b> <b>responsibility</b> to provide social welfare rights, and though development projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased. Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|Cokayne now {{began to}} acquire a degree of {{influence}} and recognition in Deryshire society. In March 1392 he received a commission of array. In February 1393 he received a commission of arrest to pursue a fugitive in a case brought to attention by his uncle John. Rituals of social solidarity and <b>political</b> <b>responsibility</b> did not make Cokayne markedly less inclined to consort with criminals. In May John Cokayn, probably the uncle, obtained a pardon for a man involved in a rampage of housebreaking and murder at Ashbourne. Although there is no suggestion in the text that Sir John himself was present on this occasion, the list of those involved overlaps substantially with that of his cronies who had terrorised the area in 1388, including Edmund Harthill, presumably a cousin. Moreover, when Sir John was returned to Parliament {{for the first time}} in 1395, he had another indictment for felony hanging over him. While he was at Westminster he had the case transferred to Derbyshire by a writ of nisi prius, which covered also Thomas Lache and William Walsh, both of Normanton, presumably his accomplices. The other knight of the shire in 1395 was Peter Melbourne or Fauconer, a one-time MP who was a close and devoted adherent of Gaunt. It was rare for the Derbyshire gentry to send two inexperienced men to Parliament: generally at least one would have served before.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 the Law of <b>Political</b> <b>Responsibilities</b> outlawed the CNT and expropriated its assets. At {{that time}} the {{organization}} had a million members and a large infrastructure.

25|$|The {{following}} cabinet formation {{resulted in}} a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal, Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) which formed the First Balkenende cabinet with Balkenende becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office on 22 July 2002. The cabinet Balkenende I collapsed on 16 October after just 87 days in office after internal conflicts within the Pim Fortuyn List that destabilized the government. For the Dutch general election of 2003, Balkenende again as lijsttrekker won one seat and the following cabinet formation {{resulted in a}} coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the Democrats 66 (D66) which formed the Second Balkenende cabinet. On 29 June 2006 the Democrats 66 retracted {{their support for the}} cabinet Balkenende II after criticizing the way Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk (VVD) had handled the crisis around the naturalization of her party fellow elected to the House of Representatives Ayaan Hirsi Ali. On 7 July 2006 a rump cabinet Third Balkenende cabinet was formed and stayed in office until the Dutch general election of 2006. Balkenende again as lijsttrekker lost three seats but the Christian Democratic Appeal remained by far the largest party with 41 seats. The following 2006–2007 cabinet formation resulted in a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal, the Labour Party (PvdA) and the ChristianUnion (CU) that formed the Fourth Balkenende cabinet. On 20 February 2010 the Labour Party retracted their support for the cabinet Balkenende IV after a disagreement over the extension of the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. For the Dutch general election of 2010, Balkenende was appointed again as lijsttrekker, but his party lost 20 seats; he resigned his position as Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal on 9 June, taking <b>political</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the disappointing results in the election. Balkenende remained Prime Minister of the Netherlands until the First Rutte cabinet was installed on 14 October 2010.|$|E
500|$|The book {{explores the}} themes of exile, survival, heroism, leadership, <b>political</b> <b>responsibility,</b> and the [...] "making of a hero and a community". Joan Bridgman's {{analysis}} of Adams's works in The Contemporary Review identifies the community and hero motifs: [...] "he hero's journey into a realm of terrors to bring back some boon to save himself and his people" [...] is a powerful element in Adams's tale. This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his study of comparative mythology, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), and in particular, Campbell's [...] "monomyth" [...] theory, also based on Carl Jung's view of the unconscious mind, that [...] "all the stories {{in the world are}} really one story." ...|$|E
