5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were a normal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life, {{much more so}} than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life and culture in {{occupied}} Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling {{the actions of the}} official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA became a symbol of national unity and of passive resistance.|$|E

Optical communication provides the backbone for both the Internet and modern telephony.|$|E

25|$|Magic and {{religion}} were an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life in ancient Egypt. Evil gods and demons {{were thought to}} be responsible for many ailments, so often the treatments involved a supernatural element, such as beginning treatment with an appeal to a deity. There {{does not appear to have}} existed a clear distinction between what nowadays one would consider the very distinct callings of priest and physician. The healers, many of them priests of Sekhmet, often used incantations and magic as part of treatment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} four {{decades of the twentieth}} century, {{long-haul}} journeys between large American cities were accomplished using trains. By the 1950s, air travel was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life for many Americans. The tourism industry in the US experienced exponential growth as tourists could travel almost anywhere with a fast, reliable and routine system. For some, a vacation in Hawaii was now a more frequent pleasure. Air travel changed everything from family vacations to Major League Baseball, as had steam-powered trains in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.|$|E
25|$|Hummus is {{a common}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> meals in Israel. Apart from being {{included}} in the Mizrahi Jewish cuisine, a significant reason for the popularity of hummus in Israel {{is that it is}} made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. It is seen as almost equally popular among Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Though not a traditional Jewish food, it is sufficiently popular in Israel to be found in numerous hummus-only restaurants across the country and is regarded as a national food.|$|E

25|$|The most {{influential}} abolitionist tract was Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), the best-selling novel and play by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Outraged by the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 (which made the escape narrative <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> news), Stowe emphasized the horrors that abolitionists had long claimed about slavery. Her {{depiction of the}} evil slave owner Simon Legree, a transplanted Yankee who kills the Christ-like Uncle Tom, outraged the North, helped sway British public opinion against the South and inflamed Southern slave owners who tried to refute it by showing some slave owners were humanitarian. It inspired numerous anti-Tom novels, several written and published by women.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} costumes of Denmark, though varying from {{region to}} region, date back roughly {{to the period}} between 1750 and 1900 when clothes were often home-made from yarn spun from wool or flax. In rural communities, the fabrication of garments for both family members and servants was an important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life. The artist Frederik Christian Lund, who had travelled across Denmark as {{a soldier in the}} First Schleswig War, took an interest in sketching people in local costumes {{in various parts of the}} country. He completed his collection of 31 coloured sketches in 1864, publishing them as coloured lithographs in Danske Nationaldragter (Danish National Costumes).|$|E
25|$|Religious {{practices}} {{are as much}} an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life and a very public affair {{as they are in}} the rest of India. Therefore, not surprisingly, many festivals are religious in origin although several of them are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. Among the most important Hindu festivals are Diwali, Holi and Vijayadashami, Mahashivaratri, Ram Navmi, Basant Panchami, Sri Krishna Janamastmi and Raksha Bandhan, which are also observed by Jains and Sikhs. Eid al-Milad, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id and Moharram are Muslim religious festivals. Mahavir Jayanti is celebrated by Jains, Buddha Jayanti by Buddhists, Guru Nanak Jayanti by Sikhs and Good Friday, Christmas by the Christians.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a class-sensitive research design for addressing two <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life: eating and moving. In the gentrifying neighborhood of Sétif (Paris), it finds three class-specific strategies: multiplying places (underclass), partitioning places (working class), anchoring places (middle class). Adding to criticism of privative, miserabilist approaches of the underclass {{and the working}} class, it theorizes food lifestyles as cohering of products, practices, tastes, and norms, and spatial mobility as use of class singularities of places. All in all, this paper hopes to show that studying matters <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life yields contributions regarding the working of class, the making of social life, and the shaping of individual lives in context...|$|R

25|$|The ICAC uses a three-pronged {{approach}} to combating corruption: investigation, prevention, and community education. The most high profile of aspect {{of its work}} has been its investigative work, however as important {{if not more so}} has been its work in prevention and education. Prevention wise the ICAC offers advice and practical help to enable companies and organisations to introduce systems and procedures that are resistant to corruption. Since its inception the ICAC has worked tirelessly to change the public's perception that bribes and kickbacks are an expected and normal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life, and to reassure citizens that if they face a demand for an illegal payment that the ICAC will be there to investigate.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of chairs}} {{may also have}} been to provide more space for prostration, another ancient Jewish {{observance}} that the Jews of Yemen continued to practise until very recent times. There are still a few Yemenite Jews who prostrate themselves during the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> Jewish prayer called Tachanun (Supplication), though such individuals usually do so in privacy. In the small Jewish community that exists today in Bet Harash, prostration is still done during the tachanun prayer. Jews of European origin generally prostrate only during certain portions of special prayers during Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). Prostration was a common practise amongst all Jews until some point during the late Middle Ages or Renaissance period.|$|E
25|$|The Englewood {{community}} was largely {{defined by the}} Englewood Shopping Center at 63rd & Halsted, a large pedestrian mall. The City, social services, and mall management worked with community leaders and groups to integrate the mall with the community. The goal {{was to make the}} mall {{a vital part of the}} community, and a central <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life. It was the site of numerous community events, parades, outdoor concerts, live radio broadcasts and the like. This was spearheaded by the Englewood Business Men's Association and its director, Richard Drew. Mr. Drew died in 1978, and with his passing the Association lost its community focus. The Center subsequently lost its major anchor tenants, including Sears Roebuck, and became a collection of smaller merchants.|$|E
