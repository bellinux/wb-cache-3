5|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} design, in summer 1542 work recommenced on the castle, well after the initial invasion scare was over, lasting until August 1543. The decision to rectify the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> castle may have been taken by King Henry himself. Oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as the pay master and acted as the master of the works, with von Haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost {{until the end of the}} project, despite the difficulties with his earlier work. The cost of the second phase of work was much higher than the first, around £10,000.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} report released in November 1990 documented serious <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy {{to justify the}} program and deliver reasons why {{it should not be}} canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stability of the aircraft and vibration <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
5|$|After <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{first two}} {{airborne}} operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor {{assigned to the}} 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, the Guam National Weather Service {{issued a}} typhoon watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, {{as well as}} a high surf {{advisory}} for Guam. The watch was later upgraded to a warning, and was canceled after the typhoon exited the region. Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local aircraft communication system. During the storm, there were minor power outages on Saipan in two villages that were quickly restored. On Alamagan where the storm struck, six people rode out the storm in a concrete bunker.|$|E
5|$|And {{there were}} already <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already failed.

Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E

Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E

Although it had survived the Blitz, structural <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E

5|$|By February 1944, {{the reactor}} was {{irradiating}} {{a ton of}} uranium every three days. Over the next five months, {{the efficiency of the}} separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. Modifications over time raised the reactor's power to 4,000kW in July 1944. Unfortunately, the effect of the neutron poison xenon-135, one of many fission products produced from the uranium fuel, was not detected during the early operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Xenon-135 subsequently caused <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> startup of the Hanford B reactor that nearly halted the plutonium project.|$|E
