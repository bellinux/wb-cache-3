The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV) {{has asked the}} Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) to provide an opinion regarding the health risks associated with plant protection products containing glyphosate. A publication by a nongovernmental organisation (NGO) and a request by the European Commission for Germany’s commentary in its role as rapporteur for the active substance within the European plant protection <b>product</b> <b>authorisation</b> procedure on this report initiated this request. BfR concludes that the NGO report in question contains little new factual information while its relevant aspects {{in regard to the}} health assessment of the active substance glyphosate have already been examined by various international panels. On the contrary, the central expert debate actually reflects fundamentally different approaches to the health risk assessment of chemicals. According to BfR, such paradigm shifts must first be subjected to an expert review process and international panel discussions in order to assess their necessity. The present Opinion served as information to the European Commission and was thus drafted and will only be published in English on the BfR website...|$|E
40|$|A {{predictive}} {{model for the}} estimation of agricultural operator exposure has been developed {{on the basis of}} new exposure data. More than 30 unpublished GLP exposure studies conducted between 1994 and 2009 mainly for the purpose of plant protection <b>product</b> <b>authorisation</b> were chosen for evaluation according to a set of quality criteria defined by an expert group. All data including information about the studies were compiled in a database and used for a statistical analysis of exposure factors. The statistical analysis resulted in six validated models for typical scenarios of pesticide mixing/loading, and application outdoors including downwards and upwards spraying with vehicle-mounted/-trailed or hand-held equipment. As a major factor contributing to the exposure of operators, the amount of active substance used per day was identified. Other parameters such as formulation type, droplet size, presence of a cabin or density of the canopy were selected as factors for particular sub-scenarios. However, in the case of knapsack mixing/loading, and hand-held application directed downwards, the number of data was too small for identifying reliable exposure factors; instead the relevant percentiles of the exposure distribution were used. The new operator exposure model represents current application techniques and practices in Europe and allows for a tiered approach considering personal protective equipment (if necessary). The new model is intended to be used for national authorisation and for registration procedures of plant protection products in the EU...|$|E

40|$|Following {{the entry}} into force of the Directive 98 / 8 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council {{concerning}} the placing of biocidal products on the market, all active substances in the European market have to be reviewed to ensure that under normal conditions of use {{they can be used}} without unacceptable risk for people, animals or the environment. Thus, in the frame of the review process, the risk assessment of each active substance plays a fundamental role and providing technical guidance to the assessments that must be performed ensures a correct and uniform implementation of the Directive for the different Member States. According to Annex VI of Directive 98 / 8 /EC the risk assessment shall cover the proposed normal use of the biocidal product together with a ‘realistic worst case scenario’. The aim of this Emission Scenario Document (ESD) is to set up methods for the estimation of the emission of disinfectants, used for the disinfection of vehicles used for animal transport, for veterinary hygiene and in hatcheries. 	 The present ESD is intended to be used by Member States as a basis for assessing applications submitted with a view to include existing active substances used in PT 3 in Annex I or IA of Directive 98 / 8 /EC or for assessing applications for <b>product</b> <b>authorisation.</b> It can be a useful tool also for Industry, when assessing requirements for a submission.

40|$|This {{draft report}} was {{released}} to assist participants in preparing a submission {{to the public}} inquiry into default superannuation funds in modern awards. Default superannuation arrangements exist because many employees do not actively choose a superannuation fund. Default funds are currently listed in most modern awards.   Current default fund arrangements have provided stability, and investment returns of default funds have generally exceeded those of non-default funds.   However, the arrangements could be improved to promote {{the best interests of}} members. The primary objective of default funds should be the best interests of members, and for modern awards that list default funds, the selection and ongoing assessment of those funds should be merit based.   The criteria that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will use for MySuper <b>product</b> <b>authorisation</b> provide a sound basis for the selection and ongoing assessment of superannuation funds for listing as default funds in modern awards.   While the Commission does not consider {{there is a need for}} additional criteria, there are factors that should be considered as a second stage when selecting funds to be listed in modern awards.   These are: as primary factors, the appropriateness of the MySuper product 2 ̆ 7 s investment return and risk profile for employees to whom the superannuation provisions in that modern award apply, and the fund 2 ̆ 7 s expected ability to deliver on the MySuper product 2 ̆ 7 s investment objectives the appropriateness of the fees charged by the MySuper product, given its stated investment return objective and risk profile the assessment of governance structures to test if they are, as far as legislative requirements allow, consistent with meeting the best interests of members the assessment of the mechanisms put in place by fund trustees to deal with conflicts of interest, and the transparency in disclosing those conflicts the likelihood of members being switched to higher cost divisions of a fund, or facing significantly higher fees upon exiting employment (2 ̆ 7 flipping 2 ̆ 7) the compatibility of the fund 2 ̆ 7 s insurance offerings with the characteristics of employees to whom the superannuation provisions in that modern award apply the quality of member- and fund-specific intra-fund advice the administrative efficiency of a fund against a set of benchmarks.   The process for the selection and ongoing assessment of superannuation funds for listing as default funds in modern awards also needs to be reformed. The Commission is seeking further comment on two alternative options.   Decisions being made by an expert panel within Fair Work Australia (FWA), and the selection process being opened up to allow all funds to present their case to be listed in awards to FWA, based on the factors identified by the Commission; or Establishment of a new expert body independent of FWA, with the sole purpose of selecting and assessing the funds to be listed in modern awards, based on the factors identified by the Commission. Under either option employers would be able to choose a fund not listed in an award, provided they can demonstrate, upon request, that their employees are no worse off.  ...|$|E

The report outlines the important provisions of applicable legislation in both the regulations concerning harmonization of the authorisation of chemicals and the directives targeting the environmental concerns of the water bodies in the Union. The Biocidal Products Regulation provides the basis for all biocidal <b>products</b> <b>authorisation,</b> including procedural provisions and requirements for approval of active substances and <b>authorisation</b> of biocidal <b>products,</b> while the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive regulate the marine environment and provide specific environmental quality standards and measures that must be considered in the authorisation process. Provisions in both the Biocidal Products Regulation and the regulation in combination with the water policy directives provide the possibility to impose conditions or restrictions on antifouling biocides based on local environmental conditions, but the environmental concerns must be weighed against the objective of harmonization of the internal market. The particular sensitivity and unique environmental quality of the Baltic Sea constitutes aspects that can and must be taken into consideration in the authorisation process.

50|$|The EU {{regulatory}} framework for biocides has for years been defined by the Directive 98/8/EC, {{also known as the}} Biocidal Products Directive (BPD). The BPD was revoked by the Biocidal Products Regulation 528/2012 (BPR), which entered into force on 17 July 2012 with the application date of September 1, 2013. Several Technical Notes for Guidance (TNsG) have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the BPR and to assure a common understanding of its obligations. According to the EU legislation, biocidal <b>products</b> need <b>authorisation</b> to be placed or to remain on the market. Competent Authorities of the EU member states are responsible for assessing and approving the active substances contained in the biocides. The BPR follows some of the principles set previously under the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restrictions of Chemicals) and the coordination of the risk assessment process for both REACH and BPR are mandated to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which assures the harmonization and integration of risk characterization methodologies between the two regulations.|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary medicinal product sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary medicinal products needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary medicinal products, the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire. The report revealed that, even though {{a number of countries}} had developed legislative texts on medicinal products, these texts vary widely from one country to another and in only a few cases are they specific to veterinary medicinal products. In most cases, the implementing regulations are not properly enforced. As regards the registration of medicinal <b>products,</b> marketing <b>authorisation</b> (MA) applications receive only cursory examination because approval systems do not hav...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational medicinal products in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational medicinal products, in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational medicinal products. Clinical trials assessing typical investigational medicinal <b>products</b> require <b>authorisation</b> from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational medicinal products. Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational medicinal products overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational medicinal products. The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational medicinal products. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the outcomes and timing within the product life cycle of all benefit-risk reassessment procedures for marketed products that were completed by the committee for medicinal product for human use during 2001 - 2012. METHODS:A cohort of all referral procedures for benefit-risk reassessment (Article 20, Article 31, Article 36, Article 107 procedures) for which committee for medicinal product for human use issued an opinion between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2012 was created. The European Medicines Agency website and the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board website were used to collect all data. RESULTS:There were a total of 73 benefit-risk reassessments during the study period; 61 reassessments for a single product and 12 reassessments for multiple products or an entire product class. Nineteen reassessments resulted in the recommendation to remove the product from the market. On average, a benefit-risk reassessment was performed 18. 7 [*]years after the product was first marketed. Seventeen products were marketed 5 [*]years or less when the reassessment procedure was completed; six of these products were subsequently removed from the market. CONCLUSIONS:The majority of all benefit-risk reassessments that were performed during the study period did not result in removing the product from the market, but rather, in confirming the positive benefit-risk of the product, conditional to changes to the <b>product's</b> marketing <b>authorisation.</b> About half of all products that were removed from the market during the 2000 s had been marketed for more than 20 [*]years.

In addition numerous glucosamine preparations are on sale on the market as food supplements, frequently in combination with chondroitin sulphate. Medicinal <b>products</b> require marketing <b>authorisation</b> in the course of which their quality, efficacy and safety must be proven. Food supplements are foods.

40|$|The modern textile {{industry}} has experienced tremendous changes and {{become one of}} the best premier beneficiaries of advances in nanotechnology. This project is to explore the applications and management of nanotechnology to {{textile industry}}. The experimental studies include microwave absorption and magnetic induced heating on polyester textile using three magnetic nanoparticles [...] Carbonyl Iron Powder (CIP), Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and Ferrofluids. In comparison with the textile without applying magnetic nanoparticle material, these functional textiles show intersecting property of microwave absorption in the particular range of frequency and magnetic induced heating. I call these two promising textiles [...] Microwave-Absorption Textile (MAT) and Magnetic Heated Textile (MHT). Despite I have achieved significant and interesting results on MAT and MHT, there is plenty {{of work to be done}} not only in the development but also in the commercialization of the textiles. Thus, the public health and environmental safety become extremely important because there are a large number of imitators in the target market-China, and their lack of full knowledge, skills and understanding of the particular nanomaterials and nanoprocesses may result in the flood of counterfeit and poor-quality products in Chinese market which may endanger both public health and environmental safety. In order to minimize and manage the health and safety risks, I implement risk management for nanotechnology using two models [...] National Innovation System (NIS) and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), and significant findings are obtained. First, I find that a NIS can help nanotechnology manage health and safety risks in the development and commercialization of products with three stages: innovation inputs, innovation process and innovation outputs. Second, I find that IPR can be a good model for risk management, with which the risks associated with public health and environmental safety can be controlled, and those people or organizations that use our <b>products</b> without <b>authorisation</b> can be detected, and the violations of property rights and illegal imitations can be prevented. Chapter 1 introduces nanotechnology, risk management and the functional textiles.

40|$|Chondroitin {{sulphate}} is {{a natural}} component of cartilage and other body tissue. This substance is not authorised in Germany as a medicinal product for oral administration. However, chondroitin sulphate {{is to be found}} in numerous products that are on sale as food supplements. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to undertake a health assessment of the use of isolated chondroitin sulphate in foods (food supplements) in amounts at which no pharmacological (medicinal/therapeutic) effect is to be expected. Food supplements are foods. Unlike medicinal products they do not, in principle, require marketing authorisation. They must be safe and not harmful to health. Their ingredients should not have any pharmacological effects. As, up to now, no oral dose could be established by the national drug authority (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices - BfArM) upwards of which the therapeutic (pharmacological) efficacy of a substance can be assumed, BfR based its assessment of the use of isolated chondroitin sulphate in food supplements on intakes of between 800 and 1200 milligram per day. BfR expressly points out that no statement is made about possible pharmacological effects, and that this is not a recommendation to admix amounts of this kind as daily intakes to food supplements/foods.
