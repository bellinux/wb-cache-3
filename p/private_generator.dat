50|$|The first {{organisation}} to {{plan for}} a new power station on the site was Cumbria Power in 1987, formed of four engineers. They hoped to build a CCGT plant that used the steam turbines of the former plant. This idea wasn't feasible, so a new power station was chosen instead, but situated in the former turbine hall. ABB joined the planning process in April 1989, and a new company - Lakeland Power Ltd - was formed, being owned 80% by ABB and 20% by Cumbria Power. In October 1989, the North Western Electricity Board (NORWEB) {{signed an agreement with}} Lakeland Power to have a supply of electricity - the first such agreement between a UK regional electricity company and a <b>private</b> <b>generator.</b> NORWEB also bought 20% of the company.|$|E

40|$|We study a {{model of}} mixed {{wholesale}} electricity market in which a profit-maximizing <b>private</b> <b>generator</b> and a public (or a regulated) generator compete to serve consumers on the same transmission network. We allow for different objective functions for the public/regulated generator, ranging from pure consumer surplus maximization to pure profit maximization. We consider a network configuration where transmission constraints may lead to network externalities. The transmission network is operated by an Independent System Operator (ISO) utilizing a market-based congestion management system. Reliability of the transmission network is achieved via explicit nodal transmission price signals to the generators. We characterize equilibria and study various issues involved, such as multiple equilibria {{and how to make}} a plausible choice among them based on (equilibrium) profits of the ISO and the public/regulated generator. We also study the impact of the public/regulated generator's objective function on equilibrium outcomes and overall welfare and characterize its optimal objective function. Our findings also have policy implications regarding the extent t...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{relates to}} a study of {{abnormal}} conditions on a threephase distribution feeder of industry like State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) with several loads and a capacitor bank. An induction generator, which {{plays the role of}} a dispersed storage and generation unit, driven by a hydraulic turbine, which is a common form of renewable energy scheme, is connected to the distribution feeder through a Δ/Y transformer. Transients caused switching of the induction generator, by single line-to-ground fault, double line-to-ground fault through contact resistances, broken conductor touching the ground through a small resistance, isolating the induction generator to form its own supply domain (islanding) etc are investigated and interesting conclusions of practical importance are derived. The IBM PC version 4 of the Electro-Magnetic-Transient Program - Alternative Transient Program (ATP), was used to solve this problem. The program also gives output results for automatic plotting in time domain. Accordingly, transient voltages at several nodes and transient currents at interesting points were plotted from the output results. Planning and operational aspects like voltage control, reliability, harmonics, earthing, and contractual matters between the <b>private</b> <b>generator</b> and the utility are also considered. Technical aspects interconnections between the private generation and the utility has been considered. Interesting conclusions, valuable for insulation co-ordination, interrupting duty on circuit breakers, effect on response of protective relays and automatic control systems are pointed out. It also considers security to personnel and protection of metering equipment. The thesis also offers guide for contractual matters between the utility and the private generation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} contributions on {{the economic}} impacts of energy infrastructure constraints and air pollution in the developing world. I begin by investigating the impact of unreliable power supply on worker reallocation in Chinese manufacturing firms. This study {{contributes to the literature}} by highlighting the causal relationships between the quality of energy infrastructure and labour market outcomes. I find that frequent power outages significantly increase the pace at which long-term workers are reallocated. The impacts on the reallocation of temporary workers are much weaker and statistically insignificant. Evidence suggests that these impacts are driven in part by firms' decreased labour demand and the relative wages of long-term workers. In India, to cope with the poor public electricity provision problem, many enterprises install private generators. I examine whether the adoption of such private remedial infrastructure can enhance a firm's marginal profit from production capital, and consequently, increase the investment rate. Using Indian firm-level data, the key findings suggest a heterogeneous treatment effect of <b>private</b> <b>generator</b> adoption on the investment rate. That is, firms that are the least likely to install generators however would benefit the most and have a larger impact on their investment in other production capital. Traditional energy production and use results in air pollution, which is now recognized as an increasing concern for developing countries. To evaluate the economic impact of air pollution in China, I analyze the causal association between air pollution and urban land prices using a unique land conveyance dataset. To address the endogeneity issue of air pollution, I exploit the systematic effects of the interactions between atmospheric circulation and topographical features on the dispersion of local air pollutants. Results suggest that air pollution significantly influences land prices. Each 1 % increase in average annual air pollution reduces urban land prices by approximately 1. 4 %. These effects vary across land types: there is a large and negative effect on residential land, but the effects on industrial or commercial land are both small and positive...|$|E

40|$|A {{secure and}} {{distributed}} {{framework for the}} management of patients’ information in emergency and hospitalization services is proposed here in order to seek improvements in efficiency and security in this important area. In particular, confidentiality protection, mutual authentication, and automatic identification of patients are provided. The proposed system is based on two types of devices: Near Field Communication (NFC) wristbands assigned to patients, and mobile devices assigned to medical staff. Two other main elements of the system are an intermediate server to manage the involved data, and a second server with a <b>private</b> key <b>generator</b> to define the information required to protect communications. An identity-based authentication and key exchange scheme is essential to provide confidential communication and mutual authentication between the medical staff and the <b>private</b> key <b>generator</b> through an intermediate server. The identification of patients is carried out through a keyed-hash message authentication code. Thanks to the combination of the aforementioned tools, a secure alternative mobile health (mHealth) scheme for managing patients’ data is defined for emergency and hospitalization services. Different parts of the proposed system have been implemented, including mobile application, intermediate server, <b>private</b> key <b>generator</b> and communication channels. Apart from that, several simulations have been performed, and, compared with the current system, significant improvements in efficiency have been observed...|$|R
