5000|$|As the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>operation</b> of valves, {{compared}} to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a pneumatic nozzle and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to sense the valve actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual valve regulating element position against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the valve body. A positioner also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type valve actuators.|$|E

To allow the analysis of samples with limited available volume, and to render the construction less complicated compared to a computer-controlled counterpart, sample injection is carried out hydrodynamically directly from the sample vial into the capillary by manual syphoning. The system is a well performing solution where the financial means for the highly expensive commercial instruments are not available and where the in-house construction of a sophisticated automated instrument is not possible due to limited mechanical and electronic workshop facilities and software programming expertise.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. In this thesis, silicone rubber was integrated with standard silicon based micromachining processes to allow fabrication of large deflection actuators. Taking {{advantage of the}} low Young's modulus and resulting flexibility of silicone rubber, several different devices for fluidic control were demonstrated. A novel self-releasing process for defining large actuators on silicon substrates irrespective of backside opening size was developed and used to generate micro balloon actuators used for delta wing control. When deployed near the separation line on the rounded leading edge of a delta wing, significant aerodynamic moments were generated allowing flight control at high angle of attack. To allow more flexibility in spatial actuation, a flexible metal substrate actuator "skin" was also developed and tested on flight models. With vertical actuations of 2 mm, rolling moment coefficients up to 0. 012 were obtained at high angle of attack, comparable to conventional flaps. The low durometer and flexibility of silicone rubber membranes were exploited to fabricate a peristaltic pump. Taking advantage of the low dead volume and good sealing afforded by membranes combined with form-fitting chambers, a self-priming pump capable of pumping gas and liquid with high particle immunity was demonstrated. Due to the planar nature of the device, it is straightforward to construct integrated systems of reservoirs, channels, valves, and pumps. Standalone operation without an external pneumatic source was achieved using thermopneumatic actuation with air as the working fluid. To achieve low power consumption and reasonable operational frequency, a suspended silicon island heater process was also developed. Flow rates up to 6. 3 [ [...] . ]/min at 291 mW power consumption were achieved with thermopneumatic actuation and flow rates above 100 [ [...] . ]/min can be easily obtained with external <b>pneumatic</b> <b>operation.</b> Using technology developed for the peristaltic pump, a diaphragm pump topology suitable for complex fluidic systems was developed.

40|$|Hydraulic cylinder-driven {{control systems}} have become {{increasingly}} popular as the means of actuation for human-scale legged robots (such as Boston Dynamics' ATLAS humanoid) and assistive devices (such as Lockheed Martin's HULC exoskeleton) largely due to their high actuator power density. McKibben muscles are also an attractive actuator choice among the robotics community because of their extremely light weight, high force capacity, and low fabrication cost. The vast majority of these actuators are operated pneumatically, enhancing compliance, but resulting in extremely low efficiencies. Powering these actuators hydraulically increases actuator stiffness and allows for roughly double the efficiency. While running the system hydraulically is more efficient than <b>pneumatic</b> <b>operation,</b> efficiency {{is still one of}} the largest drawbacks of hydraulic servo-systems, where on average 43 % of the input power is lost to valve throttling. Due to these large losses, one of the biggest limitations of these robots is their run time untethered from a power source. This dissertation aims to improve actuation efficiency in order to enable a greater range for mobile robots. First, the transduction efficiency of McKibben muscle actuators is characterized, and is increased through the use of higher bulk modulus fluids, inelastic bladders, and higher pressures. Through these modifications, the transduction efficiency is increased from 27 % for a pneumatic latex bladder McKibben muscle, to 80 % for a hydraulic low density polyethylene bladder McKibben muscle. Next, a real-time variable recruitment actuation scheme is implemented on a bundle of parallel McKibben actuators for the purpose of reducing servovalve throttling losses. This strategy minimizes fluid power consumption by selectively activating the minimum number of McKibben actuators required by the load, and is inspired by multiple motor unit summation in skeletal muscle. Over the range of loads tested on the proof-of-concept bundle, variable recruitment is shown to increase actuation efficiency from 39 % to 57 % compared to a throttling only approach. Lastly, an improved angular position controller for the hydraulic McKibben actuators is formulated via a cascaded PI(angular feedback) -P(pressure feedback) -controller with feedforward compensation. The feedforward term provides anticipative action through a McKibben flowrate model and valve flow gain. This controller increases system bandwidth and reduces settling times. These control techniques are then discussed within the context of enhanced variable recruitment control, and overall future directions for improving system efficiency are considered. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|To summarize: Contemporary Evangelicalism is {{not merely}} a {{momentary}} or reactionary movement, but the full-grown of the long process of <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>operation</b> in restoring Christian Faith back to its prototypal theological structures. Contemporary Evangelicalism presents a distinct ecclesiology descriptive of the structures of the prototype ekklesia that has been historically marred; thus Contemporary Evangelicalism is restorative of the prototypal ecclesiological structures. The peoplehood of God, or in the particular New Testament context, the peoplehood of Christ—is the very identity of the church, and the very identity that Contemporary Evangelicalism presents to the church in the present times; thus Contemporary Evangelicalism is restorative of the original ecclesial identity. Now, to inversely synthesize, God called Noah and his family because they were still obedient to God. God called Abraham because he had that inclination to be faithful to God. God called Lot because he still had that God-consciousness. God called Israel because they still believe on the one Creator-God. Then God called the Christian church because it is composed of people who believe in Jesus Christ. Thus, here we see the fidestic response factor throughout God’s historical calls. God call a people because they are those who respond to him in faith. Whenever such faith response waned, God chooses another people who, again, could respond to him in faith. Thus the existence and life of the ekklesia is co-existent with its fidestic response to God. The moment it stops responding to God in faith, it loses its ekklesiality. It is in this context, that Contemporary Evangelicalism emerges as the climactic phase of God’s historical ekklesiality. Contemporary Evangelicalism presents before the church the prototypal theological and ecclesiological framework of Christian Faith. As such, while presenting this prototypal framework, it also poses a call for the restoration the prototypal structures in the present theological and ecclesiological framework of Christian Faith. But the call necessitates a wholehearted response of faith. Thus, Contemporary Evangelicalism, in essence, is the call for the New Reformation of Christian Faith, the New Reformation of Christian church, back to its prototypal structures. When Christians and the Christian church fail to heed this call, Christianity could, again, lose a great and blissful opportunity to be more truly God’s people, to be more truly the people of Christ, in the present time nearing the parousia. It is prayerful hope that this work would spark a global conflagration of New Reformation!Thesis (PhD (Systematic Theology&Ethics)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

During <b>pneumatic</b> hybrid <b>operation</b> the engine {{can be used as a}} 2 -stroke compressor for generation of compressed air during vehicle deceleration and during vehicle acceleration the engine can be operated as an air-motor driven by the previously stored pressurized air. The compressed air is stored in a pressure tank connected to one of the inlet ports.

In order to switch between different modes of engine operation there is a need for a VVT system and the engine used in this study is equipped with pneumatic valve actuators that uses compressed air in order to drive the valves and the motion of the valves are controlled by a combination of electronics and hydraulics.

Data exchange between electronic units is carried by SAE-J 1939 protocol with a transmission rate of 250 kbit/s. Change in diesel fuel supply, clutch engagement and gearshifting take place automatically {{as a result of}} <b>pneumatic</b> power actuator <b>operation</b> by a signal from the controller to the corresponding solenoid valve or a combination thereof. Presents the results of semi-natural experiment on research of gear shifting process in the command mode of powertrain control. Transient gearshift oscillograms with various control algorithm structure have been given in the paper. The paper contains a ^iT^rative analysis of the oscillograma and a conclusion on expediency of gear shifting automation. A graphic representation of the semi-natural experiment results has been performed with the help of CoDeSys V 2. 3 -visualization facilities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Urban traffic {{involves}} frequent {{acceleration and}} deceleration. During deceleration, the energy previously used {{to accelerate the}} vehicle is mainly wasted on heat generated by the friction brakes. If this energy that is wasted in traditional IC engines could be saved, the fuel economy would improve. Today there are several solutions {{to meet the demand}} for better fuel economy {{and one of them is}} the pneumatic hybrids. The idea with pneumatic hybridization is to reduce the fuel consumption by taking advantage of the, otherwise lost, brake energy. In the work presented in this study a heavy duty Scania D 12 engine has been converted to work as a pneumatic hybrid. During <b>pneumatic</b> hybrid <b>operation</b> the engine can be used as a 2 ‐stroke compressor for generation of compressed air during vehicle deceleration (compressor mode) and during vehicle acceleration the engine can be operated as an air‐motor driven by the previously stored pressurized air (air‐motor mode). The compressed air is stored in a pressure tank connected to one of the inlet ports. One of the engine inlet valves has been modified to work as a tank valve in order to control the pressurized air flow to and from the pressure tank. In order to switch between different modes of engine operation there is a need for a fully variable valve actuation (FVVA) system. The engine used in this study is equipped with pneumatic valve actuators that use compressed air in order to drive the valves and the motion of the valves are controlled by a combination of electronics and hydraulics. Since the pneumatic VVA system, used in the work presented in this thesis, was still under development, the need to evaluate the system before any extensive use was more than necessary. The evaluation of the pneumatic VVA system verified its potential and a stable function was noticed together with great flexibility to manipulate both valve timing and valve lift to fit the desired purpose. Initial testing concerning the different pneumatic hybrid engine modes of operation was conducted. Both compressor mode (CM) and air‐motor mode (AM) were executed successfully. Optimization of CM and AM with regards to valve timing and valve geometry has been done with great improvements in regenerative efficiency which is defined as the ratio between the energy extracted during AM and the energy consumed during CM...|$|R
