5000|$|Pleiotropy (from Greek πλείων pleion, [...] "more", and τρόπος tropos, [...] "way") {{occurs when}} one gene {{influences}} {{two or more}} seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Therefore, a mutation in a <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> may {{have an effect on}} several traits simultaneously due to the gene coding for a product used by a myriad of cells or different targets that have the same signaling function.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, a <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> may be both harmful and {{beneficial}} to an organism, which {{is referred to}} as antagonistic pleiotropy. This may occur when the trait is beneficial for the organism's early life, but not its late life. Such [...] "trade-offs" [...] are possible since natural selection affects traits expressed earlier in life, when most organisms are most fertile, more than traits expressed later in life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> {{act as an}} arbitrating {{force in}} speciation. William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert (1993) {{conclude}} that the observed prezygotic isolation in their studies {{is a product of}} pleiotropy's balancing role in indirect selection. By imitating the traits of all-infertile hybridized species, they noticed that the fertilization of eggs was prevented in all eight of their separate studies, a likely effect of <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> on speciation. Likewise, <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene's</b> stabilizing selection allows for the allele frequency to be altered.|$|R

40|$|Pleiotropy, {{the ability}} of a single mutant gene to cause {{multiple}} mutant phenotypes, is a relatively common but poorly understood phenomenon in biology. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the analysis of <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> is determining whether phenotypes associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions, finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance. We use a biclustering algorithm to group <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> by common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to biological process classifications, synthetic lethal interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis that this method can be used to genetically define cellular functions. Applying these functional classifications to <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes,</b> we are able to dissect phenotypes into groups associated with specific gene functions...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> {{action can}} limit {{the rate of}} multivariate {{evolution}} when natural selection, sexual selection or artificial selection on one trait favors one specific version of the gene (allele), while selection on other traits favors a different allele, which shows how evolution is negatively related with pleiotropy in models. Although some of the evolution in genes can be beneficial, some gene evolution is harmful to an organism. Genetic correlations and responses to selection most often exemplify pleiotropy.|$|E
5000|$|Pleiotropy {{occurs when}} one gene {{influences}} multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits, an example being phenylketonuria, {{which is a}} human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect. [...] Andrzej Pękalski, from the University of Wrocław, argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> that could possibly {{be associated with a}} positive trait. Pekalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with myopia from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two go together.|$|E
5000|$|An antagonistically <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> can be {{selected}} for {{if it has}} beneficial effects in early life while having its negative effects in later life because genes tend to have larger impacts on fitness in an organism's prime than in their old age. An {{example of this is}} testosterone levels in male humans. Higher levels of this hormone lead to increased fitness in early life, while causing decreased fitness in later life due to a higher risk for prostate cancer. This is an example of antagonistic pleiotropy being an explanation for senescence. Senescence is the act of ageing in individuals; it's the failure over time of the individual's life processes by natural causes. Williams's theory has been the motivation for many of the experimental studies on the reasons for aging in the last 25 years. However {{there is more than one}} theory out there for aging. The competing model to explain senescence is Medawar's [...] "mutation accumulation" [...] hypothesis, saying that [...] "over evolutionary time, late-acting mutations will accumulate at a much faster rate than early-acting mutation. These late-acting mutations will thus lead to declining viability and/or fertility as an organism ages." [...] Medawar's theory is based around the older concept of selection shadow that had been discussed throughout the early 1900s and led to Medawar's theory after discussions with J. B. S. Haldane in the 1940s.|$|E
40|$|Pleiotropy {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} in which a single gene controls several distinct, and seemingly unrelated, phenotypic effects. We use C. elegans early embryogenesis as a model to conduct systematic studies of pleiotropy. We analyze high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) data from C. elegans and identify "phenotypic signatures", which are sets of cellular defects indicative of certain biological functions. By matching phenotypic profiles to our identified signatures, we assign genes with complex phenotypic profiles to multiple functional classes. Overall, we observe that pleiotropy occurs extensively among genes involved in early embryogenesis, and {{a small proportion of}} these <b>genes</b> are highly <b>pleiotropic.</b> We hypothesize that genes involved in early embryogenesis are organized into partially overlapping functional modules, and that <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> represent "connectors" between these modules. In support of this hypothesis, we find that highly <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> tend to reside in central positions in protein-protein interaction networks, suggesting that <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> act as connecting points between different protein complexes or pathways...|$|R

The increased expression of this polypeptide in strains carrying the sacQ 36 allele, or in strains carrying the sacQ gene on a high copy plasmid, appears to be responsible for the phenotype of higher levels of proteases seen in these strains.

40|$|Motivation: In haploinsufficiency {{profiling}} data, <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> {{are often}} misclassified by clustering algorithms that impose the constraint that a gene or experiment belong {{to only one}} cluster. We have developed a general probabilistic model that clusters genes and experiments without requiring that a given gene or drug only appear in one cluster. The model also incorporates the functional annotation of known genes to guide the clustering procedure. Results: We applied our model to the clustering of 79 chemogenomic experiments in yeast. Known <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> PDR 5 and MAL 11 are more accurately represented by the model than by a clustering procedure that requires genes {{to belong to a}} single cluster. Drugs such as miconazole and fenpropimorph that have different targets but similar off-target genes are clustered more accurately by the model-based framework. We show that this model is useful for summarizing the relationship among treatments and genes affected by those treatments in a compendium of microarray profiles...|$|R

50|$|Sickle cell anemia is {{a classic}} example of the mixed benefit given by the staying power of <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes,</b> as the {{mutation}} to Hb-S provides the fitness benefit of malaria resistance to heterozygotes, while homozygotes have significantly lowered life expectancy. Since both of these states are linked to the same mutated gene, large populations today are susceptible to sickle cell despite it being a fitness-impairing genetic disorder.|$|R
40|$|Myopia {{has become}} an almost {{pandemic}} problem in many populations. There are compelling {{evidence to suggest that}} myopia is a hereditary condition. However, myopia would constitute a definite selection disadvantage during most stages of human evolution, which is incompatible with its moderate to high prevalence in most modern populations. The rapid upsurge of myopia over just a few decades also implies that its inheritance does not follow any of the usual patterns, and environmental factors may have an important role in precipitating its occurrence in those who are genetically predisposed. Previous studies showed that myopes were, on average, more intelligent than non-myopes, and this association had been attributed to a biological link between eye growth and brain development. We propose a pleiotropic genetic model to explain the atypical epidemiologic and inheritance pattern of myopia and its relationship with neurocognitive development. This <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> was positively selected for its facilitation of human intelligence. The myopic component is a latent phenotype; myopia will not be expressed unless some novel external factors are encountered (i. e. a "quirk" phenomenon). Therefore, the myopic component was selectively neutral in our ancestral environment. The net gain in Darwinian fitness enables the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> to attain a high frequency in the human population, as reflected by our current prevalence of myopia. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: Current {{genome-wide}} association studies (GWAS) {{are normally}} implemented in a univariate framework and analyze different phenotypes in isolation. This univariate approach ignores the potential genetic correlation between important disease traits. Hence {{this approach is}} difficult to detect <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes,</b> which may exist for obesity and osteoporosis, two common diseases of major public health importance that are closely correlated genetically. Principal Findings: To identify such <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> and the key mechanistic links between the two diseases, we here performed the first bivariate GWAS of obesity and osteoporosis. We searched for genes underlying co-variation of the obesity phenotype, body mass index (BMI), with the osteoporosis risk phenotype, hip bone mineral density (BMD), scanning, 380, 000 SNPs in 1, 000 unrelated homogeneous Caucasians, including 499 males and 501 females. We identified in the male subjects two SNPs in intron 1 of the SOX 6 (SRY-box 6) gene, rs 297325 and rs 4756846, which were bivariately associated with both BMI and hip BMD, achieving p values of 6. 8261027 and 1. 4761026, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background A multivariate {{genome-wide}} association test {{is proposed}} for analyzing data on multivariate quantitative phenotypes collected from related subjects. The proposed method is a two-step approach. The first step models {{the association between}} the genotype and marginal phenotype using a linear mixed model. The second step uses the correlation between residuals of the linear mixed model to estimate the null distribution of the Fisher combination test statistic. Results The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method controls the type I error rate and is more powerful than the marginal tests across different population structures (admixed or non-admixed) and relatedness (related or independent). The statistical analysis on the database of the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) demonstrates that applying the multivariate association test may facilitate identification of the <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> contributing to the risk for alcohol dependence commonly expressed by four correlated phenotypes. Conclusions This study proposes a multivariate method for identifying <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> while adjusting for cryptic relatedness and population structure between subjects. The two-step approach is not only powerful but also computationally efficient even when the number of subjects and the number of phenotypes are both very large...|$|R

These defects were all corrected in fam and htpR mutants by complementation with plasmids carrying intact htpR+ or by recombination between these mutant alleles and a plasmid carrying {{only a portion of}} htpR.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{clinical study}} of 30 families with familial polyposis coli is presented. Seven 'isolated' cases are also described. It {{was found that}} some families did not exhibit any extracolonic manifestations, {{but the majority of}} families showed various numbers of members who had these manifestations of differing types and degrees. In view of the great variability within the members of a family, polyposis coli and the Gardner syndrome are probably both produced by one <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene.</b> The occurrence of other neoplastic phenomena in association with polyposis coli has been considered. Many types of malignancy can occur in these patients and their families and the majority are probably fortuitous.

40|$|SummaryHuman {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (hPSCs) offer a unique platform for elucidating the genes and molecular pathways that underlie complex traits and diseases.  To realize this promise, methods for rapid and controllable genetic manipulations are urgently needed. By combining two newly developed gene-editing tools, the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas systems, we have developed a genome-engineering platform in hPSCs, which we named iCRISPR. iCRISPR enabled rapid and highly efficient generation of biallelic knockout hPSCs for loss-of-function studies, as well as homozygous knockin hPSCs with specific nucleotide alterations for precise modeling of disease conditions. We further demonstrate efficient one-step generation of double- and triple-gene knockout hPSC lines, as well as stage-specific inducible gene knockout during hPSC differentiation. Thus the iCRISPR platform is uniquely suited for dissection of complex genetic interactions and <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>gene</b> functions in human disease studies and {{has the potential to}} support high-throughput genetic analysis in hPSCs...|$|E
40|$|Dementia is a {{major problem}} of health in {{developed}} societies. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia, and mixed dementia account for over 90 % of the most prevalent forms of dementia. Both genetic and environmental factors are determinant for the phenotypic expression of dementia. AD is a complex disorder in which many different gene clusters may be involved. Most genes screened to date belong to different proteomic and metabolomic pathways potentially affecting AD pathogenesis. The ε 4 variant of the APOE gene seems to be a major risk factor for both degenerative and vascular dementia. Metabolic factors, cerebrovascular disorders, and epigenetic phenomena also contribute to neurodegeneration. Five categories of genes are mainly involved in pharmacogenomics: genes associated with disease pathogenesis, genes associated with the mechanism of action of a particular drug, genes associated with phase I and phase II metabolic reactions, genes associated with transporters, and <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> and/or genes associated with concomitant pathologies. The APOE and CYP 2 D 6 genes have been extensively studied in AD. The therapeutic response to conventional drugs in patients with AD is genotype specific, with CYP 2 D 6 -PMs, CYP 2 D 6 -UMs, and APOE- 4 / 4 carriers acting as the worst responders. APOE and CYP 2 D 6 may cooperate, as <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes,</b> in the metabolism of drugs and hepatic function.

40|$|Background: Translational {{research}} typically aims {{to identify}} and functionally validate individual, disease-specific genes. However, reaching this aim {{is complicated by the}} involvement of thousands of genes in common diseases, and that many of those <b>genes</b> are <b>pleiotropic,</b> that is, shared by several diseases. Methods: We integrated genomic meta-analyses with prospective clinical studies to systematically investigate the pathogenic, diagnostic and therapeutic roles of <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes.</b> In a novel approach, we first used pathway analysis of all published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to find a cell type common to many diseases. Results: The analysis showed over-representation of the T helper cell differentiation pathway, which is expressed in T cells. This led us to focus on expression profiling of CD 4 (+) T cells from highly diverse inflammatory and malignant diseases. We found that <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> were highly interconnected and formed a pleiotropic module, which was enriched for inflammatory, metabolic and proliferative pathways. The general relevance of this module was supported by highly significant enrichment of genetic variants identified by all GWAS and cancer studies, as well as known diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Prospective clinical studies of multiple sclerosis and allergy showed the importance of both pleiotropic and disease specific modules for clinical stratification. Conclusions: In summary, this translational genomics study identified a pleiotropic module, which has key pathogenic, diagnostic and therapeutic roles...|$|R

40|$|SummaryQuantitative {{traits are}} shaped by {{networks}} of <b>pleiotropic</b> <b>genes</b> [1]. To understand the mechanisms that maintain genetic variation for quantitative traits in natural populations and to predict responses to artificial and natural selection, we must evaluate pleiotropic effects of underlying quantitative trait genes and define functional allelic variation {{at the level of}} quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs). Catecholamines up (Catsup), which encodes a negative regulator of tyrosine hydroxylase [2], the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine, is a <b>pleiotropic</b> quantitative trait <b>gene</b> in Drosophila melanogaster [2 – 4]. We used association mapping to determine whether the same or different QTNs at Catsup are associated with naturally occurring variation in multiple quantitative traits. We sequenced 169 Catsup alleles from a single population and detected 33 polymorphisms with little linkage disequilibrium (LD). Different molecular polymorphisms in Catsup are independently associated with variation in longevity, locomotor behavior, and sensory bristle number. Most of these polymorphisms are potentially functional variants in protein coding regions, have large effects, and are not common. Thus, Catsup is a <b>pleiotropic</b> quantitative trait <b>gene,</b> but individual QTNs do not have pleiotropic effects. Molecular population genetic analyses of Catsup sequences are consistent with balancing selection maintaining multiple functional polymorphisms...|$|R
