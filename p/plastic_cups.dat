25|$|In February 2008, after helping United beat Aberdeen in the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup, Załuska was {{reported}} to the Scottish Football Association (SFA) for making gestures to the Aberdeen fans. In the match, both keepers faced missiles thrown by sets of opposing fans, including <b>plastic</b> <b>cups,</b> chocolate and £1 coins. Referee Iain Brines was also hit by a coin thrown from the Aberdeen supporters' end. A month later, Załuska received a £500 fine and a warning from the SFA for his actions.|$|E
25|$|Value and {{discount}} {{retailers have}} seen a boom in sales since the recession {{at the start of}} 2009. Although there are several retailers with the same strategy as 99p Stores, such as independent businesses and smaller price-point retail chains such as Poundworld, 99p Stores' closest and largest rival in the sector is Poundland. The retailer has cited one of their main aims is to catch up with Poundland and their 223 stores as of August 2009. The retailer makes it a point of honour to undercut rival Poundland, whose £1 pack of 100 white <b>plastic</b> <b>cups</b> contained 20 fewer (and cost a penny more) than the pack of 120 available at 99p Stores as of late 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{underwear}} maker Jockey International {{offered a}} new way to measure bra and cup size. It introduced a system with ten cup sizes per band size that are numbered and not lettered, designated as 1-36, 2-36 etc. The company developed the system over eight years, during which they scanned and measured the breasts and torsos of 800 women. Researchers also tracked the women's use of their bras at home. To implement the system, women must purchase a set of <b>plastic</b> <b>cups</b> from the company to find their Jockey cup size. Some analysts were critical of the requirement to buy the measurement kit, since women must pay about USD$20 to adopt Jockey's proprietary system, in addition to the cost of the bras themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Large {{amounts of}} sugar – or other {{sweeteners}} for low-energy yogurts – {{are often used}} in commercial yogurt. Some yogurts contain added modified starch, pectin (found naturally in fruit), and/or gelatin to create thickness and creaminess artificially at lower cost. This type of yogurt is also marketed under the name Swiss-style, although it is unrelated to the way yogurt is eaten in Switzerland. Some yogurts, often called [...] "cream line", are made with whole milk {{which has not been}} homogenized so the cream rises to the top. In the UK, Ireland, France and United States, sweetened, flavored yogurt is the most popular type, typically sold in single-serving <b>plastic</b> <b>cups.</b> Common flavors include vanilla, honey, and toffee, and fruit such as strawberry, cherry, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, mango and peach. In the early twenty-first century yogurt flavors inspired by desserts, such as chocolate or cheesecake, have been available.|$|E

2500|$|John Wesley, {{a founder}} of Methodism, {{said that it was}} the duty of Christians to receive the sacrament as often as possible. Methodists in the United States are {{encouraged}} to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating {{back to the days of}} circuit riders that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or <b>plastic</b> <b>cups</b> known as communion cups. The United Methodist Church practices open communion, inviting [...] "all who intend a Christian life, together with their children" [...] to receive Communion.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, two skyscrapers {{designed}} by architect Rafael Viñoly, the Vdara in Las Vegas and 20 Fenchurch Street in London, have experienced unusual problems {{due to their}} concave curved glass exteriors acting as respectively cylindrical and spherical reflectors for sunlight. [...] In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflected off the Vdara's south-facing tower could singe swimmers in the hotel pool, as well as melting <b>plastic</b> <b>cups</b> and shopping bags; employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the [...] "Vdara death ray", aka the [...] "fryscraper." [...] In 2013, sunlight reflecting off 20 Fenchurch Street melted parts of a Jaguar car parked nearby and scorching or igniting the carpet of a nearby barber shop. [...] This building had been nicknamed the [...] "walkie-talkie" [...] because its shape was supposedly similar to a certain model of two-way radio; but after its tendency to overheat surrounding objects became known, the nickname changed to the [...] "walkie-scorchie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{places such}} as Kerala where {{coconuts}} are in abundance, the half shell of coconut {{was used as the}} latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or <b>plastic</b> <b>cups</b> became [...] more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised [...] "spout" [...] knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily [...] "task" [...] size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. [...] "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it." ...|$|E
