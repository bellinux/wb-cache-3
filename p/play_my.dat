25|$|From the beginning, kibbutzim had a {{reputation}} as culture-friendly and nurturing of the arts. Many kibbutzniks became writers, actors, or artists. Kibbutzim typically offer theatre companies, choirs, orchestras, athletic leagues, and special-interest classes. In 1953 Givat Brenner staged the <b>play</b> <b>My</b> Glorious Brothers, about the Maccabee revolt, building a real village on a hilltop as a set, planting real trees, and performing for 40,000 people. Following kibbutz work practices of the time, all the actors were members of the kibbutz, and all performed as part of their work assignments.|$|E
25|$|Following her {{separation}} from Summers, Allyson was twice married to and divorced from businessman Alfred Glenn Maxwell, {{who owned a}} number of barbershops and had been Powell's barber. During this time, Allyson struggled with alcoholism, which she overcame in the mid-1970s. In 1976, Allyson married David Ashrow, a dentist turned actor. The couple occasionally performed together in regional theater, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, toured the United States with the stage <b>play</b> <b>My</b> Daughter, Your Son. They also appeared on celebrity cruise ship tours on the Royal Viking Sky, in a program that highlighted Allyson's movie career.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Giger and Tobler visited {{director}} Fredi M. Murer in London. Murer filmed a TV documentary, entitled Passagen (1972), about Giger's work. The documentary {{also featured}} interviews by both Giger and Tobler. In the 1972–1973 season, Tobler gained {{a part in}} the <b>play</b> <b>My</b> Woman, My Leader and had to travel all around Switzerland. Physically and mentally exhausted after 130 performances of the play, weary after the hectic schedule that required extensive touring around the country, and confused by her promiscuous erotic life, Tobler decided to take a leave of absence from the acting profession, as well as from her relationship with Giger. In 1974, she opted for leaving him and moving to San Francisco with her new American boyfriend. However, 30 days later, she returned to Zürich, claiming to be disappointed over the United States (as well as incapable of adapting to American lifestyle, according to Giger) and resuming her relationship with the painter.|$|E

500|$|According {{to one of}} Ruth's biographers, Jim Reisler, [...] "why Frazee needed cash in 1919—and large {{infusions of}} it quickly—is still, more than 80 years later, {{a bit of a}} mystery". The often-told story is that Frazee needed money to finance the musical No, No, Nanette, which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee {{financial}} security. That play did not open until 1925, however, by which time Frazee had sold the Red Sox. Still, the story may be true in essence: No, No, Nanette was based on a Frazee-produced <b>play,</b> <b>My</b> Lady Friends, which opened in 1919.|$|E
500|$|The nightly in-character guest {{interviews}} were initially {{of concern to}} Colbert, who worried his character's belligerent nature would be off-putting to guests. However, since the show's debut, {{he says he has}} found he is able to [...] "slide the intensity" [...] of his behavior depending on his interviewee's ability to respond to his aggressive approach. Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his favorite part of the show, because it allows him to improvise. Colbert advises his guests to disabuse the character of his ignorance. [...] "Don't let me get away with anything. Don't try to <b>play</b> <b>my</b> game. Be real. Be passionate. Hold your ideas. Give me resistance. Give me traction I can work against." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan moved from folk {{songwriter}} to folk-rock pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed [...] "Beatle boots". A London reporter wrote: [...] "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo." [...] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Appearing on the Les Crane television show and asked about a movie he planned, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, [...] "No, I <b>play</b> <b>my</b> mother." ...|$|E

500|$|My Worlds Acoustic is {{the first}} remix album by Canadian {{recording}} artist Justin Bieber. [...] It was released on November 26, 2010 and was initially sold exclusively at Walmart retail stores and Sam's Club.

500|$|Sean Connery {{turned down}} an offer to cameo as Henry Jones, Sr., as he found {{retirement}} too enjoyable. Lucas stated that in hindsight it was good that Connery did not briefly appear, as it would disappoint the audience when his character would not join the film's adventure. Ford joked, [...] "I'm old enough to <b>play</b> <b>my</b> own father in this one." [...] The film addresses Connery's absence by Indiana implying that both Henry, Sr. and Marcus Brody (played by Denholm Elliott in the previous films, who died in 1992) died before the film's events. Connery later stated that he liked the film, describing it as [...] "rather good and rather long." [...] Michael Sheard, who portrayed Adolf Hitler in the third film, expressed interest in appearing in the film, but he died in August 2005.|$|E
500|$|Pérez {{arrived in}} Kansas City amid {{widespread}} {{anger over the}} departure of fan-favorite Dye.

[...] Pérez finished out the 2001 season in Kansas City, batting [...]241 over 49 games. Pérez started at shortstop for the 2002 season but his batting average sank to [...]236, leading sportswriters to question whether the rarefied air at Coors Field had inflated Pérez's numbers. Pérez also may have sealed his fate by refusing to enter a late-season game at the request of manager Tony Peña. [...] At {{the end of the year}} the Royals were looking to move Pérez and his $4.1 million salary; he was eventually claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants and signed a two-year, $4.25 million contract.|$|E

500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to <b>play.</b> <b>My</b> only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E

Following this, he {{returned}} to Ireland, where he rejoined his old club St Patrick's Athletic on 23 December 2013. Commenting on his move back to Richmond Park, he said [...] "Both the fans and the club have always been great to me, and the stability of the club behind the scenes really made me want to come back and <b>play</b> <b>my</b> football in Inchicore again." [...] He made his third debut for the club in a 2–1 victory over Dundalk on 17 February 2014 in a Leinster Senior Cup match, scoring a free kick. On 2 March 2014, Fahey scored the only goal as St. Patrick's Athletic became the first team to win the FAI President's Cup, defeating Sligo Rovers in the process. His goal drew praise from Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill and from Sligo Rovers' Alan Keane, who stated [...] "A wonder goal won it, it was a great strike.

500|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, while {{continuing}} his violin studies, Monteux took up the viola. He studied privately with Benjamin Godard, with whom he performed in the premiere of Saint-Saëns's Septet, with the composer at the keyboard. Monteux joined the Geloso Quartet as violist; he played many concerts with them, including a performance of Fauré's Second Piano Quartet with the composer at the piano. On another occasion he was the violist in a private performance of a Brahms quartet given before the composer in Vienna. Monteux recalled Brahms's remark, [...] "It takes the French to <b>play</b> <b>my</b> music properly. The Germans all play it much too heavily." [...] Monteux remained {{a member of the}} Geloso Quartet until 1911. With Johannes Wolff and Joseph Hollman he also played chamber music for Grieg. Years later, in his seventies, Monteux deputised with the Budapest Quartet without rehearsal or score; asked by Erik Smith if he could write out the parts of the seventeen Beethoven quartets, he replied, [...] "You know, I cannot forget them." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Lewis told Tom Eames that Glassheart has a running theme about [...] "star-crossed lovers that can't be together", {{and so it was}} likely that this idea would feature on the tour. Lewis also cited William Shakespeare as another source of inspiration. She spent the three days of the final tour rehearsals at The Backstage Centre in Purfleet, Essex (UK). The Glassheart Tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one venues across Germany and the United Kingdom. The tour was expected to begin on 15 April in Berlin. The list had expanded from an initial sixteen to include five dates in Germany. Lewis would then proceed with UK dates beginning in Glasgow, including two dates at London's Royal Albert Hall before finishing on 18 May in Plymouth. Speaking about the tour, Lewis said [...] "I can't wait {{to get out there and}} <b>play</b> <b>my</b> new songs.

500|$|Hooker's vocal {{alternates}} between sung {{and spoken}} sections. [...] Commenting on Hooker's vocal sections, music historian Ted Gioia notes, [...] "The song has almost no melody. [...] Even less harmony. [...] In fact, {{it is hard}} to call it a song. [...] It's more like a bit of jive steam of consciousness in 4/4 time." [...] Some of the lyrics are borrowed from earlier songs that date {{back to the beginning of}} the blues. [...] The opening line [...] "My mama she didn't allow me to stay out all night long" [...] has origins in [...] "Mama Don't Allow", an old dance song. [...] Several songs were recorded in the 1920s with similar titles. [...] "Boogie No. 3" [...] by boogie-woogie pianist Cow Cow Davenport has sung and spoken sections and includes the lines, [...] "I don't care what Grandma don't allow, <b>play</b> <b>my</b> music anyhow, Grandma's don't 'llow no music playin' in here". Hooker's first and second takes of the song include similar verses and the narrative about Henry's Swing Club, but do not include the crucial mid-song hook [...] "Boogie, chillen'!" [...] before the guitar break, which gives the song its lyrical identity.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{after her}} {{marriage}} with Ajay Devgn, Kajol {{featured in a}} supporting role alongside him and Mahima Chaudhry in Prakash Jha's drama Dil Kya Kare. She played Nandita Rai, the other woman {{in the life of}} Anant Kishore, played by Devgn. In an interview with Filmfare she explained, [...] "The only reason, I agreed to <b>play</b> <b>my</b> character was because it had shades of grey. I would have probably refused the wife's role. Because I felt it had nothing for me to do." [...] Upon release, the film met with largely negative reviews. Critic Sharmila Taliculam, however, described Kajol as [...] "the only person who gives her role a semblance of sanity". Commercially too, the film failed to do well. However, her next release, Satish Kaushik's woman's film, the drama Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain, emerged as a critical and commercial success. Starring alongside Anil Kapoor, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare ceremony for her portrayal of Megha, the deceived wife of Kapoor's character. The film met with wide media coverage for being one of the few woman-centered films to emerge as a commercial success in India.|$|E
