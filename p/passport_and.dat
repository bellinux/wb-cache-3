In November 2010, Chopra entered into talks over acquiring an Indian passport in order to represent India in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.

In August 2014, Chopra stated {{that he wanted to}} play for India at international level, and was willing to renounce his British citizenship to do so.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{was born}} on 19 December 1906 in Kamenskoye, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (now Kamianske, Ukraine), to {{metalworker}} Ilya Yakovlevich Brezhnev and his wife, Natalia Denisovna Mazalova. His parents {{used to live in}} Brezhnevo (Kursky District, Kursk Oblast, Russia) before moving to Kamenskoe. Brezhnev's ethnicity was specified as Ukrainian in some documents, including his <b>passport,</b> <b>and</b> Russian in others. Like many youths in the years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he received a technical education, at first in land management where he started as a land surveyor and then in metallurgy. He graduated from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum in 1935 and became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industries of eastern Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his <b>passport,</b> <b>and</b> {{went back to the}} amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E

Internationally, Nix has represented England at youth level, playing for the U16, U18 and U20 teams, and semi-professional levels but holds an Australian <b>passport</b> <b>and</b> has expressed a desire to play for the latter country.|$|E

5|$|Passport Acquisition: Any time a Lebanese Identity Card holder applies for a passport, their Personal Identification Number (PIN) is {{captured}} on the <b>passport</b> <b>and</b> their personal information cross-checked {{with the existing}} data in the National Identification System. A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{may not be able}} to acquire a passport if they do not possess a Lebanese Identity Card. This is because only people who qualify to hold Lebanese Passports will be issued with one since the individual’s nationality can be properly checked from the National Identification System.|$|E

A driving licence is valid for almost every situation where non-electronic personal identification is needed even though they are not officially recognized as such.|$|E

5|$|After {{forfeiting}} {{his title}} as World Champion, Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic, disappearing from both competitive chess {{and the public}} eye. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the U.S. government, which sought income tax on Fischer's match winnings, and ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, he lived his life as an émigré. In 2004, {{he was arrested in}} Japan and held for several months for using a passport that had been revoked by the U.S. government. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic <b>passport</b> <b>and</b> citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live in Iceland until his death in 2008.|$|E

Citizens of Brazil and Turkey are instead granted a multiple entry visa valid for a maximum stay of 1 month and 3 months respectively. All visitors must hold a passport valid for 6 months beyond the period of intended stay and with two blank pages. An identity document is accepted in lieu of a passport for Jordanian citizens.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes {{during the}} Druze revolt, the authorities, {{with whom he}} always had a tense relationship, grew wary of his {{strength}} and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid. He was sent to Istanbul by sea and from there he was sent to serve a prison sentence at the Widin fortress on the Danube River. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the <b>passport</b> <b>and</b> a disguise, he and an Albanian inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached Salonica. From there, Aqil departed to Anatolia and then Aleppo. Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling.|$|E

5|$|Franz Stangl was a {{supervisor}} at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, part of Action T4, an early Nazi euthanasia programme that {{was responsible for}} the deaths of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany. In February 1942, he was commander at the Sobibor extermination camp and in August of the same year he was transferred to Treblinka. During his time at these camps, he oversaw the deaths of nearly 900,000 people. While in U.S. detention for two years, he remained unidentified as a war criminal because so few witnesses had survived Sobibor and Treblinka that authorities never realised who he was. He escaped while on a roadwork detail in Linz in May 1948. After he made his way to Rome, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross <b>passport</b> <b>and</b> a boat ticket to Syria. His family joined him there a year later and they emigrated to Brazil in 1951.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time {{at the request of}} explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian <b>passport</b> <b>and</b> financial security.|$|E
5|$|Josef Mengele was {{a medical}} officer {{assigned}} to Auschwitz concentration camp from 1943 {{until the end}} of the war. As well as making most of the selections of inmates as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country; he acquired a Red Cross <b>passport</b> <b>and</b> left for Argentina; he set up a business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to extradite Mengele in 1960, but he could not be found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979.|$|E
