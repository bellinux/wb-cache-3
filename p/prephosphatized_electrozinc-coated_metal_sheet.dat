40|$|Abstract: With {{the aims}} at {{determining}} the mechanical properties of Expanded <b>Metal</b> <b>Sheet</b> under seismic excitations, {{the research on}} Expanded <b>Metal</b> <b>Sheet</b> has been implementing at University of Liege. Firstly, the square and rectangular sheets worked in monotonic shear loading was thoroughly studied by E. Pecquet[1]. In his study, there are three approaches {{used to determine the}} mechanic behavior of expanded <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> monotonically loaded in shear, that is, analytical models, numerical simulations and experimental investigations were performed and compared simultaneously. Secondly, the same dimensions of the sheets will be studied under cyclic shear loading. In this research, non-linear numerical stimulations and experimental investigation will be used to determine the properties of expanded <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> under cyclic shear loads. The analytical models will be proposed with the aims at modeling the sheets in Reinforced Concrete Frames, the next step of this study. Numerical stimulations are implemented with FINELG, a non linear finite element code. Expanded <b>Metal</b> <b>Sheet</b> Experiments under reverse loading are to be carried out at Laboratory of University of Liege. Experimental Investigations will be compared with numerical stimulations to propose an analytical model, hysteric loop for this type of material under cyclic loading. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Both finite element simulation and experimental verification were carried out to investigate the deformation of blanks. Several significant process parameters, such as holding force, friction, counter pressure history, and blank dimensions, were discussed for improv-ing the formability of the two <b>metal</b> <b>sheets.</b> In SHF simulation, a virtual film technique was proposed to realistically approach the hydraulic loading condition during SHF. Finally, the deformed shape and thickness distribution of parts manufactured with SHF were com-pared {{with the results of}} simulation. Good agreements were obtained...|$|R
