40|$|The {{performance}} of multipole (MTP) and point charge (PC) force fields in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of condensed-phase systems for both equilibrium and dynamical quantities is compared. MTP electrostatics provides an improved {{description of the}} anisotropic electrostatic potential, which is especially important to describe key, challenging interactions, such as lone pairs, π-interactions, and hydrogen bonds. These chemical environments are probed {{by focusing on the}} hydration properties of two molecules: N-methylacetamide and <b>phenyl</b> <b>bromide.</b> Both, equilibrium and dynamical, quantities are affected by the quality of the electrostatic model. The alteration of the first solvation shell in MTP simulations is validated by comparing with lifetimes and correlation times of solute-solvent interactions from experiment. The improved dynamical behavior found in the MTP simulations—observed for molecules parametrized using very different protocols—suggests that a systematic improvement of both equilibrium and dynamical quantities when using MTP electrostatics is possible...|$|R
40|$|On-surface Pd- and Cu-catalyzed CC {{coupling}} reactions between <b>phenyl</b> <b>bromide</b> functionalized porphyrin derivatives on an Au(111) surface {{have been investigated}} under ultra-high vacuum conditions by using scanning tunneling microscopy and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We monitored the isothermal reaction kinetics by allowing the reaction to proceed at different temperatures. We discovered that the reactions catalyzed by Pd or Cu {{can be described as}} a two-phase process that involves an initial activation followed by CC bond formation. However, the distinctive reaction kinetics and the CC bond-formation yield associated with the two catalysts account for the different reaction mechanisms: the initial activation phase is the rate-limiting step for the Cu-catalyzed reaction at all temperatures tested, whereas the later phase of CC formation is the rate-limiting step for the Pd-catalyzed reaction at high temperature. Analysis of rate constants of the Pd-catalyzed reactions allowed us to determine its activation energy as (0. 41 +/- 0. 03) eV...|$|R
40|$|A small {{library of}} 2 -aminoarenethiolato-copper(I) (CuSAr) {{complexes}} was tested as (pre-) catalysts in the arylation reaction of phenols with aryl bromides. These copper(I) (pre-) catalysts are thermally stable, soluble in common organic solvents, and allow reactions of 6 h at 160 °C with low catalyst loadings of 2. 5 mol %. Among the (pre-) catalysts screened, 2 -[(dimethylamino) methyl]benzenethiolato-copper(I) (1 c) {{led to the}} best results and provided good to excellent yields of various substituted diaryl ethers. Mechanistic studies showed that at {{early stages of the}} C-O coupling reaction the CuSAr complex is converted into CuBr(PhSAr) via selective coupling of the monoanionic arenethiolato ligand with <b>phenyl</b> <b>bromide</b> with formation of CuBr. In addition, the first results are shown involving a multi-component reaction (MCR) protocol for the in situ synthesis of propargylamines and their subsequent conversion involving a C-O cross coupling reaction. Furthermore, two examples of sequential C-O/C-S and C-N/ C—S cross coupling reactions have been carried out on the same dihalo-pyridine substrate in a one-pot process with the same (CuSAr) (pre-) catalyst (overall yields 40 - 80 %) ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by McKenzie and his school that when {{optically}} active esters of alpha-keto-acids and a Grignard reagent (RgX) interact the diastereo-isomerides are produced in unequal amounts. The substituted glycollic acids, obtained by hydrolysis, were optically active, although not optically pure. The analogous reactions using optically active esters of gamma-, delta-, epsilon- [...] . keto-acids had virtually not been studied. In the present investigation the interaction of (-) -menthyl esters of o-acetyl fatty acids and <b>phenyl</b> magnesium <b>bromide</b> has been studied {{with a view to}} obtaining asymmetric synthesis and to relating this to the length of the chain intervening between the carbonyl and carbomenthoxy groups. The investigation has entailed the preparation of the above type of esters when n = 0, 2, 3, 4 and 8, and their treatment with <b>phenyl</b> magnesium <b>bromide.</b> The hydroxy-acids or (with n = 2 and 3) lactones, obtained after hydrolysis of the resulting esters, were opticallyactive, except in the case of n = 8. With n = 2 or 3, the degree of asymmetric synthesis was dependent on reaction conditions. The addition of a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group has previously been found to occur asymmetrically only when the carbonyl group is in a molecule containing, a "fixed centre of asymmetry". It has now been found that an asymmetric reaction occurs when an optically active organo-metallic compound adds to a ketone. This type of reaction has been studied using (-) -menthyl bromoacetate, acetophenone and zinc. The B -hydroxy acid obtained on hydrolysis was optically active. The extent of the asymmetric synthesis was found to be remarkably constant, irrespective of a wide variation in reaction conditions. Theories of asymmetric synthesis are discussed and a theory involving energy differences of two transition states is proposed as an explanation of the results obtained in this investigation. Hydroxy-V-phenyl-n-valeric acid (n = 2) has been prepared and resolved. <p...|$|R

40|$|Thin {{surfactant}} {{films have}} been formed by dip-coating glass slides in a solution of reversed micelles containing titanium isopropoxide. The alkoxide is slowly hydrolyzed {{in the presence of}} reversed micelles since hydrolysis competes with hydration of surfactant polar groups. Adhesion of the surfactant on the glass slide is assisted by incompletely hydrolyzed alkoxide through the following possible mechanism: the alkoxide adheres by-Si-O-Ti-bonds and the surfactant follows by hydrophobic attraction to the isopropyl groups. The films are transparent and visually uniform. Three surfactants, forming reversed micelles, have been investigated: one nonionic, Triton X- 100; one anionic, AOT; and one cationic, hexadecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride. The environment provided by the surfactant film has been studied by fluorescence probing. In particular, we have analyzed pyrene excimer formation as well as energy transfer between pyrene, acting as donor, and coumarin- 153 or N-n-heptyl- 4 -(((dimethylamino) <b>phenyl)</b> ethyl) -pyridinium <b>bromide,</b> acting as acceptor. In Triton and hexadecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride films, pyrene excimer formation is diffusion-controlled while in AOT films excimer largely comes from pyrene aggregation. Pyrene excimer formation capacity decreases in the presence of cosulubilized poly(vinyl methyl ether) chains. Energy transfer data indicate that coumarin- 153 is randomly distributed in the films, but N-n-heptyl- 4 -(((dimethylamino) <b>phenyl)</b> ethenyl) pyridinium <b>bromide</b> is not randomly distributed but shows a tendency to aggregate. Generally speaking, the benzyl-group-bearing surfactants form fluid structures while AOT may provide a restricted low dimensional environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tiger Milk {{mushroom}} is {{a unique}} mushroom that has number of medicinal properties. Communities in Malaysia have been using this mushroom to treat different kinds of cancer. This {{study was conducted to}} elucidate the antiproliferation activity of this national treasure mushroom on human colorectal cancer cells (HCT 116). Colon cancer cells were cultured in the presence of L. rhinocerotis for aqueous or methanol pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) at various concentrations for 24 hours. The percentage of cell viability was determined by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -di <b>phenyl</b> tetrazolium <b>bromide</b> (MTT) assay. Our results showed that methanol PLE of Lignosus rhinocerotis sclerotia was found to exhibit antiproliferative activity against HCT 116 cells, with an IC 50 of 600 µg/mL and 1200 µg/mL for aqueous PLE. In comparison, both extractions did not show significant cytotoxicity against normal human colon cell (CCD- 18 CO). The IC 50 values suggested that the solvent differences in pressurized liquid extraction greatly affected their antiproliferative activites. Additionally, weak antioxidant capacities were detected in both methanol and aqueous PLE of L. rhinocerotis by the FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) Assay. However, this capacity was not significant when the aqueous extract was tested in the presence of HCT 116 cells. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed that both methanol and aqueous pressurized liquid extraction of L. rhinocerotis contained alkaloids...|$|R
40|$|Although {{many studies}} have shown the {{antitumor}} properties of ginger extract (Zingiber officinale), little is known regarding the mechanism of its effects. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the mechanism of antitumor effects of ginger extract by evaluating apoptosis rate and cell cycle progression status in colon cancer cell lines HCT 116 and p 53 defective HT 29. HCT 116 and HT 29 cells were cultured in the presence of ginger extract at various concentrations for 24 h. The percentage of cell viability was determined by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -di <b>phenyl</b> tetrazolium <b>bromide</b> (MTT) assay. Our results showed that ginger extract inhibited proliferation of HCT 116 and HT 29 cells with an IC 50 of 496 ± 34. 2 µg/ml and 455 ± 18. 6 µg/ml, respectively. We also found that ginger extract at increasing concentrations induced apoptosis dose dependently in both colon cancer cells. Apoptosis rates were 11. 15, 35. 05 and 57. 49 % for HCT 116 and 4. 39, 19. 81 and 28. 09 % for HT 29 at 200, 500 and 800 µg/ml of ginger extract, respectively. Ginger extract arrested HCT 116 and HT 29 cells at G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phases with corresponding decreased in S-phase. This study suggests that ginger extract may exert its antitumor effects on colon cancer cells by suppressing its growth, arresting the G 0 /G 1 -phase, reducing DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Inhibitors of the aldo–keto reductase enzyme AKR 1 C 3 are of {{interest}} as potential drugs for leukemia and hormone-related cancers. A series of non-carboxylate morpholino(phenylpiperazin- 1 -yl) methanones were prepared by palladium-catalysed coupling of substituted <b>phenyl</b> or pyridyl <b>bromides</b> with the known morpholino(piperazin- 1 -yl) methanone, and shown to be potent (IC 50 ∼ 100 nM) and very isoform-selective inhibitors of AKR 1 C 3.

These structure–activity relationships are consistent with an X-ray structure of a representative compound bound in the AKR 1 C 3 active site, which showed H-bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of the drug and Tyr 55 and His 117 in the ‘oxyanion hole’ of the enzyme, with the piperazine bridging unit providing the correct twist to allow the terminal benzene ring to occupy the lipophilic pocket and align with Phe 311...|$|R
40|$|The photophysical {{behavior}} of the amphiphilic cationic hemicyanine dye N-n-heptyl- 4 -(((dimethylamino) <b>phenyl)</b> ethenyl) pyridinium <b>bromide</b> (H 7 HC) has been examined in various environments with the intention to assess its state of adsorption on a TiO 2 mesoporous film. In some solvents, such as short-chain alcohols or chloroform, the dye is dissolved as a monomer. In other solvents, like water and cyclohexane, it is found in concentration-dependent aggregate forms. H 7 HC monomer absorption and fluorescence spectra show a symmetric solvatochromic effect previously found for other amphiphilic hemicyanines (Fromherz, P. J. Phys. Chem., 1995, 99, 7188). Aggregates are of the H-type; i. e., they are formed by repulsive interaction and display a hypsochromic shift in their absorption spectra. When adsorbed on nanostructured mesoporous TiO 2 films, H 7 HC is found in aggregate form, which evolves {{in the course of}} time by displaying a hypsochromic shift in the absorption maximum.
