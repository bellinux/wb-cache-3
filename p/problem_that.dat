5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> is simpler to solve; {{the solutions to}} the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E

In April 2015 Wink experienced a security <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall.

Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} the recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E

5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
