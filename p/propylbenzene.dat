The reactivity of the aromatics gave an order of para-xylene > ortho-xylene > meta-xylene > toluene > ethylbenzene ≫ <b>propylbenzene.</b> Kinetic analysis revealed that the order of reaction in hydrogen was typically first order while the reaction order in toluene was zero order and negative half order for ethylbenzene. The reaction order for <b>propylbenzene</b> and the xylenes was negative first order. Apparent activation energies were calculated and all were in the range 26 – 46 kJ mol− 1. Competitive hydrogenation between toluene, ethylbenzene and <b>propylbenzene</b> revealed that the <b>propylbenzene</b> was the most strongly adsorbed aromatic {{in agreement with the}} strongly negative reaction order. The xylenes gave an order of reactivity of para > ortho > meta following the increasing negative reaction order. Reactions with deuterium revealed an inverse kinetic isotope effect, most likely related to the change in hybridization of the carbon from sp 2 to sp 3, for all reactions, except that of ortho-xylene. Rapid exchange of the methyl group hydrogens was observed with all the xylenes, whereas total exchange was noted with toluene. The generation of trans- 1, 2 -dimethylcyclohexane was explained by the formation of two intermediates, 1, 2 -dimethylcyclohexene and 1, 6 -dimethylcyclohexene, which give the cis- 1, 2 -dimethylcyclohexane and trans- 1, 2 -dimethylcyclohexane, respectively...|$|E

P. mendocina KR 1 grew only in the presence of heptane. All three P. putida strains were able to become established in a fluvisol soil from the Granada, Spain, area, whereas P. mendocina KR 1 did not survive in this soil. The tolerance to organic solvents of all three P. putida strains was therefore assayed in soil. The addition to soil of 10 % (vol/wt) heptane or 10 % (vol/wt) <b>propylbenzene</b> did not affect the survival of the three P. putida strains. However, the addition of 10 % (vol/wt) toluene led to an immediate decrease of several log units in the number of CFU per gram of soil for all of the strains, although P. putida F 1 and DOT-T 1 subsequently recovered. This recovery was influenced by the humidity of the soil and the incubation temperature.

40|$|Biotransformations of {{a series}} of ortho-, meta- and para-substituted {{ethylbenzene}} and <b>propylbenzene</b> substrates have been carried out, using Pseudomonas putida UV 4, a source of toluene dioxygenase (TDO). The ortho- and para-substituted alkylbenzene substrates yielded, exclusively, the corresponding enantiopure cis-dihydrodiols of the same absolute configuration. However, the meta isomers, generally, gave benzylic alcohol bioproducts, in addition to the cis-dihydrodiols (the meta effect). The benzylic alcohols were of identical (R) absolute configuration but enantiomeric excess values were variable. The similar (2 R) absolute configurations of the cis-dihydrodiols are consistent with both the ethyl and propyl groups having dominant stereodirecting effects over the other substituents. The model used earlier, to predict the regio- and stereo-chemistry of cis-dihydrodiol bioproducts derived from substituted benzene substrates has been refined, to take account of non-symmetric subsituents like ethyl or propyl groups.

The oxidation of benzene and phenyl radical has been found to proceed in a stepwise C 6 -C 5 -C 4 sequence. Species profiles obtained from flow-reactor experiments suggest that the oxidation of benzene and phenyl radical follows the generalized route via phenoxy, cyclopentadienyl and butadienyl radical. The oxidation of the C 4 species branches into multiple pathways that yield copious amounts of ethylene and acetylene.

The NR 1 / 2 B receptor subtype was several times more sensitive to these compounds than the NR 1 / 2 A subtype. The convulsant solvent flurothyl had no effect on NMDA responses in oocytes but potently inhibited ion flux through recombinant GABA receptors expressed in oocytes. Overall, these results suggest that abused solvents display pharmacological selectivity and that NR 1 / 2 B NMDA receptors may be an important target for the actions of these compounds on the brain...|$|E
40|$|The Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria-United Atom (TraPPE-UA) {{force field}} for {{hydrocarbons}} is extended to alkenes and alkylbenzenes by introducing the following pseudo-atoms: CH{sub 2 }(sp{sup 2 }), CH(sp{sup 2 }), CH(aro), R-C(aro) for {{the link to}} aliphatic side chains, and C(aro) for the link of two benzene rings. In this united-atom force field, the nonbonded interactions of the hydrocarbon pseudo-atoms are solely governed by Lennard-Jones 12 - 6 potentials, and the Lennard-Jones well depth and size parameters for the new pseudo-atoms were determined by fitting to the single-component vapor-liquid phase equilibria of a few selected model compounds. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the NVT version of the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to calculate the single-component vapor-liquid coexistence curves for ethene, propene, 1 -butene, trans- and cis- 2 -butene. 2 -methylpropene, 1, 5 -hexadiene, 1 -octene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, <b>propylbenzene,</b> isopropylbenzene, o-, m-, and p-xylene, and naphthalene. The phase diagrams for the binary mixtures of (supercritical) ethene/n-heptane and benzene/n-pentane were determined from simulations in the NpT Gibbs ensemble. Although the TraPPE-UA force field is rather simple and makes use of relatively few different pseudo-atoms, its performance, as judged by comparisons to other popular force fields and available experimental data, is very satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the chemistry involved during the combustion of components of diesel fuel, {{the structure of a}} laminar lean premixed methane flame doped with n-butylbenzene has been investigated. The inlet gases contained 7. 1 % (molar) of methane, 36. 8 % of oxygen and 0. 96 % of n-butylbenzene corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 0. 74 and a ratio C 10 H 14 / CH 4 of 13. 5 %. The flame has been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6. 7 kPa using argon as diluent, with a gas velocity at the burner of 49. 2 cm/s at 333 K. Quantified species included the usual methane C 0 -C 2 combustion products, but also 16 C 3 -C 5 hydrocarbons, 7 C 1 -C 3 oxygenated compounds, as well as 20 aromatic products, namely benzene, toluene, phenylacetylene, styrene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, allylbenzene, <b>propylbenzene,</b> cumene, methylstyrenes, butenylbenzenes, indene, indane, naphthalene, phenol, benzaldehyde, anisole, benzylalcohol, benzofuran, and isomers of C 10 H 10 (1 -methylindene, dihydronaphtalene, butadienylbenzene). A new mechanism for the oxidation of n-butylbenzene is proposed whose predictions are in satisfactory agreement with measured species profiles in flames and flow reactor experiments. The main reaction pathways of consumption of n butylbenzene have been derived from flow rate analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} structure of {{volatile organic compounds}} determines their oxidation pathway, directly impacting secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. This study comprehensively investigates the impact of {{molecular structure}} on SOA formation from the photooxidation of 12 different eight- to nine-carbon aromatic hydrocarbons under low-NO x conditions. The effects of the alkyl substitute number, location, carbon chain length and branching structure on the photooxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons are demonstrated by analyzing SOA yield, chemical composition and physical properties. Aromatic hydrocarbons, categorized into five groups, show a yield order of ortho (o -xylene and o -ethyltoluene) > one substitute (ethylbenzene, <b>propylbenzene</b> and isopropylbenzene) > meta (m -xylene and m -ethyltoluene) > three substitute (trimethylbenzenes) > para (p -xylene and p -ethyltoluene). SOA yields of aromatic hydrocarbon photooxidation do not monotonically decrease when increasing alkyl substitute number. The ortho position promotes SOA formation while the para position suppresses aromatic oxidation and SOA formation. Observed SOA chemical composition and volatility confirm that higher yield is associated with further oxidation. SOA chemical composition also suggests that aromatic oxidation increases with increasing alkyl substitute chain length and branching structure. Further, carbon dilution conjecture developed by Li et al.  (2016) is extended in this study {{to serve as a}} standard method {{to determine the extent of}} oxidation of an alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon...|$|E
40|$|Symptoms {{of sensory}} {{irritation}} (pungency) often {{contribute to the}} judgment that an indoor environment is unhealthy. We assessed the independent contribution of the trigeminal and olfactory nerves to the detection of airborne chemicals by measuring nasal detection thresholds in subjects clinically diagnosed as lacking a functional sense of smell (anosmics) and in matched normal controls (normosmics). Anosmics can only provide odor-unbiased pungency thresholds. Normosmics provided odor thresholds. The stimuli comprised homologous alkylbenzenes (from toluene to octylbenzene), and chlorobenzene, 1 -octene, and 1 -octyne. As seen before with homologous alcohols, acetates, and ketones, both types of threshold declined with increasing carbon chain length. Anosmics failed to detect alkylbenzenes above <b>propylbenzene.</b> The strong linear correlation between pungency thresholds and saturated vapor concentration for all tested compounds, as a whole, and the constancy of pungency thresholds expressed as % of vapor saturation, suggests that nasal pungency from these substances relies heavily on a broadly tuned physicochemical interaction with a susceptible biophase within the cell membrane. Through such a nonspecific mechanism, low, sub-threshold levels {{of a wide variety}} of volatile organic compounds of low reactivity — as found in many polluted indoor spaces — could add their sensory impact to precipitate noticeable sensory irritation...|$|E
40|$|Sphingobium sp. PNB, {{like other}} sphingomonads, has {{multiple}} ring-hydroxylating oxygenase (RHO) genes. Three different fosmid clones have been sequenced {{to identify the}} putative genes responsible for the degradation of various aromatics in this bacterial strain. Comparison of {{the map of the}} catabolic genes with that of different sphingomonads revealed a similar arrangement of gene clusters that harbors seven sets of RHO terminal components and a sole set of electron transport (ET) proteins. The presence of distinctly conserved amino acid residues in ferredoxin and in silico molecular docking analyses of ferredoxin with the well characterized terminal oxygenase components indicated the structural uniqueness of the ET component in sphingomonads. The predicted substrate specificities, derived from the phylogenetic relationship of each of the RHOs, were examined based on transformation of putative substrates and their structural homologs by the recombinant strains expressing each of the oxygenases and the sole set of available ET proteins. The RHO AhdA 1 bA 2 b was functionally characterized {{for the first time and}} was found to be capable of transforming ethylbenzene, <b>propylbenzene,</b> cumene, p-cymene and biphenyl, in addition to a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Overexpression of aromatic catabolic genes in strain PNB, revealed by real-time PCR analyses, is a way forward to understand the complex regulation of degradative genes in sphingomonads...|$|E
40|$|Solvent-tolerant {{microorganisms}} {{are useful}} in biotransformations with whole cells in two-phase solvent-water systems. The results presented here describe the effects that organic solvents have on the growth of these organisms. The maximal growth rate of Pseudomonas putida S 12, 0. 8 h− 1, was not affected by toluene in batch cultures, but in chemostat cultures the solvent decreased the maximal growth rate by nearly 50 %. Toluene, ethylbenzene, <b>propylbenzene,</b> xylene, hexane, and cyclohexane reduced the biomass yield, and this effect depended on the concentration of the solvent in the bacterial membrane and not on its chemical structure. The dose response to solvents in terms of yield was linear up to an approximately 200 mM concentration of solvent in the bacterial membrane, both in the wild type and in a mutant lacking an active efflux system for toluene. Above this critical concentration the yield of the wild type remained constant at 0. 2 g of protein/g of glucose with increasing concentrations of toluene. The reduction of the yield {{in the presence of}} solvents is due to a maintenance higher by a factor of three or four as well as to a decrease of the maximum growth yield by 33 %. Therefore, energy-consuming adaptation processes as well as the uncoupling effect of the solvents reduce the yield of the tolerant cells...|$|E
