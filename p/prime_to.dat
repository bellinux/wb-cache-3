Ironhide and Sunstreaker are given this task, but the Machination strikes and {{seemingly}} destroy Sunstreaker and Hunter. Ratchet realizes that Sunstreaker's corpse is a fake and that he and Hunter have simply been kidnapped. Megatron uses the Ore-13 {{to give him the}} rare ability of mass-displacement to transform into an earthen pistol, and decides to stay on Earth to escalate tensions, using a human facsimile to stir up a war between the United States and El Jira. The Autobots, with newly arrived allies, battle the Decepticons in the Russian breakaway state of Brasnya where the super-powered Megatron beats <b>Prime</b> <b>to</b> near death. Prime manages to recover and puts Megatron to flight. However, the facsimile Georgi Koska arrives dead at the Autobot base.|$|E

The Prius Prime features Toyota’s first carbon fiber rear hatch, which saves weight, while a dual-wave rear glass design helps cut drag.|$|E

The player joins them, only to watch Liberty Prime be destroyed by a devastating orbital strike. Taking out this new threat becomes the top priority. A short side-mission is arranged to equip the player with the powerful Tesla Cannon, after which they move on the Enclave's massive Mobile Crawler base, located outside of the Wasteland at Adams Air Force Base. After fighting through the base personnel, a control station at the top {{can be used to}} call an orbital strike on the base itself, destroying it. Alternatively, the Citadel can be destroyed, marking the player a traitor to the Brotherhood of Steel.|$|E

Shepard meets Garrus and Wrex, and rescues Tali, who possesses a recording of a conversation between Saren and asari Matriarch, Benezia. The two discuss their victory while also mentioning an artifact called the [...] "Conduit" [...] {{and the return of}} the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships believed to eradicate all organic civilization every 50,000 years.

500|$|The Metroid {{series has}} been noted and praised for its unique style of video game music. Hirokazu [...] "Hip" [...] Tanaka, {{composer}} of the original Metroid, has {{said he wanted to}} make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a [...] "living organism" [...] and had no distinction between music and sound effects. The only time the main Metroid theme was heard was after Mother Brain is defeated; this is intended to give the player a catharsis. At all other times, no melodies are present in the game. The composer of Super Metroid, Kenji Yamamoto, came up with some of the games' themes by humming them to himself while riding his motorcycle to work. He was asked to compose the music for Metroid <b>Prime</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the series continuity. Metroid Primes Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound was mixed by a member of Dolby. Developers from Retro Studios noted how the 6MB memory budget for all sound effects of a level in Metroid Prime was crucial in producing a quality soundtrack, as each sound had to be of very high quality to be included. Composer Kenji Yamamoto utilizes heavy drums, piano, voiced chants, clangs of pipes, and electric guitar. [...] took advantage of the increase in the amount of RAM that took place when the series switched from the GameCube to the Wii; this allowed for higher quality audio samples to be used and thus allowing a better overall audio quality. Kenji Yamamoto, who composed the music to Super Metroid and the Prime trilogy, copied the musical design of the original Metroid in [...] Metroid Prime 3, by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end, when uplifting music is played during the credits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The high {{incidence}} of stressor-related pathologies among stigmatized groups {{has been associated with}} experi-ences of discrimination. The present study demonstrated that following a mood priming manipulation (anger vs. sadness), an acute sex discrimination event influenced women’s (N= 61) salivary cortisol levels as well as systolic (SBP) and dia-stolic (DBP) blood pressure. Among women <b>primed</b> <b>to</b> feel sad, cortisol levels declined {{over the course of the}} experimen-tal session, likely reflecting a decline of arousal. However, among those <b>primed</b> <b>to</b> feel angry the cortisol levels were sus-tained over the session, especially if they perceived the possibility of rectifying their failed status (control). As well, SBP and DBP increased following the discrimination experience irrespective of perceived control. Among women <b>primed</b> <b>to</b> feel angry, feelings of hostility were associated with higher SBP and heart rate. Evidently, sex discrimination affects stress-reactive physiological systems among women, and might thus influence vulnerability to pathology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe CD 4 {{receptor}} synergizes {{with the}} T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) in helper T-cell activation. However CD 4 crosslinking {{in the absence}} of simultaneous TCR engagement leaves the cells <b>primed</b> <b>to</b> activation dependent apoptosis. To assess the role of the CD 4 associated protein tyrosine kinase p 56 lck in CD 4 <b>priming</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis we have constructed Jurkat T-cell lines stably transfected with a constitutively active form of p 56 lck. These cells were constitutively <b>primed</b> <b>to</b> undergo apoptosis upon TCR crosslinking with specific antibodies. In addition the Jurkat JCaM 1 line, which is defective for p 56 lck expression, was resistant to TCR induced apoptosis. These data indicate that p 56 lck is required for T-cell apoptosis and that CD 4 priming of T-cells for antigen dependent apoptosis is due to inappropriate or partial activation of the p 56 lck signal transduction pathway...|$|R

In an experimental simula-tion involving a situation of sex discrimination, women (N = 108) were <b>primed</b> <b>to</b> experience a particular emotion (sad, angry, control condition) and were subsequently instructed to either suppress or express (or neither) their emotional responses.

Furthermore, when encouraged to express their emo-tions, women <b>primed</b> <b>to</b> feel sad {{were more likely to}} endorse nor-mative actions to rectify the situation, whereas women induced to feel angry were more likely to endorse collective actions to change the status quo.
