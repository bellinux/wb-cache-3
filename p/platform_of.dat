Endara finished second, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos' 47%.|$|E

5|$|Both {{men were}} incarcerated in Landsberg Prison, where Hitler soon {{began work on}} his memoir, Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"), which he {{dictated}} to fellow prisoners Hess and Emil Maurice. Edited by publisher Max Amann, Hess and others, the work was published in two parts in 1925 and 1926. It was later released in a single volume, which became a best-seller after 1930. This book, with its message of violent antisemitism, became {{the foundation of the}} political <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped <b>{{platform}}</b> <b>of</b> the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. The deceased was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on his back with a southeast-northwest orientation. Most of the bones were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented {{it was evident that}} artificial craneal deformation had taken place. One of the upper canine teeth was fitted with pyrite decoration; the other canine had a crescent-shaped hollow that had once held its decoration. The deceased had several items of shell jewellery.|$|E

5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E
5|$|Devolution {{continued}} {{to be part of}} the <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Party which, in May 1997, took power under Tony Blair. In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Four {{decades after}} its construction, Union Station was proving {{too small for}} its role as the {{principal}} railroad hub of Berkshire County. In 1908 local residents began agitating for a larger station, and William H. MacInnis made it a <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> his mayoral candidacy. In 1910 MacInnis appointed a three-man committee (one {{a director of the}} B) to lobby the railroad authorities to replace Union Station. Financial constraints at first hampered their efforts. but in April 1912 the B agreed to support the project. In 1913, the NYNH acquired the former Burbank Hotel property and began constructing the second Union Station.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated {{his seat}} in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, {{but this was not}} to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Frank Oliver, who had {{represented}} Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888, {{resigned to}} pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing by-election. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who, like Rutherford, ran as an independent. Rutherford campaigned on a <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied geopolitics under Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which later became one of the pillars of Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP) ideology. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July 1920, and was at Hitler's side on 8 November 1923 for the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed Nazi attempt to seize control of the government of Bavaria. Whilst serving time in jail for this attempted coup, Hess helped Hitler write his book, Mein Kampf, which became a foundation of the political <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> the NSDAP.|$|E
