5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. He <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of those who escaped unharmed were workers {{in the front of}} the building who left through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke. Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got out through a loading bay. The bay was initially blocked by a tractor-trailer, but three workers went into the rear of the truck and <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle. Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Hudson and {{two other}} Sisters of her congregation, Carol Gilbert, O.P., and Ardeth Platte, O.P., entered Peterson Air Force Base without {{authorization}} and sprinkled blood on a fighter plane. The trio was caught and arrested. They were then held in a federal prison until the charges were dropped {{because there was no}} lasting damage was done to the airplane. Gilbert claimed that the base was part of the [...] "Star Wars" [...] defense system and the government did not want to draw unnecessary attention to the area. In 2002, the same group of nuns gained access to a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. Wearing white hazmat suits emblazoned with [...] "Citizen Weapon Inspection Team," [...] they <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> missile, drew a cross in their own blood and prayed for peace. At their pre-trial hearing, the Sisters, dressed in their religious habit, engaged in silent protest by only answering the judge with a nod. When their trial came about, the presiding judge, Robert E. Blackburn, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor preventing the Sisters from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. The group was sentenced to between 31 and 40 months for obstructing national defense and damaging government property. The sister's appeal was rejected in 2005 by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them." ...|$|E
