Anderson of Slate wrote that [...] "Title" [...] perpetuated a {{retrograde}} belief about relationships and deemed Trainor a poor role model, and opined, [...] "Once again she is sending the message that a woman's worth is defined by men". Sean Michaels of The Guardian highlighted the lyrics, [...] "You gotta treat me like a trophy / <b>Put</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shelf / You gotta show me off," [...] as controversial.|$|E

Gholston did not even see himself as a football player {{when he was in}} high school, yet he has gone on to become an Ohio State Buckeyes football defensive end, the 2007 Big Ten Conference Defensive lineman of the year and the sixth overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods and I was going to my next class. ...He thought I was actually somebody’s father walking down the hall. He asked me whom was I looking for.

500|$|... 2006: In an {{interview}} with ESPN in January, after the Packers had finished with a 4-12 record, Favre admitted {{that if he had}} to make a decision right away he would not come back. He went on to say [...] "There's other days, I go, 'What if it's crunch time, two minutes left, do you want the ball?' I don't know if I do." [...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it. It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot." [...] Asked if he was indeed going to retire, Favre responded [...] "We'll see. We'll see. I don't want to say anything right now." [...] After the game, a Packers teammate said that Favre was just as emotional in a speech after the Seattle Seahawks game in 2005 at Lambeau Field when he was all but certain he was going to retire.|$|E
500|$|After {{some months}} in London, Lambert was visited by Józef Boruwłaski, a [...] dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural Pokuttya, Boruwłaski was {{generally}} considered to be the last of Europe's court dwarfs. [...] He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. [...] Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked [...] "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied [...] "No, she is dead, and I am not very sorry, for when I affront her, she <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantle-shelf for punishment." ...|$|E

The deal {{required}} ABC studios to either develop a project starring her or cast her in an existing show for the 2015 network television season. For quite some time, the casting executive at ABC, Keli Lee, had been trying to convince Chopra to do television in the United States, something that Chopra was not sure of. However, when Chopra was first considering the possibility of doing a television series in America, Lee learned that another studio was also trying to sign her, to which she reacted by saying, [...] "No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India." [...] Later, Lee traveled to India and was finally able to convince her to accept the offer. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Chopra revealed the only condition she put forward to Lee for doing a show was that she wanted them to find her a series that would put her in the same position that she currently enjoyed in India. She said [...] "There were TV shows and movies that were offered [...] before this one as well. But I wanted a part that <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same platform as [...] India.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{describes}} the protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies {{in which she}} would like to engage, asking her lover playfully to [...] "touch her body". Though the song features sexually oriented lyrics, critics deemed that the melody and playful tone of the song made them less explicit. The song's lyrics find Carey maintaining the duo keep the relationship private from the media, as she threatens to [...] "hunt him down" [...] if he shall record anything of their private life. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, [...] "Touch My Body" [...] is a [...] "questionably sexy striptease: a goofy-sleazy tryst vignette", with Carey singing [...] "If there's a camera up in here then I best not catch this flick on YouTube." [...] Critic Rodman felt the song's lyrics describe the protagonist's sexual fantasies, but also serves as a warning to [...] "potential touchers: 'If you run your mouth and brag about our secret rendezvous / I will hunt you down.' Yikes!" [...] In an interview with Fox News, journalist Hollie McKay asked Carey if there was any literal interpretation regarding the lyrics [...] "Touch My Body / <b>Put</b> <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Floor / Wrestle Me Around / Play With Me Some More", to which she replied [...] "There is no full-blown meaning; it is just cute and it's one of those songs that makes me happy. I wasn't taking it that seriously. It was just fun experience." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote that in the song [...] "Mariah coos soft-core phone sex fantasies over plinked piano notes, all while referencing YouTube in {{what appears to be a}} desperate grab for relevance."

2500|$|After {{moving back}} to California, Emery pursued {{a career as a}} film {{producer}} and editor in comedy-related films and TV shows. In 2005, he gained national attention as the editor of The Aristocrats, a documentary about the eponymous dirty joke as told by various comedians. In an interview, he said of the film [...] "he imagery and descriptions that appear in the film are far beyond offensive by conventional standards but not for the sake of shocking the viewer, but to entertain the entertainer. That is one very important point that The Aristocrats makes." [...] His friend Paul Provenza, who directed the movie, praised Emery's editing work, crediting it with shaping the style and shape of the film. Emery in turn said in an interview [...] "The Aristocrats was the film that <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> map, so it holds a very special place in my heart.
