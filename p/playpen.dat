25|$|In September 1997, Harkes {{prepared}} for the 1998 World Cup with an ill-advised trip to California that ultimately defined his legacy. In 2010, it was finally revealed by Eric Wynalda that former US national team manager Steve Sampson had cut Harkes from the 1998 World Cup team only two {{months prior to the}} tournament because Harkes had been sleeping with teammate Eric's wife, Amy, in the couple's house, and near the <b>playpen</b> of their young child. Sampson became aware of the scandal and brewing feud between Wynalda and Harkes, and chose to cut Harkes to restore locker room accord. Despite intense criticism from the media and subsequent failure in the World Cup, Sampson remained silent regarding the true reason for Harkes' dismissal from the team out of respect for the privacy of those involved. Harkes himself would publish an autobiography in 1999 panning Sampson's tenure as manager, but made no mention of the affair.|$|E

For both philosophical and economic reasons, work was viewed as an essential component of education. By 1920, the woodworking class had grown into a business producing small household items such as trellises, <b>playpens,</b> potty chairs, ladders and ironing boards. Furniture was a natural extension of the product line, and by the early 1960s, production focused on simple furniture.|$|R

40|$|Our aim is {{to explain}} a way to {{construct}} categories of games by combining 2 -dimensional structures called <b>playpens.</b> We use a running example of a category of games based on digraphs. We explain some basic properties of digraphs, including a construction of a tensor product on this category {{by means of a}} promonoidal structure on the category consisting of a parallel pair of maps. We describe a corefiective subcategory of the category of digraphs which is naturally thought of as a category of trees. To motivate the 2 -dimensional structures we shall use, we introduce the concept of unwiring. This formalises the idea of a structure whose elements can be decomposed over the shapes provided by a monad. We show that this construction picks out a well-behaved class of exponentiable objects, and allows the lifting of exponentiation functors to categories of algebras. We explore the details of the special case of this construction for free multicategory monads. Examining what happens for the free fc-mulicategory monad leads to the introduction of <b>playpens.</b> We explore simple constructions and examples of <b>playpens,</b> and show how these may be used to produce an fc-multicategory of games based on digraphs. We outline the theory of represent ability for fc-multicategories, and we demonstrate that the fc-multicategory we've produced underlies a strict double category, whose horizontal part is a standard category of games. We explore a link between this construction and slicing in fc-multicategories. We explain how to modify the construction so far to produce categories with different conventions for play, with different notions of strategy, and with different combinatorial notions of game (including trees of the kind mentioned earlier). By means of these examples, we hope to indicate the variety of potential further extensions of our construction. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The Developmental Study {{is part of}} {{a larger}} {{intervention}} on “saving of lives from drowning (SoLiD) ” where children were enrolled either into crèches (daycare centers) or <b>playpens</b> to prevent drowning in rural Bangladesh. Sampling ~ 1000 children between the ages of 9 – 17 months, we compared problem-solving, communication, motor and personal-social outcomes assessed by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire in the two interventions. After controlling for variables such as home stimulation in multivariate regressions, children in crèches performed about a quarter of a standard deviation better in total scores (p < 0. 10) and 0. 45 standard deviations higher in fine motor skills (p < 0. 05). Moreover, once the sample was stratified by length of exposure to the intervention, then children in crèches performed significantly better in a number of domains: those enrolled the longest (about 5 months) have higher fine motor (1. 47, p < 0. 01), gross motor (0. 40, p < 0. 05) and personal-social skills (0. 95, p < 0. 01) than children in <b>playpens.</b> In addition, children in crèches with the longer exposure (about 5 months) have significantly higher personal-social and problem-solving scores than those in crèches with minimum exposure.

40|$|AbstractSoil-transmitted helminthes {{infections are}} caused by {{different}} species of parasitic worms. They are transmitted by eggs or larvae present in dog faeces, which contaminate the soil. The presence of infective parasitic elements in the environment represents an important way of transmission of intestinally nematodes from dog to human and other animals. They can become infected by accidental ingestion of the infective elements or cutaneous contact with contaminated soil. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the possibility of contamination with canine intestinal worms of the soil from different parks in Bucharest and a dog's shelter outside of town. A total of 45 soil samples were collected from 4 dog <b>playpens</b> (from which 3 fenced and 1 unfenced), 4 playgrounds and one shelter dogs. Helminthes eggs were found in 22. 22 % of the soil samples. Positive samples for at least one parasite have found in 1 (the unfenced once), 4 <b>playpens,</b> 3 / 4 playground and 1 / 1 shelter dogs. The most frequently parasites species found in the examinated soil samples were Toxocara spp. (17. 17 %), followed by Trichuris spp. (8. 88 %), Strongyloides spp. and Toxascaris spp., each one with 4. 44 %. 8. 88 % had only one kind of eggs, and two parasites mixt were found in 13. 33 %.
