40|$|As can {{be shown}} by the rapid {{development}} of scientific subjects like microtechnology and nanotechnology, there is a continuous tendency in microstructuring advanced materials. In most cases, the detailed structurization of <b>powdery</b> <b>solids</b> (like precursors for ceramic components or additives for plastics and elastomers) can be advantageously performed {{on the level of}} individual particles. The core-shell or microcapsules structure is an example for microstructures at particle dimensions having multiple application potentials. The coating of an original particle (core) by a shell-forming compound results in a partial or complete masking or modifying of the primary chemical, physical or sensoric properties of the core material by those of the shell material. It is of highest priority that the resulting microcapsule exhibits the properties of both core and shell materials, either permanently or time-delayed. The studies presented here aim at inorganic core-shell s ystems suitable as functional filling agents, pigments or powdery ceramic precursors for innovative material applications. The most interesting substances taken into consideration as inorganic coating materials are sparingly soluble or insoluble metal oxides and metal carbonates that can be transformed into oxides by successive calcination steps...|$|E
40|$|Supramolecular {{self-assembly}} of {{soft matter}} have received many attention for various {{applications such as}} liquid crystals, sensors, catalysts, and optics due to its precise control and easily tunable characteristics. Particularly, benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxamides (BTAs) as p- stacked organic motif were recognized for formation of liquid crystals materials; however, these BTAs were only reported bearing different short alkyl or aromatic side chains {{in order to have}} liquid crystalline properties. Herein, self-assemblies of BTAs (CRNH-BTA, where R = 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18) via hydrogen bonding interactions have been demonstrated as mesophase liquid crystalline materials by simply tuning its long hydrophobic alkyl chains attached to amide. Series of BTAs were synthesized by a Schotten-Baumann reaction using 1, 3, 5 -benzenetricarbonyl trichloride with respected alkyl amides in the presence of triethylamine in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) under an inert condition for overnight. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass (MALDI-TOF-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) have proved the successful isolation of the hydrophobic BTAs using column chromatography as <b>powdery</b> <b>solids.</b> Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements showed self-assembled aggregation of a tape-like morphology with different aspect to ratio lengths corresponding to different alkyl side-chains lengths. Likewise, FT–IR spectra showed vibration bands at 1540 and 1719 cm- 1 due to formation of N-H and C=O bondings, respectively, corresponding to the presence of hydrogen bonding interactions for all BTAs. Moreover, polarized optical microscopy (POM) showed spehrulitic-like texture upon isotropic melts at 140 ºC monitored for 20 hours of C 12 NH-BTA, strongly supports the characteristics of discotic liquid crystals for BTAs. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms showed that longer alkyl side-chains shortened mesophase ranges due to the presence of higher steric hindrance of the alkyl amide chains...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{composites}} in aircraft structures {{is often}} limited by material and manufacturing costs which, for some designs and applications, are prohibitively high. To increase {{the frequency of}} application of composites in primary airframe components alternative manufacturing processes are sought that reduce cost and/or enhance structural efficiency. One alternative process {{involves the use of}} THERM-Xsm as the pressure transfer medium during autoclave curing. THERM-Xsm, a silicon-based flow able polymer which behaves like a liquid under autoclave presssure, transmits quasi-hydrostatic pressure to all contacting surfaces of the part to be cured. Once the autoclave pressure is relieved, THERM-Xsm reverts back to the <b>powdery</b> <b>solid</b> state and can be reused many times. The THERM-Xsm process to be evaluated is depicted and consists of (1) enclosing the tool and part to be cured by a set of frames that create a box, (2) pouring THERM-Xsm powder onto the part and filling the box, and (3) placing a vacuum bag over the box assembly. In this program, a separating non-porous film (Teflon) was placed between the part to be cured and THERM-Xsm powder to avoid any contamination. The use of THERM-Xsm has two significant advantages over conventional manufacturing procedures. First, it eliminates complicated hard tooling since it guarantees uniform pressure transfer and thus, good compaction at complex structural details (such as frame-stiffener intersections and corners). Second, it greatly simplifies vacuum bagging, since once the part to be cured is covered by THERM-Xsm powder, the vacuum bag need only conform to a relatively flat shape reducing significantly the number of pleats required. A program is on-going at Sikorsky Aircraft to evaluate the structural performance of complex composite fuselage structures made with this THERM-Xsm process and to quantify the impact of THERM-Xsm on manufacturing labor hours and cost. The program involves fuselage panel optimization analysis, a building block test program where structural details representative of the full-scale article are analyzed and tested, and static and fatigue test/analysis of the full-scale test articles. The main results of this program are reported...|$|R

Weeks ### Abstract SHAPE (selective 2 ’-hydroxyl {{acylation}} {{analyzed by}} primer extension) chemistry {{is a powerful}} approach for single-nucleotide resolution analysis of RNA secondary and tertiary structure. SHAPE uses hydroxyl-selective electrophiles to react with and form covalent adducts at the ribose 2 ’-hydroxyl group. The most useful and robust reagent for routine SHAPE experiments is 1 -methyl- 7 -nitroisatoic anhydride (1 M 7). This protocol describes a straightforward synthesis of 1 M 7 from commercially available precursors. The synthesis of 1 -methyl- 7 -nitroisatoic anhydride was originally described by Mortimer et al.. The reaction scheme is: ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") *Amounts of each starting material can be varied using the above Table*. ### Reagents 1. 4 -nitroisatoic anhydride (4 NIA) (AstaTech, cat. no. 69441) - Sodium hydride (NaH) – 60 % dispersion in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 452912) - Methyl iodide (MeI) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 289566) - Anhydrous dimethylfluoride (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 227056) - HCl (Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

40|$|FIR {{spectroscopy}} is {{an alternative}} way of collecting spectra of many inorganic pigments and corrosion products found on art objects, which is not normally observed in the MIR region. Most FIR spectra are traditionally collected in transmission mode but as a real novelty it is now also possible to record FIR spectra in ATR (Attenuated Total Reflectance) mode. In FIR transmission we employ polyethylene (PE) for preparation of pellets by embedding the sample in PE. Unfortunately, the preparation requires heating of the PE in order to produces at transparent pellet. This will affect compounds with low melting points, especially those with structurally incorporated water. Another option in FIR transmission {{is the use of}} thin films. We test the use of polyethylene thin film (PETF), both commercial and laboratory-made PETF. ATR collection of samples is possible in both the MIR and FIR region on <b>solid,</b> <b>powdery</b> or liquid samples. Changing from the MIR to the FIR region is easy as it simply requires the change of detector and beamsplitter (which can be performed within a few minutes). No preparation of the sample is necessary, which is a huge advantage over the PE transmission method. The most obvious difference, when comparing transmission with ATR, is the distortion of band shape (which appears asymmetrical in the lower wavenumber region) and intensity differences. However, the biggest difference can be the shift of strong absorbing bands moving to lower wavenumbers in ATR mode. The sometimes huge band shift necessitates the collection of standard library spectra in both FIR transmission and ATR modes, provided these two methods of collecting are to be employed for analyses of unknown samples. Standard samples of 150 pigment and corrosion compounds are thus collected in both FIR transmission and ATR mode in order to build up a digital library of spectra for comparison with unknown samples. XRD, XRF and Raman spectroscopy assists us in confirming the purity or impurity of our standard samples. 24 didactic test tables, with known pigment and binder painted on the surface of a limestone tablet, are used for testing the established library and different ways of collecting in ATR and transmission mode. In ATR, micro samples are scratched from the surface and examined in both the MIR and FIR region. Additionally, direct surface contact of the didactic tablets with the ATR crystal are tested together with water enhanced surface contact. In FIR transmission we compare the powder from our test tablet on the laboratory PETF and embedded in PE. We also compare the PE pellets collected using a 4 x beam condenser, focusing the IR beam area from 8 mm to 2 mm. A few samples collected from a mural painting in a Nepalese temple, corrosion products collected from archaeological Chinese bronze objects and samples from a mural paintings in an Italian abbey, are examined by ATR or transmission spectroscopy...|$|R
