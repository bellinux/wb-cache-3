Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal <b>pupil</b> <b>size,</b> is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E

In 30 pain free TMD patients, we found a highly significant, positive correlation between left-right differences in EMG and <b>pupils</b> <b>size.</b> The asymmetry in the <b>pupils</b> <b>size</b> was likely induced by the asymmetric sensorimotor signals arising from the oro-facial region, as the pupils asymmetry decreased significantly after application of a cusp bite. Moreover, cusp bite wearing bilaterally increased the mydriasis induced by performing haptic tasks. Finally, unbalancing the occlusion by a precontact increased {{the diameter of the}} ipsilateral pupil and abolished the mydriasis induced by haptic tasks. In conclusion, trigeminal sensorimotor signals may exert a tonic control on autonomic structures regulating the <b>pupils</b> <b>size</b> at rest and during haptic tasks. Since task-associated mydriasis is correlated with task performance and is strictly proportional to the phasic release of noradrenaline at cerebral cortical level, present findings suggest that unbalanced trigeminal activity influences brain processes not directly related to the orofacial region...|$|R

50|$|These {{results suggest}} that {{understanding}} other's feelings and emotions is driven not by cognitive deduction of what the stimuli means but by automatic activation of somatosensory neurons. A recent study on <b>pupil</b> <b>size</b> directly demonstrated emotion perception was automatic process modulated by mirror systems. When people saw sad faces, pupil sizes influenced viewers in perceiving and judging emotional states without explicit awareness of differences of <b>pupil</b> <b>size.</b> When <b>pupil</b> <b>size</b> was 180% of original size, people perceived a sad face as less negative and less intense than when pupil was smaller {{than or equal to}} original <b>pupil</b> <b>size.</b> This mechanism was correlated with brain regions that implicated in emotion process, the amygdala. Furthermore, viewers mimic the size of their own pupils to those of sad faces they watched. Considering that <b>pupil</b> <b>size</b> is beyond voluntary control, the change of <b>pupil</b> <b>size</b> upon emotion judgment is a good indication that understanding emotions is automatic process.

40|$|Determining {{the pupil}} center is {{fundamental}} for calculating eye orientation in video-based systems. Existing techniques are error prone and not robust because eyelids, eyelashes, corneal reflections or shadows {{in many instances}} occlude the pupil. We have developed a new algorithm which utilizes curvature characteristics of the pupil boundary to eliminate these artifacts. Pupil center is computed based solely on points related to the pupil boundary. For each boundary point, a curvature value is computed. Occlusion of the boundary induces characteristic peaks in the curvature function. Curvature values for normal <b>pupil</b> <b>sizes</b> were determined and a threshold was found which together with heuristics discriminated normal from abnormal curvature.

40|$|The eye is {{an optical}} {{instrument}} that projects {{scenes of the}} visual world onto the retina. It {{has been known for}} many years that the eye is far from being a perfect optical system, in particular for large pupil diam-eters. Refractive anomalies (defocus or astigmatism) occur frequently in the eye. In Western countries, myopia affects approximately 30 % of the population, although its prevalence is much higher (> 80 %) in certain Asian societies. 1 However, the eye suffers also from other optical imper-fections (called high-order aberrations), which are not typically measured in the clinic and cannot be corrected by conventional means. Like defo-cus, optical aberrations blur the retinal image, reducing image contrast and limiting the range of spatial frequencies available to further stages of the visual processing. The contribution of aberrations to optical degrada-tion is typically smaller than is that of defocus or astigmatism. The blur-ring effect of aberrations becomes more noticeable for large pupils.
