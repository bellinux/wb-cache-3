5|$|Irish <b>phonology</b> {{has been}} studied as a {{discipline}} since the late 19th century, with numerous researchers publishing descriptive accounts of dialects from all regions where the language is spoken.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{automatic}} phonetic comparison will only return true results if the languages in question have similar and comparably lenient <b>phonologies.</b> In {{the situation where}} their <b>phonologies</b> are incompatible and / or restrictive, linguistic knowledge of both of them is necessary to obtain results matching human perception. Whilst the case is mainly exemplified by Levenshtein distance and Russian loanwords in Dolgan, the conclusion is also applicable to the approach as a whole...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} <b>phonologies</b> of Gamāle, Sheram and Ghusbāng, three closely related {{southern}} varieties of Khām. The vowel and consonant inventories, suprasegmentals and phonotactics of each variety {{is described in}} turn, after which the <b>phonologies</b> are compared. The comparison identifies the front rounded vowels /y/ and /ø/ in Sheram and Ghusbāng as being linked to the Gamāle labial-palatal approximants, and also suggests {{that the loss of}} the syllable-final glottal in breathy voiced verbs is the origin of the pitch contour present in Takāle breathy voiced lengthened verbs...|$|R

5|$|The <b>phonology</b> of the Irish {{language}} {{varies from}} dialect to dialect; {{there is no}} standard pronunciation of Irish.

5|$|When asked, many signers in the South gave anecdotal {{accounts}} {{of differences between}} the signing of Black and White signers.

Among these accounts were claims that Black signers had a larger signing space and used more two-handed signs. Investigation into these anecdotes has found correlations.|$|E
5|$|German dialects, {{traditional}} local varieties {{traced back}} to the Germanic tribes, are distinguished from varieties of standard German by their lexicon, <b>phonology,</b> and syntax. It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three working languages of the European Commission. German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek, from which he probably took {{the idea of the}} diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in certain situations such as literature. Also the <b>phonology</b> of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, but this is not easily recognised.|$|E

5|$|Like Icelandic and Faroese, the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and <b>phonology,</b> although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its <b>phonology,</b> syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E

5|$|The dialects of Jèrriais {{differ in}} <b>phonology</b> and, {{to a lesser}} extent, lexis between parishes, with the most marked {{differences}} to be heard between those {{of the west and}} east. Many place names are in Jèrriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. Anglicisation of the place names increased apace with the migration of English people to the island.|$|E
5|$|The vocabulary, however, {{is mostly}} Chinese, based on Guiliu and the Tuguai variant of Pinghua. Out of the 2,000 most {{commonly}} used E words, only about 200 are of Tai-Kadai origin. E also inherits elements of these Chinese dialects' <b>phonology</b> and compound word formation. E morphology is primarily analytic, with concepts such as negation expressed with auxiliary words (pat6, m2) and no pronominal agreement.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in <b>phonology.</b> The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
50|$|The Ramu-Lower Sepik {{also known}} as Lower Sepik-Ramu {{languages}} are a proposed family of 35 Papuan languages spoken in the Ramu and Sepik river basins of northern Papua New Guinea.
