25|$|Measurements of {{the energy}} and arrival {{directions}} of the ultra-high energy <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 {{by members of the}} Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter {{on the grounds of the}} Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the energy spectrum of the <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> is now known to extend beyond 1020eV. A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe.|$|E

25|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> {{primarily}} {{originate from}} outside the Solar system and sometimes even the Milky Way. When they interact with Earth's atmosphere, they are converted to secondary particles. The mass ratio of helium to hydrogen nuclei, 28%, {{is similar to the}} primordial elemental abundance ratio of these elements, 24%. The remaining fraction is made up of the other heavier nuclei that are typical nucleosynthesis end products, primarily lithium, beryllium, and boron. These nuclei appear in cosmic rays in much greater abundance (~1%) than in the solar atmosphere, where they are only about 10−11 as abundant as helium. Cosmic rays made up of charged nuclei heavier than helium are called HZE ions. Due to the high charge and heavy nature of HZE ions, their contribution to an astronaut's radiation dose in space is significant even though they are relatively scarce.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic {{rays are}} high-energy radiation, mainly {{originating}} outside the Solar System {{and even from}} distant galaxies. Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface. Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin. Data from the Fermi Space Telescope (2013) found that the intensity is, in fact, greater from the west, proving that most primaries are positive. During the years from 1930 to 1945, {{a wide variety of}} investigations confirmed that the <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> are mostly protons, and the secondary radiation produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons, photons and muons. In 1948, observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to {{near the top of the}} atmosphere showed that approximately 10% of the primaries are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and 1% are heavier nuclei of the elements such as carbon, iron, and lead.|$|E
500|$|Supernovae may expel much, if not all, of the {{material}} away from a star, at velocities up to [...] or 10% {{of the speed of}} light. This drives an expanding and fast-moving shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, and in turn, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust, which is observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae create, fuse and eject the bulk of the chemical elements produced by nucleosynthesis. Supernovae {{play a significant role in}} enriching the interstellar medium with the heavier atomic mass chemical elements. Furthermore, the expanding shock waves from supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars. Supernova remnants are expected to accelerate a large fraction of galactic <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays,</b> but direct evidence for cosmic ray production was found only in a few of them so far.

40|$|Recently an {{essential}} progress in development of physical models for <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> induced ionization {{in the atmosphere}} is achieved. Basically, the models are full target, i. e. based on Monte Carlo simulation of an electromagnetic-muon-nucleon cascade in the atmosphere. In general, the contribution of proton nuclei in those models is highlighted, i. e. <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> α-particles and heavy nuclei are neglected or scaled to protons. The development of <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> induced atmospheric cascade is sensitive to the energy and mass of the <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> particle. The largest uncertainties in Monte Carlo simulations of a cascade in the Earth atmosphere are due to assumed hadron interaction models, the so-called hadron generators. In the work presented here we compare the ionization yield functions Y for <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> nuclei, such as protons, α-particles, Oxygen and Iron nuclei, assuming different hadron interaction models. The computations are fulfilled with the CORSIKA 6. 9 code using GHEISHA 2002, FLUKA 2011, UrQMD hadron generators for energy below 80 GeV/nucleon and QGSJET II for energy above 80 GeV/nucleon. The observed difference between hadron generators is widely discussed. The influence of different atmospheric parametrizations, namely US standard atmosphere, US standard atmosphere winter and summer profiles on ion production rate is studied. Assuming realistic <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> mass composition, the ion production rate is obtained at several rigidity cut-offs - from 1 GV (high latitudes) to 15 GV (equatorial latitudes) using various hadron generators. The computations are compared with experimental data. A conclusion concerning {{the consistency of the}} hadron generators is stated.

[...] For instance, electron-positron pairs may be formed in pulsars, as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron pairs from the star surface. [...] Therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae. [...] This weathering takes place as [...] "the cold, magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically expanding ejecta, a shock wave system forms in the impact: the outer one propagates in the ejecta, while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star." [...] The former ejection of matter in the outer shock wave and the latter production of antimatter in the reverse shock wave are steps in a space weather cycle.|$|E
