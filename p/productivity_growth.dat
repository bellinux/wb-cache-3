40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between Brazil's {{political}} institutions and its disappointing <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth</b> in recent decades. Although political institutions provide the president with incentives and the instruments to pursue monetary stability and fiscal discipline they simultaneously raise the costs of achieving those very objectives. The insulation of certain expenditures from presidential discretion necessitates the use of other policy options, such as high taxation levels and cuts in unprotected expenditures, which put a drag on <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth.</b> In a context of robust checks and balances and interest group fragmentation, a state overburdened by constitutional entitlements has resorted to massive increases in taxation. The resulting environment possesses both essential elements for sustainable economic growth and distortions that conspire against its realization. While some improvements in <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth</b> {{have occurred in the}} past decade, the pace has been slow and incremental...|$|R

40|$|The 1980 s and 1990 s have {{witnessed}} the emergence of many Asian economies as important traders in the world. How has openness to trade and investment affected <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth</b> performance in those economies? This question is often tackled with the traditional growth regression method. However, the findings in the existing literature are still inconclusive. This paper proposes an alternative approach which is employed to {{examine the impact of}} openness on the sources of <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth</b> in the APEC economies. Specifically, the proposed technique distinguishes technological progress (innovation) from efficiency changes (catch-up) and attempts to isolate the influences of openness on these two distinct factors. The findings in this study may help gain fresh insight into the relationship between openness and <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth</b> performance in the APEC economies.

40|$|Abstract (100 words) The paper {{analyses}} {{the differential}} effect of human capital on regional economic <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth</b> depending on its composition. The potential existence of geographical spillovers of human capital is also considered applying spatial panel data techniques. The empirical analysis of Spanish provinces between 1980 and 2005 confirms {{the positive effect of}} secondary and tertiary studies on both <b>growth</b> and <b>productivity,</b> but we find very weak evidence of positive geographical spillovers of human capital. In fact, only in some specifications the spatial lag of primary studies {{has a positive}} effect on productivity, while tertiary studies seems to have the contrary effect both on <b>productivity</b> and <b>growth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Some {{observers}} {{have raised the}} possibility that production spillovers and network effects associated with information and communications technology (ICT) {{are an important part}} of the “New Economy. ” Across U.

Once one allows for productivity differences across industries, measured TFP growth is uncorrelated with all capital inputs, including ICT capital. This provides little evidence for a New Economy story of ICT-related spillovers or network effects driving TFP growth throughout U. S. manufacturing...|$|R

The Mankiw, Romer and Weil model provides a lower estimate of the TFP (residual) than the basic Solow–Swan model because the addition of human capital to the model enables capital accumulation to explain more {{of the variation in}} income across countries. In the basic model the TFP residual includes the effect of human capital because human capital is not included as a factor of production.|$|E
