5|$|Fifteen {{or twenty}} barges were still using {{the river in}} the 1880s, {{although}} the upper reaches were no longer accessible. Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896. In 1898, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who by this time were {{the owners of the}} railway from Horsham to Littlehampton, drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course, and poured tons of chalk into the tunnel to stabilise it. A trade in chalk and lime extracted from Amberley chalk pits continued into the early twentieth century. Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs, and imports of salt, timber and coal for the gasworks continued. Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914, and the last sailing vessel to reach the port did so three years later. Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908, and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938. As freight traffic disappeared from the river, Edward Slaughter, who later became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> of Buller and Slaughter, was hiring pleasure craft by 1903, and the company was still doing so in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In {{its defense}} of {{that part of}} Sobuk-san south of Battle Mountain and P'ilbong, the 1st Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, also had nearly {{continuous}} action {{in the last week}} of the month. During this time, Master Sergeant Melvin O. Handrich of C Company, 5th Regimental Combat Team posthumously won the Medal of Honor for actions on August 25 and 26. From a forward position he directed artillery fire on an attacking North Korean force and at one point personally kept <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> from abandoning its positions. Although wounded, Handrich returned to his forward position, to continue directing artillery fire, and engaged North Korean troops alone until he was killed. When the 5th Regimental Combat Team regained the area, it counted over 70 dead North Koreans in the vicinity, all likely killed by Handrich. By the end of August, the fighting in the mountains west of Masan remained a stalemate. Neither side had secured a definite advantage.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{cancellation}} of the company's Army contracts had removed Platt-LePage's primary source of income, and without sufficient funds to continue operating, the company closed its doors on January 13, 1947. McDonnell Aircraft, which had acquired <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> in 1942, and a larger share in 1944, purchased {{the rights to the}} remainder of the company's intellectual property, including the design for the PL-9, a twin-engine helicopter that McDonnell would develop into the XHJD Whirlaway.|$|E
25|$|On 12 January 2000, Københavns Lufthavne, which {{operates}} {{among other things}} Copenhagen Airport, bought 33.3% of the shares in Rygge Sivile Lufthavn. The company stated that they had invited the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration to purchase <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> but that no decision {{had been made by}} the government agency. The company stated that they were therefore forced to invite a foreign airport operate to purchase <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> to have sufficient competence in airport operations. In December, the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration stated that they were negative to the plans for civilian traffic at Rygge. The administration operates with the model that the large airports, in particular Gardermoen, make a profit, which is used to finance the deficits at smaller airports. The administration stated that establishing a civilian airport at Rygge would undermine the financial structure of Norwegian airports and would breach the political presumptions for constructing Gardermoen. If the administration was to be able to complete on price with Rygge, the state would have to give the necessary grants to cover the deficits at other airports. At the same time, Torp was required to pay their own air traffic control costs, which until then had been covered by the administration. In September 2001, the Norwegian Competition Authority supported the airport, stating that it would allow more competition on international flights from Norway, and could make it easier to establish domestic competition in the face of Scandinavian Airline's take-over of Braathens.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s Agderfly shifted its {{business}} model. A cooperation was started with Skjelbreds Rederi and the aviation company {{changed its name}} to A/S Nortrans Agderfly. During this period the Senecas were sold and replaced with a Piper Navajo and a Piper Aztec. For a period it also leased a Mitsubishi MU-2. Rustenstad bought back the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> he didn't own in 1985 and changed the name back to Agderfly. The MU2 was sold in 1987 and replaced with a Grumman Cougar, a Bellanca Super Decathlon and a Socata Rallye. During this period the pilot school specialized in converting military pilots to civilian certificates, and offered commercial B, C and D licenses.|$|E

Stein Matre bought <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> in 2000, and decided to bid for some of the public service obligations that were being auctioned away by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The company was awarded two routes, from Bodø Airport to Røst Airport, and from Oslo Airport, Gardermoen to Fagernes Airport, Leirin, taking effect from 1 April 2000. The Røst route resulted in the company having to establish a base at Røst Airport. Starting in November 2000, GuardAir started flights from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Kristiansund and Ålesund, with one daily service.|$|E
25|$|A {{project group}} {{concluded}} in 1996 {{that the agency}} should be converted to a limited company.

In October, the board rejected all the bids, stating that they were too low. The bid from Fosen involved them purchasing 66% of the company, while the other bids were for 100% of the shares. Fosen also proposed transferring Fosen's and Fosen's largest owner, Torghatten Trafikkselskap's bus divisions to TrønderBilene, and base the new company in Steinkjer.|$|E

He was planning to develop mind control so that the world's populace would buy the next useless gadget he would bring to market. However, thanks to Elise and Dan's intervention (after his new computer broke and couldn't get it fixed due to Ditmer's plan interfering), and his former partner Hiram (who had his <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> stolen from him by Barry, and met Dan and Chris while they were stranded, eventually trying to murder them) invading, his plan is foiled and his complex blows up.

25|$|The {{consistently}} revenue-generating <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> {{may have}} a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing company may have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow {{over the next five}} years from these. It cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today the present value of a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets.|$|E
