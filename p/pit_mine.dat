25|$|The {{mass grave}} site, {{one of the}} largest in Slovenia, was first {{publicly}} discussed in 1990, after the fall of communism in Yugoslavia. A memorial chapel was raised near the entrance to the mine in 1997. Investigation of the Barbara <b>Pit</b> <b>mine</b> began in 2008. It took several months for workers to remove concrete walls built after the war to seal the cave. On 3 March 2009, investigators found 427 unidentified bodies at a ditch in the mine. Another 369 corpses were found on the first five meters of a nearby shaft. As of March 2017, remains of 1,420 victims were exhumed from the site. The Barbara <b>Pit</b> <b>mine</b> was subsequently visited by the Croatian and Slovenian political leadership to pay tribute to the victims.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} three years, the deposit was assessed for economic viability, and in 1983 {{the decision was made}} to commence mining operations.

The mine was commissioned in December 1985.|$|E

25|$|The Clean Water Initiative {{was voted}} on as Ballot Measure 4 on August 26, 2008, and lost {{by a vote}} of about 57 percent against and 43 percent for the measure. The measure was {{designed}} to impose higher water quality standards on a large scale mining operation, known as the Pebble Mine, near the Bristol Bay, which were designed to prevent pollution from entering some of the world's most productive Sockeye salmon runs. The Pebble Mine is primarily a large open <b>pit</b> <b>mine</b> which will extract copper and gold ore, resulting in runoff from the mine finding its way into salmon streams and drinking water, copper dust in particular being poisonous, even in low quantities, to fish.|$|E
25|$|Motorola {{offered a}} 1970s-era {{system based on}} the United States Coast Guard LORAN {{maritime}} navigation system. The LORAN system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name Metricom. It consisted of an LF LORAN receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical noise in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a <b>pit</b> <b>mine</b> or port.|$|E

25|$|In late May and June 1945, {{when the}} Yugoslav army started {{emptying}} its prison camps in Slovenia, prisoners from the Teharje camp and the Stari Pisker prison were brought by trucks {{at night to}} the abandoned Barbara <b>Pit</b> <b>mine</b> in Huda Jama. Slovene Home Guard POWs that were singled out in Slovenj Gradec, Velenje, Kranj and Celje were {{the first ones to}} arrive on the last week of May. NDH troops were brought on foot. Once arrived, groups of 5-6 prisoners with hands tied with wire were stripped, ordered to kneel above a mine shaft and shot in the head, or were hit with a mine hammer or a pickaxe. In some cases, groups of 20-30 prisoners were tossed into a mine shaft, followed with hand grenades to finish off the victims. A number of prisoners were thrown in alive. Once the shafts were filled with corpses, the remaining prisoners were sent in the direction of Zagorje in northwest Croatia where they were killed, while the bodies were covered with lime to speed up decomposition. The mine was then enclosed with 400 cubic meters of concrete and wooden barriers. Those still conscious tried to climb over each other to reach the hatch, but could not escape the sealed mine.|$|E

The three lines continue heading south until they reach a substation on the North Shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. From there on, the three lines parallel the North Shore as the Gulf narrows to the southwest toward the Saint Lawrence River discharge mouth.

500|$|In 1968 the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) {{discovered}} a molybdenum deposit {{at the base}} of Castle Peak, the highest peak in the White Cloud Mountains. ASARCO filed paperwork with the Forest Service to construct roads and to allow for an open <b>pit</b> <b>mine</b> below Castle Peak to extract the ore. The proposed mine would have been [...] deep, [...] wide, and [...] long. About [...] of [...] material would be processed daily with 99.5 percent being deposited in waste piles and settling ponds. ASARCO estimated that the mine would create 350 jobs and $1 million ($ today) in taxes per year, while the roads would open up opportunities for further exploration. The Forest Service {{would not be able to}} stop mining and protect the White Cloud Mountains because the General Mining Act of 1872 gave mining rights to anyone who had located a lode or placer. Nationally, opposition to the mine mounted, while in 1970 Republican Idaho Governor Don Samuelson voiced support for the mine, saying that ASARCO was not, [...] "going to tear down mountains. They are only going to dig a hole." [...] He also characterized Castle Peak as, [...] "nothing but sagebrush on one side and scraggly trees on the other."
