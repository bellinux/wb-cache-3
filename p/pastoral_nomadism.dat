The main objective {{of the study was to}} assess and address various economic behavior patterns of nomads. For this purpose the study was carried out in the four areas in District Faisalabad. A sample of 120 respondents was made from four randomly selected areas of District Faisalabad. A well designed interviewing schedule has been developed to accomplish the task of collecting data. Whilst data thus collected was analyzed through percentage statistical technique. Analytical conclusions are drawn and critical suggestions have been formulated on the basis of collected data. The present study shows that the birth rate among nomads is very high i. e. 33. 3 percent respondents have 5 - 10. The major source of income for nomads was labour (67. 5 percent) More than one fourth i. e. 38. 5 percent of the respondents reported that the males and females are involved in labour.

40|$|Almost {{the first}} lecture in West European and North American Romani Studies classes {{establishes}} the theoretical distinction between commercial, <b>pastoral</b> and hunter-gatherer <b>nomadisms,</b> and between {{all three of}} them and migration. Whether and how they can be anchored into any theoretical framework of economic development is more controversial: nationalist visions tend to regard nomadism as a reactionary obstacle to the establishment of a secure, territorially based modern state. The discourses of East European Romani Studies are therefore rather torn between their desire to present nomadism as a retrogressive pathology caused by persecution, and their desire to assert a non-territorial ethno-political identity which transcends the nation-state. This paper will suggest that the analytical distinction between the various sources of identity and social capital are not as hard and fast as they seem. It will suggest that since all perceived ethnic boundaries are the consequences of mobility, {{it is not surprising that}} nomadic traditions can assist success in migration, and indeed that commonalty of ethnicity may aid persons of sedentary culture to acquire elements of social capital that assist successful migration. The patterns of cultural change and the acquisition of new cultural capital are very complex, as may be seen in the differences between the adaptations of 19 th, 20 th and 21 st century Romani migrants from Eastern Europe, the distinction encapsulated in the American Vlach Romani distinction between “amare Roma” and “themeske Roma”. A more complex theoretical framework may help to deconstruct the ideologies which lead Western states to obstruct the free movement of people, and perhaps ultimately to dismantle the controls themselves...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the possibilities of}} regional history {{as a basis for}} understanding the development of society in Iran in the nineteenth century. It begins by defining some conceptual problems needing dis- cussion in order to embark on such a history. The choice of a regional society as the unit of study, and the selection of Kennan in particular are examined. The problem of source material is dealt with by a survey of the sources used in the study of nineteenth century Kennan. The emergence of the region as a geographical and historical entity is then summarised in order to clarify its identity as it appeared by the nineteenth century. The central section of the thesis is an examina- tion of the important aspects of material life in Kerman. The rural sector is discussed first as being dominant in economy and society, with a survey of crop production being followed by examination of rural technology and society, and then a discussion of landlord-cultivator relations. The urban sector is then analysed in terms of a survey of craft production and then of social organisation. A separate chapter examines the sphere of circulation linking urban and rural sectors, looking at urban-rural contacts especially as articulated by landlord- peasant relations, and also at the links between Kennan and other regions, and with international markets. There is an appendix on the special case of <b>pastoral</b> ism and <b>nomadism.</b> The last section of the thesis uses the understanding of society which has emerged in an analysis of politics. Discussion of useful definitions of this term is followed by examination of various levels of political life, and more specifically of the decade 1905 - 1915. Finally conclusions are drawn about the contribution of this regional study to better under- standing of history arid society in Iran...|$|R

50|$|According to {{the most}} common theory the Indo-European {{languages}} originated on the western steppe. Before perhaps 1000BC Iranian languages were established all over the western and central steppe. The origin of steppe <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> is poorly understood.

Archeologists have identified a Tripolye culture (c4000BC) at {{the western edge of}} the steppe, a Sredny Stog culture at about the same time on the Dnieper, a Yamna culture (c3000BC, Indo-European?), a Srubna culture (c1500BC) linked eastward to the possibly Indo-Iranian Andronovo culture, and others.|$|E
50|$|The Nugaal Valley {{is a key}} {{pastoral}} area which spans across four regions, Nugaal, Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer. <b>Pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> is the primary {{way of life for}} most of the people living in the valley. Goat and camel raising form the basis of the economy, and frankincense and myrrh are collected from wild trees. The beds of the watercourses have a few permanent wells, to which the predominantly nomadic population returns during the dry season.

50|$|One of {{the results}} of the {{break-up}} of the Soviet Union and the subsequent political independence and economic collapse of its Central Asian republics has been the resurgence of <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism.</b> Taking the Kyrgyz people as a representative example, nomadism was the centre of their economy before Russian colonization at the turn of the 20th century, when they were settled into agricultural villages. The population became increasingly urbanized after World War II, but some people still take their herds of horses and cows to high pastures (jailoo) every summer, continuing a pattern of transhumance.|$|E
50|$|Civilization {{emerged in}} north China {{in the second}} {{millennium}} BC. At this time the Tarim Basin was inhabited by people of European appearance who probably spoke an Indo-European language (Tocharian). They may have introduced the chariot and bronze-working into China. The later Yuezhi in the Gansu corridor may have also been Tocharian. The origin of steppe <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> is not well understood. Mounted archery began {{in the west and}} reached east Asia some time before 307BC. The steppes were inhabited by various disunited tribes that the Chinese called Rong (west), Beidi (north), Donghu (east) and other names.|$|E
50|$|The Gandapur, {{like many}} other nomadic Pashtun groups in the region, {{regularly}} moved between the Daman plains stretching from the Indus to the eastern slopes of the Sulaiman mountains.

50|$|Neolithic {{agricultural}} settlements (c. 5500-3500 BC), such {{as those}} at Norovlin, Tamsagbulag, Bayanzag, and Rashaan Khad, predated the introduction of horse-riding nomadism, a pivotal event {{in the history of}} Mongolia and becoming the dominant culture. Horse-riding nomadism has been documented by archeological evidence in Mongolia during the Copper and Bronze Age Afanasevo culture (3500-2500 BC); this culture was active to the Khangai Mountains in Central Mongolia. The wheeled vehicles found in the burials of the Afanasevans have been dated to before 2200 BC. <b>Pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> and metalworking became more developed with the later Okunev culture (2nd millennium BC), Andronovo culture (2300-1000 BC) and Karasuk culture (1500-300 BC), culminating with the Iron Age Xiongnu Empire in 209 BC.

5000|$|In {{the past}} it was {{asserted}} that pastoral nomads left no presence archaeologically {{but this has}} now been challenged, and was clearly not so for many ancient Eurasian nomads, who have left very rich kurgan burial sites. Pastoral nomadic sites are identified based on their location outside the zone of agriculture, the absence of grains or grain-processing equipment, limited and characteristic architecture, a predominance of sheep and goat bones, and by ethnographic analogy to modern pastoral nomadic peoples [...] Juris Zahrins has proposed that <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> began as a cultural lifestyle {{in the wake of}} the 6200 BC climatic crisis when Harifian pottery making hunter-gatherers in the Sinai fused with Pre-Pottery Neolithic B agriculturalists to produce the Munhata culture, a nomadic lifestyle based on animal domestication, developing into the Yarmoukian and thence into a circum-Arabian nomadic pastoral complex, and spreading Proto-Semitic languages.|$|E
50|$|In October 1924, when Central Asia {{was divided}} into {{distinct}} political entities, the Transcaspian Region and Turkmen Oblast of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR) became the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR), a full-fledged constituent republic of the Soviet Union. During the forced collectivization and other extreme socioeconomic changes of {{the first decades of}} Soviet rule, <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> ceased to be an economic alternative in Turkmenistan, and by the late 1930s the majority of Turkmen had become sedentary. Efforts by the Soviet state to undermine the traditional Turkmen way of life resulted in significant changes in familial and political relationships, religious and cultural observances, and intellectual developments. Significant numbers of Russians and other Slavs, as well as groups from various nationalities mainly from the Caucasus, migrated to urban areas. Modest industrial capabilities were developed, and limited exploitation of Turkmenistan's natural resources was initiated.|$|E
50|$|Pulleyblank also writes,Although {{there is}} now archaeological {{evidence}} of the spread of <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> based on horse riding from Central Asia into Mongolia and farther east {{in the first half}} of the first millennium B.C.E., as far as we have evidence it did not impinge on Chinese consciousness until the northward push of the state of Zhao 趙 to the edge of the steppe in present Shanxi province shortly before the end of the fifth century B.C.E. brought them into contact with a new type of horse-riding “barbarian” that they called Hu 胡. … In Han times the term Hu was applied to steppe nomads in general but especially to the Xiongnu who had become the dominant power in the steppe. Earlier it had referred to a specific proto-Mongolian people, now differentiated as the Eastern Hu 東胡, from whom the Xianbei 鮮卑 and the Wuhuan 烏桓 later emerged.|$|E
5000|$|Horse-based <b>Pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> {{appeared}} {{in this area}} some time between 4000 and 1000 BC. There is not enough data to be more specific. It is thought that the Northwest Caucasian languages {{are related to the}} ancient Hattite language and the Northeast Caucasian languages are related to Hurrian and Urartian. This implies that the mountaineers of the Caucasus have been in their present location for a very long time. According to the most common theory the Indo-European languages originated on the steppes north of the Caucasus and Black Sea. Some time before 3000 BC the Maikop culture {{appeared in}} Circassia and Kabardia. It is noted for its excellent gold and silver work. North on the steppe was the Yamnaya culture which was probably Indo-European. Around 1000 BC there was a bronze-age Koban culture in the Kabardian area which may have been proto-Chechen. Iron appeared in the eighth century BC.|$|E
50|$|Although {{cultivation}} of crops has continued since the Neolithic, agriculture has always remained small in scale compared to <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism.</b> Agriculture may have first been introduced {{from the west}} or arose independently in the region. The population during the Copper Age {{has been described as}} mongoloid in the east of what is now Mongolia, and as europoid in the west. Tocharians (Yuezhi) and Scythians inhabited western Mongolia during the Bronze Age. The mummy of a Scythian warrior, which is believed to be about 2,500 years old, was a 30- to 40-year-old man with blond hair; it was found in the Altai, Mongolia. As horse nomadism was introduced into Mongolia, the political center of the Eurasian Steppe also shifted to Mongolia, where it remained until the 18th century CE. The intrusions of northern pastoralists (e.g., Guifang, Shanrong, Donghu) into China during the Shang dynasty (1600-1046 BC) and Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BC) presaged the age of nomadic empires.|$|E
50|$|Between the 10th and the 13th Century, {{there was}} large {{immigration}} of Jat groups from Balochistan and Sindh northwards to Punjab and eastwards towards {{what is now}} Rajasthan. Many Jat clans initially settled in a region known as the Bar country, which referred to the country between the rivers of Punjab, thinly populated with scanty rainfall which accommodated a type of <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism</b> which was based primary on the rearing of goats and camels. Between the 11th and the 13th centuries, the Jats became essentially a peasant population, taking advantage {{in the growth of}} irrigation. As these Jats became converted to peasant farmers, they also started to become Muslims. Most Jats clans of western Punjab have traditions that they accepted Islam at the hands of two famous Sufi saints of Punjab, Shaikh Faridudin Ganj Shaker of Pakpattan or his contemporary Baha Al Haq Zakiriya of Multan. In reality the process of conversion was said to much a slower process.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the break-up of the Soviet Union and the subsequent political independence and economic collapse of its Central Asian republics is the resurgence of <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism.</b> Taking the Kyrgyz people as a representative example, nomadism was the centre of their economy prior to Russian colonization {{at the turn of the}} C19/C20, when they were settled into agricultural villages. The population became increasingly urbanized after World War II, but some people continued to take their herds of horses and cows to the high pasture (jailoo) every summer. Since the 1990s, as the cash economy shrank, unemployed relatives were absorbed back on the family farm, and the importance of this form of nomadism has increased. The symbols of nomadism, specifically the crown of the grey felt tent known as the yurt, appears on the national flag, emphasizing the centrality of their nomadic history and past in the creation of the modern nation of Kyrgyzstan.|$|E
5000|$|According to Alberto Piazza [...] "it {{is clear}} that, genetically speaking, {{peoples of the}} Kurgan steppe descended {{at least in part}} from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who im{{migrated}} there from Turkey." [...] According to Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza, the Yamna-culture may have been derived from Middle Eastern Neolithic farmers who migrated to the Pontic steppe and developed pastoral nomadism.: ...if the expansions began at 9,500 years ago from Anatolia and at 6,000 years ago from the Yamnaya culture region, then a 3,500-year period elapsed during their migration to the Volga-Don region from Anatolia, probably through the Balkans. There a completely new, mostly pastoral culture developed under the stimulus of an environment unfavorable to standard agriculture, but offering new attractive possibilities. Our hypothesis is, therefore, that Indo-European languages derived from a secondary expansion from the Yamnaya culture region after the Neolithic farmers, possibly coming from Anatolia and settled there, developing <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another {{explanation}} of yaylag's importance and position in today's agriculture {{is given by}} recent research: [...] "Because it is semiarid, {{large parts of the}} Middle East traditionally have been given over to a mode of livelihood that combines the extensive cultivation of crops such as wheat and barley with sheep and goat herding. Herds are usually moved in fixed patterns between adjacent ecological zones {{in the course of a}} year and graze on the stubble of cultivated fields after harvest. Such movement is called transhumant pastoralism or seminomadism, and it differs from the movement of nomadic groups who follow their herds (<b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism).</b> Seminomadic pastoralists and pastoral nomads form a significant but declining minority in such countries as Saudi Arabia (probably less than 3 percent), Iran (4 percent), and Afghanistan (no more than 10 percent). They comprise less than 2 percent of the population in the countries of North Africa, with the exception of Libya and Mauritania." ...|$|E
5000|$|Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Alberto Piazza {{argue that}} Renfrew and Gimbutas {{reinforce}} rather than contradict each other.

[...] Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006) state that: if the expansions began at 9,500 years ago from Anatolia and at 6,000 years ago from the Yamnaya culture region, then a 3,500-year period elapsed during their migration to the Volga-Don region from Anatolia, probably through the Balkans.

Our hypothesis is, therefore, that Indo-European languages derived from a secondary expansion from the Yamnaya culture region after the Neolithic farmers, possibly coming from Anatolia and settled there, developing <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism.</b> [...] Spencer Wells suggests in a (2001) study that the origin, distribution and age of the R1a1 haplotype points to an ancient migration, possibly corresponding to the spread by the Kurgan people in their expansion across the Eurasian steppe around 3000 BCE.|$|E
50|$|The Kimak {{economy was}} classic Central Asian <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism,</b> with the Turkic pattern of widely varying local {{economic}} specializations and adaptations. The key animal was horse {{and the main}} subsistence animal was sheep. As a subsistence animal, fatty-tailed sheep provided meat for food, oil for cooking, and tallow for light. The poorest Kimaks herded cattle. They wintered in the steppe between the Emba and Ural rivers, but summered near the Irtysh. The summer home of the Kimak Khakans was {{in the town of}} Imak, in the middle Irtysh, the winter capital was Tamim on the southern shore of lake Balkhash. Archeology confirms that te Kimaks in the Irtysh area were semi-settled, Al-Idrisi in the 12th century wrote about Kimak cultivated lands as a well-known fact, with wheat crops, millet, barley, legumes, and even rice. The Kimaks also raised grapes and were beekeepers. They left remains of irrigation systems and ruins of castles. Al-Idrisi describes in detail the Kimak cities, emphasizing that all of them were well fortified. In the Kagan’s city, with its concentration of Kimak aristocracy, were markets and temples. Sedentary life led to construction of more stable dwellings, in the settlements and cities clay-walled semi-dugouts were widely used alongside felt yurts. Typically, both type of dwellings had a hearth in the center.|$|E

5000|$|Whereas Trade and Civilisation mainly {{follows the}} {{traditional}} descriptive method of a historian, Asia before Europe is a study, using mathematical set theory, {{of the dynamic}} interaction between economic life, society, and civilisation in the regions around and beyond the Indian Ocean {{during the period from}} the rise of Islam to 1750. It raises and answers the question how the identity of different Asian civilisations is established {{in the first place and}} then goes on to examine the structural features of food habits, clothing, architectural styles, and housing. The analysis of the different modes of economic production is followed by a description of the role of crop raising, <b>pastoral</b> <b>nomadism,</b> industrial activities, and the history of urbanisation for the main regions of the Indian Ocean. The book also presents a distinctive theory of comparative history. An extension of Fernand Braudel's theory of time and space, the methodology sets out precisely the logical foundation of the historical perceptions of unities and disunities, continuities, ruptures, and thresholds. The analysis of the historical evidence leads to the conclusion that Indian Ocean societies were united or separated from one another by a conscious cultural and linguistic identity. Below this surface level of awareness was a deeper structure of unities created by a common ecology, technology of economic production, traditions of government, theory of political obligations rights, and shared historical experience. The theory makes it possible to show that the name or the linguistic sign [...] "Indian Ocean" [...] is an arbitrary construction with a narrow range of meaning: the real Indian Ocean was an area which extended historically from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to the sea which lies beyond Japan. The [...] "axiom of choice" [...] in mathematical set theory is used to show that even the great deserts of Asia can be included in the [...] "set" [...] Indian Ocean through the logic of dialectical opposition.|$|E
