60|$|The {{consultation}} {{was a short}} one. All {{the officers}} were in favour of pushing forward, pointing out that, as only the 16th Egyptians could be considered as fairly disciplined, the troops would lose heart if they retired; {{and could not be}} relied upon to keep steady, if attacked by a largely superior force; while, at present, they would probably fight bravely. The Arab battalion had been raised by the Italians, and were at present full of confidence, as they had defeated the Mahdists who had been besieging Kassala. The Arab irregulars had, of course, the fighting instincts of their race, and would assault an enemy bravely; but in a defensive battle, against greatly superior numbers, could scarcely be expected to stand well. As for the eighty camel men, they were all Soudanese soldiers, discharged from the army for old age and <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness.</b> They could be relied upon to fight but, small in number as they were, could but have little effect on the issue of a battle. All therefore agreed that, having come thus far, the safest, as well as the most honourable course, would be to endeavour to fight the enemy in a strong position.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the leisure time physical activity (LTPA) participation and physical fitness (PF) levels of South African women of the various ethnic groups. Individuals between the ages of 30 and 60 years (= 41. 0; ±= 4. 6) who were part of a cross-sectional non-randomized availability population who voluntarily participated, were used in this study. The group that formed part of the physical activity survey included 3273 subjects (Asian = 262; black= 1357; coloured= 239; white= 1415) while the group for the physical fitness analysis included 3060 subjects (Asian= 248; black= 1015; coloured= 199; white= 1225). Subjects who used medication such as beta-adrenergic suppressors that could affect the fitness test were excluded from participating. Statistical analysis was done using the CSS: Statistica computer software to determine profile analysis of the participants. The results indicated that 85 % of coloured women reported low physical activity participation, followed by black and Asian women where 83 % of the participants indicated low physical activity participation, while 75 % of white women revealed low physical activity levels. In contrast, 10 % of the white women indicated high LTPA participation while only 5 % of coloured women were very active. In the case of black and Asian participants, 8 % and 6 % respectively indicated high LTPA levels. Regarding physical fitness, 57 %, 50 %, 49 % and 39 % of the black, Asian, coloured and white respondents respectively showed low physical fitness levels, while 10 %, 6 %, and 5 % of the white, Asian/black and coloured respondents showed high levels of physical fitness. This high prevalence of <b>physical</b> inactivity and <b>unfitness</b> may lead to various health problems and can increase the prevalence of hypokinetic ailments in adult women, increased health care costs and even premature death.

50|$|Fatigue was {{a factor}} in a {{significant}} number of cases (28% according to Edmonds). Fatigue is caused by excessive exertion, is aggravated by <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness,</b> and reduces the reserves available for survival. Factors cited as causes of fatigue include excessive drag due to over-weighting, drag due to over-inflation of the BCD, and long surface swims in adverse sea conditions, and it was not restricted to unfit divers. Fatigue was also associated with salt-water aspiration syndrome, cardiac problems and asthma.|$|E
5000|$|South African {{studies also}} {{utilized}} the spirometer to address racial and class differences. Eustace H. Cluver conducted vital capacity measurement {{research at the}} University of Witwatersrand and found that poor white people had <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness</b> {{but that it was}} attributable to environmental issues rather than genetics. Using these studies, Cluver argued to the South African Association for the Advancement of Science during World War Two that improving both nutrition and physical training programs could help produce wealth and win the war by increasing the working capacity of individuals across all races as their labor was necessary to achieve these ends. Racism and the spirometer intersected again in these studies when further research was done on the effects of physical training on poor white recruits; vital capacity studies showed that ‘the poor-white is biologically sound and can be turned into a valuable citizen’ but no comment was made on the outcome of black South Africans.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 In {{social and}} {{biological}} evolution, infelicity {{can operate as}} a driving motor to force change. In this essay, for life other than human, infelicity is equated with <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness</b> {{to compete for the}} resources of a specific niche. For humanity it is defined as the result of an incongruity between a nation's culture and its government. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how, for irrational life, unfitness can stimulate the creation of a new species and, for men, how the unhappiness of a nation may enhance its opportunity to enter a new socio-economic order. An evolutionary account about a possible way in which life could have evolved is offered, concentrating mainly on the transition from ape to a less remote ancestor of man, but also taking into consideration other life forms. Then, a parallel to social evolution is established. A study of the rise of capitalism in England, as well as the recent attempts to institute socialism in Latin America, are also explained as consequences of infelicity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{indicated}} an association between musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and physical work demands. Psychosocial work demands have also been identified as possible risk factors, but findings have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate factors associated with upper back, neck and upper limb MSD among workers from 14 plastic manufacturing companies located {{in the city of}} Salvador, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to survey a stratified proportional random sample of 577 workers. Data were collected by questionnaire interviews. Factor analysis was carried out on 11 physical demands variables. Psychosocial work demands were measured by demand, control and social support questions. The role of socio-demographic factors, lifestyle and household tasks was also examined. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors related to upper back, neck and upper limb MSDs. RESULTS: Results from multiple logistic regression showed that distal upper limb MSDs were related to manual handling, work repetitiveness, psychosocial demands, job dissatisfaction, and gender. Neck, shoulder or upper back MSDs were related to manual handling, work repetitiveness, psychosocial demands, job dissatisfaction, and <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders requires: improving the work environment, reducing biomechanical risk factors, and replanning work organization. Programs must also be aware of gender specificities related to MSDs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Cerebrovascular {{accident}} (CVA) or stroke {{results in}} {{weakness of the}} trunk muscles and <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness.</b> Objectives: To evaluate respiratory changes caused by stroke and correlate them with the functional capacity of chronic stroke patients who were treated at the Clinical Center of Physical Therapy of the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, Betim. Methods: Fifteen patients were recruited for assessment of respiratory function and functional capacity. We measured maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital capacity (VC), and functional capacity using the six-minute walk test (6 MWT). Test results were compared with reference values using an unpaired Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test. Respiratory variables were correlated with the distance walked in the 6 MWT using Spearman's correlation test. Results: The sample had {{a mean age of}} 58. 2 ± 13. 4 years, and most patients had a diagnosis of ischemic stroke and left hemiparesis. The following values were obtained: MIP (47. 7 ± 22. 2 cmH 2 O); MEP (47. 5 ± 20. 3 cmH 2 O); PEF (351. 3 ± 90. 8 L/min); VC (3. 0 ± 0. 91 L); and 6 MWT (222. 4 ± 101. 6 m). The MIP, MEP, PEF, and 6 MWT values measured in this study were statistically significantly lower (p 0. 005). Conclusion: Our results suggest that, despite the decrease in respiratory muscle strength, PEF, and VC, these variables did not correlate with the functional capacity of the chronic stroke patients assessed in this study...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} time {{patterns}} and predictors of initiating a quit attempt and subsequent sustained abstinence among youth smokers {{after receiving a}} telephone smoking cessation intervention. Methods: This was a longitudinal study of 408 current youth smokers aged 12 - 25 years who called a smoking cessation hotline in Hong Kong. Telephone surveys were conducted at baseline; 1 week; and 1, 3, and 6 months to assess smoking status and other risk factors. Nonparametric Kaplan-Meier methods and hierarchical Cox's proportional odds models were applied to explore the time patterns and predictors of the quitting process. Results: Half of the youth smokers initiated a quit attempt within 1 month after receiving the baseline telephone intervention, while the likelihood of further quit attempts decreased over time. Two thirds relapsed within the first 7 days after starting a quit attempt. Intention to quit, previous quit attempts, perceived <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness,</b> and other factors could predict the initiation of a quit attempt. Sustained abstinence was facilitated by making an immediate attempt to quit, adopting self-help strategies, and a perceived improvement in physical health. Conclusions: Our findings support the "catastrophic" pathway of youth smokers initiating a quit attempt. Counselors should capture the quitting momentum and motivate youth smokers to quit immediately. Interventions should include a health assessment and discussion of smokers' physical fitness. During {{the first week of}} abstinence, intensive monitoring of withdrawal symptoms, together with booster counseling, is helpful in preventing smoking relapse and could remotivate those who fail to sustain their quit attempt. © The Author 2010.

40|$|Abstract Background Preoperative {{anxiety and}} <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness</b> {{have been shown}} to have adverse effects on {{recovery}} from cardiac surgery. This study involving cardiac surgery patients was primarily aimed at assessing the feasibility of delivering physical conditioning and stress reduction programs within the public hospital setting. Secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of these programs on quality of life (QOL), rates of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) and length of stay (LOS) in hospital. Methods Elective patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft and/or valve surgery at a public hospital in Melbourne, Australia were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either holistic therapy (HT) or usual care (UC). HT consisted of a series of light physical exercise sessions together with a mental stress reduction program administered in an outpatient setting for the first two weeks after placement on the waiting list for surgery. A self-administered SF- 36 questionnaire was used to measure QOL and hospital records to collect data on LOS and rate of postoperative AF. Results The study population comprised 117 patients of whom 60 received HT and 57 received UC. Both programs were able to be delivered within the hospital setting but ongoing therapy beyond the two week duration of the program was not carried out due to long waiting periods and insufficient resources. HT, as delivered in this study, compared to UC did not result in significant changes in QOL, LOS or AF incidence. Conclusions Preoperative holistic therapy can be delivered in the hospital setting, although two weeks is insufficient to provide benefits beyond usual care on QOL, LOS or postoperative AF. Further research is now required to determine whether a similar program of longer duration, or targeted to high risk patients can provide measurable benefits. Trial registration This trial was conducted {{as part of a larger}} study and according to the principles contained in the CONSORT statement 2001. </p...|$|E

Although widely recommended {{there are just}} few data available about long time LMP. The present work aimed to present the effects of 2 years LMP on dietary, anthropometric and physical fitness of adults from both gender. One hundred and four subjects (77 women and 27 men; 54. 04 ± 7. 7 years) fullfiled the inclusion criteria of exercise sessions, presence of nutritional meetings and accomplishment of every 6 -months assessments during 2 years. After the clinical trial all subjects were included in supervisioned exercise program of 80 min, 5 x/wk along with diet-counseling meetings. Assessments of dietary intake, anthropometry and physical tests were undertaken semesterly. Statistical analysis were done to compare sexes, aging and moments for α= 5 %. Six months of LMP reduced significantly body weight and body mass index and more markedly <b>physical</b> <b>unfitness</b> without changes on food intake. Only trunk flexibility and handgrip continued to improve up to 24 mo. The greater improvements were found in women. Thus the present long-lasting LMP showed to be efficient for adults in promoting better physical fitness and body fat reclassification without signifi cant dietary changes.
