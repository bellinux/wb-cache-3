40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is a culmination of a collaborative venture between Matra BAe Dynamics and The Department of Enterprise Integration at Cranfield University. Initially the thesis examines the Engineering Doctorate philosophy, before describing the collaborator's history and the background to the decision to formulate a structured process to aid investment in manufacturing technology. The findings of an extensive literature review are described accompanied {{by the results of}} two supporting industrial studies initiated to complement the theoretical work. The literature review and studies revealed a concern about the degree of planning conducted prior to the adoption of manufacturing technology and how insufficient planning can {{have a negative impact on}} the implementation of the chosen investment. Further investigation highlighted an awarenesso f this being the problem within industry, yet it also revealed a lack of time and resources to take corrective action. The thesis then extends to the development of a process model constructed using the findings from the literature review and the industrial studies. The process model presents a structured process for investing in manufacturing technology consisting of a series of activities designed to guide managers through the planning and implementation stages of an investment. A third stage is proposed consisting of activities designed to encourage planning for future investments using the results from past investments as guides. Following a review of possible techniques for developing a <b>process</b> <b>aid</b> from the process model, HTML was selected and, based on a series of established requirements, a <b>process</b> <b>aid</b> was constructed. An industrial case study was undertaken to validate the process model and prove that the process is robust.

Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE's) are interesting materials for various applications, including the automotive industry, due to their excellent balance between processability and physical properties, especially using hydrogenated styrene-butadiene copolymer.

40|$|The {{production}} of lactose via {{the concentration of}} whey permeate is an important process in the dairy industry. Hautapu dairy factory, owned by Fonterra Cooperative Group, process milk into a range of dairy-based products including; Cheese, Milk Protein Concentrate and Lactose. This project was focused around reducing fouling during the evaporation of whey permeate for the {{production of}} lactose powder. As whey permeate is heated in evaporators, mineral salts precipitate and accumulate onto the stainless steel heat exchange surfaces. This layer of mineral scale, known as fouling, greatly reduces the amount of heat transfer used for evaporating the whey permeate. Once the fouling gets to a point where it is no longer achievable to reach the concentrated solids target, the evaporator is shut down and cleaned with chemicals to remove the scale build up. To decrease the amount of scale build up, a <b>process</b> <b>aid</b> is added to the whey permeate. This <b>process</b> <b>aid</b> A, or PAA, is a polyphosphate that when added to the feed stream gives longer run times. This project was aimed at establishing the chemistry behind the inhibiting abilities of PAA and its interaction with whey permeate. It is known that PAA acts as a complexing agent with calcium when it is added to the permeate stream which prevents it from forming calcium phosphate, the main source of fouling. In the course of the research, it was fortuitously discovered that PAA works very inefficiently as an inhibitor in whey permeate because of its ability to form an insoluble salt with free calcium ions. The consequence of this was that high calcium levels in whey permeate lead to PAA precipitating out of solution rendering it an ineffective anti-fouling agent to prevent further scale build up. As a result of this, alternative inhibitors were considered and tested for their calcium tolerance and calcium phosphate inhibiting properties. From these considerations, carboxymethyl inulin was regarded as the most favourable replacement candidate for PAA. This resulted in plans being set down for a future industrial trial involving the carboxymethyl inulin...|$|E

The two-fluid coaxial spinning technique was used to encapsulate the desired block copolymer as the core with another protective polymer as the shell. Advantages of the two-fluid electrospinning include (a) The shell fluid itself being electro-spinnable serves as a <b>process</b> <b>aid</b> for the block copolymers. Removal of these shells, results in ultrafine block copolymer fibers, (b) smaller diameter fibers are produced due to the independent control of the two fluids that permit wider changes in {{the diameter of the}} core fiber, (c) the integrity of the fiber does not get compromised due to the cylindrical confinement of the shell polymer which has a higher glass or melt transition temperature, thus creating a temperature window. TEM images confirm the continuous core–shell nature of the nanofibers. It also shows well-defined structures consisting of concentric layers because of curving of the lamellar phase due to fiber confinement [73].|$|E

30|$|While {{paradigms}} {{can be seen}} as a way {{in which}} powerful actors impose their understanding of reality, this does not mean that aid comes about in a top-down manner alone. There are obvious actors—and humanitarian agencies are among them—that command powerful positions and who are largely able to define and give meaning to the crisis event, decide on policy and its effects and allocate resources (Olson 2000). Nonetheless, the power to achieve outcomes does not only rest with the ‘usual suspects’. On close observation, power needs to be enacted to be effective, and this happens through social negotiation and by the interference of a large number of actors each of whom have a certain power to jointly shape the outcomes. This includes the recipients of aid, who in their strategies to obtain resources, for example through migration or through the manipulation of aid, may considerably reshape the landscape of humanitarian assistance. A recent example is how people from Syria and other conflict-affected areas massively decided to seek refuge in Europe in 2015 putting extreme pressure on the European Union in the <b>process.</b> <b>Aid</b> paradigms can be powerful, but practices of aid come about in more complex ways and by a multiplicity of actors.|$|E
40|$|Identification, {{measurement}} and monitoring of key quality measures {{at different stages}} of the survey <b>process</b> <b>aid</b> the survey manager in assuring quality or in identifying potential quality problems. In {{the first part of this}} paper, we describe recent developments in the Australian Bureau of Statistics extending the use of quality measures through the concept of quality gates, which can be seen as validation points in the end to end statistical process. The key quality measures are assessed and measured against acceptable limits or benchmarked against set targets. Throughout the statistical process, there will be a number of validation points or gates which should be 'passed ' before moving on to the next stage. This information is also useful for investigating quality issues which may emerge during the output analysis and clearance phase before data release. The second part of the paper describes the way our systems are being enhanced and integrated in order that the quality measures used as inputs to the gates are produced as a by-product of the various (e. g. editing, estimation) systems, and piped automatically to a central Quality Infrastructure System repository where they are easily accessible to users.
