We have used in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly visualize fully hydrated, intact intracellular mature vaccinia virus (IMV) virions and chemical and enzymatic treatment products thereof. The latter included virion cores, core-enveloping coats, and core substructures. The isolated coats appeared to be composed of a highly cross-linked protein array. AFM imaging of core substructures indicated association of the linear viral DNA genome with a segmented protein sheath forming an extended ∼ 16 -nm-diameter filament with helical surface topography; enclosure of this filament within a 30 - to 40 -nm-diameter tubule which also shows helical topography; and enclosure of the folded, condensed 30 - to 40 -nm-diameter tubule within the core by a wall covered with peg-like <b>projections.</b> <b>Proteins</b> observed attached to the 30 - to 40 -nm-diameter tubules may mediate folding and/or compaction of the tubules and/or represent vestiges of the core wall and/or pegs. An accessory "satellite domain" was observed protruding from the intact core. This corresponded in size to isolated 70 - to 100 -nm-diameter particles that were imaged independently and might represent detached accessory domains. AFM imaging of intact virions indicated that IMV underwent a reversible shrinkage upon dehydration (as much as 2. 2 - to 2. 5 -fold in the height dimension), accompanied by topological and topographical changes, including protrusion of the satellite domain. As shown here, the chemical and enzymatic dissection of large, asymmetrical virus particles in combination with in situ AFM provides an informative complement to other structure determination techniques...|$|R

With the advent of genomics and bioinformatics approaches, these effects of music can now be studied in a more detailed fashion. To verify whether listening to classical music has any effect on human transcriptome, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling from the peripheral blood of participants after listening to classical music (n = 48), and after a control study without music exposure (n = 15). As musical experience is known to influence the responses to music, we compared the transcriptional responses of musically experienced and inexperienced participants separately with those of the controls. Comparisons were made based on two subphenotypes of musical experience: musical aptitude and music education. In musically experiencd participants, we observed the differential expression of 45 genes (27 up- and 18 down-regulated) and 97 genes (75 up- and 22 down-regulated) respectively based on subphenotype comparisons (rank product non-parametric statistics, pfp 0. 05, > 1. 2 -fold change over time across conditions). Gene ontological overrepresentation analysis (hypergeometric test, FDR < 0. 05) revealed that the up-regulated genes are primarily known {{to be involved in the}} secretion and transport of dopamine, neuron <b>projection,</b> <b>protein</b> sumoylation, long-term potentiation and dephosphorylation. Down-regulated genes are known to be involved in ATP synthase-coupled proton transport, cytolysis, and positive regulation of caspase, peptidase and endopeptidase activities. One of the most up-regulated genes, alpha-synuclein (SNCA), is located in the best linkage region of musical aptitude on chromosome 4 q 22. 1 and is regulated by GATA 2, which is known to be associated with musical aptitude. Several genes reported to regulate song perception and production in songbirds displayed altered activities, suggesting a possible evolutionary conservation of sound perception between species.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} {{enveloped virus}} (EEV) form of vaccinia virus is bound by an envelope which is acquired by wrapping of intracellular virus particles with cytoplasmic vesicles containing trans-Golgi network markers. Six virus-encoded proteins {{have been reported}} as components of the EEV envelope. Of these, four proteins (A 33 R, A 34 R, A 56 R, and B 5 R) are glycoproteins, one (A 36 R) is a nonglycosylated transmembrane protein, and one (F 13 L) is a palmitylated peripheral membrane protein. During infection, these proteins localize to the Golgi complex, where they are incorporated into infectious virus that is then transported and released into the extracellular medium. We have investigated the fates of these proteins after expressing them individually {{in the absence of}} vaccinia infection, using a Semliki Forest virus expression system. Significant amounts of proteins A 33 R and A 56 R efficiently reached the cell surface, suggesting that they do not contain retention signals for intracellular compartments. In contrast, proteins A 34 R and F 13 L were retained intracellularly but showed distributions {{different from that of the}} normal infection. Protein A 36 R was partially retained intracellularly, decorating both the Golgi complex and structures associated with actin fibers. A 36 R was also transported to the plasma membrane, where it accumulated at the tips of cell <b>projections.</b> <b>Protein</b> B 5 R was efficiently targeted to the Golgi region. A green fluorescent protein fusion with the last 42 C-terminal amino acids of B 5 R was sufficient to target the chimeric protein to the Golgi region. However, B 5 R-deficient vaccinia virus showed a normal localization pattern for other EEV envelope proteins. These results point to the transmembrane or cytosolic domain of B 5 R protein as one, but not the only, determinant of the retention of EEV proteins in the wrapping compartment...|$|R

In the late nineties, the method was suggested to have the potential of generating “atomic resolution” reconstructions of particles above a certain mass. However, visualization of secondary structure elements in cryo-EM reconstructions {{has so far been}} achieved mainly for highly symmetrical macromolecular assemblies or by using previously existing X-ray structures to solve the initial alignment problem. A factor that severely limits the resolution for low-symmetry (point group symmetry Cn) particles is the problem of ab initio three-dimensional alignment of cryo-EM <b>projection</b> images of <b>proteins</b> in vitreous ice. A more general problem in the field of molecular biology is the study of heterogeneous structural properties of particles in preparations of purified macromolecular complexes. If not resolved, structural heterogeneity limits the achievable resolution of a cryo-EM reconstruction and makes correct biological interpretation difficult. If resolved, the heterogeneity instead offers a tremendous biological insight into the dynamic behaviour of a structure, and statistical information about partitioning over subpopulations with distinct structural features within the ensemble of particles may be gained. This thesis adds to the existing body of methods in the field of single-particle cryo-EM by addressing the problem of ab initio rotational alignment and the problem of resolving structural heterogeneity without using a priori information about the structural variability within large populations of cryo-EM <b>projections</b> of unstained <b>proteins.</b> The thesis aims at making the single-particle cryo-EM method a generally applicable tool for generating subnanometer resolution reconstructions and perform heterogeneity analysis of biological macromolecules.

Therefore, discovering the underlying molecular principlesof relapse is essential. The metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR 5, is considered to beinvolved in this aspect. One of the brain structures expressing mGluR 5 is the striatum, an areawith well-established role in addiction which is largely composed of medium-sized spinyneurons (MSNs). These neurons are basically divided into two major subpopulationscharacterized based on their <b>projections</b> and <b>protein</b> properties.

Differential expression analysis in the two cell lines identified altered gene expression in both protein coding and noncoding RNAs as they undergo neural differentiation with 222 differentially expressed genes observed in SK-N-SH cells and 19 differentially expressed genes in ReNcell CX. Interestingly, genes showing differential expression in SK-N-SH cells are enriched in genes implicated in autism spectrum disorder, but not in gene sets related to cancer or Alzheimer’s disease.

We demonstrate that a subbrush of L-tails creates an electrostatic potential profile with an approximately parabolic shape. An experimentally relevant (2 : 1) ratio of L- to alpha-projections reduces the charge density of the L subbrush and shifts the translocation transition of the H-tails to slightly higher degrees of phosphorylation.

In the striatum, more than 95 % of neurons are GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), which form two intermingled populations distinguished by their <b>projections</b> and <b>protein</b> content. Those expressing dopamine D 1 -receptors (D 1 Rs) project preferentially to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), whereas those expressing dopamine D 2 - receptors (D 2 Rs) project preferentially to the lateral part of the globus pallidus (LGP). The degree of segregation of these populations has been a continuous subject of debate, and the recent introduction of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins driven by specific promoters was a major progress to facilitate striatal neuron identification. However, the fraction of MSNs labeled in these mice has been recently called into question, casting doubt on the generality of results obtained with such approaches. Here, we performed an in-depth quantitative analysis of striatal neurons in drd 1 a-EGFP and drd 2 -EGFP mice. We first quantified neuronal and non-neuronal populations in the striatum, based on nuclear staining with TO-PRO- 3, and immunolabeling for NeuN, DARPP- 32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr, 32, 000), and various markers for interneurons.

40|$|Proteins are {{polymeric}} molecules {{with many}} degrees of conformational freedom whose internal energetic interactions are typically screened to small distances. Therefore, in the high-dimensional conformation {{space of a}} protein, the energy landscape is locally relatively flat, in contrast to low-dimensional representations, where, because of the induced entropic contribution to the full free energy, it appears funnel-like. Proteins explore the conformation space by searching these flat subspaces to find a narrow energetic alley that we call a hypergutter and then explore the next, lower-dimensional, subspace. Such a framework provides an effective representation of the energy landscape and folding kinetics that does justice to the essential characteristic of high-dimensionality of the search-space. It also illuminates {{the important role of}} nonnative interactions in defining folding pathways. This principle is here illustrated using a coarse-grained model of a family of three-helix bundle proteins whose conformations, once secondary structure has formed, can be defined by six rotational degrees of freedom. Two folding mechanisms are possible, one of which involves an intermediate. The stabilization of intermediate subspaces (or states in low-dimensional <b>projection)</b> in <b>protein</b> folding can either speed up or slow down the folding rate depending on the amount of native and nonnative contacts made in those subspaces. The folding rate increases due to reduced-dimension pathways arising from the mere presence of intermediate states, but decreases if the contacts in the intermediate are very stable and introduce sizeable topological or energetic frustration that needs to be overcome. Remarkably, the hypergutter framework, although depending on just a few physically meaningful parameters, can reproduce all the types of experimentally observed curvature in chevron plots for realizations of this fold...|$|R

The polarized growth of mating projections involves new cell wall synthesis, {{a process that}} relies on activation of the cell integrity MAP kinase, Mpk 1. In this report, we show that Mpk 1 activation during pheromone induction requires the transcriptional output of the mating pathway and protein synthesis. Consequently, Mpk 1 activation occurs subsequent to the activation of the mating pathway MAP kinase cascade. Additionally, Spa 2 and Bni 1, a formin family member, are two coil-coil-related proteins {{that are involved in}} the timing and other aspects of mating <b>projection</b> formation.

Stimulation of Mpk 1 activity occurs through the cell integrity phosphorylation cascade and depends on Pkc 1 and the redundant MAP/Erk kinases (MEKs), Mkk 1 and Mkk 2. Surprisingly, Mpk 1 activation by pheromone was only partially impaired in cells lacking the MEK kinase Bck 1.

Macromolecular assemblies present in the fractions were analyzed by integrating available data using bioinformatic approaches. We identified 368 unique proteins in our sample. Among these are components of some well-characterized assemblies involved in diverse cellular processes and structures including translation, proteolysis, protein folding, metabolism, and the cytoskeleton, as well as less characterized proteins that may correspond to additional components of known assemblies or other homo- or hetero-oligomeric structures. Single-particle analysis of electron micrographs of negatively stained samples allowed the identification of clearly distinguishable two-dimensional <b>projections</b> of discrete <b>protein</b> assemblies. Among these, we can identify small ribosomal subunits and preribosomal particles, the 26 S proteasome complex and small ringlike structures resembling the molecular chaperone complexes. In addition, {{a broad range of}} discrete and different complexes were seen at size ranges between 11 to 38 nm in diameter. Our procedure selects the assemblies on the basis of abundance and ease of isolation, and therefore provides an immediately useful starting point for further study of structure and function of large assemblies. Our results will also contribute toward building a molecular cell atlas. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Between 25 - 40 % {{of neurons}} in laminae I-III are GABAergic, {{and some of}} these express neuropeptide Y (NPY). We {{previously}} reported that NPY-immunoreactive axons form numerous synapses on lamina III projection neurons that possess the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK 1 r). The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of neurons and GABAergic boutons in this region that contain NPY, and to look for evidence that they selectively innervate different neuronal populations. We found that 4 - 6 % of neurons in laminae I-III were NPY-immunoreactive and based on the proportions of neurons that are GABAergic, we estimate that NPY is expressed by 18 % of inhibitory interneurons in laminae I-II and 9 % of those in lamina III. GABAergic boutons were identified by the presence of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) and NPY was found in 13 - 15 % of VGAT-immunoreactive boutons in laminae I-II, and 5 % of those in lamina III. For both the lamina III NK 1 r-immunoreactive <b>projection</b> neurons and <b>protein</b> kinase Cc (PKC gamma) -immunoreactive interneurons in lamina II, we found that around one-third of the VGAT boutons that contacted them were NPY-immunoreactive. However, based on differences in the sizes of these boutons and the strength of their NPY-immunoreactivity, we conclude that these originate from different populations of interneurons. Only 6 % of VGAT boutons presynaptic to large lamina I projection neurons that lacked NK 1 rs contained NPY. These results show that NPY-containing neurons make up a considerable proportion of the inhibitory interneurons in laminae I-III, and that their axons preferentially target certain classes of dorsal horn neuron...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{structure}} of protein ions in vacuo has {{received a lot of}} interest. Experimentally, such structures can only be characterized by global, low-resolution descriptors like the orientationally-averaged collision cross section (σ) over bar. An alternative descriptor of chain entanglement, the mean overcrossing number (N) over bar, is a very useful tool because it can distinguish sensitively between different conformations based on aspects of their geometry and topology. An overcrossing number distribution arises from an ensemble of different <b>projections</b> of the <b>protein</b> structure onto a viewing plane, where for each projection, the number of crossings by the set of line segments joining sequence-adjacent Calpha atoms is computed. (N) over bar is the mean of this distribution. Despite their usefulness, overcrossing numbers depend on the atomic coordinates and thus cannot be measured for protein ions in vacuo as can collision cross sections. In this work, we explore theoretically whether collision cross sections are correlated with overcrossing numbers. Using a group of diverse proteins with the same chain length as lysozyme and known X-ray structures, we find a weak correlation between (σ) over bar and (N) over bar. Thus, a nontrivial range of orientationally-averaged cross section values can be consistent with the same mean overcrossing number. Since (N) over bar comprises a very sensitive tool for the study of conformational rearrangements, we checked also for correlations between (σ) over bar and (N) over bar during molecular dynamics simulated unfolding and relaxation pathways of lysozyme in vacuo. For a given pathway, the two quantities are found to be highly correlated. Although neither (σ) over bar nor (N) over bar maps one-to-one onto a particular tertiary fold, they are both sensitive descriptors to monitor the conformational state of a protein along a pathway of dynamical change...|$|R
40|$|Multi subunit <b>protein</b> <b>projections</b> termed pili {{are found}} {{on the surface of}} Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. They are {{necessary}} for bacterial motility, biofilm formation, host adhesion/invasion etc. The assembly of pili in Gram-positive bacteria is not well understood, hindering the development of prophylactic/therapeutic strategies to counter important human pathogens. A characteristic feature of pilus assembly in Gram-positive bacteria is the involvement of cysteine transpeptidases called 2 ̆ 7 sortases 2 ̆ 7. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the model organism utilized in this thesis has six sortase enzymes (Srt A, B, C, D, E and F) and assembles three distinct pilus structures designated as the SpaABC, SpaDEF and SpaHIG type pili. With the exception of the presumed 2 ̆ 7 housekeeping 2 ̆ 7 sortase SrtF, the other five 2 ̆ 7 pilus-specific 2 ̆ 7 sortases are organized into gene clusters along with the pilin substrates they help polymerize. Current models of pilus assembly in Gram-positive bacteria propose a specific biochemical basis for sortase-substrate interaction. In this model, the active site cysteine of sortase attacks the Thr-Gly junction of the LPXTG sorting signal motif of the substrate pilin causing the formation of a thioester linkage between the two proteins. The resulting sortase-substrate complex {{is referred to as the}} 2 ̆ 7 acyl enzyme intermediate 2 ̆ 7 and it is speculated to serve as the pilus assembly core. However, experimental evidence for this complex was lacking. Pilus assembly models also suggest that pilus polymers that are synthesized on different pilus assembly cores are ultimately transferred to a 2 ̆ 7 housekeeping sortase 2 ̆ 7 which then anchors them to the cell wall. However, systematic biochemical and genetic investigation of the housekeeping sortase 2 ̆ 7 s function in pilus assembly was also lacking. The thesis work presented herein addresses the role of the housekeeping sortase SrtF and the mechanistic basis of the SrtA-SpaA reaction and their relevance to pilus assembly in C. diphtheria. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Studies {{have shown}} {{increased}} prevalence of osteoporosis and {{increased risk for}} vertebral fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine anterior-posterior (AP) projection {{may be difficult to}} interpret due to the ligamentous calcifications, and the lateral projection might be a better measuring site. Our objectives were to investigate BMD changes after 5 years at different measuring sites in patients with AS and to evaluate disease-related variables and medications as predictors for BMD changes. Methods: In a longitudinal study, BMD in Swedish AS patients, 50 +/- 13 years old, was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the hip, the lumbar spine AP and lateral projections, and the total radius at baseline and after 5 years. Patients were assessed with questionnaires, blood samples, and spinal radiographs for grading of AS-related alterations in the spine with the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) and assessment of vertebral fractures by the Genant score. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate predictors for BMD changes. Results: Of 204 patients included at baseline, 168 (82 %) were re-examined after 5 years (92 men and 76 women). BMD decreased significantly at the femoral neck and radius and increased significantly at the lumbar spine, both for AP and lateral <b>projections.</b> Mean C-reactive <b>protein</b> during follow-up predicted a decrease in the femoral neck BMD (change in %, beta = - 0. 15, p = 0. 046). Use of bisphosphonates predicted an increase in BMD at all measuring sites (p < 0. 001 to 0. 013), except for the total radius. Use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) predicted an increase in AP spinal BMD (beta = 3. 15, p = 0. 012). Conclusion: The current study (which has a long follow-up, many measuring sites, and is the first to longitudinally assess the lateral projection of the spine in AS patients) surprisingly showed that lateral projection spinal BMD increased. This study suggests that the best site to assess bone loss in AS patients is the femoral neck and that inflammation has an adverse effect, and the use of bisphosphonates and TNFi has a positive effect, on BMD in AS patients...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical {{research}} has been undergoing a quasi-revolution with {{the dawn of the}} genomics era. The flood of sequence data from the various genome projects, the task of cataloging the entire coding portion of a genome instead of identifying and characterizing individual genes, as well as technical demands accompanying these developments have posed great challenges to the research community. Although the entire human genome sequence has been virtually recorded, fundamental issues remain about the precise number of protein coding genes, as well as their functional characterization. Available resources for the study of human gene function include large genome annotation pipelines, expression profiling data, and protein interaction screens. To gain biological insights from this maze of data, one must both find mechanisms to organize the information and assess the quality of the results. This thesis focuses on the functional annotation of sparsely characterized human genes and their encoded proteins. The work includes four stages: I. Gene expression profiling II. Assessment of the level of characterization of human genes III. <b>Projection</b> of <b>protein</b> networks from lower eukaryotes onto human IV. Integration of computational and experimental results for data mining. Initially, a cross-platform comparison for a set of gene expression profiling techniques was carried out to compare the performance of cutting-edge high-throughput methods and conventional approaches in terms of sensitivity, reliability, and throughput. In this study, we demonstrated that correlation between the different methods was poor and thus multi-technique validation was justified. Nonetheless, the strongest correlation between the new reference data in our report, i. e., a collection of traditional Northern blots, was observed with microarray-based technologies. The assessment of the level of functional characterization of human genes was addressed in the second study, where we developed a scoring system to quantify the annotation status of each human gene. We created a metric to effectively predict the characterization status of human genes based on a set of predictors from the GeneLynx database ([URL] This scoring function will not only assist the targeted analysis of groups of sparsely annotated genes and proteins, but will prove itself useful in the monitoring of long-term gene annotation efforts and the overall annotation status of the human genome. Comparative genomics efforts to transfer gene annotation from proteins in amenable model organisms onto human proteins are currently restricted by the limited availability of experimental data. Nonetheless, we demonstrated how protein networks could be effectively projected from lower eukaryotes onto human and how the confidence in these projections increased with redundantly detected protein interactions. This so-called Interolog Analysis offers promise for reliable inference of protein function. The bioinformatics system we created (Ulysses) provides a novel intuitive interface for biologists studying human proteins. As data depth and coverage will increase over time, this system will prove to be valuable in the extended prediction of high-confidence functional associations of a large portion of human genes. The fusion of experimental data and computational predictions is a central goal of functional genomics. We constructed a bioinformatics workbench for the study of uncharacterized human gene families. By assembling bioinformatics resources and experimental results in a common space, the NovelFam 3000 system facilitates functional characterization. Working with a collection of uncharacterized genes, we demonstrated how bioinformatics methods can lead to novel inferences about cellular function of specific protein families. This thesis unites the identification of uncharacterized human genes, the assessment of genomics data quality, and the application of high-throughput data for the inference of protein function...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis is {{characterized}} by synovial joint degeneration, and its cardinal pathological feature is degeneration and loss of the articular cartilage joint surface. While the aetiology of osteoarthritis is unknown, risk factors include gender, age, obesity, and prior joint injury. Joint injuries, including tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, increase the risk {{for the development of}} OA and involve both mechanical damage to cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissues, and tissue degradation associated with cytokine-induced inflammation. While the role of inflammatory cytokines in OA is still controversial, their role in rheumatoid arthritis is evidenced by the successful use of anti-TNF-ca and anti-IL- 1 therapies to abrogate disease symptoms and progression. In vitro, both IL- 13 and TNF-ca promote chondrocyte-mediated matrix degradation and inhibit cartilage matrix synthesis, while mechanical damage causes cell death, matrix damage, and decreased cell biosynthesis. Understanding the similarities and differences in cartilage responses to inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury is important in understanding the catabolic-anabolic shifts that typify OA progression. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were (1) to identify the role of TNF-a and IL- 1 induced nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of cartilage tissue damage;(cont.) (2) to characterize and compare the regulation by IL- 1 P, TNF-cc, and mechanical injury of secreted factors, matrix degradation, and mechanisms of chondrocyte cell death using an SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS protein profiling approach; and (3) to further quantify the effects of IL- 1 3, TNF-ca and injury using an isobaric isotope labeling (iTRAQ) based 2 D-LC/MS/MS approach. Together these studies were designed to provide better understanding of matrix degradation, cell death, immune response, and evidence of cell-mediated repair processes. NO is produced by chondrocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL- 1 3 and IL- 17, and can mediate cellular and extracellular events through cGMP signaling, protein modifications (e. g., S-nitrosation or tyrosine nitration), altered transcript stability, and altered sugar and lipid chemistry. Cartilage was treated with IL- 13 or TNF-ca left untreated in {{the presence or absence of}} the NO synthase inhibitor, L-N-methylarginine (L-NMA), and changes in gene expression and matrix breakdown were measured. We found that L-NMA treatment partially inhibited TNF-a-induced, aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation as indicated by a decrease in sGAG loss to the medium and by an increase in the generation of aggrecanase-specific aggrecan fragments. (cont.) No change was observed upon addition of L-NMA to IL- 1 P treated explants, but addition of L-NMA to combined IL- 1 3 and TNF-a treated explants increased sGAG loss, suggesting that the effects of NO may be contextual. We hypothesized that this might be due to differences in aggrecanase expression (ADAMTS 4 vs. ADAMTS 5) or post-translational modification, but no aggrecanase was consistently identified in the samples. No difference in MMP expression or activation was noted following addition of L-NMA, and no change in NO chemistry between IL- 1 3 and TNF-a treatment was evident by nitrate and nitrite production. Gene expression analysis was conducted on a battery of 32 genes, including matrix proteins, inflammatory mediators, proteases, cytokines and growth factors, and housekeeping proteins. While IL- 113 and TNF-a both increased the expression of proteases and inflammatory mediators, addition of L-NMA did not significantly affect expression of the genes tested. We concluded that the effects of TNF-a and IL- 1 p-induced NO production may depend on differences in cellular responses to each of these cytokines and possibly to differences in signaling or aggrecanase expression. (cont.) In the second study, newborn bovine calf cartilage explants were treated with 10 ng/ml IL- 1 p, 100 ng/ml TNF-a, radially-unconfined injurious compression (strain: 50 %; strain rate 1000 /o/sec), or no treatment, and cultured for five days. Pooled medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS, and data were analyzed by Spectrum Mill proteomics software, focusing on protein identification, differences between treatments and matrix protein proteolysis. Over 250 proteins were identified among the four protein groups including CD 109, platelet derived growth factor like protein, and scrapie responsive protein, which have not been previously identified in cartilage. IL- 13 and TNF-a caused an increase in YKL 39, YKL 40, complement factor B, MMP- 3, ECM- 1, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A 3, and clusterin. Injurious compression caused the release of intracellular proteins including GRP 58, GRP 78, alpha 4 actinin, pyruvate kinase, and vimentin, suggesting a loss of membrane integrity in a population of chondrocytes. Data on actin release within the first 24 hours suggested that this loss of membrane integrity occurred by mechanical cell disruption. Injurious compression also caused proteolysis of collagen type VI subunits, collagen type II, and COMP. Thrombospondin 1 fragments were seen in all treatment groups, and aggrecan proteolysis was predominant with cytokine treatment. (cont.) Cartilage explants subjected to injurious compression released intracellular proteins and showed enhanced degradation of matrix proteins, while explants subjected to IL- 13 or TNF-ct released proteins involved in innate immunity and stress response. In the third study, cartilage explants were subjected to injurious compression, TNF-a (100 ng/ml) or IL- 13 (10 ng/ml), or no treatment, cultured in equal volumes of medium, and the medium was collected, pooled and the proteins deglycosylated by treatment with chondroitinase ABC. The proteins were subjected to trypsinization, and the peptides were labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels each containing a unique signature ion. The labeled peptides were subjected to nano- 2 D-LC/MS/MS on a QStar, quadrupole time of flight instrument. The study was done in analytical replicate on a pooled sample of greater than 70 explants from a total of 6 - 12 different animals. Data were analyzed by ProQuant to obtain a ProGroup peptide report containing identified spectra, which were combined to achieve a peptide, and then a protein level output of mean ratios, standard deviations of those ratios, and significance based on either Wilcoxan sign rank or Student's t-test both corrected for multiple comparisons. (cont.) Because of our interest in catabolic and anabolic shifts, a targeted data analysis approach was taken in addition to a systems level PCA and K-means clustering approach. By focusing on particular protein domains, we identified a decrease in the synthesis of most fibrillar collagen subunits (p< 0. 05), and an increase in the release of the aggrecan G 2 and G 3 domains with IL- 13 and TNF-ta treatment (p< 0. 05). We also noted a significant increase in MMP- 1, MMP- 3, MMP- 9, and MMP- 13 in at least one condition and, in most cases, all conditions compared to the untreated sample. Increases in proteins involved in innate immunity and immune cell recruitment were noted with IL- 1 [3 and TNF-a treatment, while an increase in intracellular protein release was seen most dramatically with mechanical compression injury. Since anabolic effects are often driven by the insulin-like growth factor family and the TGF-[3 superfamily, we specifically identified members of these pathways to understand which factors may mediate early repair processes. (cont.) At the systems level, 2 principal components were sufficient to describe 97 % of the covariance in the data. IL- 1 and TNF-a caused a similar response in proteins identified; in contrast, a 'Y'-shaped distribution was observed upon <b>projection</b> of <b>proteins</b> based on their response injury vs. cytokine treatment. K-means clustering revealed six main clusters to further characterize the biology of mechanical injury versus cytokine effects on cartilage. by Anna L. Stevens. Thesis (Ph. D.)
