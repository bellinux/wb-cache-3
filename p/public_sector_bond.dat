40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the impact of {{quantitative}} easing on <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>bond</b> yields of selected countries in the world. It mentions channels of standard monetary policy tools and channels of quantitative easing, which can be included among unconventional monetary policy tools. This thesis analyses the impacts of quantitative easing, which was done by the Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. Firstly, all these institutions fought against the financial crisis with standard monetary policy tools. However, those tools were not very effective, therefore the institutions moved to non-standard tools. After the analysis based on event-study method was carried out, it was found out that mainly the first announcements about the policy of quantitative easing were always the most effective in decreasing government bond yield. The subsequent expansion of the policy of quantitative easing did not have such impact. The main benefit of this thesis is in the examination of the impact of later statements regarding quantitative easing on government bond yield, which were not effective in decreasing government bond yield...|$|E
40|$|This study empirically {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} bond market development in {{a cross section of}} 23 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries between 1990 and 2008. It considers the stage of development {{and the size of the}} bond market, as well as the historical, structural, institutional and macroeconomic factors driving bond market development in SSA. The study finds that the savings constraint is a key impediment to domestic bond markets development as well as financial market deepening, as it results in a low level of financial intermediation by the banks. Overall, the results show that a confluence of factors matters for the development of domestic bond markets in SSA; these include structure of the economy, investment profile, law and order, size of the banking sector, the level of economic development, and various macroeconomic factors. Policy implications include increased efforts to strengthen the investment environment and the need for a regional approach to bond market development.

Although {{the external}} current account shifted to a moderate deficit, mainly reflecting the recovery in imports, export performance has been robust, and {{gross international reserves}} are now about three-fourths their pre-crisis level. The authorities’ program appropriately focuses on fiscal consolidation keeping inflation low through prudent monetary policy, promoting sound credit flows in a strengthened financial system, and other growth-oriented reforms. Key to maintaining macrostability will be achieving sufficiently large primary surpluses over the medium term to keep the public debt on a firm downward path.

We also document that government interventions in the banking sector deteriorate the credit risk of sovereign debt. Higher risk premium required by investors for holding riskier government bonds depresses the sovereign debt market, it impairs banks’ balance sheets, and it depresses the collateral value of loans leading to bank retrenchment. The ensuing two-way banking-fiscal feedback loop indicates that government interventions do not necessarily stabilize the banking sector...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} European {{economic}} integration slackened in the 1960 s. National markets for goods, most services and labour {{were not being}} integrated {{because they were not}} really being liberalised. The exception to this rule was financial services, one of which - the sale of long-term corporate and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>bonds</b> to relatively wealthy investors - became integrated in a quite novel way {{in the course of the}} 1960 s. The rise of the so-called 'Eurobond' market was a major breakthrough in the history of European integration but it was a largely spontaneous result of innovation by private sector actors, led by Siegmund Warburg. In some measure, no doubt, the bankers' primary motive was the profit motive. Yet there is also compelling evidence that Warburg and his associates also had a political agenda. They regarded it not only as a way of making money, but also as a potent device for advancing Europe's political integration. In particular, they appreciated that European capital market integration could reinforce the case for British membership of the EEC. The resurrection of London as Europe's principal financial centre, even at a time of economic and exchange rate weakness, was a major achievement in its own right. But it was also a crucial for the resumption of European integration in the 1970 s. bank operations, government bonds, international bonds, international capital market, economic history,...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Finance & Investment)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2013. This {{research}} studies {{the bond market}} in South Africa and other emerging bond markets. Comparison {{will be made to}} distinguish the South African bond market from the East Asian and Latin American bond markets. Private and <b>public</b> <b>sectors</b> use <b>bond</b> markets to raise capital either for investment or current expenditures; to measure the effectiveness of the bond market, the criterion used are Liquidity, Diversified investor base, Sound regulatory and legal framework and Well coverage of Maturity Structure and reliable bond yield curve. This paper will make use of the Efficiency Market Hypothesis to test the South African bond market and prove that it is a weak-form efficient. The concept of the efficient market hypothesis theory asserts that the financial markets are informational efficient. There are three common forms of markets stated in the efficient market hypothesis, i. e. weak form efficient market, semi-strong form efficient market and strong form efficient market. These three forms of the efficient market imply that the price cannot be forecast. In order to test the efficiency of the selected bonds, two models will be used in this paper, i. e. simple regression model with time varying parameters and test of evolving efficiency (TEE). The simple regression model cannot capture the nature of the returns on assets, because it assumes that the variance of the return is constant, thus cannot detect changes in efficiency of the market; whereas the TEE, using a GARCH approach with time-varying parameters, is able to capture changes in weak-form efficiency of market through time. However, the GARCH model requires the underlying series to be stationary and a conditional variance that is not constant...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the importance of knowledge management in Slovenian <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> organizations. Knowledge management has received a lot of attention in the past two decades, however in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> it is still under-researched. The global financial and economic crisis revealed some important organizational weaknesses in the Republic of Slovenia, some particularly due to the ineffectiveness of the Slovenian <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> which ranks amongst the worst in the Euro zone. Authors argue that a stronger commitment to knowledge management, which is currently unused in the Slovenian <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> represents an opportunity to coordinate and exploit <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> organizational knowledge resources. After analysing existing literature, authors have identified examples of good practices from foreign countries that could be partially transferred and adapted into the Slovenian environment. Since the efficient use of knowledge is linked to the performance of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> organizations, the paper suggests that successful implementation of knowledge management initiatives should result in a more efficient <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> and, indirectly, in improved international <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> competitiveness rankings.

For the analysis of implemented changes a comparison with International <b>Public</b> <b>Sector</b> Accounting Standards (so-called IPSAS), which represent the most professional source for accrual accoun-ting methods applicable in the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> was used. The reporting is examined by using several cases occurring within specific entities of <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> At the final part of the thesis the newly introduced accounting methods are evaluated and the differences from the International <b>Public</b> <b>Sector</b> Accounting Standards (IPSAS) are identified...|$|R
40|$|Accounting and {{budgeting}} {{systems at}} all government levels and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> entities in Europe have undergone substantial reforms under the New Public Management paradigm {{and a great}} variety of accounting and audit practices have been implemented in governments and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> entities throughout Europe. As a consequence, the harmonization of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> accounting in European Union Member States has been introduced into the EU political agenda. The chapter aims to synthetize the state-of-the-art in <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> accounting, budgeting, and auditing in some European countries while in parallel to take stock of the main challenges that <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> accounting faces in Europe.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} relationship between <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> motivation and development. In the model the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> produces a <b>public</b> good and workers are heterogeneous in terms of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> motivation (PSM). Wages in the private sector are increasing in the quality of the public good. In this context, <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage premia (PSWP) have two opposite effects: low PSWP help screen workers with PSM into the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> while high PSWP help motivate workers to be honest. Raising PSWP may not improve the quality of governance and multiple equilibria might arise. The model highlights that the relative importance of workers selection and provision of "on the job" incentives in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> varies in systematic ways with wages in the private sector. I provide anecdotal and original empirical evidence consistent with the theoretical predictions and discuss some policy implications for <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> reforms in developing countries. corruption; developing countries; multiple equilibria; <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> motivation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> labor {{relations}} is best understood in {{a framework that}} focuses on unions' ability to shift demand curves rather than to raise wages, {{as is the case}} in the private sector. It reviews the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> labor relations literature and finds that: (i) <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> unionism has flourished as a result of changes in laws; (2) the effects of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> unions on wages are likely to have been underestimated; (3) <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> unions have a somewhat different effect on wage structures than do private sector unions; (4) compulsory arbitration reduces strikes with no clearcut impact on the level of wage settlements; (5) <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> unions have diverse effects on non-wage outcomes as do private sector unions. In terms of evaluating <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> unionism, the paper argues that by raising both the cost of public services (taxes) and the amount of services <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> unionism involves a different welfare calculus than private sector unionism. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{starts with}} a brief and concise {{definition}} of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> ethics. It traces the origin of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> ethics in the United Kingdom (UK). Also, corruption and unethical conduct amongst others are in focus too. An analysis of the expected ethical standards in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> and mechanisms used to maintain such standards are also in focus. The mechanisms include codes of conduct {{and the use of}} regulatory bodies. To remedy the defects inherent in the extant <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> ethics in the UK, some recommendations will be made. The conclusion will posit that the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> in the UK has higher ethical standards than the private or business sector in the UK. This paper is a general review of the extant literature on <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> ethics in the United Kingdom and its main finding is that <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> ethics {{are an integral part of}} the organizational structure of the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> in the United Kingdom...|$|R
