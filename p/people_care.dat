25|$|A {{number of}} {{assumptions}} underlie their game theoretic model, {{and allow for}} the authors' simplified model of society. First, Acemoglu and Robinson assume that society is simply divided between a small rich class and a large poor class. Second, they assume that regimes must be either democratic or nondemocratic; {{there is nothing in}} between. Third, people's preferences in society are defined only by monetary redistribution from the rich ruling class. The more monetary benefits they get, the more they prefer the ruling class. Fourth, <b>people</b> <b>care</b> not only about redistribution today but also redistribution in the future. Therefore, people would not only want more redistribution today but also they want to see a guarantee for more or stable redistribution in the future. Fifth, the economic output of a country fluctuates year by year, which means revolution is less costly for the ruling class during economic downturn. Finally and most importantly, each individual in the society tries to maximize their own utility.|$|E
25|$|Kamui's {{decisions}} reflects one of X main themes {{which is}} {{caring for the}} humans even if does not help the Earth. While Ohkawa considers it common sense that <b>people</b> <b>care</b> about protecting the planet, {{it is more important}} loving friends and relatives. Ohkawa also applied to Kamui and Fuma ideas she had during middle school such as the fact that both possess a dual nature as she states people can be considered good or evil. As a result of Kamui losing Kotori and all his relatives, Ohkawa placed emphasis on Kamui's friendship with Fuuma as she believes his feelings have become stronger. Across the manga, Kamui meets Subaru Sumeragi whose rivalry with Seishiro Sakurazuka serves as parallel to Kamui's rivalry with Fuma Monou. Clamp referred to Kamui and Subaru as siblings; Kamui is supposed to learn from their Subaru's final fight with Seishiro and avoid his final fight against Fuuma have the same tragic conclusion.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to [...] "You're Getting Old" [...] was positive. Critics {{pointed to}} the self-referencing aim of the episode in growing older and redefining senses of humor as well as cynicism. While Ramsey Isler of IGN found the episode to be largely humorless and monotonous, he {{interpreted}} this as intentional {{on the part of}} the show's creators, who he believed had grown weary of creating the series. Isler called the final moments of the episode [...] "the most somber material the series has ever produced... providing the emotional soundtrack for a montage of images that just rip the heart out of any South Park fan", giving the episode an 8.5/10. HitFix's review on the episode focused on its personal philosophic themes, with reviewer Alan Sepinwall stating [...] "But what was interesting about Stan's existential crisis, and how he struggled to like anything, is that the show's philosophy has often largely been about how other <b>people</b> <b>care</b> too much about things... Yet here, Stan's lack of passion – and the Marsh parents' – was clearly shown to be a bad thing for them." ...|$|E

500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other <b>people</b> <b>care</b> too much about things, and {{that many of our}} big problems and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{school to}} work {{transition}} {{for young people}} in state care: Perspectives from young people, carers and professionals Workforce participation has many positive effects on quality of life.

A mixed-method study conducted in Australia about career development for young <b>people</b> in <b>care</b> investigated how this population develops ideas about future work: the social and cognitive variables that influence career decision-making; practices for preparing young <b>people</b> in <b>care</b> for the transition to work or further education; and factors that support or impede the transition.

Interview data {{were obtained from the}} multiple perspectives of young <b>people</b> in <b>care,</b> foster carers, caseworkers and school personnel.
