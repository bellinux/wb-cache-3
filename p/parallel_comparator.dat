40|$|Existing SIMD {{extensions}} cannot efficiently vectorize the histogram function due {{to memory}} collisions. We propose two techniques {{to avoid this}} problem. In the first, a hierarchical structure of three levels is proposed. In order to provide n-way parallelism, auxiliary arrays that have n and n/ 2 subarrays {{are used in the}} first and second level, respectively. The last level has the primary histogram array. Indirect SIMD load and store instructions are designed in order to access different elements of different subarrays. The different subarrays in the lower levels are merged and finally at the end, the calculated results are stored in the primary histogram array. In the second method, <b>parallel</b> <b>comparators</b> are used in order to count the number of subwords within a media register that are the same. Thereafter, these numbers are added to the values of the histogram array simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract—The RSA public-key {{cryptosystem}} is an algorithm {{that converts}} input data to an unrecognizable encryption and converts the unrecognizable data {{back into its}} original decryption form. The security of the RSA public-key cryptosystem {{is based on the}} difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. This paper demonstrates to factor the product of two large prime numbers, and is a breakthrough in basic biological operations using a molecular computer. In order to achieve this, we propose three DNA-based algorithms for parallel subtractor, <b>parallel</b> <b>comparator,</b> and parallel modular arithmetic that formally verify our designed molecular solutions for factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Furthermore, this work indicates that the cryptosystems using public-key are perhaps insecure and also presents clear evidence of the ability of molecular computing to perform complicated mathematical operations.

40|$|As {{the density}} of {{memories}} increases, unwanted interference between cells and the coupling noise between bit-lines become significant, requiring parallel testing. Testing high-density memories for {{a high degree of}} fault coverage requires either a relatively large number of test vectors or a significant amount of additional test circuitry. This paper proposes a new tiling method and an efficient built-in self-test (BIST) algorithm for neighborhood pattern-sensitive faults (NPSFs) and new neighborhood bit-line sensitive faults (NBLSFs). Instead of the conventional five-cell and nine-cell physical neighborhood layouts to test memory cells, a four-cell layout is utilized. This four-cell layout needs smaller test vectors, provides easier hardware implementation, and is more appropriate for both NPSFs and NBLSFs detection. A CMOS column decoder and the <b>parallel</b> <b>comparator</b> proposed by P. Mazumder are modified to implement the test procedure. Consequently, these reduce the number of transistors used for a BIST circuit. Also, we present algorithm properties such as the capability to detect stuck-at faults, transition faults, conventional pattern-sensitive faults, and neighborhood bit-line sensitive faults...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{approaches to}} the interpretation and analysis an event that is poised between reality and performance. It focuses upon a real event witnessed by the author while driving out of Los Angeles, USA. A body hanging on a rope from a bridge some 25 / 30 feet above the freeway held up the traffic. The status of the body was unclear. Was it the corpse of a dead human being or a stuffed dummy, a simulation of a death? Was it is tragic accident or suicide {{or was it a}} stunt, a protest or a performance? Whether a real body or not, it was an event: it drew an audience, it took place in a defined public space bound by time and it disrupted everyday normality and the familiar. The article debates how approaches to performance can engage with a shocking event, such as the Hanging Man, and the frameworks of interpretation that can be brought to bear on it. The analysis takes account of the function of memory in reconstructing the event, and the paradigms of cultural knowledge that offered themselves as <b>parallels,</b> <b>comparators</b> or distinctions against which the experience could be measured, such as the incidents of self-immolation related to demonstrations against the Vietnam War, the protest by the Irish Hunger Strikers and the visual impact of Anthony Gormley’s 2007 work, 'Event Horizon'. Theoretical frameworks deriving from analytical approaches to performance, media representation and ethical dilemmas are evaluated as means to assimilate an indeterminate and challenging event, and the notion of what an ‘event’ may be is itself addressed. ...|$|R

METHODS: 18 healthy volunteers received single subcutaneous rising doses (0. 5, 1. 66 or 5 million international units, MIU) of AVI- 005. A randomized <b>parallel</b> <b>comparator</b> group of 10 subjects received 5 MIU of unglycosylated IFN-alpha 2 b (Intron A). The pharmacokinetic parameters t 1 / 2, tmax, Cmax, AUC 0 - 24 h, Vd, and clearance were compared between AVI- 005 and unglycosylated IFN-alpa 2 b. RESULTS: At equipotent doses, AVI- 005 had a larger AUC 0 - 24 h than the control interferon. Pharmacodynamic markers ofneopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin for the two treatments were similar. These markers were increased by AVI- 005 in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacodynamic responses to treatment with AVI- 005 were shown by the change in mRNA expression for interferon inducible protein kinase and 22 ̆ 752 ̆ 7 -oligoadenylate synthetase.

40|$|When {{working with}} 0. 18 mum or smaller CMOS technologies, current larger {{technology}} architectures {{are not easily}} scaled and subject to short channel effects. As a result, changes in architecture and/or unconventional transistor sizing must be done. The voltage comparator that has been designed consists of (13) transistors to form the following architectures; a differential input pair, a current mirror and a rail-pulling output stage. Special transistor sizing {{has been used in}} the current mirror biasing stage to produce a constant current source for biasing of the input transistors, overcoming the problems of non-constant current and non-constant transconductance due to short channel effects. The performance of the voltage comparator has been verified via software simulations and compared with current state-of-the-art designs. The design has been submitted to the Canadian Microelectronics Corporation for fabrication under the design name ICFWRJSS. The packaged design with bonding pads, occupies an area of 0. 26 mm 2, and is contained in a DIP package. The fabricated chip is expected to arrive at the University in August of 2003. Actual physical testing of the voltage comparator will take place at that time. In addition to the design of the voltage comparator a detailed design methodology has also been developed. The design methodology has been developed in <b>parallel</b> with the <b>comparator</b> design and describes the major steps and considerations taken while designing the voltage comparator.

Upstream and catheter laboratory-initiated GPI were assumed to be tirofiban and abciximab, respectively. Life expectancy of first-year survivors, unit costs, and health-state utilities came from United Kingdom sources. Costs and effects were discounted at 3. 5 %. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. ResultsHigher acquisition costs for bivalirudin were partially offset by lower hospitalization and bleeding costs. In the ACUITY-based analysis, per-patient lifetime costs in the bivalirudin and heparin plus GPI strategies were £ 10, 903 and £ 10, 653, respectively. Patients survived 10. 87 and 10. 82 years on average, corresponding to 5. 96 and 5. 93 QALYs and resulting in an ICER of £ 9, 906 per QALY gained. The GRACE-based ICER was £ 12, 276 per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 72. 1 % and 67. 0 % of simulation results were more cost-effective than £ 20, 000 per QALY gained, in the ACUITY-based and GRACE-based analyses, respectively. Additional scenario analyses implied that greater cost-effectiveness may be achieved in actual clinical practice.
