40|$|Spinal pathologies or {{injuries}} can severely {{compromise the}} quality of life for the patients. The surgical intervention is often performed using internal fixation devices. Fixation with pedicle screws is a well-established method providing spinal stability and deformity correction. However, reported rates of fixation failure because of screw loosening have become a major concern, especially with the appearance of new and more powerful surgical techniques. Numerous experimental studies have been devoted to pedicle screw fixation strength evaluation. The evaluation methods are commonly including preoperative measurements of bone mineral density, screw insertional torque measurement and pullout tests. Bone mineral density measurement gives only to some extent an estimation of the pedicle screw fixation strength. Several studies indicated that the screw insertional torque measurement can provide predictive information on the fixation strength. However, the latter was not confirmed by other studies. This controversy illustrates the need for improving the understanding of factors related to pedicle screw fixation strength. In addition, there is a need for better understanding the mechanisms of pedicle screw loosening leading to failure and their effects on the fixation strength. The main objective of this doctoral thesis was to improve the understanding on the mechanisms of pedicle screw loosening and the factors related to pedicle screw fixation strength. This objective is related to two hypotheses: 1) the indentation force measured while performing the pilot hole and the torque observed during screw insertion are related to the screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness; 2) cyclic bending load (toggling) on pedicle screw in craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral (ML) directions loosens the screw and affects the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness. Three specific objectives were defined to verify the hypotheses using two experimental protocols. The first specific objective was to develop and validate tools measuring the indentation force while performing the pilot hole and the insertional torque during pedicle screw insertion. The second objective was to compare the screw loosening mechanisms through toggling in different modes and evaluate their effects on pedicle screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness. Finally, the third objective was to establish the relationships between the indentation force, the insertional torque and the screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness. The first protocol was performed on synthetic bone surrogates mainly to explore the first specific objective. Furthermore, to account for the effect of various bone densities and toggling modes on <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness, pedicle screw were pulled out with and without toggling from synthetic bone surrogates of three different densities. With five repetitions, a total of 36 trials have been completed. Finally, potential relationships between the indentation force and the insertional torque with the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness were explored. The second protocol was performed on porcine vertebrae to investigate the second and the third specific objectives. As the second specific objective, three toggling modes (CC, ML and no toggling (NT)) were performed on porcine lumbar vertebrae ranging from L 1 to L 3. The screws were then submitted to axial pullout test. A complete design of experiment with two factors and three levels (32 = 9 trials) was used to investigate on the main effect of toggling mode and vertebral level on screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness, as well as their quadratic interactions. With five repetitions, a total of 54 trials were performed on 27 isolated vertebrae, using both pedicles. Finally, potential relationships were investigated between the indentation force while performing a pilot hole, the insertional torque during screw insertion, and the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness with and without toggling. The results of the first protocol suggest that screw toggling significantly affects the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> (P = 0. 01) and stiffness (P < 0. 0001). A higher <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness was demonstrated for higher density without toggling. The effect of density was higher than the effect of toggling on <b>pullout</b> <b>force.</b> The indentation force while performing the pilot hole was significantly correlated to <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness (r = 0. 99, P < 0. 0001 and r = 0. 92, P < 0. 0001 respectively). Strong correlations were also shown between the insertional torque during screw insertion and the pedicle screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 0001 and r = 0. 91, P < 0. 0001 respectively). The study on porcine vertebrae showed that screw toggling significantly affects the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> (P = 0. 0004) and stiffness (P 0. 85, P < 0. 0001). For <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> without toggling BMD and pedicle area were the main contributing factors to the regression model. For the stiffness with and without toggling, the indentation force was the single best factor with highest contribution to the regression model. In conclusion, pedicle screw toggling significantly affects the pedicle screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness. Screw toggling, in particular CC toggling, should be considered in the biomechanical evaluation of pedicle screw fixation strength. Furthermore, the contribution of toggling was more important on the stiffness than the <b>pullout</b> <b>force.</b> The effect of vertebral level should be considered in determining the fixation strength. The developed instruments and methods for indentation force measurement during pilot hole creation and insertional torque measurement during screw insertion were reproducible, and provide valuable data to estimate pedicle screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness. The relationship between the pilot hole indentation force and screw insertional torque, and the screw <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and stiffness are a affected by the toggling mode. Indentation force and insertional torque measurements, together with BMD measurement, are recommended for a better estimation of pedicle screw fixation strength after CC toggling...|$|E

They clearly show that the dynamic <b>pullout</b> <b>forces</b> and curves are well above the static ones, and that the pullout work of bond failure is considerably greater for the dynamic impact loading. Confinement, provided by a steel tube, leads to improved bonding; peak loads increase up to 2. 5 times. The effects of bond length and concrete strength have also been put into evidence. Finally it has been verified that post-installed rebars, depending upon the particular adhesive employed, can achieve the same bond resistance as the cast-in-place ones. JRC. DG.

40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There is no {{universal}} consensus {{regarding the}} biomechanical aspects and relevance on the primary stability of misplaced pedicle screws. PURPOSE: The study is aimed to {{the determination of}} the correlation between axial <b>pullout</b> <b>forces</b> of pedicle screws with the possible screw misplacement, including mild and severe cortical violations. METHODS: Eighty-eight monoaxial pedicle screws were implanted into 44 porcine lumbar vertebral bodies, paying attention on trying to obtain a wide range of placement accuracy. After screw implantation, all specimens underwent a spiral computed tomography scan, and the screw placements were graded following the scales of Laine et al. and Abul Kasim et al. Axial pullout tests were then performed on a servohydraulic material testing system. RESULTS: Decreasing <b>pullout</b> <b>forces</b> were determined for screws implanted with increasing cortical violation. A smaller influence of cortical violations in the medial direction with respect to the lateral direction was observed. Screws implanted with a large cortical violation and misplacement in the craniocaudal direction were found to be significantly less stable than screws having comparable cortical violation but in a centered sagittal position. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide adjunctive criteria to evaluate more accurately the fate of a spine instrumentation. Particular care should be placed in the screw evaluation regarding the craniocaudal positioning and alignment...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to the design}} of a finite-element model {{simulating}} accurately the pullout behaviour of cylindrical pedicle screws and predicting their <b>pullout</b> <b>force.</b> Three commercial pedicle screws, subjected to pure pullout from synthetic bone, were studied experimentally. The results were used for the design, calibration and validation of a finite-element model. Special attention was paid to the accurate simulation of the failure inside the host material under shear. For this purpose, a bilinear cohesive zone material model was adopted, controlling the mode-II debonding of neighbouring elements {{in the vicinity of the}} screw. Comparison between experimental and numerical results proved that the implementation of this approach can significantly enhance the accuracy of the numerical simulation of a screw's mechanical behaviour under pure pullout loads. The numerical model was used for the parametric study of various factors affecting the pullout performance of a cylindrical pedicle screw. It was concluded that the major parameter influencing the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> is the outer radius (increasing its value by 36 % increases the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> by 34 %). The influence of the purchase length of the screw is of similar quantitative nature. The respective dependence on the thread inclination, depth and pitch was significantly weaker. (C) 2009 IPEM.

40|$|The risk of cut-out of a {{pedicle screw}} {{is high in}} the {{presence}} of osteoporotic bone. In cadaver studies it was found that cement augmentation of pedicle screws markedly increases <b>pullout</b> <b>forces.</b> However, the use of conventional low viscosity vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty cement is associated with the risk of cement extravasation. The risk might be reduced by using high viscosity, radiofrequency-activated bone cement. After performing DEXA scans, six fresh-frozen vertebral bodies of different bone densities were obtained from cadavers. Two pedicle screws (WSI Expertise-Inject, Peter Brehm, Germany) were placed in the pedicles. About 3 ml of radiofrequency- activated, ultra-high viscosity cement (ER 2 Bone Cement, DFine Europe GmbH, Germany) was injected through the right pedicle. The left pedicle screw was left uncemented and served as control. Axial pullout tests were performed using a material testing device (Zwick/Roell Zmartpro, Ulm, Germany). The tests revealed that cementaugmented pedicle screws were able to withstand markedly higher <b>pullout</b> <b>forces.</b> Extravasation of cement did not occur. The value of the study is limited by the fact that only six samples were investigated. Further cadaver studies and clinical evaluation will be needed in the future. However, this pilot study showed that combining cannulated pedicle screws with ultra-high viscosity bone cement is a successful approach.

40|$|Abstract: Riparian {{vegetation}} exerts {{a number}} of mechanical and hydrologic controls on streambank stability, which affect the delivery of sediment to channels. Estimates of root-reinforcement of soils have commonly been attained using perpendicular root models that simply sum root tensile strengths and consider these as an add-on factor to soil strength. A major limitation of such perpendicular models is {{that the effect of}} variations in soil moisture and bank geotechnical properties on root-reinforcement are omitted as root tensile strengths are considered to be independent of soil type and moisture. In reality, during mass failure of a streambank, some roots break, and some roots are pulled out of the soil intact; the relative proportions of roots that break or pull out are determined by soil moisture and shear strength, and root strengths. In this paper an equation to predict the frictional resistance of root-soil bonds was tested against field data collected at Long Creek, MS, under two soil moisture conditions. The root pullout equations were then included in the root-reinforcement model, RipRoot, and bank stability model runs for Goodwin Creek, MS, were carried out in order {{to examine the effects of}} spatial and temporal variations in soil shear strength and rooting density, on streambank factor of safety.

40|$|The porcine {{model is}} {{frequently}} used during development and validation of new spinal devices, {{because of its}} likeness to the human spine. These spinal devices are frequently composed of pedicle screws {{with a reputation for}} stable fixation but which can suffer pullouts during preclinical implantation on young animals, leading to high morbidity. With a view to identifying the best choices to optimize pedicle screw fixation in the porcine model, this study evaluates ex vivo the impact of weight (age) of the animal, the level of the vertebrae (lumbar or thoracic) and the type of screw anchorage (mono- or bi-cortical) on pedicle screw pullouts. Among the 80 pig vertebrae (90 - and 140 -day-old) tested in this study, the average screw <b>pullout</b> <b>forces</b> ranged between 419. 9 N and 1341. 2 N. In addition, statistical differences were found between test groups, pointing out the influence of the three parameters stated above. We found that the the more caudally the screws are positioned (lumbar level), the greater their pullout resistance is, moreover, screw stability increases with the age, and finally, the screws implanted with a mono-cortical anchorage sustained lower <b>pullout</b> <b>forces</b> than those implanted with a bi-cortical anchorage. We conclude that the best anchorage can be obtained with older animals, using a lumbar fixation and long screws traversing the vertebra and inducing bi-cortical anchorage.

The hydroxyapatite layers are composed of long and thin hydroxyapatite sheets.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research of pullout behavior of geogrid embeded in red clay. An experimental investigation is conducted under eight different moisture {{content of the}} soil. Tests {{results indicate that the}} geogrid mainly represents pullout failure embedded in clay, and the ultimate resistance is water-sensitive. It decreased with the rise of the moisture content firstly, and then tended to a constant around the plastic limit where the ultimate <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> is independent of the normal pressure. The display of strain demonstrates that the decrease of the ultimate <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> is due to the reduction of the friction capability between the soil and geogrid. Besides this, the moisture content influenced the process of the pullout behavior as well. The load-displacement curve can be separated into three parts: linear ascending segment, nonlinear ascending segment and ultimate segment, the increase of moisture content shortened the second segment, which means that the ultimate <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> will be reached soon {{after the end of the}} first segment. A numerical analysis was conducted on the predicting of the pullout resistance, which shows that predicted and measured pullout resistance have a good agreement for the moisture content lower than plastic limit, and the contribution of friction took up more than 90 % of the total resistance.

By varying the overburden pressure, the peak <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and the load-displacement behavior were determined by carrying out pullout tests in a displacement-rate controlled manner. The test results were compared to other published ones. The present results show that the pullout resistance can be interpreted with conventional soil parameters. The effect of retrained dilatancy, which is considered to be the reason for high pullout resistance in dense materials, is negligible in loose fill materials except under very low stress level. Furthermore, pullout resistance increases with overburden pressure opposed to some field test results reported in the literature which show no systematic trend in pullout resistance with overburden pressure.

40|$|Block {{stability}} is common {{and has to}} be studied in detail for designing tunnels. Stability of block depends upon the shape and size of the blocks, stresses around the block and factors such as clamping forces and the ratio between joint stiffness. These factors are studied in detail and are the main objective of this thesis. In this thesis influence of loading and unloading of blocks on joint stiffness and thus on ultimate <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> are analyzed. Normal stress on the joint plane is linked with shear stiffness of the joint and relaxation of forces. Changes of forces were considered to estimate joint stiffness and ultimate <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> using new methods in the present thesis. First method takes into account changing clamping forces considering stiffness ratio constant (Crawford and Bray). The second method was developed in which the ratio between normal and shear stiffness was taken as a function of normal stress (Bagheri and Stille). In third method, gradually <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> is increased which changes the normal stress and joint stiffness. The lower limit of joint stiffness gives a very conservative design. So a stiffness value based on the average of lower and upper limit of normal force has also been considered. A comparison between the new methods and the previous method proposed by Crawford and Bray which considers a constant ratio of normal and shear stiffness and constant clamping forces shows that Crawford and Bray’s solution overestimates the pullout forces hence the design is unsafe.

40|$|The {{technique}} of soil nailing is seldom used in stabilizing loose fill slopes {{because there is}} a lack of understanding of the interaction behaviour of nails in loose fills. A large-scale laboratory apparatus has been built to study the soil-nail interaction in loose fill materials. Pullout tests were performed in a displacement-rate-controlled manner on steel bars embedded in loose, completely decomposed granitic soils. The load-displacement curves have distinct peak values followed by a sharp decrease in the <b>pullout</b> <b>force.</b> The test results also show that the normal stress acting on the nail changes because of the volume-change tendency and arching effect of the soil being sheared around the nail. The post-peak decrease in the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> is mainly due to the reduction in the normal stress caused by the arching effect of soil around the nail.

Objective: To conclude whether the self-tapping insertion technique is indeed the optimum one for self-tapping screws, {{with respect to the}} pullout strength. Summary of Background Data: It is reported in the literature that the size of the pilot-hole significantly influences the pullout {{strength of}} a self-tapping screw. In addition it is accepted that an optimum value of the diameter of the pilot-hole exists. For non self-tapping screw insertion it is reported that undertapping of the pilot-hole can increase its pullout strength. Finally it is known that in some cases orthopedic surgeons open the threaded holes, using another screw instead of a tap. Methods: A typical commercial self-tapping pedicle screw was inserted into blocks of Solid Rigid Polyurethane Foam (simulating osteoporotic cancellous bone), following different insertion techniques. The <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> was measured according to the ASTM-F 543 - 02 standard. The screw was inserted into previously prepared holes of different sizes, either threaded or cylindrical, to conclude whether an optimum size of the pilot-hole exists and whether tapping can increase the pullout strength. The case where the tapping is performed using another screw was also studied. Results: For screw insertion with tapping, decreasing the outer radius of the threaded hole from 1. 00 to 0. 87 of the screw's outer radius increased the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> 9 %. For insertion without tapping, decreasing the pilot-hole's diameter from 0. 87 to 0. 47 of the screw's outer diameter increased its <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> 75 %. Finally, tapping using another screw instead of a tap, gave results similar to those of conventional tapping.

The peak of root reinforcement at 2  m distance from a 0.3  m DBH tree modelled for the PN dataset is due to the peak of root frequency calculated for this distance. This result shows that, at this distance, root reinforcement is dominated by roots with diameter classes less than 2  mm. While the number of roots mainly influences the magnitude of the reinforcement, the distribution of roots in different diameter classes influences the magnitude of reinforcement, with a factor ranging from 1 to 3 (Cohen et al., 2011), and the stiffness of the reinforcement (Schwarz et al. 2013). This last aspect has been discussed less often in the literature, but it represents an important factor in conditions where the stabilisation effects of roots are due mainly to lateral roots (Schwarz and Cohen 2011; Schwarz et al. 2012 a, Schwarz et al. 2015). Although the results show a good prediction of the root distribution model (Fig.  4), the prediction of root reinforcement in Fig.  6 shows how sensitive this calculation is to slightly different distribution of roots, especially in the case of the PN dataset. Vice versa, the model prediction of root reinforcement based on the G dataset fits the data better (Fig.  5). This difference may be explained by two main reasons. First, the simulation conducted for only a single tree is not a representative of an entire stand and thus shows lower variability. Second, the calibration of the root distribution model based on data of a complete excavated root system with a greater number of trench distances (one every metre) allows for the whole root system to provide a better prediction of root distribution.|$|R

China, a long-time ally of Pakistan, insisted on a <b>pullout</b> of <b>forces</b> to the pre-conflict positions along the LOC and settling border issues peacefully.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} mechanical behavior of implants inserted in three substrates, by measuring the pullout strength and the relative stiffness. 32 implants (Master Porous-Conexao, cylindrical, external hexagon, and surface treatment) were divided into 4 groups (n = 8) : pig rib bone, polyurethane Synbone, polyurethane Nacional 40 PCF, and pinus wood. Implants were installed with the exact distance of 5 mm of another implant. The insertion torque (N·cm) was quantified using the digital Kratos torque meter and the pullout test (N) was performed by an axial traction force toward the long axis of the implant (2 min/mm) through mount implant devices attached to a piece adapted to a load cell of 200 Kg of a universal testing machine (Emic DL 10000). Data of insertion torque and maximum <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> were submitted to one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni tests (α = 0. 05). Polyurethane Nacional 40 PCF and pinus wood showed the highest values of insertion torque and <b>pullout</b> <b>force,</b> with significant statistical difference (P < 0. 05) with other groups. The analysis showed stiffness materials with the highest values for primary stability. © 2013 Nathalia Ferraz Oliscovicz et al...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the correlations between bone characteristics, orthodontic miniscrew designs, and primary stability. METHODS: Four different miniscrews were placed in pig ribs. The miniscrews were first scanned with a scanning electron microscope to obtain measurable images of their threads. Subsequently, the maximum insertion torque of the screws and the maximum load value in the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> tests were measured; furthermore, bone specimen characteristics were analyzed by using cone-beam computed tomography. For each bone sample, the insertion site cortical thickness as well as both cortical and marrow bone density were evaluated. The nonparametric Kendall rank correlation (tau) was used to evaluate the strength of the associations among the characteristics measured. The nonparametric Kruskall-Wallis test was used to evaluate the differences among the groups, and post-hoc comparisons were assessed by using the Nemenyi-Damico-Wolfe-Dunn test. RESULTS: A significant dependence was found between pitch and maximum insertion torque (tau, - 0. 49). Positive correlations were also found between <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> and maximum insertion torque (tau, 0. 64), cortical thickness (tau, 0. 36), and marrow bone density (tau, 0. 35). CONCLUSIONS: In this in-vitro experimental study, strong correlations were observed among miniscrew geometry, bone characteristics, and primary stability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{has focused on}} {{achieving}} a micromechanical understanding of the microbond test, which involves pulling a fiber out of a bead of matrix (i. e. droplet) through a knife-edge, in order to quantify the interfacial fracture properties of fiber-reinforced composites. According to the microbond test results for carbon-fiber and epoxy-resin system, matrix cracking occurred during the fiber pullout, {{in addition to the}} debonding at the fiber–matrix interface. Therefore, in evaluating the fracture properties of the fiber–matrix interface, we should pay attention to the coupling effects of matrix failure and interfacial debonding on the test results. Then, we discuss how to best extract the interfacial properties while excluding the influence of matrix plasticity and cracking, using numerical simulations. The key mechanism demonstrated here is that the <b>pullout</b> <b>force,</b> in the cases where the influence of matrix cracking is negligible, appears as the upper limit among the experimental data of the <b>pullout</b> <b>force</b> for a constant initial embedded length of the fiber in the matrix. For this reason, the upper-limit data all over the range of embedded fiber length in experiments can be reasonably evaluated by the simulation focusing on the debonding process with matrix plasticity. This evaluation technique is effective as a way of extracting interfacial properties appropriately from microbond test results...|$|E
40|$|A new {{analytical}} method for defining the nonlinear bond stress–slip models of fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) sheet–concrete interfaces through pullout bond test is proposed. With this method, {{it is not}} necessary to attach many strain gauges on the FRP sheets for obtaining the strain distributions in FRP as well as the local bond stresses and slips. Instead, the local interfacial bond stress-slip models can be simply derived from the relationships between the <b>pullout</b> <b>forces</b> and loaded end slips. Based on a series of pullout tests, the bond stress–slip models of FRP sheet–concrete interfaces, in which different FRP stiffness, FRP materials (carbon FRP, aramid FRP, and glass FRP), and adhesives are used, have been derived. Only two parameters, the interfacial fracture energy and interfacial ductility index, which can take into account the effects of all interfacial components, are necessary in these models. Comparisons between analytical results and experimental ones show good accordance, indicating the reliability of the proposed method and the proposed bond stress–slip models. It is the author's manuscript version and not the published versio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of end anchorage length and stirrup ratio on bond and shear capacity of concrete beams reinforced with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) bars. This study was carried out using test data on nine simply supported reinforced concrete beams with stirrups. The beams were subjected to two point monotonic loads and the test variables were the length of end anchorage and the stirrup ratio. Theoretical equations for calculating bond strength and shear capacity obtained from literature were applied and then compared with experimental values. Beams with inadequate end anchorage length showed premature bond failure even when there was sufficient stirrup ratio. Beams with adequate end anchorage length failed in shear or flexure modes depending on the stirrup ratio. A numerical model for bond stress and slip in response to <b>pullout</b> <b>forces</b> was also used to determine analytically the bond stress distributions along end anchorage. The behavior of tensile force acting on the stirrups was also examined. Finally, a simple model for predicting tension force acting on the stirrups was proposed...|$|R
40|$|The global {{structural}} {{performance of}} masonry buildings, under earthquake loading, {{is affected by}} the efficiency of wall-to-floor connections, since they assure the continuity of the energy path and prevent the occurrence of most of the local collapse mechanisms. In fact, out-of-plane behaviour of masonry walls observed in recent seismic events showed the critical importance of proper connections in historical buildings. A review of current literature yields little in terms of experimental and numerical data on the subject. Thus, there is an urgent need to study the behaviour of these connections. The present paper presents a series of tests carried out to characterize the wall-to-floor connections. Different specimens were constructed in laboratory to represent connections found in ‘Gaioleiro’ and Late ‘Pombalino’ buildings in downtown Lisbon. Pull-out tests of wall-to-floor connections were carried out on unstrengthened and strengthened specimens in order to study failure modes, maximum <b>pullout</b> <b>forces,</b> and corresponding displacements. These parameters allow better understanding of this type of connection and also the development of design recommendations for the strengthening...|$|R
