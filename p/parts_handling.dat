40|$|Efficient {{methods for}} {{simulating}} operators performing <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> tasks in manufacturing plants are needed. The simulation of <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> motions {{is an important}} step towards the implementation of virtual manufacturing for the purpose of improving worker productivity and reducing injuries in the workplace. However, industrial assembly tasks are often complex and involve multiple interactions between workers and their environment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a series of industrial simulations using the Human Motion Simulation Framework developed at the University of Michigan. Three automotive assembly operations spanning scenarios, such as small and large parts, tool use, walking, re-grasping, reaching inside a vehicle, etc. were selected. A conceptual model for describing relationships among task objectives, the environment, parts and tools, as well as worker variability, work methods, motion patterns, and musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) risks is proposed as a structure for conducting the case studies. The conceptual model is implemented using simulation strategies and the HUMOSIM Framework. Analyses demonstrate that the HUMOSIM Framework provides improvements on simulation capabilities over the built-in Jack functionality, such as the prediction of force-exertion posture and stepping motions. But knowledge gaps are also identified for <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> simulations, in particular the prediction of grasping and re-grasping. Methods for integrating part assembly paths generated by other simulation software are also needed...|$|R

New control system proposed in this study contains a generating system of real-time pulse series for driving stepping motor in the control loop.

In this paper we describe a method for estimating the distribution of stable poses in a stream of identical polyhedral parts. We assume that each part's initial orientation with the worksurface is a uniform random variable and that the part falls under quasi-static conditions (i. e. without dynamics). For an n-sided polyhedron, our algorithm runs in time O(n 2). 1 Introduction As it is extremely costly to maintain part order throughout the manufacture cycle, for example by keeping parts in pallets, parts are often delivered in bags or boxes where they must be fed to an assembly station.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{technical characteristic}} of a <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> and transport system which supports a factory layout of machine tools or an FMS is the required part transport speed from machining-(inspection-, assembly-) station to station. This speed is imposed by the production programme for which the layout has been designed and {{is a function of}} more parameters: number of stations; net production plus part loading-unloading times; buffer capacities; topology; and size scale of the machine layout. It is also dependent on the machine operation scheduling and on the maximum machine utilization requirement. In the paper, a new machine serving methodology is presented and analysed. It takes into account, in addition to the mentioned parameters, the position of the part transport means at each decision step, the part availability for further processing as well as the space availability in the machine buffer storages and evaluates the required minimum part transport speed. This minimum transport speed can then be used as a criterion for the final design of the <b>part</b> <b>handling</b> and transport system.
