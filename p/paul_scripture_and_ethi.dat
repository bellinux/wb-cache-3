But {{quickly after}} this, I fell in company with one poor man that made {{profession}} of religion; who, as I then thought, did talk pleasantly of the <b>Scriptures,</b> <b>and</b> of the matters of religion; wherefore, falling into some love and liking {{to what he}} said, I betook me to my Bible, and began to take great pleasure in reading, but especially with the historical part thereof; for, as for <b>Paul's</b> epistles, <b>and</b> <b>Scriptures</b> of that nature, I could not away with them, being as yet but ignorant, either of the corruptions of my nature, or of the want and worth of Jesus Christ to save me.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{argues that}} Deut 29 – 32, {{especially}} Deut 31, plays {{a significant role}} in 2 Cor 3, especially vv. 7 – 18 : Paul's elusive allegorical narrative draws on Deuteronomic motifs of ‘closure’ (the end of Moses, of the law and of the Israelites); the national observance of reading the law and encountering the Lord face to face; and the succession of Moses by one named Ἰησοῦς in the LXX. This analysis extends scholarly discussion of Paul's use of Deuteronomy and contributes to the wider debate about <b>Paul's</b> use of <b>scripture</b> <b>and</b> his understanding of Jesus' relationship to Moses and the Mosaic covenant...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigher plant DNA is {{methylated}} at CG and CNG targets. In {{this study}} we have investigated the tobacco methylation system in tissue culture using the methylation inhibitors 5 -azacytidine (5 -azaC), dihydroxypropyladenine (DHPA) <b>and</b> ethionine (<b>Ethi),</b> <b>and</b> methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases HpaII, MspI, HhaI, EcoRII, ScrFI, and Fnu 4 HI. Surprisingly, CAG/CTG sequences, contrary to CG doublets and CCG/CGG triplets, appeared to be refractory to the inhibitory effect of 5 -azaC. Thus 5 -azaC cannot be considered a general inhibitor of DNA methylation in tobacco cells. On the other hand, DHPA, the inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, <b>and</b> <b>Ethi</b> caused hypomethylation of both CAG/CTG and CCG/CGG triplets but not of the CG doublets. The sensitivity of triplet-specific methylation to the inhibition of SAH hydrolase suggests the possibility that plant-specific DNA methylation at CNG targets might be modulated by alterations of the SAH/S-Adenosyhnethionine ratio in plant cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the adaptogenic activity of ethanol (EtHI), ethyl acetate (EAHI) fractions of Habenaria intermedia D. Don, Orchidaceae (HI), tubers using immobilization induced acute stress (AS), chronic stress (CS) and swimming induced stress in experimental animals. The tested doses of <b>EtHI</b> (100 <b>and</b> 200 mg/kg, p. o.) and higher dose of EAHI (200 mg/kg, p. o.) normalized altered serum biochemical parameters and the severity of ulcers in both AS and CS. EAHI <b>and</b> <b>EtHI</b> restored the hyperthrophy of adrenal gland and atrophy of spleen and thymus gland in AS and CS. Greater swimming time was noted in the mice pretreated with <b>EtHI</b> <b>and</b> EAHI. Levels of adrenal ascorbic acid and cortisol were restored significantly. EAHI exhibited prominent scavenging effect of DPPH, hydroxyl radical and lipid peroxidation in vitro.

40|$|The strong biblical {{character}} of Rom 1 : 16 – 2 : 29 is generally recognised. Throughout the reading process, one finds in it various scriptural texts which are present either plainly or more discretely. The publication, in 1989, by Richard Hays of Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul, has made biblical scholars more {{aware that the}} links between <b>Paul</b> <b>and</b> <b>Scripture</b> {{are not limited to}} the sole instances where the Apostle makes an explicit reference to it. There are also cases when, without mentioning directly his sources, Paul is nevertheless in dialogue with some scriptural texts. The Greek influences on Paul, given the fact that he expresses himself in the common Greek language and comes from the Judaism of the Diaspora, do not hide the fact that the contents and the form of Rom 1 : 16 – 2 : 29 have above all a biblical character. Although Amos is never quoted explicitly in Paul’s letters, it is doubtless that numerous significant common points between some passages of this book and Rom 1 : 16 – 2 : 29 enrich our understanding of the scriptural grounding of the Apostle of the Gentiles. An intertextual analysis of Rom 1 : 16 – 2 : 29 and the book of Amos, in the perspective suggested by Hays, highlights some aspects of Paul’s texts, just as some aspects of Amos are better understood in the light of Rom 1 : 16 – 2 : 29.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the use of <b>Scripture</b> <b>and</b> tradition in Sirach 16 : 24 � 17 : 14, which is a retelling of the creation stories. Ben Sira as an interpreter of Scripture utilised interpretive traditions or exegetical motifs that were in circulation during his time to provide instruction for his generation. His indebtedness to Scripture {{is evident from the}} quotations from <b>Scripture</b> <b>and</b> his use of scriptural language. In his retelling of the creation stories, he made use of the exegetical motifs that were in circulation, adapting them within the wisdom interpretive framework. He also rejected the tendency to blame evil on external agencies such as fallen angels and downplayed the gap between the creation process and the giving of the law at Sinai. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: The article is an exegetical inquiry of the extra-biblical text of Ben Sira in dialogue with <b>Scripture</b> <b>and</b> with other exegetical traditions which were in circulation in the Second Temple period.
