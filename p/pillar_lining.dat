40|$|This Bureau of Mines {{study was}} {{conducted}} to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} coal mine bump problem and its effect on underground coal mining in the Eastern United States. To accomplish this, information was collected on the geologic conditions, mining techniques, and engineering parameters at five bump-prone mines. Two geologic conditions have been found to cause the occurrence of bumps in the Eastern United States: (1) relatively thick overburden and (2) extremely rigid strata occurring immediately above and below the mine coalbed. Additionally, the probability of bump occurrence is increased by certain mining practices that concentrate stresses during retreat mining, in areas where geologic conditions are conducive to bumps. Mining plans that permit the development of <b>pillar</b> <b>line</b> points or long roof spans that project over gob areas should be avoided because these features may contribute to the occurrence of bumps...|$|R

40|$|Retreat or pillar {{recovery}} mining redistributes the overburden weight {{onto the}} adjacent coal pillars in a room-and-pillar section. The additional stress {{and the resultant}} energy stored in the remaining pillars can become so great that pillars may bump or violently fail. An investigation at the Gary No. 2 Mine was conducted to examine {{the effectiveness of the}} thin pillar mining method for mitigating bump occurrences. Field observations were made and instruments were installed to monitor pillar behavior during extraction. Stress monitoring instruments and roof-to-floor convergence stations were installed in pillars and entries and crosscuts, respectively. Results indicated that high pillar stress concentrations occurred in these bump-prone geologic conditions. The thin pillar mechanism, the creation and progressive outby movement of an expanded yield zone, was also monitored through the instruments. The expanded yield zone, a result of using thin pillars in a highly stressed <b>pillar</b> <b>line</b> area, mitigates bump risk...|$|R

5000|$|Ocean liners also {{adopted a}} style of Art Deco, known in French as the Style Paquebot, or [...] "Ocean Liner Style". The most famous example was the SS Normandie, which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935. It was {{designed}} particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop. The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration. The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles. It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six matching <b>pillars</b> <b>lined</b> the walls. This {{was one of the}} earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings. A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners. The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style.|$|R

40|$|Retreat {{pillar mining}} {{concentrates}} stresses on workings directly outby gob areas, which {{can result in}} coal mine bumps. The development of bump-control design criteria by the U. S. Bureau of Mines was furthered by data from a novel bump control mining method at the Olga Mine, McDowell County, WY. The pillar splitting, retreat mining system induced large pillar pressure increases and roof-to-floor con-vergence. Roof-to-floor convergence monitoring {{proved to be a}} valuable tool in evaluating the pillar splitting mining method and localized destressing techniques. Maximum strain energy storage in chain pillars appears to have occurred just prior to the first of four split cuts. At that point a 15 -ft-wide, highly fractured perimeter confined the core of the 55 -by 70 -ft pillars, permitting the pillar core to support tremendous pressures. Splitting the chain pillars into two 17. 5 -by 70 -ft wings removed the confinement load, resulting in pillar yield. Thus, the pillar splitting mining method successfully redistributed the weight of the roof away from the <b>pillar</b> <b>line.</b> Shot fire and auger drilling destressing techniques aug-mented the pillar splitting mining method by redistributing the weight of the roof...|$|R

40|$|This {{proceedings}} volume contains papers {{presented at}} technology transfer seminars {{sponsored by the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on New Technology for Ground Control in Retreat Mining. The seminars were conducted at five locations: Uniontown, PA (March 26, 1997), Norton, VA (April 8, 1997), Pikeville, KY (April 10, 1997), Charleston, WV (April 17, 1997), and Evansville, IN (April 22, 1997). The papers presented here describe several new, highly practical technologies developed by the NIOSH Pittsburgh and Spokane Research Centers 3 to improve safety during pillar retreat operations. Two central issues are addressed: pillar design and mobile roof supports (MRS's). Proper pillar sizing is essential for safe pillar extraction. The Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) program and its large data base of actual mining case histories are presented. LAMODEL, a second computer program, {{can be used for}} analysis of multiple-seam and other complex mining situations. Other papers address pillar design to avoid massive pillar collapses and the proper role of coal strength testing. MRS's have greatly improved safety where they are used for <b>pillar</b> <b>line</b> support. We studied the application of MRS's at 20 mines throughout the Eastern United States.

40|$|Deep cover retreat mining (overburden {{in excess}} of 750 ft) is an {{important}} emerging issue which will intensify {{in the future as}} the more easily mined shallow seam reserves are depleted. Analysis of Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) statistics indicates that deep cover pillar recovery accounts for a disproportionate share of the underground coal mine roof/rib fall fatalities and injuries. Past research has shown that previously recommended Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) stability factors (SF 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) may be excessive for deep cover pillar design. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the various methods and strategies by which panels, production pillars and barrier pillars are developed and extracted under deep cover, and to develop appropriate design guidelines. In the course of the research, 29 mines in 7 states were investigated to collect panel design case histories. At each mine site, underground geotechnical data were collected on the <b>pillar</b> <b>line</b> in order to document roof rock, coalbed and floor conditions. The analyses indicated that squeezes were the most likely failure mode where the depth was less than 1, 250 ft, but bumps predominated in the deeper cover cases. Immediate roof rock quality, the ARMPS SF 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s, and barrier pillar stability factors were all found to be important parameters in determining the outcomes of the case histories. Design guidelines, including suggestions for barrier pillars to isolate active panels from nearby gobs in bump prone ground, are also proposed...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{behaviors}} of the base electrolyte containing different additives were investigated by galvanostatic potential transient measurements (GM), cyclic voltammetry tests (CV) and potentiostatic measurements. Copper deposits on sputtering copper seed from physical vapor deposition (PVD) were examined by a scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction spectra. Cross sections of copper <b>pillars</b> and fine <b>line</b> patterns were observed by metallographic microscope. GM result revealed ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co-polymer (EO/PO) performed a further inhibition on copper deposition {{in the presence of}} 60 ppm chloride ions as the increment of EO/PO concentration.

Sputtering PVD copper seed with even deposit surface was recommended to form the uniformity of copper deposition through increasing the growing density of copper particles. Oscillatory was employed to form uniform distribution of copper deposits in thickness. Copper grain growth was preferentially [111] textured.

40|$|PhD, Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, 2010 The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to provide a proper design procedure for Merensky crush pillars, based primarily on underground measurements. Three sites with a variety of geotechnical conditions were selected. An interaction between the pillars and the rock mass around the stopes was shown by the literature, relevant laboratory tests and numerical modelling. During the investigations, nonlinear rock behaviour was observed at one of the sites. Further studies revealed that nonlinear behaviour also occurred in samples extracted from high stress conditions at the other sites, but the rock mass was not nonlinear at these sites. A methodology for determining stress from strain measured in nonlinear rock was established. The research also established that there is an approximately linear relationship between peak pillar strength and w/h ratio at ratios between about 1. 2 and 8. The so called ‘squat’ effect is not observed because pillar failure is not contained within the pillar but extends into the foundations. A linear peak pillar strength formula was established from back analyses of underground pillar failures and was confirmed by numerical modelling. Pillar behaviour was established from underground measurements on one stability pillar and six crush pillars, which included peak and residual strengths. Also, stable and unstable loading conditions were established from an analysis of pillar bursts and the minimum strata stiffness for stable pillar failure was determined. This stiffness is only achieved near the advancing face and pillars that fail in the back areas are likely to burst. For this reason, pillar design needs to include the peak strength as large pillars may be too strong and fail in the back area. The residual strength also needs to be considered as the load-bearing capacity of these pillars needs to satisfy the criterion of 1 MPa across the stope to prevent back-breaks. This translates into a pillar stress of between 8 MPa and 13 MPa if the <b>pillar</b> <b>lines</b> are spaced 30 m apart. The peak and residual requirements have been included in a design chart, and the relationship between w/h ratio and residual strength is provided in a graph for easy design...|$|R
