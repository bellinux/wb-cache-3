Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".|$|E

She said that she was always going to [...] "definitely" [...] release an album, if she was signed or not. However, she stated that she did not think there would be [...] "this much anticipation, or acknowledgement of what I was doing". She said she loves to be in the limelight and that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her so much. She said she only loves the attention because she has experienced the other side, when no one cares.|$|E

2500|$|The last of McManaman's caps came in 2001 when Sven-Göran Eriksson {{utilised}} him for {{his first}} games in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including a game back at Anfield against Finland – where McManaman set up David Beckham's winner– but then apparently {{left a message on}} McManaman's answering machine to inform him {{that he was not going}} to be in the final World Cup squad in early 2002. Despite the pleas of McManaman's Real Madrid team mates Zidane and Fernando Hierro for McManaman's case, McManaman said he never ever heard from or met Eriksson again. Zidane went on to state England had made a mistake, and described McManaman with a rare passion as one of the highest quality players he ever played with: [...] "I was surprised when McManaman was left out of the last England squad. I couldn't believe they would ignore a player of his quality. Now <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the fact that maybe he will get his chance because David Beckham is injured. But McManaman is far better than just being a replacement for Beckham. McManaman should be in the starting line-up anyway." [...] Support for McManaman also came before the 2002 World Cup in the British media, after Sky Sports published an article based on OPTA statistics, revealing that despite a poor goalscoring record, McManaman had in fact an 88% dribbling completion rate (having embarked on a run every 17 minutes), and an 84% pass completion rate, all three of which were higher by over 15% than any English midfield Premiership player at the time.|$|E
