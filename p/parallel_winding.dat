Since the planar technology, commonly PCB layers, limits the maximum layer thickness, the use {{of parallel}} windings is usually {{required in order to}} reduce the current density and losses. The distribution of the current through each <b>parallel</b> <b>winding</b> depends on the winding positioning and the frequency effects. This effect is especially important in gapped inductors, because the energy stored in the gap region determines the current distribution through the windings.

40|$|Abstract. Heliotron {{reactors}} have attractive {{features for}} fusion power plants, such as {{no need for}} current drive and a wide space between the helical coils {{for the maintenance of}} in-vessel components. Their main disadvantage was considered the necessarily large size of their magnet systems. According to the recent reactor studies based on the experimental results in the Large Helical Device, the major radius of plasma of 14 to 17 m with a central toroidal field of 6 to 4 T is needed to attain the self-ignition condition with a blanket space thicker than 1. 1 m. The stored magnetic energy is estimated at 120 to 140 GJ. Although both the major radius and the magnetic energy are about three times as large as ITER, the maximum magnetic field and mechanical stress can be comparable. In the preliminary structural analysis, the maximum stress intensity including the peak stress is less than 1, 000 MPa that is allowed for strengthened stainless steel. Although the length of the helical coil is longer than 150 m that is about five times as long as the ITER TF coil, cable-in-conduit conductors can be adopted with a <b>parallel</b> <b>winding</b> method of five-in-hand. The concept of the <b>parallel</b> <b>winding</b> is proposed. Consequently, the magnet systems for helical reactors can be realized with small extension of the ITER technology. 1...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to establish the effectiveness of parked cars in urban street canyons as passive controls on pedestrian pollutant exposure. A numerical model of a generic street canyon was developed using a large eddy simulation (LES) model to compare personal exposure on the footpath with and without the presence of parked cars. Three configurations of car parking systems were investigated (parallel, perpendicular & 45 o parking) {{in addition to the}} influence of wind speed, wind direction and car parking occupancy. A tracer gas (CO 2) was used as a representative pollutant from vehicular sources within the street canyon models. The results indicated that parked cars may act as a temporary baffle plate between traffic emissions and pedestrians on the footpath. Reductions in exposure of up to 35 % and 49 % were attained on the leeward and windward footpaths in perpendicular <b>wind</b> conditions, with <b>parallel</b> <b>winds</b> allowing up to 33 % pollutant reduction on both footpaths for parallel parking. The perpendicular and 45 o car parking configurations investigated proved less successful as passive controls on air pollution exposure and an increase in pollutant concentration occurred in some models. An investigation of parking space occupancy rates was carried out for parallel parked cars. The fraction of parked cars influenced the level of reduction of pollutants on the footpaths with steady reductions in perpendicular winds, yet reductions were only evident for occupancy rates greater than approximately 45 % in <b>parallel</b> <b>wind</b> conditions. One negative impact associated with the parked cars study was the increase of pollutant levels on the roadway as the parked cars acted as a baffle wall, which trapped pollutants in the road.

40|$|Increasing {{the power}} density of power {{electronic}} converters while reducing or maintaining the same cost, offers a higher potential {{to meet the}} current trend inrelation to various power electronic applications. High power density converters {{can be achieved by}} increasing the switching frequency, due to which the bulkiest parts, such as transformer, inductors and the capacitor's size in the convertercircuit can be drastically reduced. In this regard, highly integrated planar magnetics are considered as an effective approach compared to the conventional wire wound transformers in modern switch mode power supplies (SMPS). However, as the operating frequency of the transformers increase from several hundred kHz to MHz, numerous problems arise such as skin and proximity effects due to the induced eddy currents in the windings, leakage inductance and unbalanced magnetic flux distribution. In addition to this, the core losses whichare functional dependent on frequency gets elevated as the operating frequency increases. Therefore, this thesis provides an insight towards the problems related to the high frequency magnetics and proposes a solution with regards to different aspects in relation to designing high power density, energy efficient transformers. The first part of the thesis concentrates on the investigation of high power density and highly energy efficient coreless printed circuit board (PCB) step-down transformers useful for stringent height DC-DC converter applications, where the core losses are being completely eliminated. These transformers also maintain the advantages offered by existing core based transformers such as, high coupling coefficient, sufficient input impedance, high energy efficiency and wide frequencyband width with the assistance of a resonant technique. In this regard, several coreless PCB step down transformers of different turn’s ratio for power transfer applications have been designed and evaluated. The designed multilayered coreless PCB transformers for telecom and PoE applications of 8, 15 and 30 W show that the volume reduction of approximately 40 - 90 % is possible when compared to its existing core based counterparts while maintaining the energy efficiency of the transformers in the range of 90 - 97 %. The estimation of EMI emissions from the designed transformers for the given power transfer application proves that the amount of radiated EMI from a multilayered transformer is lessthan that of the two layered transformer because of the decreased radius for thesame amount of inductance. The design guidelines for the multilayered coreless PCB step-down transformer for the given power transfer application has been proposed. The designed transformer of 10 mm radius has been characterized up to the power level of 50 Wand possesses a record power density of 107 W/cm 3 with a peak energy efficiency of 96 %. In addition to this, the design guidelines of the signal transformer fordriving the high side MOSFET in double ended converter topologies have been proposed. The measured power consumption of the high side gate drive circuitvitogether with the designed signal transformer is 0. 37 W. Both these signal andpower transformers have been successfully implemented in a resonant converter topology in the switching frequency range of 2. 4 – 2. 75 MHz for the maximum load power of 34. 5 W resulting in the peak energy efficiency of converter as 86. 5 %. This thesis also investigates the indirect effect of the dielectric laminate on the magnetic field intensity and current density distribution in the planar power transformers with the assistance of finite element analysis (FEA). The significanceof the high frequency dielectric laminate compared to FR- 4 laminate in terms of energy efficiency of planar power transformers in MHz frequency region is also explored. The investigations were also conducted on different winding strategies such as conventional solid winding and the <b>parallel</b> <b>winding</b> strategies, which {{play an important role in}} the design and development of a high frequency transformer and suggested a better choice in the case of transformers operating in the MHz frequency region. In the second part of the thesis, a novel planar power transformer with hybrid core structure has been designed and evaluated in the MHz frequency region. The design guidelines of the energy efficient high frequency planar power transformerfor the given power transfer application have been proposed. The designed corebased planar transformer has been characterized up to the power level of 50 W and possess a power density of 47 W/cm 3 with maximum energy efficiency of 97 %. This transformer has been evaluated successfully in the resonant converter topology within the switching frequency range of 3 – 4. 5 MHz. The peak energy efficiency ofthe converter is reported to be 92 % and the converter has been tested for the maximum power level of 45 W, which is suitable for consumer applications such as laptop adapters. In addition to this, a record power density transformer has been designed with a custom made pot core and has been characterized in thefrequency range of 1 - 10 MHz. The power density of this custom core transformer operating at 6. 78 MHz frequency is 67 W/cm 3 and with the peak energy efficiency of 98 %. In conclusion, the research in this dissertation proposed a solution for obtaining high power density converters by designing the highly integrated, high frequency(1 - 10 MHz) coreless and core based planar magnetics with energy efficiencies inthe range of 92 - 97 %. This solution together with the latest semiconductor GaN/SiC switching devices provides an excellent choice to meet the requirements of the next generation ultra flat low profile switch mode power supplies (SMPS) ...|$|E

The modes associated with the cosine terms of the wind profile (or the sine terms of the wind shear profile) do not agree well with the observations.

The surface convergence was very important to supply the lifting necessary for the development of new the convection. The interaction of the gust front from an old cloud with the environmental wind, as well as the interaction between the two gust fronts, were the main factors that enhanced the surface convergence. A favorable perturbation pressure gradient was also found to intensify this mechanism.

This paper first provides a detailed review of the literature for CFD studies of outdoor ventilation for generic urban configurations. The review indicates that there is a clear lack of studies for urban configurations where not all parallel streets have equal street widths. Next, the paper presents Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of outdoor ventilation for generic configurations with parallel streets of equal and unequal street widths. The 3 D steady RANS equations with the standard k-e model and the passive scalar transport equation are used to calculate the effective local mean age of air at pedestrian level as an indicator of pollutant removal efficiency. The study is based on grid-convergence analysis and on validation with previously published wind-tunnel measurements. The influence of a central and wider main street on the wind-velocity pattern and on the effective local mean age of air of the surrounding area is analyzed for different wind directions.

40|$|Abstract. Past {{research}} has shown that the most important areas for active sand movement {{in the northern part of}} the Chihuahuan Desert are mesquite-dominated desert ecosystems possessing sandy soil texture. The most active sand movement in the mesquite-dominated ecosystems has been shown to take place on elongated bare soil patches referred to as “streets”. Aerodynamic properties of mesquite streets eroded by wind should be included in explaining how mesquite streets are more emissive sand sources than surrounding desert land. To understand the effects of wind properties, we measured them at two flat mesquite sites having highly similar soil textures but very different configurations of mesquite. The differences in wind properties at the two sites were caused by differences of size, orientation, and porosity of the mesquite, along with the presence of mesquite coppice dunes (sand dunes stabilized by mesquites growing in the dune and on its surface) found only at one of the two sites. Wind direction, u ∗ (friction velocity), z 0 (aerodynamic roughness height) and D (zero plane displacement height) were estimated for 15 -m tower and 3 -m mast data. These aerodynamic data allowed us to distinguish five categories with differing potentials for sediment transport. Sediment transport for the five categories varied from unrestricted, free transport to virtually no transport caused by vegetation protection from wind forces. In addition, “steering ” of winds below the level of the tops of mesquite bushes and coppice dunes allowed longer <b>parallel</b> <b>wind</b> durations and increased wind erosion for streets that aligned roughly SW–NE...|$|R
