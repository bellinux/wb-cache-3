40|$|The {{release of}} {{urokinase}} plasminogen activator (uPA) from endometrial stromal cells decreased after progesterone stimulation, due to upregulation of PA inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) and uPA receptor (uPAR). Subsequently, the uPA:PAI- 1 complex was internalized and degraded via uPAR. Predecidual {{cells in the}} late secretory phase expressed PAI- 1 and uPAR, supporting a specific role for predecidual cells in the down-regulation of uPA. The tissue content of uPA protein and mRNA did not vary over the menstrual cycle. The tissue distribution of uPA and uPAR mRNAs and proteins indicated that the proteins bind in a paracrine way to epithelial cells. All factors were strongly expressed in the menstrual phase, suggesting a function in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and blood clot lysis during menstruation. Malignant endometrial tissue had a higher content of uPA protein than normal tissue. Also, the uPA content gradually increased from simple hyperplasia to <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer.</b> In contrast, the content of tPA mRNA and protein gradually decreased from simple hyperplasia to <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer.</b> The tumor tissue content of PAI- 2 was a marker of poor postoperative prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer (HR= 3. 0; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 7. 1), whereas the content of uPAR {{was not associated with}} survival.

Thermoradiotherapy is an is an exiting innovative new approach for a biological influenced dose escalation. Ferromagnetic implants allows an optimal heat distribution and control in the prostate. Early data on PSA follow up of thermoradiotherapy shows promising results, which anticipate to achieve similar progression free survival data like HDR brachytherapy.

Results: We found a significantly higher level of cgA in men with <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> CaP.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{incidence}} {{rates are}} increasing among persons younger than 50 years of age, a population routinely not screened unless {{an individual has}} {{a high risk of}} CRC. This population-based study focuses primarily on describing the CRC burden for persons in this age group. METHODS. The data used for this study were derived from the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) surveillance systems. Age-adjusted incidence rates, rate ratios, and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS. CRC is ranked among the top 10 cancers occurring in males and females aged 20 – 49 years regardless of race. Persons younger than 50 years were more likely to present with less localized and more distant disease than do older adults. Among younger adults, age-adjusted incidence rates for <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> were twice as high as rates for well-differentiated cancers. Incidence rates for <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> were 60 % higher than that for welldifferentiated cancers diagnosed in older adults. Rates were significantly higher for blacks and significantly lower for Asians/Pacific Islanders when compared with that for whites for the most demographic and tumor characteristics examined. CONCLUSIONS. This study confirms the findings of previous population-based studies suggesting that younger patients present with more advanced disease than do older patients. This study also identifies racial and ethnic disparities in CRC incidence in this population. These findings suggest the need for additional studies to understand the behavior and etiology of CRC in blacks...|$|R

Results The incidence rate of lymphatic metastasis in <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> early gastric <b>cancer</b> was 19. 0 %(56 / 294),from which the incidence rates of lymphatic metastasis for mucosal(M) and submucosal(SM) cancer were 4. 4 %(6 / 136) and 31. 6 %(50 / 158). The logistic regression analysis showed that tumor sizes of > 1. 5 cm(P= 0. 049,OR= 2. 437),submucosal invasion(P= 0. 000,OR= 6. 681),lymphatic vessel involvement(P= 0. 000,OR= 8. 469) are independent risk factors for lymphatic metastasis.

This new in vivo model not only allows analysis of approximately {{all of the}} cell types present in prostate cancer within an intact tissue microenvironment, but also provides a more accurate assessment {{of the effects of}} interventions when tissues from the same specimen with similar cell composition and histology are used as control and experimental samples. The thinness of the slices ensures that sufficient samples can be obtained for large experiments as well as permits optimal exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and drugs between the grafted tissue and the host. Both benign and cancer tissues displayed characteristic histology and expression of cell-type specific markers for up to 3 months. Moreover, androgen-regulated protein expression diminished in TSGs after androgen ablation of the host and was restored after androgen repletion. Finally, many normal secretory epithelial cells and cancer cells in TSGs remained viable 2 months after androgen ablation, consistent with similar observations in postprostatectomy specimens following neoadjuvant androgen ablation. Among these were putative Nkx 3. 1 + stem cells. Our novel TSG model has the appropriate characteristics to serve as a useful tool to model all stages of disease, including normal tissue, premalignant lesions, well-differentiated cancer, and <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audiencePancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDAC) {{is still}} the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries, with increasing incidence. Neither effective prognostic markers nor therapies exist for this cancer. MicroRNAs are potent inhibitors of protein translation, and aberrantly expressed in many cancers. Because let- 7 microRNA targets the K-ras oncogene, we aimed to characterize let- 7 expression and function in PDAC in vitro and in vivo. Let- 7 expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR from resected tumors and matching adjacent tissue, and in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration material from patients with PDAC. Let- 7 is detected by reverse transcription in situ PCR in a PDAC tissue microarray. PDAC-derived cells were transfected with plasmid-based synthetic microRNAs or by lentiviral transduction, in vitro and in vivo. Let- 7 microRNA expression is strongly reduced in PDAC samples, as compared with adjacent tissue. Let- 7 is present in normal acinar pancreatic cells, and lost in <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> samples. In addition, let- 7 expression was repressed in patients with PDAC not eligible for surgery. Restoring let- 7 levels in cancer-derived cell lines strongly inhibits cell proliferation, K-ras expression, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, but fails to impede tumor growth progression after intratumoral gene transfer or after implantation of Capan- 1 cells stably overexpressing let- 7 microRNA. We describe {{here for the first}} time the extensive loss of expression of let- 7 in PDAC. In addition, this study provides the initial steps for a microRNA replacement therapy for this cancer...|$|E
40|$|This was a ten-year, hospital-based {{retrospective}} {{study for the}} incidence and clinical pattern of prostate cancer in southeastern Nigeria. Clinical information extracted from the files included the TNM stage, histo-pathological grading, level of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), mode of presentation and clinical and biochemical response to intravenous and oral diethylstilboestrol diphosphate (Honvan) / orchidectomy. There were 145 patients, mean age 66. 6 + 9. 8 years, giving an incidence of 61. 3 per 10 (5), with 54 % under 70 years. Most patients (81. 4 %) presented late, with 62 % metastatic. Over 98 % were adenocarcinomas, 77 % of which were moderate to well-differentiated cancers. PAP was elevated in 109 patients (75 %), (representing 92 % of all advanced tumours), and normal in 36 (25 %). Forty-two percent of <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> had normal levels of PAP. Most patients presented with urinary retention (56 %), prostatism (44 %), anaemia (41 %), recurrent UTI (35 %), bone pains (20 %), haematuria (18 %), backache (16 %) and paraplegia (6 %). Nearly 79 % responded to treatment with lowered PAP levels and improved quality of life, within a mean of 26. 3 +/- 13. 8 months (range 5 - 78); objective 81 (58 %), subjective 32 (23 %), no response 27 (19 %). Among paraplegics, 78 % had full, and 22 % had partial motor recovery. Patients with <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> had only a 33 % two-year survival rate. This study confirmed an upward, though moderate trend {{in the incidence of}} prostate cancer in Nigeria. The use of PAP instead of PSA as the tumor marker, a local diet with high fish content but lower animal fat, and poor hospital access may account for the lower incidence in the southeast. Poor health education may account for the high rate of late presentations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> are a {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic challenge in oncology. New therapies {{are needed for}} patients with <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) or anaplastic thyroid cancer, as these patients often present with advanced disease and effective systemic treatment options are currently limited. Epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations may occur in PDTC more often than previously thought. However, there are fewer than 6 cases {{reported in the literature}} where EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (such as erlotinib or gefitinib) were used to target EGFR mutations in PDTC. Here, we present the case of a 79 -year-old male with metastatic PDTC with an EGFR mutation who responded to treatment with the selective EGFR TKI erlotinib, with a progression-free survival of more than 11 months. A lung primary rather than a thyroid primary was initially detected. We suggest that the EGFR status should be analysed at diagnosis in any patient with a <b>poorly</b> <b>differentiated</b> tumour. The presence of an EGFR mutation may provide an effective therapeutic pathway for these patients. This pathway requires further investigation and consideration in the future...|$|R
