50|$|Bathtub Plot - The {{bathtub curve}} can provide {{tremendous}} {{insight into the}} BER performance of a link under test. A bathtub curve is obtained by drawing a horizontal line across the waveform under test. The probability distribution function for signal transitions (zero crossings) from a high voltage to a low voltage or a low voltage to a high voltage is then computed. The bathtub curve is useful because it can provide a lot of insight into {{the behavior of a}} system. Apart from estimating BER, it also provides an indication for the amount of margin that is in the system. When coupled with <b>protocol</b> <b>testing</b> with the Jitterlyzer, a high margin enables engineers to quickly rule out the physical layer as a potential cause of certain protocol errors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular models used in <b>protocol</b> <b>testing</b> field. A {{specific}} graphical EFSM model consists of two parts: state elements and transition elements. This paper presents a method for building a visual EFSM modeling system (VEMS), which is used to construct visual protocol EFSM models for <b>protocol</b> <b>testing.</b> VEMS consists of two main modules. One is the modeling module and the other is the model information analysis module. The function of our system can satisfy the requirements to build a visual EFSM model in <b>protocol</b> <b>testing.</b> Specially, users can modify the properties of states and transitions, change the size of states and transitions, build connection between states and transitions, etc. VEMS provides a good modeling support for <b>protocol</b> <b>testing.</b> Its advantages include friendly user interface, simple modeling operation, model persistence and recovery...|$|E

40|$|Part 6 : New Testing MethodsInternational audienceIn this paper, {{we focus}} on Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) with {{non-uniform}} node density distribution such as Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) and Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), and propose a technique for <b>protocol</b> <b>testing</b> and performance evaluation. In such MANETs, node density varies depending on locations and time, and it dynamically changes every moment. In the proposed method, we designate node density distributions and their dynamic variations in a target area. Then, we construct a graph called TestEnvGraph where all node density distributions are treated as its nodes and they are connected by edges whose weights denote differences of two node density distributions. We specify a set of edges to be tested in the graph, formulate a problem for efficiently reproducing all the given node density distributions and their dynamic variations as a rural postman problem, find its solution {{and use it as}} the order of reproduction of designated node density distributions and their variations. <b>Protocol</b> <b>testing</b> is carried out by reproducing node density distributions in the derived order. We have designed and developed a method and its tool for mobility generation on MANETs, which can reproduce any designated node density distribution and its dynamic variations in a target area. From our experiments for a VANET protocol, we have shown that our method can give a similar trend in network throughput and packet loss rates compared with realistic trace based <b>protocol</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|E

This paper proposed an approach for finding the shorter <b>test</b> sequences for <b>protocol</b> conformance <b>testing</b> based on the Wp method. The approach provides a technique for transforming {{the problem of the}} test sequence generation from a given FSM into one of finding the shortest path in the asymmetric travelling salesman problem by using one of the many existing meta-heuristic algorithms for addressing TSP.

40|$|Smartphones are {{becoming}} the dominant devices peo-ple use {{to access the}} Internet. Following this trend, a deep investigation of network protocol performance on cellular networks is becoming increasingly important. However, most of the current <b>protocol</b> <b>testing</b> on smart-phones are based on laboratory scope testbeds which require root privileges or even customized firmwares. These constraints limit such tests within a laboratory scope. Unfortunately, small scale testing cannot provide results with high confidence due to the high spatial and temporal variability of cellular networks. To address this challenge of testing network protocols at scale, we design and implement MobiBed, an open network protocol testbed for mobile phones in the wild. Each phone participating in MobiBed runs a network protocol emulator in user space that implements sand-boxed network stacks. Protocol packets are encapsulated in UDP tunnels that require no kernel changes or super-user privileges. The paper evaluates the performance of MobiBed’s <b>protocol</b> <b>testing</b> environment and shows that a MobiBed TCP implementation is comparable with the kernel based equivalent up to link speeds of 10 Mbit/sec, and shows only a 3 % overhead at speeds up to 4 Mbit/s. Through several examples we also show how MobiBed can facilitate network protocol debugging and develop-ment. ...|$|E
