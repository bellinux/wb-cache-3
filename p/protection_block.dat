Two kinds of fundamental experiments were carried on to elucidate transport process of driftwood in mountainous rivers. One of them was conducted to simulate supplying process of driftwood from riverside and to clarify its effects on stream channel changes. Driftwood models with a simple form had little influence on channel widening and bedforms when they were being conveyed downstream. Their effects on channel change became intense when a flow of large discharge concentrated them to heap up around a bed level retainer of iron angle installed at the downstream end. In another experiment, two types of driftwood models, which were devised to be more similar to actural one, were injected into a small depth flow over a rough bed covered with bed <b>protection</b> <b>block</b> models. The models traveled downstream sliding and rolling on the rough bed and stopped when they were sustained simultaneously by both a sidewall and bed roughness elements...|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} of {{electricity distribution network}} has been the important topic in terms of reliable and safe power supply for the customers. The field of distribution automation deals with the protection and safety of the electricity distribution network. Recently the topic of centralized protection system has become a hot topic for research and many companies, who are dealing with protection relays, {{have been working on}} centralized protection architectures. Traditional protection relays (intelligent electronic device, IED) have the protection blocks for the faults classified as single phase to earth fault, short circuit faults but it is lacking the ability to detect the type of the earth faults termed as cross country earth faults. In cross country earth faults two different phases of the same or different feeder are experiencing the earth fault at different position along the feeder. When the phases are earthed then they are short circuited through the ground. The objective of this thesis is to develop an algorithm to detect the cross country fault using the available protection tools so that the algorithm can be implemented in centralized protection without the need of any new measuring device. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the literature study part, different types of faults of medium voltage network (e. g. single phase to earth fault, double phase short circuit fault, phase to phase to earth fault and cross country fault), have been discussed along with some of protection techniques for these faults. The details about the IEC 61850 standard, the research prototype of centralized protection system of ABB and its protection blocks are also the part of the literature study. The medium voltage network can have neutral isolated or compensated but for this thesis neutral isolated network was the main focus for the research. In the research part, basics of the algorithm for the detection of the cross country fault are explained {{with the help of the}} flow charts. The algorithm was tested by different fault scenarios in the PSCAD simulation environment in which three medium voltage (MV) overhead feeders were modelled and also in the real time digital simulator (RTDS) in which two feeders were overhead MV lines while one feeder was MV cable feeder. In each test case, the fault resistances were varied and behavior of the algorithm was observed. The observations obtained from the testing of algorithm through simulations have proved that algorithm is able to detect the cross country fault and separate the cross country fault from other types of double phase faults. The algorithm is using the protec-tion block signal (i. e. directional earth fault <b>protection</b> <b>block</b> of the IED) for getting triggered. The practical issues relating to its implementation in centralized protection system are highlighted at the end of the thesis. Moreover the algorithm has reduced the time of operation against the cross country fault as compared to the directional earth fault <b>protection</b> <b>block</b> of IED. It was also observed that there are some cases when the fault resistances and the distance between the faults are small then the algorithm detect the cross country fault as the phase to phase to earth fault. For future there is still space for the improvement of the algorithm especially in the cases where the fault is wrongly detected. In addition the algorithm for the compensated neutral network still needs to be developed for the detection of cross country faults. In the nut shell, it can be said that the new developed algorithm for the detection of the cross country fault covers almost all the cases and it does not need any new measur-ing device for working. It is also using the <b>protection</b> <b>block</b> of IEDs of ABB so it is easy to implement it in centralized protection system as IEDs are basic blocks for this kind of system...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of power system protection {{is affected by}} out-of-step conditions in that system. Protection relays such as distance relays may detect an out-of-step condition and consequently operate to trip unfaulted lines. The tripping of unfaulted lines interrupts supply to loads and exacerbates an already existing stability problem. To prevent distance-relay operation during out-of-step conditions, distance protection can incorporate out-of-step <b>blocking</b> <b>protection.</b> The purpose of the out-of-step <b>blocking</b> <b>protection</b> is to detect an out-of-step condition and, upon detection, block distance-relay operation. In the research the following were investigated: 1) The effect of out-of-step conditions on distance-protection performance 2) The {{performance of}} distance <b>protection</b> incorporating out-of-step <b>blocking</b> <b>protection,</b> during out-of-step conditions. A nine-bus IEEE benchmark network was chosen {{for the purposes of}} the research. The nine-bus network is representative, simple and small. It is a benchmark which is often used in comparative studies in the power system field. The nine-bus network data taken from reference [22] (see Table 3. 1 in Chapter 3) were consistently used for every study done. Mathematical protection models representing the behaviour of distance <b>protection</b> incorporating out-of-step <b>blocking</b> <b>protection</b> were modelled in such a way as to simulate the protection of every line in the nine-bus network. These models were included in the power system model representing the nine-bus network. Two types of stability studies were done to investigate protection performance: a dynamic-stability study and a transient-stability study. IV In modelling the protection in the stability studies, it was found that a cascade effect of switching unfaulted lines can occur due to relay operation. Results also show that distance-protection performance improves with the application of out-of-step <b>blocking</b> <b>protection.</b> The research covers the following topics: 1) Dynamic stability 2) Transient stability 3) Distance <b>protection</b> 4) Out-of-step <b>blocking</b> <b>protection</b> results are discussed. An important conclusion reached is the need to take protection performance into account in routine stability studies. It will be shown that this may change the outcome of a stability study.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} examine the {{condition}} of intermediate sodiumtosodium heat exchangers (IHX) and to substantiate their operation life extension to 45 years at the BN 600 reactor plant at Beloyarsk NPP Unit 3, {{one of the six}} heat exchangers was removed from the reactor in April 2006. Inspection revealed cracks with 7 maximum depth of mm on the outer surface of the upper tubesheet (UTS) and adjacent shell. To predict durability of substantially fatigued metal, verification of the existing relationship for the threshold stress intensity factor range for the 10 Cr 18 Ni 9 steel was needed. To this end, specimens of two structural elements in the IHX – upper tube sheet and <b>protection</b> <b>block</b> were tested. To identify failure mechanisms, fractographic studies were performed on the surface of cracks detected in the tube sheet and produced in the specimens. The studies led {{to the conclusion that the}} failure mechanism for cracks detected on the tube sheet was identical to the mechanism generated in the test specimens. In both cases the intergranular failure prevailed that is typical for the material stress level indicative of crack growth termination. This result makes it possible to speak about crack initiation and propagation in the IHX tube sheet in the high-cycle fatigue region at low-level strain ranges and stress intensity factor ranges. An analysis of causes of crack formation showed that the cracks could have formed as a result of the temperature pulsation effect produced by mixing of sodium flows having different temperatures – sodium entering the IHX inlet and sodium coming from the reactor vessel cooling system. Computational analysis results showed that for all thermal pulsation conditions and crack propagation cross-sections under consideration, the leak-tightness condition is met for the upper tube-sheet and IHX outlet chamber shell that divide the primary and secondary coolant circuits. The computational and experimental studies have proved that presence of these cracks does not limit the potential service life extension to 45 years for the IHX in the BN 600 reactor plant...|$|E

40|$|During {{the work}} on the project control and {{protection}} circuitry for power semiconductors (e. g. IGBTs) was developed.

The majority of the control and <b>protection</b> <b>blocks</b> were combined on the primary side. An ASIC was developed to serve this task. Protection of the power semiconductor against the most severe threat, short circuit, uses an ocp-concept (over current protection).

40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} new way to integrate thermal protection materials on external surfaces of vehicles that experience the severe heating environments of atmospheric entry from space. Cured <b>blocks</b> of thermal <b>protection</b> materials are bonded into a compatible, large-cell honeycomb matrix that can be applied on the external surfaces of the vehicles. The honeycomb matrix cell size, and corresponding thermal <b>protection</b> material <b>block</b> size, is envisioned to be between 1 and 4 in. (. 2. 5 and 10 cm) on a side, with a depth required to protect the vehicle. The cell wall thickness is thin, between 0. 01 and 0. 10 in. (. 0. 025 and 0. 25 cm). A key feature is that the honeycomb matrix is attached to the vehicle fs unprotected external surface prior to insertion of the thermal <b>protection</b> material <b>blocks.</b> The attachment integrity of the honeycomb can then be confirmed over the full range of temperature and loads that the vehicle will experience. Another key feature of the innovation is the use of uniform-sized thermal <b>protection</b> material <b>blocks.</b> This feature allows for the mass production of these blocks at a size that is convenient for quality control inspection. The honeycomb that receives the blocks must have cells with a compatible set of internal dimensions. The innovation involves the use of a faceted subsurface under the honeycomb. This provides a predictable surface with perpendicular cell walls {{for the majority of the}} blocks. Some cells will have positive tapers to accommodate mitered joints between honeycomb panels on each facet of the subsurface.
