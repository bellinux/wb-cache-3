(2) to apply statistical models to evaluate each ratio of Cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and PEG 6000 in solid dispersion in terms of easy application and usefulness, and (3) to identify the most suitable ratio of Cefpodoxime <b>Proxetil</b> and PEG 6000 as solid dispersion. Solid dispersions of Cefpodoxime <b>Proxetil</b> were prepared with PEG 6000 in different ratios by using kneading method. Dissolution profile of all these solid dispersions were compared with dissolution profile of Cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and physical mixture of Cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and PEG 6000. The results showed that the Solid dispersions containing PEG in different proportions exhibit faster release (about 2. 2 – 3 fold faster) than Cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and physical mixture of Cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and PEG. Among the solid dispersions containing different ratios batch A containing Cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and PEG 6000 in 1 : 1 ratio exhibited about 3 fold improvement in release profile. The release kinetics of Solid dispersions was investigated using several mathematical equations. In Model-independent method similarity factor, f 2, was used for the comparison of in vitro dissolution profiles. The results showed that model-dependent methods were more discriminative than model-independent methods. Model independent methods seemed to be easier to apply and interpret; only one value is obtained to describe the closeness of the two dissolution profiles. The application and evaluation of model-dependent methods were more complicated; these methods present an acceptable model approach to the true relationship between percent dissolved and time variables, including statistical assumptions that could be checked...|$|E

According to these characteristics, preparation of cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> microparticle has been achieved using high-speed homogenization. Polymers (methylcellulose, sodium alginate, and chitosan) were precipitated {{on the surface of}} cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> using sodium citrate and calcium chloride as salting-out agents.

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity of cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. Strains of Klebsiella spp. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influeniae were effectively reduced by {{a dose of}} 200 mg. While for Esck coli no dose-activity relationship was observed—the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg—Staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. The lower doses showed stcpwise lower activities. Apart from broad spectrum /Mactamases like SHV 2 or TEM 5 the presence of plasmid coded /J-lactamases in Esch. coli and H. inftuenzae {{did not affect the}} {{antibacterial activity}} of cefpodoxime <b>proxetiL</b> The results show that cefpodoxime was more active against Gram-negative bacteria than amoxycuTin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro mode...|$|E
40|$|Now a day {{oral route}} {{is the easiest}} and most {{prominent}} route for drug delivery. More than 40 % of new chemical entities exhibit poor aqueous solubility result in unsatisfactory oral drug delivery. Cefpodoxime <b>Proxetil</b> is a Class IV drug, possess lower solubility and lower bioavailability. The {{aim of this study}} was to formulate and evaluate a Micro emulsion to overcome these issues. Capmul MCM was selected as an oily phase, tween 80 as a surfactant and PEG 400 as a co-surfactant. The batches of emulsion were formulated by spontaneous emulsification method. Different concentrations of Surfactant and Co. Surfactant were used to formulate micro emulsion. Evaluation parameters such as Globule size, pH, Viscosity, Clarity, Dilution test, Centrifugation and Freeze Thaw method were tested. %CDR, Drug content and Anti-microbial assay were also calculated.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of cefpodoxime {{were determined}} after a single oral dose of 261 mg of cefpodoxime <b>proxetil,</b> equivalent to 200 mg of cefpodoxime, {{was given to}} each of six healthy male volunteers. Concentrations in serum, urine, and cantharidin-induced inflammatory fluid were measured by a microbiological assay. The mean peak level in plasma was 2. 1 micrograms/ml, attained at a mean time of 2. 9 h. The mean half-life of elimination from serum was 2. 2 h. The inflammatory exudate was penetrated moderately rapidly, the mean peak level being 1. 7 micrograms/ml at 3. 5 h. The mean percent penetration of the inflammatory exudate was 103. 7. The mean 24 -h urine recovery of cefpodoxime was 32. 2 %. This study suggests that cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> taken once or twice daily will be sufficient to treat urinary or systemic infections caused by susceptible pathogens...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{changes in}} fecal flora and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics with the oral antibiotics ceftibuten 400 mg daily and cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> (CPX) 200 mg every 12 h, compared to amoxycillin/clavulanate 500 / 125 mg every 8 h during and following 1 week of medication. MethodsIn an open randomized triple crossover design, 18 (nine female, nine male) healthy volunteers received each drug for 7 days, {{followed by a}} ‘washout’ period of 4 weeks. Serum and urine levels of the substances were determined by bioassay, and for ceftibuten isomers by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis of quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures of feces was performed, and β-lactamase activity was determined. ResultsCeftibuten showed a mean Cmax of 18. 9 (SD 3. 0) mg/L, a terminal half-life of 2. 89 h, and an AUCtot of 100 (21. 8) mg. h/L; protein binding was 63. 7 (5. 1) %, and accumulation was marginal. Cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> had a Cmax of 1. 92 (0. 61) mg/L, a terminal half-life of 1. 97 (0. 42) h and an AUCtot of 10. 8 (3. 3) mg. h/L; no accumulation was seen. Amoxycillin and clavulanate had Cmax values of 7. 15 (2. 16) mg/L and 3. 39 (1. 31) mg/L, terminal half-life values of 1. 03 (0. 15) h and 0. 93 (0. 17) h, AUCtot values of 20. 0 (4. 2) mg. h/L and 8. 87 (3. 10) mg. h/L, {{and there was no}} accumulation. Statistical analysis for ech microorganism in fecal samples showed significant differences between amoxycillin/clavulanate and the two third-generation cephalosporins, but virtually no differences between ceftibuten and cefpodoxime <b>proxetil.</b> Eleven of 12 volunteers reported loose stools (days 2 – 7, mean duration 4. 4 (SD 2. 7) days) with amoxycillin/clavulanate, but nobody during ceftibuten administration and one volunteer during cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> administration. ConclusionsCeftibuten showed excellent and cefpodoxime favorable pharmacokinetic properties, with significantly less pronounced fecal flora changes and intestinal side effects compared to amoxycillin/clavulanate. The multiple crossover design allows powerful microbiological statistical analysis and pharmacokinetic parameter comparisons...|$|E

40|$|A new, simple, precise, {{rapid and}} {{accurate}} RP-HPLC method {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous estimation of cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and clavulanic acid from pharmaceutical dosage forms. The method was carried out on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB 5 &#x 00 B 5; C 18 (150 x 4. 6 mm) column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile: 50 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3. 0, 70 : 30 v/v) at a flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min. Detection was carried out at 228 nm. Aspirin {{was used as an}} internal standard. The retention time of clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and aspirin was 4. 43, 6. 44 and 5. 6 min, respectively. The developed method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification and solution stability.

40|$|Three {{groups of}} six healthy adult volunteers were {{randomly}} assigned to a treatment with 400 mg of oral cefpodoxime <b>proxetil,</b> oral cefixime, or placebo per day for 10 days. Informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. Clostridium difficile was not detected in the feces of any subject before treatment or {{at any time in the}} subjects in the placebo group. C. difficile was, however, detected in all subjects treated with cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and in five of six treated with cefixime. Genomic DNA restriction patterns showed that the strains of C. difficile differed from one volunteer to another. Two subjects both shed different strains at different times during the 25 -day surveillance period. All isolates were resistant to cefixime and cefpodoxime (MIC for 90 % of strains, 256 and 512 mg/liter, respectively). Antibiotic activity was found in the feces of one volunteer treated with cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> and of four volunteers treated with cefixime. It was inversely correlated with the presence of fecal beta-lactamase activity. Intestinal side effects were limited to modifications of stool consistency, which occurred in only 3 of the 12 treated volunteers and did not lead to cessation of treatment. These modifications were significantly associated with the presence of fecal antibiotic activity (P less than 0. 05) but not with the shedding of toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains of C. difficile or with the presence of toxin A in feces, which was detected only in one perfectly healthy treated volunteer...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{attempt was made}} to develop GRDDS for {{cefpodoxime}} <b>proxetil</b> using Ethyl cellulose and HPMC as a release retarded material by solvent evaporation technique. Four different batches of microspheres were prepared by varying the concentration of ethyl cellulose from 1 to 4 g. The microspheres were characterized for drug content, percentage yield, particle size analysis and surface morphology. It was observed the increase in concentration of ethyl cellulose increases the entrapment efficiency and mean particle size of the microspheres. The effect of polymer concentration on the in vitrorelease of cefpodoxime <b>proxetil</b> from the microspheres was also studied. It can be seen that by increasing the polymer concentration, decreases the rate of drug release from the microspheres dramatically. The best microsphere formulation was selected based on the in vitro release profile and subjected for further pharmacokinetic studies. An in vivo studies revealed that the relative bioavailability of the drug increased by more than 1. 5 times by formulating it into microspheres...|$|E
