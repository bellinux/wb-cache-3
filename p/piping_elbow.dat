40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this joint {{research}} project was to develop and demonstrate advanced sensors and computational technology for continuous monitoring of the condition of components, structures, and systems in advanced and next-generation nuclear power plants (NPPs). This project included investigating and adapting several advanced sensor technologies from Korean and US national laboratory research communities, {{some of which were}} developed and applied in non-nuclear industries. The project team investigated and developed sophisticated signal processing, noise reduction, and pattern recognition techniques and algorithms. The researchers installed sensors and conducted condition monitoring tests on two test loops, a check valve (an active component) and a <b>piping</b> <b>elbow</b> (a passive component), to demonstrate the feasibility of using advanced sensors and computational technology to achieve the project goal. Acoustic emission (AE) devices, optical fiber sensors, accelerometers, and ultrasonic transducers (UTs) were used to detect mechanical vibratory response of check valve and <b>piping</b> <b>elbow</b> in normal and degraded configurations. Chemical sensors were also installed to monitor the water chemistry in the <b>piping</b> <b>elbow</b> test loop. Analysis results of processed sensor data indicate that it is feasible to differentiate between the normal and degraded (with selected degradation mechanisms) configurations of these two components from the acquired sensor signals, but it is questionable that these methods can reliably identify the level and type of degradation. Additional research and development efforts are needed to refine the differentiation techniques and to reduce the level of uncertainties...|$|E

The testing described has been performed {{in order to}} reduce uncertainties in the currently used design values for predicting irrecoverable pressure losses. The earlier high Reynolds number correlations had been based on extrapolations over several orders of magnitude in Reynolds number from where the original database existed.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the development of}} two different finite <b>piping</b> <b>elbow</b> elements with two nodal tubular sections for mechanical analysis. The formulation is based on thin shell displacement theory, where the displacement is based on high-order polynomial or trigonometric functions for rigid-beam displacement, and uses Fourier series to model warping and ovalization phenomena of cross-tubular section. To model the internal pressure effect an additional formulation {{is used in the}} elementary stiffness matrix definition. Elbows attached to nozzle or straight pipes produce a stiffening effect due to the restraint of ovalization provided by the adjacent components. When submitted to any efforts, the excessive oval shape may reduce the structural resistance and can lead to structural collapse. For design tubular systems {{it is also important to}} consider the internal-pressure effect, given its effect on the reduction of the pipe flexibility. Some conclusions and examples are compared with results produced by other authors...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of elastic follow-up in high temperature piping {{has a long}} history and rules to limit its significance in design are well established. However, most design rules, and numerous associated supporting studies, have been limited to a simple power-law of creep, with variations to account for time- or strain-hardening in primary creep. A common feature of the most studies of elastic follow-up in structures subject to power-law creep is that a plot of (maximum) stress against strain – a so-called isochronous stress-strain trajectory – is almost insensitive to the creep law (in particular the stress exponent in the power law) and is almost linear (until perhaps the later stages of stress relaxation). A limitation of the power-law is that it is assumes to be valid across all stress ranges, from low through moderate to high, yet {{it is well known that}} this is not generally the case. This paper aims to investigate the effect of stress range dependent material models on the nature of elastic follow up: both a simple two-bar structure (common in studies of elastic follow-up) and a detailed finite element analysis of a <b>piping</b> <b>elbow</b> are examined. It is found that stress range dependent material models can have a significant effect on the accepted characteristics of elastic follow-up...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{drops of}} {{multiple}} piping elbows were experimentally determined for high Reynolds number flows. The testing described has been performed {{in order to}} reduce uncertainties in the currently used methods for predicting irrecoverable pressure losses and also to provide a qualification database for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computer codes. The earlier high Reynolds number correlations had been based on extrapolations over several orders of magnitude in Reynolds number from where the original database existed. Recent single elbow test data shows about a factor of two lower elbow pressure loss coefficient (at 40 x 106 Reynolds number) than those from current correlations. This single <b>piping</b> <b>elbow</b> data has been extended in this study to a multiple elbow configuration of two elbows that are 90 o out-of-plane relative to each other. The effects of separation distance and Reynolds number have been correlated and presented in a form {{that can be used for}} design application. Contrary to earlier extrapolations from low Reynolds numbers (Re c 1. 0 x 106), a strong Reynolds number dependence was found to exist. The combination of the high Reynolds number single elbow data with the multiple elbow interaction effects measured in this study shows that earlier design correlations are conservative by significant margins at high Reynolds numbers. Qualification of CFD predictions with this new high Reynolds number database will help guide the need for additional high Reynolds number testing of other piping configurations. The study also included velocity measurements at several positions downstream of the first and second test elbows using an ultrasonic flowmeter. Reasonable agreement after the first test elbow was found relative to flow fields that are known to exist from low Reynolds number visual tests and also from CFD predictions. This data should help to qualify CFD predictions of the three-dimensional flow stream downstream of the second test elbow...|$|E
40|$|High Reynolds number {{test data}} has {{recently}} been reported for both single and multiple <b>piping</b> <b>elbow</b> design configurations at earlier ASME Fluid Engineering Division conferences. The data of these studies ranged up to a Reynolds number of 42 x 10 [sup] 6 which is significantly greater than that used to establish design correlations before the data was available. Many of the accepted design correlations, based on the lower Reynolds number data, date back as much as fifty years. The new data shows that these earlier correlations are extremely conservative for high Reynolds number applications. Based on the recent high Reynolds number information a new recommended method has been developed for calculating irrecoverable pressure loses in piping systems for design considerations such as establishing pump sizing requirements. This paper describes the recommended design approach and additional testing that has been performed {{as part of the}} qualification of the method. This qualification testing determined the irrecoverable pressure loss of a piping configuration that would typify a limiting piping section in a complicated piping network, i. e., multiple, tightly coupled, out-of-plane elbows in series under high Reynolds number flow conditions. The overall pressure loss measurements were then compared to predictions, which used the new methodology to assure that conservative estimates for the pressure loss (of the type used for pump sizing) were obtained. The recommended design methodology, the qualification testing and the comparison between the predictions and the test data are presented. A major conclusion {{of this study is that}} the recommended method for calculating irrecoverable pressure loss in piping systems is conservative yet significantly lower than predicted by early design correlations that were based on the extrapolation of low Reynolds number test data...|$|E
40|$|Test data is {{described}} for three different <b>piping</b> <b>elbows.</b> These include 900 elbows with radii of curvature of 12 and 1. 5, and a 45 {degrees} elbow with a {{radius of curvature}} of 1. 2. These radii of curvature are sufficiently sharp to cause significant irrecoverable pressure losses to occur. The variation in static wall pressure was measured upstream and downstream of each elbow plus spatially around the elbow itself. Irrecoverable loss coefficients over a range of flows were obtained and correlations for the data are provided. The testing extended the Reynolds number range of the currently existing data base in various handbooks (and other references available in the open literature) by over a factor of five.

40|$|Motivated by the {{response}} of industrial piping under seismic loading conditions, the present study examines the behavior of steel process <b>piping</b> <b>elbows,</b> subjected to strong cyclic loading conditions. A set of experiments is conducted on elbow specimens subjected to constant amplitude in-plane cyclic bending, resulting into failure in the low-cycle-fatigue range. The experimental results are used to develop a low-cycle-fatigue curve within the strain-based fatigue design framework. The experimental work is supported by finite element analyses, which account for geometrical and material nonlinearities. Using advanced plasticity models to describe the behavior of elbow material, the analysis focuses on localized deformations at the critical positions where cracking occurs. Finally, the relevant provisions of design codes (ASME B 31. 3 and EN 13480) for elbow design are discussed and assessed, {{with respect to the}} experimental and numerical findings.

40|$|AbstractThe {{relative}} displacement of a piping system installed between isolated and nonisolated structures in a severe earthquake might be larger when without a seismic isolation system.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{results from}} tests {{conducted at the}} GRI Metering Research Facility to evaluate: (1) the effect of upstream <b>piping</b> <b>elbows</b> on ultrasonic meter accuracy, and (2) the effectiveness of several commercial flow conditioners in mitigating error problems. Two 8 -inch commercial multipath meters and two single-path meters were tested at locations downstream of single, double in-plane, and double out-of-plane elbows. Test results document the velocity profile and swirl distortions produced by typical meter station inlet piping arrangements, and show that more than 100 pipe diameters of straight pipe may be required upstream of a meter to reduce flow distortions to acceptable levels. Results also document the performances of all four meters in both undisturbed and distorted flow conditions. Sensitivity of the test meters to these distortions depended {{on the number of}} acoustic paths, path location, and internal meter data processing. Flow conditioners can reduce profile distortions, but do not always prevent error problems. Techniques are described to allow calculation of predicted error based on path geometry, measured profile shape, and the meter's internal weighting algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 99 Explanations and {{guidelines}} for the phenomena of cavitation noise above the NPSHR of a pump are presented, backed by laboratory and field tests. The hydraulic Institute Concepts of low, and very high suction energy, and NPSH margin are explained and related to cavitation noise and suction pressure pulsations. Cavitation is shown to exist above the NPSHR of a centrifugal pump, and {{be related to the}} suction energy level. High suction energy pumps above a certain threshold, with low NPSH margins, can produce severe cavitation noise, especially at reduced flowrates. Test results on an end suction pump also demonstrate the interaction between the air content in the water and cavitation noise within the pump, over varying NPSH margin ratios, flowrate, and speed (energy level). A small amount of air is shown to dramatically reduce the suction pressure pulsation levels. Further, suction pressure pulsation levels are seen to increase as the NPSH margin is reduced, until dissolved air begins to come out of solution and reverse the trend. Finally, test results show the negative effects of <b>piping</b> <b>elbows</b> close to the pump inlet on cavitation noise, especially with high suction energy levels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{ratcheting}} {{strains of}} the straight and <b>elbow</b> <b>piping</b> under two kinds of loads—pressurized piping under symmetric cyclic bending and pulsating cyclic pressure were analyzed based on Chaboche constitutive model. The locations of the maximum ratcheting strain were determined. The ratcheting boundaries of the two piping structures under two kinds of loads were compared and calculated by the C-TDF method. For the pressurized piping under symmetric cyclic bending, the allowable bending load increases from E 90 S to E 90 L under the same pressure. In the higher cyclic pressure range, the allowable pressure have little difference under the same bending load which indicates that the bend moment have a bit effects on the ratcheting boundary in the higher cyclic pressure range...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an analysis program which can accurately simulate ratcheting in piping components subjected to seismic or other cyclic loads. Ratcheting is defined as the accumulation of deformation in structures and materials with cycles. This phenomenon has been demonstrated to cause failure to piping components (known as ratcheting-fatigue failure) and is yet to be understood clearly. The design and analysis methods in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for ratcheting of piping components are not well accepted by the practicing engineering community. This research project attempts to understand the ratcheting-fatigue failure mechanisms and improve analysis methods for ratcheting predictions. In the first step a state-of-the-art testing facility is developed for quasi-static cyclic and seismic testing of straight and <b>elbow</b> <b>piping</b> components. A systematic testing program to study ratcheting is developed. Some tests have already been performed an d the rest will be completed by summer' 99. Significant {{progress has been made in}} the area of constitutive modeling. A number of sophisticated constitutive models have been evaluated in terms of their simulations for a broad class of ratcheting responses. From the knowledge gained from this evaluation study two improved models are developed. These models are demonstrated to have promise in simulating ratcheting responses in piping components. Hence, implementation of these improved models in widely used finite element programs, ANSYS and/or ABAQUS, is in progress. Upon achieving improved finite element programs for simulation of ratcheting, the ASME Code provisions for ratcheting of piping components will be reviewed and more rational methods will be suggested. Also, simplified analysis methods will be developed for operability studies of piping components and systems. Some of the future works will be performed under the auspices of the Center for Nuclear Power Plant Structures, Equipment and Piping. Proposals for future funding also will be submitted to different organizations and industries to speed up the progress of the research...|$|R
