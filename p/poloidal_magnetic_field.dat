40|$|We {{model the}} {{non-linear}} ideal magnetohydrodynamics of <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in neutron stars in general relativity assuming a polytropic equation of state. We identify familiar hydromagnetic modes, {{in particular the}} 'sausage/varicose' mode and 'kink' instability inherent to <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The evolution {{is dominated by the}} kink instability, which causes a cataclysmic reconfiguration of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The system subsequently evolves to new, non-axisymmetric, quasi-equilibrium end-states. The existence of this branch of stable quasi-equilibria may have consequences for magnetar physics, including flare generation mechanisms and interpretations of quasi-periodic oscillations.

40|$|We {{obtain the}} general forms {{for the current}} density and the {{vorticity}} from the integrability conditions of the basic equations which govern the stationary states of axisymmetric magnetized self-gravitating barotropic objects with meridional flows under the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation. As seen from the stationary condition equations for such bodies, {{the presence of the}} meridional flows and that of the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> act oppositely on the internal structures. The different actions of these two physical quantities, the meridional flows and the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> could be clearly seen through stationary structures of the toroidal gaseous configurations around central point masses in the framework of Newtonian gravity because the effects of the two physical quantities can be seen in an amplified way for toroidal systems compared to those for spheroidal stars. The meridional flows make the structures more compact, i. e. the widths of toroids thinner, while the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are apt to elongate the density contours in a certain direction depending on the situation. Therefore, the simultaneous presence of the internal flows and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> would work as if there were no such different actions within and around the stationary gaseous objects such as axisymmetric magnetized toroids with internal motions around central compact objects under the ideal MHD approximation, although these two quantities might exist in real systems.

40|$|Observations of {{clusters}} of galaxies show ubiquitous presence of X-ray cavities, presumably blown by the active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets.

For axisymmetric configurations embedded in unmagnetized plasma, {{the continuity of}} <b>poloidal</b> and toroidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> components {{on the surface of}} the bubble then requires solving the elliptical Grad-Shafranov equation with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

40|$|Black hole [...] {{neutron star}} (BHNS) binary mergers can form disks in which magnetorotational {{instability}} (MRI) -induced turbulence may drive accretion onto the remnant BH, supporting relativistic jets and providing the engine for a short-hard gamma-ray burst (SGRB). Our earlier study of magnetized BHNSs showed that NS tidal disruption winds the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> into a toroidal configuration, with poloidal fields {{so weak that}} capturing MRI with full-disk simulations would require ∼ 10 ^ 8 CPU-hours. In that study we imposed equatorial symmetry, suppressing <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> that might be generated from plasma crossing the orbital plane. Here we show that initial conditions that break this symmetry (i. e., tilted <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in the NS) generate much stronger poloidal fields in the disk, indicating that asymmetric initial conditions may be necessary for establishing BHNS mergers as SGRB progenitors via fully general relativistic MHD simulations. We demonstrate that BHNS mergers may form an SGRB engine under the right conditions by seeding the remnant disk from an unmagnetized BHNS simulation with purely poloidal fields dynamically unimportant initially, but strong enough to resolve MRI. Magnetic turbulence occurs in the disk, driving accretion and supporting Poynting-dominated jet outflows sufficient to power an SGRB. Comment: Matches published version; 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

50|$|Early fusion {{research}} {{devices were}} variants on the Z-pinch and used electric current {{to generate a}} <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to contain the plasma along a linear axis between two points. Researchers discovered that a simple toroidal field, in which the magnetic field lines run in circles around an axis of symmetry, confines a plasma hardly better than no field at all. This can be understood {{by looking at the}} orbits of individual particles. The particles not only spiral around the field lines, they also drift across the field. Since a toroidal field is curved and decreases in strength moving away from the axis of rotation, the ions and the electrons move parallel to the axis, but in opposite directions. The charge separation leads to an electric field and an additional drift, in this case outward (away from the axis of rotation) for both ions and electrons. Alternatively, the plasma {{can be viewed as a}} torus of fluid with a magnetic field frozen in. The plasma pressure results in a force that tends to expand the torus. The magnetic field outside the plasma cannot prevent this expansion. The plasma simply slips between the field lines.|$|E
40|$|We perform {{nonlinear}} general relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamic {{simulations of}} <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in rotating polytropic neutron stars. We have three primary goals: i) {{to understand the}} nature of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities inherent to <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in non-rotating and rotating neutron stars, ii) to explore the possible space of stable equilibrium configurations and iii) to understand gravitational wave emissions caused by the catastrophic reconfiguration of <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> associated with giant magnetar flares. Our key physical contributions can be summarized as follows: i) gravitational waves from f-modes caused by magnetar flares are unlikely to be detected in the current or near-future generation of gravitational waves observatories, ii) gravitational waves from Alfven waves propagating inside the neutron star are more likely candidates, although this interpretation relies on the unknown damping time of these modes, iii) any <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> equilibria derived from our simulations are characterized as non-axisymmetric, with approximately 65 % of their magnetic energy in the poloidal field, iv) rotation acts to separate the timescales of different instabilities in our system, with the varicose mode playing a more major role due to a delayed kink instability and v) despite the slowing growth rate of the kink mode, it is always present in our simulations, even for models where the rotational period is of the same order as the Alfven timescale.

30|$|When {{considering}} {{the effects of}} a current distribution in a sphere, it is common practice to separate the ‘toroidal’ current systems, which have current purely in concentric spherical surfaces and have no radial component, from the ‘poloidal’ current systems, which do have radial (as well as tangential) components); see e.g. Backus et al. (1996, section 5.3). It is a standard result that toroidal currents produce only <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> {{both inside and outside the}} region of current, while poloidal current systems produce only toroidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> and these only inside the current region.
