INTRODUCTION Libraries are enclaves in which a large volume of useful information is organized and made accessible to wide user communities. As in other institutions of higher education, at the University of the Americas-Puebla (UDLA), Mexico, the library has become a key resource for students, faculty and the general public. With about half a million titles, the library holds materials including books, magazines, maps, and historical archives in various formats.

5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> within choruses.|$|E

Lazio blundered {{during a}} September debate by seeming to invade Clinton's <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> {{trying to get}} her to sign a fundraising agreement. The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent. She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001, making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while, or after, serving as first lady.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{navigate}} {{in a social}} environment, a robot {{must be aware of}} social spaces, which include proximity and interaction-based constraints. Previous models of interaction and <b>personal</b> <b>spaces</b> have been inspired by studies in social psychology but not systematically grounded and validated with respect to experimental data. We propose to implement <b>personal</b> and interaction <b>space</b> models in order to replicate a classical psychology experiment. Our robotic simulations can thus be compared with experimental data from humans. Thanks to this comparison, we first show the validity of our models, examine the necessity of the interaction and <b>personal</b> <b>spaces</b> and discuss their geometric shape. Our experiments suggest that human-like robotic behavior can be obtained by using only correctly calibrated <b>personal</b> <b>spaces</b> (i. e., without explicit representation of interaction spaces and therefore, without the need to detect interactions between humans in the environment) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{considerable}} amount of information can be gathered about another person by observing his orher belongings found in their <b>personal</b> living <b>space,</b> including both their physical and virtualworld. While it may be expected that observed individuals maymanipulate their <b>personal</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{it is difficult to}} obtain a pristine impression even if oneattempts to. Furthermore, most individuals desire to be perceived as they actually are rather thanas their ideal selves. Although consensus among people tends to vary, most people tend to berelatively accurate in their personality predictions based on others’ <b>personal</b> <b>spaces.</b> Stereotypescan play a helpful role in accuracy when there is slight truth to the assumption as well as whenthe observer correctly guesses the gender of the individual.|$|R
25|$|People make {{exceptions}} to and modify their space requirements. A number of relationships may allow for <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, {{where there is}} a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. <b>Personal</b> <b>space</b> is affected by a person's position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger <b>personal</b> <b>space.</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>space</b> also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> than females, and <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> has a positive relation to age (people use more as they get older). Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> by age twelve.|$|E
25|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>space</b> {{is highly}} variable, due to {{cultural}} differences and personal preferences. On average, preferences vary significantly between countries.

25|$|Entering somebody's <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> is {{normally}} {{an indication of}} familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, {{it can be difficult}} to maintain <b>personal</b> <b>space,</b> for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable, though it is accepted as a fact of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, is unacceptable physical contact.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Digital {{libraries}} allow {{users to}} access {{large amounts of}} organised audio information. Users of these libraries are able to collect required information, that is then stored and organised for later use. A useful feature of some digital libraries {{is the ability to}} create <b>personal</b> <b>spaces</b> within the library where users may collect and organise their information in an appropriate way for them. Some of these <b>personal</b> <b>spaces</b> allow users to organise their information spatially. A difficulty with spatial organisation is that as the amount of information grows, users may become visually overloaded, and the ability to re-find information becomes slower and more error-prone. To overcome this, this paper proposes a tool that allows users to organise their audio collections spatially using audio cues to reduce the effects of visual overload. ...|$|R
25|$|Each user had a <b>personal</b> <b>space</b> {{which they}} could modify and change suitably. The initial basic apartment, the Harbour Studio, was free and offered users limited options for {{customization}} and personalization. Users could invite any other Home user (even cross-region, unless space was region locked) to their <b>personal</b> <b>space.</b> Some personal spaces, such as the PlayStation Home Mansion, had a built-in TV that played content from PlayStation (such as PlayStation.Blog). Loot Interactive's personal spaces had a variety of content that could be played on their Entertainment on Demand (EOD) screens. Users could also place their own digital photographs in picture frames to display {{on the walls of}} their apartment. While the Harbour Studio and basic furniture was provided to all users free of charge, premium personal spaces and furniture could be bought from stores. Other ways to obtain furniture, decorative ornaments, or even entire personal spaces included winning mini-games in Home and from playing certain PS3 games that supported Home rewards.|$|E
