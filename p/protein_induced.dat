50|$|Des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP), {{also known}} as <b>protein</b> <b>induced</b> by vitamin K absence/antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), is an {{abnormal}} form of the coagulation protein, prothrombin. Normally, the prothrombin precursor undergoes post-translational carboxylation (addition of a carboxylic acid group) by gamma-glutamyl carboxylase in the liver prior to secretion into plasma. DCP/PIVKA-II may be detected in people with deficiency of vitamin K (due to poor nutrition or malabsorption) and in those taking warfarin or other medication that inhibits the action of vitamin K.|$|E
5000|$|AlkB {{protein is}} a <b>protein</b> <b>induced</b> during an {{adaptive}} response and {{is involved in}} the direct reversal of alkylation damage. [...] AlkB specifically removes alkylation damage to single stranded (SS) DNA caused by SN2 type of chemical agents. [...] It efficiently removes methyl groups from 1-methyl adenines, 3-methyl cytosines in SS DNA. [...] AlkB belongs to the Fe (II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily and oxidatively demethylates the DNA substrate. [...] Demethylation by AlkB is accompanied with release of CO2, succinate and formaldehyde.|$|E
50|$|Apoptosis, a major form of cell death, is an {{efficient}} mechanism for eliminating unwanted cells and is of central importance for development and homeostasis in metazoan animals. In mice, the death inducer-obliterator-1 gene is upregulated by apoptotic signals and encodes a cytoplasmic protein that translocates to the nucleus upon apoptotic signal activation. When overexpressed, the mouse <b>protein</b> <b>induced</b> apoptosis in cell lines growing in vitro. This gene {{is similar to}} the mouse gene and therefore is thought to be involved in apoptosis. Alternatively spliced transcripts have been found for this gene, encoding multiple isoforms.|$|E

40|$|<b>Proteins</b> <b>induced</b> by {{benzoic acid}} in Escherichia coli were {{observed}} on two-dimensional electrophoretic gels (2 -D gels). Cultures were grown in glucose-rich medium {{in the presence}} or absence of 20 mM benzoate at an external pH of 6. 5, where the pH gradient (deltapH) is large and benzoate accumulates, and at an external pH of 8. 0, where deltapH is inverted and little benzoate is taken up. Radiolabeled proteins were separated on 2 -D gels and were identified on the basis of the index of VanBogelen and Neidhardt. In the absence of benzoic acid, little difference was seen between pH 6. 5 and pH 8. 0; this confirms that the mechanisms of protein homeostasis in this range are constitutive, including the transition between positive and inverted deltapH. Addition of benzoate at pH 6. 5 increased the expression of 33 proteins. Twelve of the benzoate-induced <b>proteins</b> were <b>induced</b> at pH 8. 0 as well, and nine of these matched <b>proteins</b> <b>induced</b> by the uncoupler dinitrophenol. Eighteen <b>proteins</b> were <b>induced</b> by benzoate only at pH 6. 5, not at pH 8. 0, and were not induced by dinitrophenol. One may be the iron and pH regulator Fur, which regulates acid tolerance in Salmonella spp. The other 13 proteins had not been identified previously.

50|$|TIRC7 is a {{membrane}} <b>protein</b> <b>induced</b> after immune activation on {{the cell}} surface of certain peripheral human T and B cells as well as monocytes and IL-10 expressing regulatory T cells. During immune activation, TIRC7 is co-localized with the T cell receptor and CTLA4 within the immune synapse of human T cells At the protein and mRNA level, its expression is induced in lymphocytes in synovial tissues obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis or during rejection of solid organ transplants and bone marrow transplantation {{as well as in}} brain tissues obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis.|$|E
50|$|This {{follows a}} pattern similar to western Europe or gradual onset of Neolithic, such {{as seen in}} La Hoguette Culture of France and Iberia's Impressed Cardial Ware Culture. Cereal culture advance {{markedly}} slows north of France; certain cereal strains such as wheat were difficult to grow in cold climates—however, barley and German rye were suitable replacements. It can be speculated that the DQ2.5 aspect of the AH8.1 haplotype {{may have been involved}} in the slowing of cereal culture into Ireland, Scotland and Scandinavia since this haplotype confers susceptibility to a Triticeae <b>protein</b> <b>induced</b> disease as well as Type I diabetes and other autoimmune diseases that may have arisen as an indirect result of Neolithisation.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} by Modhiran et al. attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the TLR signaling pathway. TLRs are known to recognize extra and intra cellular viral particles {{and to be a}} major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and Type 1 IFN production was reduced when the ADE-DENV complexe bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of TLR production and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown <b>protein</b> <b>induced</b> by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the TLRs transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKKα, TAB1, TAB2, NF-κB complex) involved in the TLR signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.|$|E

5000|$|The tubers {{are highly}} {{palatable}} with culinary {{characteristics of a}} potato, although the flavor can be somewhat nuttier than a potato and the texture can be finer. Studies in rats suggest that raw tubers should not be consumed because they contain harmful protease inhibitors that are denatured by cooking. Tubers contain roughly three times the protein content of a potato (16.5% by dry weight), and the amino acid balance is good {{with the exception of}} cysteine and methionine. Apios americana tubers were found to have a protein concentration of 15-30 mg/g. This was similar to that of other species in the Apios genus, Apios carnea and Apios fortunei. However, A. americana had larger levels of genistein than the other two species. The fatty acid content of tubers is approximately 4.2% to 4.6% with linoleic fatty acids predominating. Thirty-six percent of the fresh weight of a tuber is carbohydrate (primarily starch). The tubers are also an excellent source of calcium and iron. Calcium content is 10-fold greater than a potato and iron is 2-fold greater than a potato, although vitamin C was considerably less than a potato. The tuber and the flower are also full of mono and oligosaccharide. The tuber has more monosaccharides and oligosaccharides than the soybean, potato, and sweet potato. In addition, the tubers appear to have numerous health promoting factors. Hypertensive rats that were fed powdered tubers as 5% of their total diet experienced a 10% decrease in blood pressure and also a reduction in cholesterol and triglycerides. It has been shown that the tubers contain genistein and other isoflavones that have various health benefits, including an anticarcinogenic function against colon, prostate, and breast cancer. [...] Genistein-7-O-gentiobioside is a novel isoflavone that is found in the American groundnut. Extract from the American groundnut was shown to not have anti-oxidative activity itself, but to drive the anti-oxidative pathway in cells. Human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were pretreated with the extract of A. americana for 24 hours. Subsequent analysis showed an increase in expression of heme oxygenase-1, a <b>protein</b> <b>induced</b> during oxidative stress. The American groundnut, like soybean, is a great source of isoflavone. [...] Furthermore, a study on A. americana and its flower shows that the flower of the particular plant is not toxic to mice. In fact, the flower was shown to lower plasma glucose levels in diabetic mice. The flower was shown to have an inhibitory activity on maltose and an anti-hyperglycemic effect in mice suggesting that not only is it a viable and novel food source for the general population, but also in the prevention of diabetes.|$|E

Antibodies to two of the major chicken heat shock proteins, chsp 89 and chsp 70, cross-reacted with proteins of similar molecular weights in normal embryonic and adult chicken tissues and in extracts from widely different organisms.

40|$|Because of {{the highly}} conserved pattern of {{expression}} of the eucaryotic heat shock genes hsp 70 and hsp 84 or their cognates during sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and development in higher organisms, {{the role of the}} Escherichia coli homologs dnaK and htpG was examined during the response to starvation. The htpG deletion mutant was found to be similar to its wild-type parent in its ability to survive starvation for essential nutrients and to <b>induce</b> <b>proteins</b> specific to starvation conditions. The dnaK 103 mutant, however, was highly susceptible to killing by starvation for carbon and, to a lesser extent, for nitrogen and phosphate. Analysis of <b>proteins</b> <b>induced</b> under starvation conditions on two-dimensional gels showed that the dnaK 103 mutant was defective for the synthesis of some <b>proteins</b> <b>induced</b> in wild-type cells by carbon starvation and of some <b>proteins</b> <b>induced</b> under all starvation conditions, including the stationary phase in wild-type cells. In addition, unique proteins were synthesized in the dnaK 103 mutant in response to starvation. Although the synthesis of some proteins under glucose starvation control was drastically affected by the dnaK 103 mutation, the synthesis of <b>proteins</b> specifically <b>induced</b> by nitrogen starvation was essentially unaffected. Similarly, the dnaK 103 mutant was able to grow, utilizing glutamine or arginine as a source of nitrogen, at a rate approximate to that of the wild-type parent, but it inefficiently utilized glycerol or maltose as carbon sources. Several differences between the protein synthetic pattern of the dnaK 103 mutant and the wild type were observed after phosphate starvation, but these did not result in a decreased ability to survive phosphate starvation, compared with nitrogen starvation...|$|R

40|$|During cold acclimation, {{winter rye}} (Secale cereale L.) plants secrete {{antifreeze}} proteins {{that are similar}} to pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. In this experiment, the secretion of PR <b>proteins</b> was <b>induced</b> at warm temperatures by infection with pink snow mold (Microdochium nivale), a pathogen of overwintering cereals. A comparison of cold-induced and pathogen-induced proteins showed that PR proteins accumulated in the leaf apoplast to a greater level in response to cold. The PR <b>proteins</b> <b>induced</b> by cold and by snow mold were similar when separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and examined by immunoblotting. Both groups of PR proteins contained glucanase-like, chitinase-like, and thaumatin-like proteins, and both groups exhibited similar levels of glucanase and chitinase activities. However, only the PR <b>proteins</b> <b>induced</b> by cold exhibited antifreeze activity. Our findings suggest that the cold-induced PR proteins may be isoforms that function as antifreeze proteins to modify the growth of ice during freezing while also providing resistance to the growth of low-temperature pathogens in advance of infection.
