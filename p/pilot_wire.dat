50|$|P1901 {{communication}} {{is compatible with}} other 802.x standards via the IEEE 1905 standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located. P1905 includes wireless communications. In at least one implementation, communication between the off-board DC EVSE and PEV occurs on the <b>pilot</b> <b>wire</b> of the SAE J1772 connector via HomePlug Green PHY power line communication (PLC).|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} processes {{involved in}} ignition and flame spread have been extensively studied, they are generally studied separately without combining ignition and flame spread through the transition process. Moreover, {{the majority of the}} flame spread studies assume steady state flame spread. To study the transient aspects of ignition and the transition to flame spread, a time-dependent numerical model has been developed in which a thin strip is ignited along its width with either a <b>pilot</b> <b>wire,</b> radiative source, or both. For this configuration, the model is two-dimensional. Ignition is initiated away from either end of the sample, and two different flame fronts spread in opposite directions; one flows with and the other against a prescribed external flow. Usually, the flame spread is initiated by ignition {{at one end of the}} sample with or against a slow external flow, yielding one flame front. The present configuration is more realistic than the one flame front case because there is interaction between the two flames during the ignition and transition stages...|$|E
40|$|Differential {{protection}} {{scheme is}} based on comparison of measured variables such as current and voltage at the two ends of a line via a communication channel such as <b>pilot</b> <b>wire.</b> This scheme is preferred and extensively used in distribution feeder protection system in Malaysia due to its fast operation. However pilot-wire differential scheme has its own drawbacks especially on {{the maintenance of the}} pilot-wire. Once the plot-wire is out of service, the feeder protection is jeopardised. One of the options to overcome such maintenance issue is to adopt directional relay as I he feeder protection. This paper investigates a suitable relay connection and the maximum torque angle for the directional relay for 33 kV underground network. In this study, a section of 33 kV underground network in Kuala Lumpur (KL) city has been analysed. All faults types have been simulated at all possible location in the network. The obtained voltage and current were then used to determine the operation of directional overcurrent and earth-fault relay. The simulation results indicate that 30 degrees relay connection with 0 degrees maximum torque angle (30 degrees/ 0 degrees) is the most suitable setting to be applied for 33 kV underground network in KL, as against the best general and most versatile setting, 45 degrees/ 90 degrees...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} briefly compare the {{protection}} of buried three phase high voltage cable with Solkordifferential protection relay using metallic <b>pilot</b> <b>wires</b> orfibre optic <b>pilot</b> <b>wires.</b> Dielectric property of the fiber optic provides complete electrical isolation as well as interference free signaling. This provides total immunity from GPR (ground potential rise), longitudinal induction, and differential mode noise coupling andhigh-voltage hazards to personnel safety. So Fibre optic provides great advantage for Solkor differential protection relaying...|$|R

50|$|The {{airport was}} also {{previously}} a local favorite for its diverse mix of aircraft and openness. However, as of March 2012, citing safety concerns from <b>pilots,</b> barbed <b>wire</b> fencing went {{up around the}} airport, sealing off the previously popular observation areas and leaving only the inside of Aviator's Grill as the sole observation area for the public.|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{qualitative}} proposal of a new FACTS device, which aims to repower the "Smart Grids", to a higher level. The existing FACTS that are covering the role of power flow control have the disadvantages {{of the use of}} electronic devices, and generate excessive heat and harmonics injected into the network. These devices are expensive and their regulation is binary: zero flow or total flow. This proposal offers a more versatile power flow control from zero to one hundred percent of its nominal capacity. Smart grids will no longer need to have a Relay Counseling Center, and the communication by <b>pilot</b> <b>wire</b> or other means available will be enough to control and protect the network. Therefore, due to fewer crossed and analyzed data, the laborious task of considering whether an event is really a failure, will be less complicated and will be carried out more quickly. In combination with phase measurement units (PMUs) for each MAG, approximation techniques will not be necessary to estimate the variations caused by the dynamics of the demand, because the MAG is operating in "floating mode" as discussed further below. The network automatically and gradually rearranges these variations. Incomplete observation could be used for measuring voltage and current signals of the network in some specific points in the network...|$|E
50|$|The DASH GEN III is {{a wholly}} {{embedded}} design, where the complete optical and position sensing coil package is built within the helmet (either USAF standard HGU-55/P or the Israeli standard HGU-22/P) using a spherical visor {{to provide a}} collimated image to the <b>pilot.</b> A quick-disconnect <b>wire</b> powers the display and carries video drive signals to the helmet's Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). DASH is closely integrated with the aircraft's weapon system, via a MIL-STD-1553B bus.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a control}} system that uses a single solid <b>wire.</b> When the <b>pilot</b> twists the <b>wire</b> around its axis, a spiral inside the {{airplane}} spins to move the elevator. While {{it can be used}} with some success on any type of model, it is best for speed models where the reduced aerodynamic drag of the single line is a significant advantage. The control provided is not as precise as the two-line control system.|$|R

40|$|The current {{development}} effort is a Phase 3 research study entitled "A Production Ready Automated Wire Delivery System", contract number NAS 8 - 39933, awarded to Nichols Research Corporation (NRC). The goals {{of this research}} study were to production harden the existing Automated Wire Delivery (AWDS) motion and sensor hardware and test the modified AWDS {{in a range of}} welding applications. In addition, the prototype AWDS controller would be moved to the VME bus platform by designing, fabricating and testing a single board VME bus AWDS controller. This effort was to provide an AWDS that could transition from the laboratory environment to production operations. The project was performed in two development steps. Step 1 modified and tested an improved MWG. Step 2 developed and tested the AWDS single board VME bus controller. Step 3 installed the <b>Wire</b> <b>Pilot</b> in a Weld Controller with the imbedded VME bus controller...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Micro {{holes are}} useful in {{reducing}} the size of <b>pilot</b> hole in <b>wire</b> cut EDM. Micro EDM is useful in creating MEMS components, for producing micro holes, machining very hard materials, and in many other applications. Since the features to be machined are small and require high accuracy, the current level is low and must be precisely controlled. In conventional EDM, the current levels are high {{as well as the}} voltage required. Mainstream EDMs use voltage levels of about 150 V and currents of up to 50 A. As a result of higher currents, the electrode gets locally melted and there is welding of the workpiece and electrode. There are also the problems of stray arcing. Moreover, uncontrolled discharge cannot be allowed in micro machining. Thus, a different power supply is required for micro EDM. This paper discusses the step-by-step deSvelopment of a suitable power supply to fulfill these requirements. Pulsed DC power supply is a critical component for achieving the required parameters of accuracy, finish and size of micro holes via EDM process...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sonobuoy}} {{recording of}} the last few moments of I-52's sound still survives in the US National Archives in Washington D.C. in the form of two thin film canisters marked [...] "Gordon wire No. 1" [...] and [...] "Gordon wire No. 2" [...] dated 24 June 1944. The wire from Taylor's attack has not been found; however, a set of 78 rpm vinyl recordings that include segments of Taylor's wire recordings has been located. These records were produced during the war for training <b>pilots.</b> On the <b>wire</b> and vinyl recordings Lieutenant Gordon can be heard talking to his crew, along with the sound of a torpedo exploding, and metal twisting. Subsequent to the discovery of the wreck (see below), analysts at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, experts in analyzing modern submarine sounds, studied these recordings and concluded that the I-52 was sunk by Taylor. The propeller sounds heard by Gordon were actually from the U-Boat, nearly 20 mi away, reaching Gordon's sonobuoys through a [...] "surface duct". This quirk of underwater sound propagation traps sounds in a channel near the surface and can transmit them for many miles. At the time, the Navy credited the sinking of the I-52 to both Gordon and Taylor, as it was uncertain whether the ship was sunk on the first attack.|$|R
