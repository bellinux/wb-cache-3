A completely randomized design with three treatments and variable number of repetitions. The roughage:concentrate ratio from feedlot was 60 : 40. The lipid content of Longissimus dorsi muscle was influenced by the feeding system, the winter <b>pasture</b> showed higher lipid content in comparison to tropical <b>pasture,</b> while the lipid content of feedlot was intermediary. The tropical <b>pasture</b> showed intramuscular fat more saturated in relation to winter <b>pasture,</b> mainly due to the higher participation of C 15 : 0, C 17 : 0 and C 20 : 0 acids. The feedlot and winter <b>pasture</b> animals showed meat with higher content of monounsaturated fatty acids in relation to tropical <b>pasture,</b> but there was no effect of the diet on the total polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Information on the soil seed banks and the remaining vegetation in these ecosystems is crucial for guiding the restoration efforts. This study examines the size, species richness, diversity, uniformity, and similarity of soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation in 6 different grazing lands including coastal <b>pasture,</b> reseeded <b>pasture,</b> artificial <b>pasture,</b> lowland shrubland, ungrazed <b>pasture,</b> and hillside shrubland. Forty-eight soil samples were taken by cores with a diameter and depth of 10 cm from each of grazing lands in August of 2007. A vegetation survey was conducted using a 0. 5 x 0. 5 -m quadrant in both the spring and fall. Eighty species were observed in soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation. The largest seed bank was observed in reseeded <b>pasture</b> (7, 715 seed/m 2), while the smallest seed bank was found in coastal <b>pasture</b> (2, 755 seed/m 2). Coastal <b>pasture</b> also possessed {{the least amount of}} aboveground vegetation (131 plants/m 2). The most aboveground vegetation was found in ungrazed <b>pasture</b> (155 plants/m 2).

40|$|Abstract. Dairy cows fed on perennial-ryegrass <b>pasture</b> produce higher-quality milk {{in terms}} of fatty-acid composition; however, they produce much less milk {{compared}} to dairy cows under other systems. The low dry-matter intake (DMI) {{has been identified as}} the main factor responsible for the lower milk production in pasture-based systems. To maximize milk production from those systems it is important to maximize DMI from <b>pasture.</b> Many interventions have been studied, such as: manipulating herbage allowance, feeding frequency, time of allocating the new <b>pasture,</b> <b>pasture</b> maturity, fertilization rate and the choice of perennial-ryegrass variety. The results have shown that <b>pasture</b> DMI increases in a curvilinear asymptotic manner as herbage allowance increases. However, increasing herbage allowance decreases milk production per hectare and increases production cost due to the increased need for <b>pasture</b> and land. More frequent allocation of <b>pasture</b> has shown no effect on <b>pasture</b> DMI. Allocating the new <b>pasture</b> after the evening milking has sometimes shown to increase <b>pasture</b> DMI without any negative effect {{in terms of}} productivity per hectare. Allocating a young and leafy grass has shown to increase DMI, {{but at the same time}} <b>pasture</b> holding capacity was reduced and milk production per hectare decreased. Using high-sugar grass was advocated as a way to improve DMI of dairy cows on <b>pasture.</b> Research findings with regard to the effect of high-sugar grass on DMI are very inconsistent. Som...|$|R
40|$|A {{system of}} <b>pasture</b> yield {{measurement}} {{was developed for}} New Zealand’s <b>pasture</b> based, rotationally grazed farming systems. <b>Pasture</b> yield measurement is complex because the <b>pasture</b> biomass has to be measured in-situ, pre and post grazing so that <b>pasture</b> consumption and utilisation can be calculated. The “C-Dax <b>Pasture</b> Meter ” was initially developed by Massey University and subsequently commercialised by C-Dax Ltd of New Zealand. The <b>pasture</b> management solution has gained traction in the market-place and is considered a valuable management tool for dairy farmers in New Zealand and Australia. The method of measurement is simple but highly effective and provides reliable measurement of <b>pasture</b> cover {{in a range of}} <b>pasture</b> types regardless of weather and light conditions. The measurement unit is pulled behind an ATV and can be used at speeds of up to 20 kmh- 1. Two technology levels are available, either as a basic system deriving average cover for individual paddocks, or with the incorporation of a GPS to allow <b>pasture</b> production to be mapped. Recent independent calibration results from New Zealand based research organisations have shown the C-Dax <b>Pasture</b> Meter to have a higher level of accuracy than traditionally used methods as well as increased utility. The system has also proved to be reliable in measuring post grazing residual levels which are known as Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) to achieving good <b>pasture</b> management and maintaining <b>pasture</b> quality. Measuring <b>pasture</b> covers allows farmers to make timely decisions regarding feed conservation, fertiliser use and stocking policies as well as giving farmers greater certainty in budgeting feed resources. The paper examines the KPI’s that farmers use to benchmark the success of their grazing management. Acase study is presented to illustrate how the C-Dax <b>Pasture</b> Meter is benefiting dairy farmers in New Zealand and Australia...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of Australian paddocks are heterogeneous (non-uniform) and hence vary in <b>pasture</b> biomass and quality widely {{at a variety}} of scales. Cattle are selective graziers, spending time in some areas whilst avoiding others. However, despite this, many grazing studies fail to examine the underlying <b>pasture</b> quality and potential influence these <b>pasture</b> variables have on livestock selection. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate beef cattle selectivity (time spent at a site) due to the underlying quality of <b>pasture</b> that had recently been sown, and non-sown <b>pasture</b> species along with a number of weeds. Prior to cattle grazing, a range of <b>pasture</b> attributes were measured including <b>pasture</b> biomass and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) along with individual plant species to determine forage quality. These were later analysed for protein, minerals, organic acids, alcohols, fibre and non-fibre carbohydrates. Paddock variables (elevation and distance to shelter, boundary fence and water) were also determined. Eleven Angus heifers were fitted with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) collar and tracked for 58 days. Statistical analysis included <b>pasture</b> quality differences between species and random forest modelling to determine the main variables driving where livestock spend time. There were significant differences across species for all <b>pasture</b> biomass and quality variables, except for Cu, Se and Starch. Preliminary results suggest that <b>pasture</b> quality variables are the major drivers of livestock selection emphasising the importance of the underlying role that <b>pasture</b> quality has on livestock behaviour. A repository of data for a range of <b>pasture</b> species including non-sown and weed species which are rarely sampled, for numerous <b>pasture</b> quality variables (protein, non-fibre carbohydrates, minerals etc.) is needed for improvements to be made for livestock production.
