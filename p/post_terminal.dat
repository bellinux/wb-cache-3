Adipocyte isolation from human tissue samples was undertaken for these investigative studies, and the methodology was optimised. The resulting isolates of pre-adipocytes and mature adipocytes were characterised and evaluated. Major findings from these studies indicate that mature adipocytes undergo cell division <b>post</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation. Gene studies indicated that subcutaneous adipose tissue exuded greater concentrations and fluctuations of adipokine levels than visceral adipose tissue, indicating an important adiposensing role of subcutaneous adipose tissue. It was subsequently postulated that the subcutaneous depot may provide the major focus for control of overall energy balance and by extension weight control. One potential therapeutic target, 11 β-hydrosteroid dehydrogenase (11 β-HSD 1) was investigated, and prospective inhibitors of its action were considered (BVT 1, BVT 2 and AZ 121). Selective reduction of adiposity of the visceral depot was desired due to its correlation with the detrimental effects of obesity. However, studies indicated that although the visceral depot tissue was not unaffected, the subcutaneous depot was more susceptible to therapeutic inhibition by these compounds. This was determined to be a potentially valuable therapeutic intervention in light of previous postulations regarding long-term energy control via the subcutaneous tissue depot.

40|$|Obesity {{has become}} a global epidemic. Approximately 15 % of the world {{population}} is either overweight or obese. This figure rises to 75 % in many westernised countries including the United Kingdom. Health costs in the UK to treat obesity and associated disease are conservatively estimated at 6 % of the National Health Service (NHS) budget equating to 3. 33 billion Euros. Excess adiposity, especially in visceral depots, {{increases the risk of}} type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, gall stones, hypertension and cancer. Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounts for > 90 % of all cases of diabetes of which the majority can be attributed to increased adiposity, and approximately 70 % of cardiovascular disease has been attributed to obesity in the US. Weight loss reduces risk of these complications and in some cases can eliminate the condition. However, weight loss by conventional non-medicated methods is often unsuccessful or promptly followed by weight regain. This thesis has investigated adipocytes development and adipokine signalling with a view to enhance the understanding of tissue functionality and to identify possible targets or pathways for therapeutic intervention. Adipocyte isolation from human tissue samples was undertaken for these investigative studies, and the methodology was optimised. The resulting isolates of pre-adipocytes and mature adipocytes were characterised and evaluated.

30|$|Although HU has {{demonstrated}} significant clinical improvements in SCD patients, a {{complete understanding of}} the myriad of molecular mechanisms by which HU induces the disease-ameliorating HbF remain elusive [60]. This paper demonstrates the post-transcriptional effect of HU on critical regulators of γ-globin expression and associated miRNAs using two models; erythroid cells derived from umbilical cord blood CD 34 + HSCs and K 562 cells. Cord blood-derived CD 34 + cells are an abundant, non-invasive and largely unutilised source of HSCs and a good model to investigate erythropoiesis [61, 62] and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HbF production in response to therapeutic agents [63]. The volume of cord blood collected {{in this study was}} consistent with expected norms [64] although the average CD 34 + cell yield was slightly lower, possibly due to our stringent cell separation method. Erythroid cells were successfully differentiated using an ex vivo single-phase expansion and differentiation protocol [65] with minor alterations to achieve optimal ex vivo expansion [66]. Given that HU is thought to induce γ-globin via perturbation of erythroid cell maturation [36, 67], in this study HSCs were differentiated to orthochromatophilic erythroblasts for 15  days. It has been previously demonstrated that cells treated with HU around day 6 and harvested at day 10 of differentiation consist mostly of basophilic and polychromatophilic normoblasts, comparable to untreated cultures at a similar stage [68]. In another study, investigating the effect of HU on BCL 11 A, KLF- 1 and TAL- 1 in bone marrow-derived basophilic erythroblasts, <b>post</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation, {{there was no significant difference}} in the expression of the markers of late erythroid differentiation, CD 235 a and CD 71, between HU treated and untreated cells [54]. Likewise in this study, the comparable levels of CD 235 a and CD 71 between pairwise samples (HU+ and HU−) confirms that at the point of expression analyses, the paired samples were at a similar maturation stage (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1), and thus the erythroid cell maturation cannot account for the observed changes in expression. It is thus more likely that the observed induction of γ-globin is a result of the repression of BCL 11 A, KLF- 1 and MYB. Therefore, with further development of expansion and differentiation protocols, the use of cord blood stem cells can be extended to routine laboratory disease modelling and testing of therapeutic agents above and beyond the curative transplantation value of this biological material.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} neurotransmitters that is {{regulated}} by the putamen is dopamine. When a cell body of a neuron (in the putamen or caudate nuclei) fires an action potential, dopamine is released from the presynaptic terminal. Since projections from the putamen and caudate nuclei modulate the dendrites of the substantia nigra, the dopamine influences the substantia nigra, which affects motor planning. This same mechanism is involved in drug addiction. In order to control the amount of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, {{and the amount of}} dopamine binding to <b>post</b> synaptic <b>terminals,</b> presynaptic dopaminergic neurons function to reuptake the excess dopamine.|$|R

50|$|Maintaining {{a balance}} between the {{intracellular}} and extracellular ionic concentrations at the postsynaptic terminal is critical to normal neuronal function. During oxygen depletion to the brain, two events that initiate, as well as propagate, anoxic depolarization involve excessive cationic influxes, as well as the outflow of ATP, at the postsynaptic terminal. The receptors that allow this influx and outflow are the ionotropic receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels that bind specific neurotransmitters, released from the synaptic vesicles of the presynaptic terminal, to trigger the opening of the channels, which serve as conduits for cations that, in turn, initiate action potential across the <b>post</b> synaptic <b>terminals</b> of normally functioning neurons.|$|R

5000|$|The {{installation}} of chain-link fence involves setting posts {{into the ground}} and attaching the fence to them. The posts may be steel tubing, timber or concrete and may be driven into the ground or set in concrete. End, corner or gate posts, commonly referred to as [...] "terminal posts", must be set in concrete footing or otherwise anchored to prevent leaning under the tension of a stretched fence. Posts set between the <b>terminal</b> <b>posts</b> are called [...] "line posts" [...] and are set at intervals not to exceed 10 feet. The installer attaches the fence at one end, stretches it, and attaches at the other, easily removing the excess by [...] "unscrewing" [...] a wire. Finally, the installer ties the fence to the line posts with aluminum wire. In many cases, the installer stretches a bottom tension wire, sometimes referred to as [...] "coil wire", between <b>terminal</b> <b>posts</b> to help minimize the in and out movement that occurs {{at the bottom of the}} chain-link mesh between posts. Top horizontal rails are used on most chain-link fences, although not necessary.
