30|$|Although many novel {{algorithms}} {{are proposed}} {{with the advancement}} of tracking algorithms, {{most of them are}} similar in terms of <b>part</b> <b>sampling</b> strategy and base tracker. Firstly, the most popular <b>part</b> <b>sampling</b> strategies are fixed sampling strategies [15] and Gaussian distribution [12, 18] strategies. The former <b>sample</b> the <b>parts</b> by recurrently dividing the target into several fixed-size parts, while the latter is similar to particles that <b>sample</b> <b>parts</b> based on Gaussian distribution. For the base tracker, most part-based tracking algorithms choose the KCF filter [11, 14, 18, 19] because of its high speed. However, the KCF filter cannot adjust the scale variation of the parts, and its features extraction capability is limited.|$|R

As a pre-processing operation before <b>part</b> <b>sampling,</b> the saliency detection should meet requirements of efficient computation. We employ a cluster-based saliency detection method [21], which uses the contrast and spatial cues of a single image to construct a saliency map of the target area of each frame, and we then <b>sample</b> the <b>part</b> based on the saliency map.|$|R

Electronic structure of the nanotube is taken into account within the tight-binding model.

30|$|Specimens were {{examined}} in Leiden, The Netherlands, from herbarium material sent from the Sabah Parks Herbarium (SNP) in Malaysia. The first author undertook fieldwork in Malaysia during 2011 – 2013. Soil samples (n =  3) were collected near {{the roots of the}} new Actephila species and air-dried at room temperature for 3  weeks before laboratory analyses. The soil pH was measured in a 1 : 2.5 soil:water mix. Soil sub-samples were extracted with DTPA (for phytoavailable trace elements, such as Ni) and with silverthiorea (for exchangeable cations, including calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium) solutions (Becquer et al. 1995; Dohrmann 2006). Soil sub-samples were also digested with concentrated nitric (70  %) and hydrochloric (37  %) acid in a specialised microwave. Plant part samples (roots, twigs, bark, phloem, wood, leaves) collected from mature plants of the new Actephila were immediately washed with demineralised water, oven-dried at 70  °C and then digested with concentrated nitric acid (70  %) and hydrogen peroxide (30  %) in a specialised microwave. The soil and plant <b>part</b> <b>sample</b> extracts were finally measured with ICP-AES (Varian Vista Pro II) for Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, K and P. The ICP-AES instrument was calibrated using a 6 -point multi-element standard (Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, K, P) prepared in each extraction solution. The laboratory work was undertaken at The University of Queensland, Australia.|$|E

It was observed that the inner part of this eucrite (ALH- 78132, 78) showed a negative Ce anomaly, while all of the outer part specimens (ALH- 78132, 71 a, b, c and 79) displayed positive Ce anomalies. On the other hand, contents of MgO, FeO and CaO for the outer part of the eucrite {{were similar to those}} for the inner part of the eucrite. Ce and Nd isotopic ratios were also determined for ALH- 78132, 71 c, 79 and 78. In the ^ (Nd) /^ (Nd) vs. ^ (Sm) /^ (Nd) diagram, all points of ALH- 78132, 71 c, 79 and 78 appeared to fall in the chondritic evolution field within the experimental errors.

40|$|The CLAISSE-CALCULATOR is a {{new tool}} for XRF analysts who make fusion beads. It calculates the acidity of a sample and {{suggests}} the better Lithium borate flux composition for it. Its operation is briefly described. In addition, the Calculator {{has been used by}} the author to explain a) what causes the sample to have a preference for a given flux composition, and b) what causes molten glass sticking to crucibles and moulds. HISTORICAL In lithium borate fusion, acidity is the main factor that determines whether or not a fusion bead will be successfully done. In the old days of fire analysis of ores and rocks for the extraction of precious metals, the rule was: “Basic samples need acidic flux, acidic samples need basic flux”. No rule was used {{in the early days of}} fusion for XRF analysis [1] because only one flux composition was used, Sodium Tetraborate. On account of the very high dilution then used, one <b>part</b> <b>sample</b> in 100 parts flux, acidity was ignored. Later, when sodium became detectable by X-rays, Sodium Tetraborate was replaced by Lithium Tetraborate, and trouble began to appear. Various mixtures of chemicals started being tried. Only ten years ago, selection rules were proposed [2] for the determination of optimal flux composition, based on measured solubility of a number of oxides as a function of flux composition (Fig. 1).

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel part-based tracker named REC for robust visual tracking. The {{proposed}} tracker recurrently exploits the co-saliency {{distribution of the}} target area to guide <b>part</b> <b>sampling</b> and employs efficient correlation filter called ECOhc to track those <b>parts.</b> During the <b>sampling,</b> we also consider the overlaps between the parts and suppress the inference to avoid the drift of prediction. To guarantee the part reliability, we propose an appropriate updating strategy. Additionally, we also combine the idea of scale variation of particle filter and correlation filter and propose a new scale estimation method. The REC tracker outperforms most of the state-of-the-art part-based trackers as well as state-of-the-art trackers based on global information of target. The REC tracker is evaluated on highly challenging benchmarks by comparing with 19 trackers on VOT 2017 benchmark, 29 trackers on OTB- 50 benchmark, and 2 representative trackers on the subset of occlusion sequences. As a result, the experimental results on the public datasets show that the proposed tracker not only reaches the state-of-the-art level in the overall performance, but also outperforms all competitors under occlusion situation. We also investigate factors related {{to the performance of}} part-based tracker such as size of <b>part,</b> <b>part</b> <b>sampling</b> strategy, and scale estimation, which could be useful in optimizing hyper-parameters of part-based tracking algorithms. In the future, we will improve the tracker by taking the advantage of deep features and advanced attention mechanism.|$|R
