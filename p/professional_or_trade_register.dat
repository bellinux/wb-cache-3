50|$|The {{conference was}} started in 1980 by Charleston {{librarian}} Katina Stauch. Stauch started the event after being unable to afford to attend the American Library Association's Annual conference. The first event was attended by two dozen librarians, and grew to 1600 attendees in 2012. Its focus is on acquisition for research and academic libraries, particularly on serials and academic books. It also covers library infrastructure topics, such as vendor systems and library technology. It is held in three historic hotels {{in the downtown area}} of Charleston.

50|$|By definition, a {{magazine}} paginates with each issue starting at page three, {{with the standard}} sizing being 8 3/8 × 10 7/8 inches. However, in the technical sense a journal has continuous pagination throughout a volume. Thus Business Week, which starts each issue anew with page one, is {{a magazine}}, but the Journal of Business Communication, which starts each volume with the winter issue and continues the same sequence of pagination throughout the coterminous year, is a journal. Some <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>trade</b> publications are also peer-reviewed, an example being the Journal of Accountancy. Academic <b>or</b> <b>professional</b> publications that are not peer-reviewed are generally professional magazines. That a publication calls itself a journal {{does not make it}} a journal in the technical sense; The Wall Street Journal is actually a newspaper.|$|R
40|$|Immigration {{should be}} viewed as an {{opportunity}} to be embraced rather than a cost to be minimised, according to this report from economist Jim Power and the Integration Centre, an Atlantic grantee. The non-Irish population in Ireland is highly skilled with qualification levels exceeding that of the foreign population in other EU countries. The overall majority have a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>trade</b> qualification and the variety of language skills they hold is invaluable. In short, the immigrant population has been and remains a key asset to the Irish economy.

50|$|Knowledge brokers or {{intermediaries}} act as bridges {{between the}} users and {{producers of the}} knowledge. Such brokering is essential {{to ensure that the}} right information is available to the right people, at the right time and in the right format. These ideas of quality research informed by the needs of research users, accurate interpretation, open access and just-in-time service are the bases for good researcher-user interface, often provided by knowledge brokers who can synthesize a large body of research and look for policy and practice implications that facilitate use of research results. Many different individuals and organizations play a brokering or intermediary role, from think tanks to lobby groups to political parties to <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>trade</b> associations, to promoters of particular products or strategies. These various bodies may have very different motivations and degrees of objectivity in their approach. Much brokering occurs as part of political debate, in which the contention among ideas is part of broader political processes.|$|R

40|$|Technische Informationsbibliothek Hannover (TIB) {{is one of}} {{the four}} central subject {{libraries}} in the Federal Republic of Germany. TIB was founded in 1959 and established in Hannover because here a fairly large and comprehensive technical library existed, the present University Library Hannover (UB Hannover).

40|$|First release 2006 {{census data}} allow an {{examination}} of the income levels of recently arrived migrants. Their numbers jumped in the 2001 to 2006 period. This article focuses on men aged 25 to 45 as these provide the best approximate principal applicants visaed under the skilled migration program. Men in this age group who came from main-English-speaking countries (MESC) reported incomes consistent with employment in professional, managerial and trade positions. However, the majority of skilled migrants were drawn from non-English-speaking countries (NESC). Their reported incomes were well below those of their MESC counterparts. It appears that only a minority were able to find employment at the <b>professional,</b> managerial <b>or</b> <b>trade</b> level by the August 2006 Census date.

40|$|Chapter Two {{discussed}} the basic nature of periodical literature as an information source. It also explained {{the types of}} periodicals (i. e., scholarly <b>or</b> peer-reviewed journals, <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>trade</b> journals, popular <b>or</b> general-interest magazines, and newspapers), and their suitability for different kinds of research. This chapter will focus on learning to search effectively for scholarly or peerreviewed journals, and {{understanding the importance of}} their use in well-grounded research. While scholarly books always {{play an important role in}} research, the nature of periodicals makes the information published in journal articles more widely accessible and on a more current basis. Specific findings of research done on the nutritional effects of red wine would be available much quicker to interested scholars, physicians, or even the general public through publication in an issue of The Journal of the Medical Association, the Journal of Nutrition, or Science News, than it would through the book publishing process. The nature of peer-reviewed journals means that the information you use is authoritative and has made a significant contribution to advancing knowledge in that subject area. Searching Periodical Databases If you were looking for a number of different articles on the health benefits of red wine, you would be daunted by the prospect of manually looking through the table of contents of dozens of issues of hundreds of science, medical, or health journals. Besides, the library may not own all the journals you would want to look through. A periodical database is a research tool specifically designed to search the contents of thousands of periodicals, journals, magazines, and/or newspapers, and to identify individual articles that contain the subject terms or key words you specify...|$|R

50|$|About 82 {{percent of}} women lived in rural areas in the late 1980s.
