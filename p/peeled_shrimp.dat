Toppings change with the seasons and some are mostly associated with Easter or Christmas lunches, like sylte (head cheese) and æbleflæsk (roast pork or bacon in apple sauce).

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{an energy}} audit {{of a food}} industry. The company's business consists of boiling and <b>peeling</b> <b>shrimps,</b> and producing mayonnaise-based salads. This type of work involves energy-intensive processes, such as steam generation, compression of air and refrigeration of large spaces. These needs are supplied with electricity. Furthermore, the industry is a major consumer of district heating, particularly for heating the supply air in the ventilation system. The energy-related processes in the operations consume about 2, 300 MWh of electricity and 660 MWh of district heating. There are opportunities to improve the efficiency by controlling the processes, merging {{different parts of the}} systems, implementing equipment for energy recovery, and installing more energy-efficient equipment. The primary aim of the food industry is to produce high quality food. In this context {{it is no wonder that}} matters that do not affect the primary tasks receive a lower priority. There may, however, be good reason to place these energy-related issues higher on the agenda. ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments in {{freezing}} of cooked, <b>peeled</b> and unpeeled <b>shrimps</b> {{have been}} carried out in order to find out the effect of vacuum-packing and use of carbon dioxide gas in packing of the shrimps during storing at temperatures of - 25 ° and - 16 °C. Shrimps stored both in vacuum and in carbon dioxide gas maintained quality better than similar samples stored in air at the same temperature. Especially the vacuum-packed samples were definitely better than the others both in colour, taste and texture. The samples stored in carbon dioxide did not keep quite so well, and the samples of shrimps stored in air at the same temperature and in similar packing material were pronounced inferior to the others. Vacuum-packing is therefore considered to be preferable in freezing and storing of shrimps. With a satisfactory vacuum-tight packing it is found possible to store frozen shrimps longer and obtain a higher quality than now is common in commercial freezing of shrimps. The plastic bags used in the experiments were vacuum-tight and strong enough for the packing of <b>peeled</b> <b>shrimps,</b> but the bags were easily penetrated during the packing of unpeeled shrimps. A better method would probably be to freeze unpeeled shrimps in alginate. The experiments also confirmed that the storage temperature is very important in storing of shrimps, and in storing at a temperature of - 25 °C the quality was much better than at a temperature of - 16 °C...|$|R

40|$|Home based work is {{generally}} considered to be an economic activity undertaken within the periphery of the producer/workers residence. The range of activities is rather large, home based workers "sew garments, embroider, make lace, roll cigarettes, weave carpets, <b>peel</b> <b>shrimp,</b> prepare food, polish plastic, process insurance claims, edit manuscripts, and assemble artificial flowers, umbrellas, and jewelry " (Prugl, 1999). In fact the range is much larger. Within this rather broad characterization of home based work, a variety of economic relationships are included, from independent production for sale to the consumer, to subcontracting that may be of a horizontal or vertical in nature. Subcontracting itself is mostly of the type where production occurs as per the specifications of the buyer. In home based subcontracting in India, the buyer mostly provides the necessary inputs or credit, but that is not essential. Subcontracting also may be of the vertical type where the buyer is primarily a downstream manufacturer/seller, or horizontal where the buyer is engaged in a similar activity as the home based worker.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different drying methods on physical and nutritional properties of shrimp meat {{was investigated in}} this study. <b>Peeled</b> <b>shrimps</b> were dried separately using an air-oven dryer and a tunnel solar dryer. The drying profile of shrimp meat was determined in the two drying systems by monitoring moisture loss over the drying period. Changes in color, proximate composition, and rehydration capacity were assessed. The rate of moisture removal during solar drying was faster than the air-oven drying. The development of red color during drying was comparable among the two methods, but solar-dried shrimps appeared darker (L⁎= 47. 4) than the air-oven-dried (L⁎= 49. 0). Chemical analysis indicated that protein and fat made up nearly 20 % and 2 %[*](wb) of the shrimp meat, respectively. Protein and ash content of shrimp meat dried under the two dryer types were comparable but fat was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in oven-dried meat (2. 1 %), compared to solar-dried meat (1. 5 %). Although rehydration behavior of shrimp from the two drying systems followed a similar pattern, solar-dried shrimp absorbed moisture more rapidly.

Com os objetivos de testar a termoterapia associada ao tratamento químico e biológico para a obtenção de rizomas-semente sadios e avaliar a indução de supressividade do solo a Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi com a incorporação de casca de camarão, seis ensaios foram conduzidos. Para o tratamento térmico, foram utilizados rizomas infectados, com aproximadamente 5 cm de comprimento. As relações tempo-temperatura utilizadas foram: 45 °C por zero, 60, 120 e 180 minutos e 50 °C por zero, dez e 20 minutos (ensaio 1 e campo); 50 °C por zero, 30 e 60 minutos e 55 °C por zero, 10 e 20 minutos (ensaio 2); 50, 55 e 60 ºC por zero, 10 e 20 min (ensaio 3). As caldas para tratamento térmico foram constituídas por água, solução de tiofanato metílico e caldo fermentado por Bacillus subtilis. No experimento em laboratório, os rizomas foram inoculados artificialmente. Após uma semana, receberam o tratamento térmico a 45 º C por 60, 120 e 180 minutos e a 50 ºC e 55 ºC por 10 e 20 minutos. Após a termoterapia, segmentos de rizoma foram plaqueados, sendo avaliados pela contagem dos segmentos que apresentavam o crescimento do patógeno. Na coleta, foram avaliadas altura, peso da matéria fresca da parte aérea e produção, e realizado o plaqueamento da parte aérea, raiz e rizoma. Para verificar a possibilidade do uso de casca de camarão, o solo foi infestado com o isolado patogênico. Após uma semana, houve a incorporação da casca de camarão ao solo nas concentrações de 0; 2, 5; 5; 7, 5; 10; 15 e 20 % (v/v). A população de Fusarium do solo e a comunidade de actinomicetos foram avaliadas semanalmente por diluição em série e plaqueamento. Após oito semanas da incorporação, foi realizado o plantio de um rizoma-semente de gengibre por vaso. Na coleta, a avaliação foi realizada da mesma maneira que para termoterapia. Através de todos os resultados obtidos nos cinco ensaios de termoterapia, verificouse a possibilidade de utilização da técnica com sucesso no auxílio ao controle da doença. As melhores combinações tempo/temperatura foram a 45 ºC pelo tempo de 120 minutos ou a 55 ºC por 20 minutos em todas as caldas. No teste com o uso da casca de camarão, houve uma diminuição da população de Fusarium e aumento da comunidade de actinomicetos nos solos que receberam a incorporação de casca. A adição de casca de camarão ao solo permite o plantio do gengibre em locais onde o patógeno esteja presente.

After one week, they had received the thermal treatment 45 º C for 60, 120 and 180 minutes and 50 ºC and 55 ºC for 10 and 20 minutes. After the thermal treatment, segments of rhizomes had been placed in plates, being evaluated for the counting of the segments that presented the growth of the pathogen.

40|$|Olive (Olea europaea L.) {{leaves are}} rich in {{phenolic}} substances, which exert important antioxidant and antibacterial effects. In this study, the effect of olive leaves extract (OLE) on the microbial load of raw <b>peeled</b> undeveined (PUD) <b>shrimp</b> (Penaeus semisulcatus) was evaluated. Alcoholic OLE extracts were prepared at 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % (w/v) concentrations. Raw PUD shrimp samples were immersed in the treatment solutions for 3  h at 4  °C and samples were taken for determination of total viable count (TVC) and total coliforms count (TCC). OLE at concentration of 1 % (w/v) significantly (p <  0. 01) reduced the count of the aerobic and coliforms bacteria at least 1 log cycle CFU/g {{in reference to the}} non-treated control group. Such antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and usage of 2 % OLE had the most beneficial effect in controlling microbial load in PUD shrimp stored at 4  °C. This study demonstrates the potential use of OLE formulations to improve the microbial quality of PUD shrimp and OLE might be useful to the seafood industry as a natural preservative...|$|R
