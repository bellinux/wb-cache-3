40|$|In {{earlier work}} a crossed {{product of a}} Banach algebra was {{constructed}} from a Banach algebra dynamical system (A,G,α) and a class R of continuous covariant representations, and its representations were determined. In this paper we adapt the theory to the ordered context. We construct a <b>pre-ordered</b> crossed product of a Banach algebra from a <b>pre-ordered</b> Banach algebra dynamical system (A,G,α) and a given uniformly bounded class R of continuous covariant representations of (A,G,α). If A has a positive bounded approximate left identity and R consists of non-degenerate continuous covariant representations, we establish a bijection between the positive non-degenerate bounded representations of the <b>pre-ordered</b> crossed product on <b>pre-ordered</b> Banach spaces with closed cones and the positive non-degenerate R-continuous covariant representations of (A,G,α) on such spaces. Under mild conditions, we show that this <b>pre-ordered</b> crossed product is the essentially unique <b>pre-ordered</b> Banach algebra for which such a bijection exists. Finally, we study <b>pre-ordered</b> generalized Beurling algebras. We {{show that they are}} bipositively topologically isomorphic to <b>pre-ordered</b> crossed products of Banach algebras associated with <b>pre-ordered</b> Banach algebra dynamical systems, and hence the general theory allows us to describe their positive representations on <b>pre-ordered</b> Banach spaces with closed cones...|$|R

40|$|In {{my former}} paper "A <b>pre-order</b> {{principle}} and set-valued Ekeland variational principle" (see: arXiv: 1311. 4951 [math. FA]), we established a general <b>pre-order</b> principle. From the <b>pre-order</b> principle, we deduced {{most of the}} known set-valued Ekeland variational principles (denoted by EVPs) and their improvements.
