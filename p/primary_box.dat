Certain 70 -mesh {{stainless steel}} wire meshes were placed under the cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of}} the experimental platform <b>primary</b> <b>box.</b> Coal granules cannot cross the steel wire meshes, so the cribriform ventilation device under the steel wire meshes would not be blocked by coal granules. With the steel wire meshes in place, a layer of stones (10  cm thick; 20, 10 and 5  mm diameter) was laid to enable even gas to charge. After the stone paving had been laid, several 70 -mesh steel wire meshes were placed on the stone layer. The stable stone pad forms the structure of the gas-charging base. The prepared coal is placed into a <b>primary</b> <b>box</b> and tamped. Pressure, stress and temperature sensors were placed in the coal sample at different layers and locations. The top shell was set in place and sealed. Leak detection was conducted to ensure that the experimental box was airtight.|$|E
30|$|Primary and {{auxiliary}} boxes. As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 a, the <b>primary</b> <b>box</b> {{is used to}} contain the experimental coal sample. The walls of the box body are 40 -mm-thick steel plate welded into a tight complete structure, with a cover plate thickness of 60  mm, and the design pressure is 6  MPa. The primary box’s length, width and height are 1600, 1200 and 1200  mm, respectively. The maximum experimental coal sample mass is about 1200  kg. The front and rear surfaces of the main box body contain 24 holes with different height distributions in three layers; 23 of these have a 14  mm diameter for conveying sensor cables and the remaining holes with 12  mm diameters are standard screw drills for gas injection. A special high-pressure hose {{is connected to the}} external side, and the hole’s internal side is connected with a cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>box</b> (Fig.  2 b). The cribriform ventilation device is designed as a cribriform pectinate strip. The height of the pectinate strip is 20  mm, and the upper surface of the strip contains well-distributed ventilation holes. In this way, plane-charging can be fulfilled to simulate natural gas sources. A thread-cutting coal drill pipe exists inside the box body, which is used to simulate the mining work face. Two auxiliary boxes are located on both sides of the <b>primary</b> <b>box,</b> where the coal cutting power transmission shaft is located. The side boxes are also used as a container for drilled coal. Two strip holes lie on both sides of the overlap of the primary and the auxiliary boxes, which provides a moving pathway for the coal drill pipe. To observe the coal drill pipe movement, a window is set at the sealing cover of one of the auxiliary boxes.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the concept and optimal design of a lightweight seamless aeroelastic wing (SAW) structure for small air vehicles. Attention has been first focused on the design of a hingeless flexible trailing edge (TE) control surface. Two innovative design features have been created in the SAW TE section: an open sliding TE and a curved beam and disc actuation mechanism. This type of actuated TE section allows for the SAW having a camber change in a desirable shape and minimum control power demand. This design concept has been simulated numerically and demonstrated by a test model. For a small air vehicle of large sweep back wing, it is noted that significant structural weight saving can be achieved. However, further weight saving is mainly restricted by the aeroelastic stability and minimum number of carbon/epoxy plies in a symmetric layup rather than the structural strength. Therefore, subsequent effort was made to optimize the <b>primary</b> wing <b>box</b> structure. The results show that an initial structural weight can be reduced significantly under the strength criterion. The resulting reduction of the wing box stiffness and aeroelastic stability and control effectiveness can be improved by applying the aeroelastic tailoring. Because of the large swept angle and resulting lightweight and highly flexible SAW, geometrical non-linearity and large bending-torsion aeroelastic coupling have been considered in the analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Steering was difficult, {{controlled}} by varying {{the speed of}} the two tracks. Four of the crew, two drivers (one of whom also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the other the primary gearbox) and two [...] "gearsmen" [...] (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed, the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the <b>primary</b> gear <b>box,</b> communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the starting handle - a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no wireless (radio); communication with command posts was by means of two pigeons, which had their own small exit hatch in the sponsons, or by runners. Because of the noise and vibration, early experiments had shown that radios were impractical, therefore lamps, flags, semaphore, coloured discs, and the carrier pigeons were part of the standard equipment of the various marks.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{coiled tubing}} or wireline, where the wire or tubing {{is always the}} same {{diameter}} allowing for a single unmoving <b>primary</b> barrier (stuffing <b>box</b> or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints. Therefore, the pressure control system must be able to accommodate this variable diameter. The stripping rams accomplish this. The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the lower rams so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the rams can then be bled off allowing the upper rams to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened upper rams. Once the collar is in between the rams, the upper rams are closed and pressure is equalised either side of the lower rams. The lower rams are then safely opened and the collar is lowered through the rams.|$|R
40|$|Doing {{business}} "the French way" in a Francophone {{market niche}} may be somehow different {{from doing it}} "the English way" in an Anglophone market niche. Since both the employees’ and the customers’ knowledge of an organisation underpins the organisation’s performance in complex business world environments, Multinational Organisations (MNOs) {{need to find a}} manner in which they can achieve coherence between their strategic vision, organisational culture and corporate image across the different linguistic and socio-economic markets they interact with through the various marketing tools they use to stimulate recognition. As a result this can support the integrity and sustainability of their corporate brand across markets and across different linguistics landscapes while interacting with their existing and new foreign markets. This study concentrates particularly on the rhetoric figures and visual cues employed in the selected French and English advertising/promotional messages from different types of advertisements and different product packages of multinational organisation subsidiaries. The study looks at how both the rhetoric figures and visual cues in the selected advertising/promotional messages support the integrity and maintain the sustainability of the corporate brand of the selected companies. The latter is examined across different linguistic and socio-economic markets. The study explores and examines how the possible linguistic properties are used in the selected French and English advertising/promotional messages from different types of advertisements, including those on different product packages. It also looks at how the linguistic properties in selected advertising/promotional messages belonging to different types of advertisements are used in creating and maintaining a positive corporate image of the MNOs and that of their parent companies. In addition, this study analyzes the potential impacts and challenges on moral, cultural and life-style values that multinational subsidiaries inflict on customers through the advertising/promotional messages from different types of advertisements in the promotion and branding of their products and how this affects their corporate image and that of their parent organisations. This is a content analytical study of language features evident in the selected advertising/promotional messages from different types of advertisements and different product packages at the lexical, syntactic and discourse levels and their role and impact on selected multinational parent organisations and their subsidiaries’ corporate images together with those of their selected products. In order to conduct a data-driven study, the author built a data corpus based on 29 advertising messages from different types of advertisements and advertising messages printed on different product packages. The types of advertisements include the photographs and scanned images of billboards, mural billboards, outdoor advertising billboards and leaflets advertising/promoting specific services or products. The product packages include photographs and scanned images of product covers/wraps, primary packages of products, product containers’ stickers with messages printed on them, and <b>primary</b> <b>boxes.</b> The sample comes from six selected multinational subsidiary organisations from two different countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo, a Francophone and multilingual country, and the Republic of South Africa, an Anglophone and multilingual country. Through a detailed content analysis of the advertising/promotional messages from a diversity of sources used as a means of communication, with a focus on rhetoric figures,visual cues and language features, their roles and potential impact on MNO’s, corporate images in foreign markets will be summarized. In the end, possible conclusions are drawn {{in the light of the}} role and impact that they have on the selected companies’ corporate image across different linguistic and socio-economic markets...|$|R

The aim of a project by the Ministry of Primary Industries is to diversify Fiji's agricultural base, improve rural nutrition and meet the demand for fresh sheep meat. Although Fiji could not become self-sufficient in sheep meat {{due to lack of}} grazing land, there is a market for fresh sheep meat particularly for religious festivals. Currently 10, 000 tonnes of frozen meat are imported annually, mainly from New Zealand. The sheep that are being trialled in the project are a cross on the Barbados Black Belly (a hair sheep requiring no shearing) imported from California and the Wiltshire from Australia. Although other crosses were tried, the BBB/Wiltshire cross was found to have the best weight gain, the least wool and the best reproductive rate. Thirty per cent of the ewes, which lamb once a year, produced twins. It is hoped that large-scale sheep farming could productively use the largely neglected unfertile grasslands in the dry areas of the two main islands. There is also the possibility that sheep production could be integrated with other large industries such as sugar cane, citrus and softwoods.
