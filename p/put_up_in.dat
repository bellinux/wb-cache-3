5|$|The Anglican Parish of St. James {{is one of}} {{the three}} parishes of the Diocese of St Helena on the island. St James' Church is the primary church in the parish and is the oldest Anglican Church in the {{southern}} hemisphere; the present building was <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1772. There are 3 daughter churches: St John's, in Upper Jamestown, St Mary's, the Briars, and St Michael's, in Rupert's Valley. The sole Catholic Church in St Helena, Sacred Heart Church, is located in Jamestown, as is a Baptist church.|$|E

He becomes a ping pong celebrity and plays competitively against Chinese teams in ping pong diplomacy. At an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., Forrest briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. While in D.C. in 1972, Forrest meets president Richard Nixon and is <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Watergate hotel, where he accidentally reveals the Watergate scandal, ultimately forcing Nixon to resign.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E

5|$|Many Somerset {{soldiers}} {{died during}} the First World War, with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5,000 casualties. War memorials were <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> most of the county's towns and villages; only nine, described as the Thankful Villages, had none of their residents killed. During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day landings. Some of the hospitals which were built for the casualties of the war remain in use. The Taunton Stop Line {{was set up to}} repel a potential German invasion. The remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along the coast, and south through Ilminster and Chard.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Indiana Jones films, Spielberg shot the entire {{film in the}} United States, stating {{he did not want}} to be away from his family. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, in Deming, New Mexico. An extensive chase scene set at the fictional Marshall College was filmed between June 28 and July 7 at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut (where Spielberg's son Theo was studying). To keep in line with the fact the story takes place in the 1950s, several facades were changed, although signs were <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> between shots to tell the public what the store or restaurant actually was.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 the Bentworth Hall {{estate was}} bought by Major Herbert Cecil Benyon Berens, who was a {{director}} of Hambros Bank in London from 1968. In 1950 Berens built two new lodge houses at the junction of the drive to Bentworth Hall towards the main road through the village. The Berens family arms included a bear, and when Berens acquired the Bentworth Hall estate, carvings of bears were <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> various places. Two {{of which can be}} seen {{at the entrance to the}} Bentworth Hall drive, between the two lodge houses. Herbert Berens died on 27 October 1981, and the remaining estate was put up for sale. Initially Bentworth Hall was offered as a single property, but its outbuildings were divided into a number of separate dwelling units and other parts were sold to local farms. In June 1982, the Bentworth Conservation Area was established, incorporating many of the local buildings of note, extending along the main lane and around the church.|$|E

5|$|Some {{relatively}} large memorials were constructed during the war. The largest nagelfiguren was {{a statue of}} General Hindenburg, famous for his victory over the Russians in Prussia {{at the battle of}} Tannenberg; the 12 m tall statue was <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Berlin, complete with scaffolding to allow participants to reach the statue and hammer nails in. By the end of the war, architects in Germany already considering how to commemorate the dead. A large, temporary memorial shrine was built in Hyde Park in August 1918, with over 100,000 visitors in its first week: it lasted over a year. The Hyde Park shrine encouraged debate in Britain about permanent war memorials in the major cities and towns. Museums to remember the events of the war also began to be commissioned; governmentally: the Imperial War Museum in Britain in 1917, Australia began a War Museum in 1917; privately, the repository of wartime records in France, Germany the Kriegsbibliothek.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{hundreds}} of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{most of the}} towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties– though much fewer– during the Second World War, who {{were added to the}} memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was then a new experimental high-explosive. It obtained water supplies from two sources via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had neglected to follow the black-out regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down.|$|E

25|$|Few {{buildings}} of significance were <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the century {{after the completion}} of the Minster in 1472, the exceptions being the completion of the King's Manor (which from 1537 to 1641 housed the Council of the North) and the rebuilding of the church of St. Michael le Belfrey, where Guy Fawkes was baptised in 1570.|$|E

25|$|According to a 2014 two-year {{study by}} the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)'s Intelligence Report, {{registered}} Stormfront users have been disproportionately responsible {{for some of the}} most lethal hate crimes and mass killings since the site was <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1995. In the five years leading up to 2014, Stormfront members murdered nearly 100 people.

25|$|In that year, at {{the battle}} of Tolbiac, Theuderic {{defeated}} and captured Theudebert, whom the queen was now claiming was in fact the son of a gardener, and brought him and his royal paraphernalia to Brunhilda, who subsequently had him <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a monastery. She probably also then had him murdered (along with his son Merovech) to allow Theuderic to succeed to both thrones unhindered.
