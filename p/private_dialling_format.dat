50|$|There is {{a special}} {{exception}} for foreign visitors who are using international roaming in Brazil. They can use the standard <b>dialing</b> <b>format</b> to call abroad from Brazil (+cc-aa-nnnn-nnnn).|$|R
5000|$|The Rekord B {{had come}} with a curious [...] "strip speedometer", {{featuring}} a coloured line that grew longer as speed increased, and which changed colour from green to yellow to red as the most common speed limit thresholds of 50 km/h and 100 km/h were crossed. Opinions were divided on the strip speedometer, and with the Rekord C Opel reverted to a conventional <b>dial</b> <b>format</b> speedometer, suggesting that for them too, the expanding colour changing strip speedometer {{had fallen out of}} fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "0" [...] {{on every}} prefix is an Area Code Exit code {{that must be}} dialed when a number with a {{different}} area code is being called. So when calling from outside of Turkey those 0s are not <b>dialed.</b> The <b>dialing</b> <b>format</b> when calling from outside Turkey is +90 BBB AAA AA AA and NOT +90 0BBB AAA AA AA. Unlike the North American system, the Country Exit Code isn't 011 but 00. So it is one [...] "0" [...] to exit area and one more [...] "0" [...] to exit the country.|$|R
5000|$|Mobile phone area {{codes are}} three digits long and always {{start with the}} number 9, {{although}} recently new area codes have been issued with 8 as the starting digit, particularly for VOIP phone numbers. However, the area code indicates the service provider and not necessarily a geographic region. Unlike fixed-line telephones, the long-distance telephone <b>dialling</b> <b>format</b> is always observed when using a mobile phone. Therefore, mobile phone numbers always have the format [...] "+63 (xxx) xxx-xxxx" [...] for international callers and [...] "0(xxx) xxx-xxxx" [...] for domestic callers.|$|R
50|$|When Dial Global {{made the}} final {{integration}} of the <b>Dial</b> Global Local <b>formats</b> into its own portfolio in June 2012, Rock 2.0 was the only <b>Dial</b> Global Local <b>format</b> to survive with its name intact. It was the only <b>format</b> offered by <b>Dial</b> Global to feature current mainstream rock, and is available only in a Local version, not in a Total version.|$|R
50|$|Calls {{from outside}} of South Sudan has a {{different}} <b>dialing</b> <b>format</b> needing to be used. International call prefixes, area codes, and phone numbers may vary. An inbound call has the format of +211 mm nnn nnnn (where mm represents the mobile code, and nnn nnnn represents the local number). This is also started off with the international call prefix respective to the country the call is coming from (for example, the United States and Canada use 011, and most other countries use 00). So for example, if someone from tried to call to the number 55-555-5555 in South Sudan from the United States, then one would use 011 211 55 555 5555.|$|R
5000|$|Caballero {{interiors}} {{featured a}} bench seat in standard models, though an upgrade to bucket seats with a center console and floor-mounted shifter was available. Most models with automatic transmission carried the shifter {{on the steering}} column. Cloth or vinyl upholstery choices were offered {{in a variety of}} colors. The instrument panel originally featured a [...] "strip" [...] style of speedometer, with the needle making a long sweep across a horizontal line of numbers to indicate speed. This was changed for 1981 to a more conventional round <b>dial</b> <b>format,</b> with some further minor tweaks for 1986. The 1987 model year {{was the end of the}} line for GM's North American Coupe Utilities, which included 420 leftover El Caminos and 325 Cabelleros that were reported first sold in 1988.|$|R
50|$|Calls between {{different}} {{countries and territories}} of the NANP are not typically charged as domestic calls. However, calls between the United States and Canada are considered domestic, but are typically charged at higher rates than calls to most domestic areas. Calls to other destinations in the NANP are often charged at overseas rates even on flat-rate plans in the United States and Canada; for example, it generally costs more to call Bermuda from the United States {{than it does to}} call the UK or Japan, even though the <b>dialing</b> <b>format</b> {{is the same as the}} domestic format. Similarly, calls from Bermuda to U.S. numbers (including toll-free 1-800) incur high international rates. This was because many of the island nations at the time implemented a plan of subsidizing the cost of local phone services by directly charging higher pricing levies on international long-distance services.|$|R
5000|$|On December 29, 2008, [...] "adult {{rock and}} roll" [...] was merged with Jones Radio Networks' [...] "rock classics" [...] to make <b>Dial</b> Global's new <b>format</b> [...] "classic rock".|$|R
5000|$|When {{calling from}} outside of Israel, the leading [...] "0" [...] in area codes is not <b>dialed,</b> and the <b>format</b> is +972-A-XXX-XXXX for calls to landlines, +972-5N-XXX-XXXX for calls to mobile lines, +972-7N-XXX-XXXX for calls to VoIP lines.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: These two ads {{show the}} <b>Dialing</b> for Dollars <b>format</b> in 1972-73 on two sister stations, KXMB-TV in Bismarck/Mandan, N.D. and KXMC-TV in Minot, N.D. They {{illustrate}} how local stations used their own talent and set design {{to create a}} Dialing for Dollars series.|$|R
5000|$|WNCI {{began its}} Top 40 {{programming}} in 1970, although the station also broadcast an evening [...] "progressive rock" [...] album-based program {{beginning in the}} fall of 1969. From 1979 to 1982, the station attempted a full-service adult contemporary music format to compete with WTVN, adding a 5-person news staff. Its slogan at the time was [...] "The Best Is At The Center," [...] playing on its location on the FM <b>dial.</b> The <b>format</b> was abandoned in 1982 and the station returned to the Top 40 format.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} between Clear Channel and Perry Broadcasting discontinued when Perry purchased KRPT-103.5 out of Anadarko, Oklahoma (See KVSP) and upgraded {{the station to}} target Oklahoma City, then moved KVSP's Urban format to the FM <b>dial.</b> The Spanish <b>format</b> was also dropped as well for Talk format.|$|R
50|$|In some markets, {{the smooth}} jazz format has {{also found a}} new home on the AM <b>dial.</b> The <b>format</b> had brief comebacks on the AM dial in Reno, Nevada, Phoenix, Arizona (nights and {{weekends}}), and Atlanta, Georgia (the latter during weekends only). Among the markets featuring full-time AM smooth jazz outlets are Seattle, Washington (KZIZ 1560 AM) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (WDAS 1480 AM, simulcasting WISX 106.1 FM HD2). In Detroit, Michigan, WCHB 1200 AM (with a translator on 99.9 FM) also programs smooth jazz during the evening and overnight hours.|$|R
50|$|Another program, Uncle Ted's Ghoul School, once {{employed}} Bill O'Reilly as a writer. He {{was also}} a reporter at the station {{for a brief period}} during the mid-1970s. WNEP also served as the local affiliate for the Bowling for Dollars and <b>Dialing</b> for Dollars <b>formats,</b> producing local versions of each.|$|R
50|$|In the United States and Canada, ten-digit dialing is the {{practice}} of including the area code of a telephone number when dialing to initiate a telephone call. When necessary, a ten-digit number may be prefixed with the trunk code 1, which {{is often referred to}} as 11-digit <b>dialing</b> or national <b>format.</b>|$|R
50|$|WLKM-FM is a {{radio station}} owned by Impact Radio and {{licensed}} to Three Rivers, Michigan. The featured music is Adult Contemporary. The format switched from Classic Hits on June 17, 2012, when the Dial Global Classic Hits format the station had been carrying was discontinued. Programming now comes from <b>Dial</b> Global's AC <b>format.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1960, {{it evolved}} to mostly Spanish. In 1975 {{the station was}} sold to SJR {{communications}} along with WHOM-FM. WHOM-FM would become AC WKTU (then years later disco then rock WXRK, talk as WFNY-FM, and later rock again turned Top 40 WXRK again). WHOM AM was renamed WJIT (Radio Jit) and went from diversified Spanish to Spanish contemporary music. In the late '70s WJIT was the leading salsa and merengue station on the New York <b>dial.</b> The <b>format</b> changed to Spanish Adult Contemporary and the station was sold, along with WKTU 92.3, to Infinity Broadcasting in 1982.|$|R
50|$|WGL {{was sold}} (along {{with the other}} Kovas Communications {{stations}}) to Travis Broadcasting Corp. in December, 2001, for $7.5 million. WGL was purchased, along with its sister stations by Summit City Radio Group in July, 2004. Currently, it broadcasts adult standards, having picked up the format in 2003. WGL aired the syndicated Adult Standards (America's Best Music) <b>format</b> from <b>Dial</b> Global until April 2007, when the station went to a standards/soft AC hybrid {{with a combination of}} local DJs and local automation. The station soon returned to airing the <b>Dial</b> Global <b>format</b> with a local morning show.|$|R
50|$|Land line {{phone numbers}} in Kenya follow the format Area Code + Phone Number.To dial a number within an Area and/or City, only the Phone Number {{needs to be}} dialled. When {{dialling}} from a different Area/City, the telephone number is <b>dialled</b> in the <b>format</b> 0 + Area Code + Phone Number. When dialling from overseas, the 0 is omitted.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, Standard Broadcasting {{acquired}} CHAM and {{its sister}} stations (CKOC and CKLH), and on January 31, 2005, at 8:20am, with contemporary country listeners having gravitated to the FM <b>dial,</b> adjusted CHAM's <b>format</b> to become [...] "All Time Country Favourites: 820 CHAM - The Legend," [...] with the station concentrating on classic country music (though a few current songs {{would later be}} included on a limited basis).|$|R
50|$|As Dial {{travels the}} globe, Harry shares {{dangerous}} missions with Dial while linked {{to him by}} computer. He {{is in charge of}} the technological end, seeing and hearing everything Dial sees and hears, and providing the information not readily available to the average person. But much is left to Harry's imagination as the details of <b>Dial's</b> <b>private</b> life remain - well, private.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{competitors}} were [...] "Country Today" [...] and [...] "The Bar" [...] by Waitt, CD Country and U.S. Country by Jones, however {{those assets}} were absorbed by Triton Media Group, leaving Citadel Media's Today's Best Country and Real Country the only competitors. The Jones and Waitt networks, except for [...] "The Bar," [...] will {{be integrated into}} Mainstream Country and other <b>Dial</b> Global country <b>formats</b> in late 2008 and early 2009.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music the}} station plays is mostly Adult Contemporary in nature, though Oldies music is also heard {{throughout}} the day ("How Long" [...] by Ace and [...] "Already Gone" [...] by The Eagles make almost daily rotations), and Sunday mornings are home to the long-time local favorite [...] "Big Band Sunday" [...] music block. During evening and weekend dayparts, the station airs <b>Dial</b> Global's adult-contemporary <b>format</b> via satellite.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2012, due to reorganizations at Dial Global, the Dial Global Local 24/7 formats {{were fully}} {{integrated}} into Dial Global's portfolio of formats, and [...] "Dial Global Local" [...] {{ceased to exist}} as a brand name. However, most of the former <b>Dial</b> Global Local <b>formats</b> are still offered to affiliate stations {{in the same manner}} in which they were previously offered. AC Active continues as a Local version of Dial Global's Hot AC format.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1970s, the {{popularity}} faded for the <b>Dialing</b> for Dollars <b>format,</b> as competition developed from daytime talk shows, {{and more sophisticated}} game shows were syndicated. Another factor in the show's decline was the trend of fewer households having stay-at-home members available {{to answer the phone}} during the day. Dialing for Dollars left the Baltimore airwaves in 1977 (although it is still seen in a few markets), after giving away $800,000 locally in its 38-year run there on radio and television.|$|R
50|$|Until 17 December 1994, Andorra formed {{part of the}} French {{numbering}} plan, {{with numbers}} beginning with 628, after which the principality adopted the country code 376. Consequently, all calls from France to Andorra must be <b>dialed</b> in international <b>format</b> 00 376 plus the phone number, while calls from Andorra to France similarly must be dialed as 00 33 plus the phone number. On 21 June 1996, Monaco similarly adopted its own country code 377, replacing access from France (+33 93).|$|R
5000|$|In June 2012, due to reorganizations at Dial Global, the Dial Global Local 24/7 formats {{were fully}} {{integrated}} into Dial Global's portfolio of formats, and [...] "Dial Global Local" [...] {{ceased to exist}} as a brand name. However, most of the former <b>Dial</b> Global Local <b>formats</b> are still offered to affiliate stations {{in the same manner}} in which they were previously offered. Country Classics is no longer offered under that name but continues as a local version of Dial Global's Classic Country format.|$|R
50|$|Fútbol de Primera Radio Network {{was created}} in August 1989 by Alejandro Gutman taking its first steps in {{becoming}} {{an integral part of}} the nation’s soccer landscape. With vast experience in the soccer world, Fútbol de Primera realized there was a need for soccer to be listened to on a substantial market list of stations that match the quality of the games themselves. In a historic move, Fútbol de Primera Radio worked with its affiliates to broaden the landscape beyond AM and talk radio to put soccer on the FM <b>dial</b> music <b>formatted</b> stations as soccer specials. The strategy worked and powerhouse matches over the years have been heard nationally without fail. Fútbol de Primera's most renowned broadcasts include the 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup. Other broadcasts include the Mexico national team games, CONCACAF World Cup Qualification and a record eight consecutive CONCACAF Gold Cups.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2012, due to reorganizations at Dial Global, the Dial Global Local 24/7 formats {{were fully}} {{integrated}} into Dial Global's portfolio of formats, and [...] "Dial Global Local" [...] {{ceased to exist}} as a brand name. However, most of the former <b>Dial</b> Global Local <b>formats</b> are still offered to affiliate stations {{in the same manner}} in which they were previously offered. Three formats - Rock 2.0, Good Time Oldies, and Hits Now! - are available in Local versions only (the latter being a former Dial Global Total offering).|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, KOBI {{broadcast}} a popular interactive game show called Jackpot Bingo, hosted by Tom Carnes. The show aired before Days of Our Lives and took after the popular <b>Dialing</b> for Dollars <b>format.</b> Jackpot Bingo gave contestants {{the opportunity to}} win up to $5,000 in cash by playing blackout bingo. However, contestants usually won the minimum $200 prize. Carnes was replaced by Sally Holliday in 1987 and the show was renamed $10,000 Jackpot Bingo as the prize money doubled. Still, contestants usually won $200. The show garnered the highest ratings for its time slot, although it was cancelled in 1988.|$|R
50|$|On some {{stations}} (such as KTVU {{hosted by}} Pat McCormick, who also did voices for the Charley & Humphry puppets during a local cartoon show), the <b>Dialing</b> for Dollars <b>format</b> {{would be used}} during the local telecasting of a morning or afternoon movie. The film would be interrupted by a dialing for dollars segment every so often, rather than going to a commercial break, after which the program either went to a commercial or directly back to the film. On others, such as WKBW's version, the show was a full one-hour variety show complete with studio audience and mini-games.|$|R
5000|$|Most superzoom compact cameras have between 30x and 60x optical zoom, {{although}} some have even further zoom, {{most notably the}} Nikon P900, which has 83x optical zoom, and weigh less than 300 grams, much less than bridge cameras and DSLRs. Most of these compact cameras use small 1/2.3" [...] sensors, but since 2008 a few non-interchangeable compact cameras use larger sensor such as 1" [...] and even APS-C, such as the Fujifilm X100 series, or full frame format such as the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1R series. They prioritize intelligent Auto, but some high end P&S cameras have PSAM mode <b>dial,</b> Raw image <b>format,</b> and hot shoe. None have lens threads.|$|R
