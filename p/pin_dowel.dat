The result of the numerical construction of the slip-lines can precisely be represented by an analytical function of a logarithmic spiral that can {{be shown to be}} the exact solution. This function in one variable can be given in the power law form leading to a theoretical and experimental value of that power of 0. 5. This power representation of the stress spreading model of the strength increase, by confined dilatation, provides simple rules for the code and a simple design method that precisely matches to the data in all circumstances and loading cases and explains the apparent contradictory test results of Suenson, the Eurocode, the French rules, Graf, Korin and Augustin et al. and, as shown before, explains other comparable loading cases as e. g. by <b>pin</b> <b>dowel</b> connections (see literature) ...|$|E

Metric <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are often found in two size. In DIN 6325 {{standard}} the <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are slightly larger than the nominal value. For example a 3 mm <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> will range from 3.002 to 3.008. In the ISO 2338 standard the <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are slightly smaller - 3mm nominal range is 2.986 to 3.000. The terminology (e.g. [...] "oversized", [...] "standard") is not entirely consistent across suppliers. In inch pins [...] "oversized" [...] refers to pins that are more significantly oversized for worn out <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> holes.

50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses a <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{study of}} {{connections}} for timber structures {{has been the}} subject of intense research in Brazil. This work aimed to study the embedment strength of connections made by steel <b>pins</b> (<b>dowels)</b> in specimens of reforested woods. Analytical and experimental evaluations were considered in this study. Initially, tests on specimens made from Pinus elliottii (Class C 30) and Eucalyptus salligna (Class C 50) woods with dowels, type 1020, with diameter of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 ") were performed. The tests were performed according to the ANBT NBR 7190 (1997) and Eurocode 5 (2004) Standards with subsequent comparison between the analytical and experimental results for embedment strengths. The values of the embedment strength showed that the Eurocode 5 (2004) Standard had greater agreement between experimental and analytical results when compared to the results of the ABNT NBR 7190 (1997) Standard...|$|R

Examination revealed that the eye-end of the torque link has opened up by tensile overload while all the dowel bolts got sheared off. There were no evidences of delayed failure like fatigue or stress corrosion cracking.

When the impression is poured up, it is directly mounted on a plastic base or tray that already has a built-in condyle to form a complete articulator when the two halves are joined. By eliminating the need to pour up a stone base, the single-pour is a much faster system than the Stone Base system. There are varieties of single-pour systems that use <b>dowel</b> <b>pins,</b> and there are some that omit the need for <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> by creating the model completely out of die stone.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} shear-carrying {{structures}} very often profits by the dowel action developed by reinforcing bars or shear connectors, since dowel action is, in principle, a very efficient shear-transfer mechanism. Within the same element, the reinforcing bars may act as dowels {{as soon as}} stress-induced interfaces form (cracks in the ultimate load situation), while shear connectors between side-by-side elements (studs, <b>pins,</b> <b>dowels)</b> develop a dowel action {{from the very beginning}} of the loading process, including the service load situation. Within this framework an experimental program has been carried out to investigate the dowel action in 27 reinforced concrete specimens fitted up with a single deformed bar of 14, 18, and 24 -mm diameter (No. 5, 6, and 8). The shear response of the dowel bar, the displacements and curvatures up to failure, and the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment were measured or evaluated. The tests give new evidence on the behavior of dowel action and allow further checks of the models available in literature for predicing dowel strength and stiffness. Furthermore, suitable formulations are proposed for the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment to allow the professional engineer to design a dowel bar or introduce dowel action in a safer and more consistent way...|$|R

40|$|Statement of Problem: Given that meticulous implant {{prosthodontic}} {{procedures are}} recommended {{to obtain the}} best possible intraoral fit, the die systems used for multi implant casts warrant further investigation. Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac precision die system, and Conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac precision die tray system, Pindex system, and conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional <b>Dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system however for Accu-trac precision die tray system, it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured.
