40|$|This study {{details the}} {{numerical}} modelling and optimization of natural convection heat suppression in a solar cavity receiver with <b>plate</b> <b>fins.</b> The use of <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> {{attached to the}} inner aperture surface {{is presented as a}} possible low cost means of suppressing natural convection heat loss in a cavity receiver. In {{the first part of the}} study a three-dimensional numerical model that captures the heat transfer and flow processes in the cavity receiver is analyzed, and the possibilities of optimization were then established. The model is laminar in the range of Rayleigh number, inclination angle, plate height and thickness considered. In the second part of the study, the geometric parameters considered were optimized using optimization programme with search algorithm. The results indicate that significant reduction on the natural convection heat loss can be achieved from cavity receivers by using <b>plate</b> <b>fins,</b> and an optimal <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> configuration exit for minimal natural convection heat loss for a given range of Rayleigh number. Reduction of up to a maximum of 20 % at 0 receiver inclination was observed. The results obtained provide a novel approach for improving design of cavity receiver for optimal performance.

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{study and}} optimization of combined laminar natural convection and surface radiation heat transfer in solar cavity receiver with <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. Minimizing heat loss in cavity receivers {{is seen as an}} effective way to enhance the thermal performance and the use of <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> has been proposed as a low cost means to minimize heat loss. Firstly, the influence of operating temperature, emissivity of the surface, orientation and the geometric parameters on the total heat loss from the receiver was investigated. It was observed that convective heat loss is largely affected by the angle of inclination of the receiver, the presence of fins and the number of fins in the receiver. As for the radiation heat loss it was observed that it is mainly influenced by the properties of the cavity receiver surface. The radiation heat loss was found to be constant at all the angles of the receiver. Significant reduction in natural convection heat loss from the cavity receiver was accomplished by using the <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> whereas radiation heat loss was marginally reduced by about 5 %. Secondly, the optimization was conducted to obtain the optimal fin geometry and lastly, the overall thermal efficiency of the receiver was presented at different operating temperatures. The overall cavity efficiency marginally increased by approximately 2 % with the insertion of <b>fin</b> <b>plates</b> although the convective heat loss was suppressed by about 20 %. This {{is due to the fact}} that radiation heat loss dominates at high operating temperatures compared to convective heat loss. National Research Foundation and University of Pretoria[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using {{heat sink}} to {{increase}} the cooling area is the most familiar and fundamental method in LED heat management technology. We develop a new configuration of finned heat sink for LED lamp. It is a circular cylinder with many <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> radially arranged on the external surface. There are many straight ducts inside the peripheral wall of the cylinder. These ducts form the chimney ef-fect to enhance the heat transfer. This work experimentally investigated the chimney effect on the heat transfer characteristics of the finned heat sink under the free convection state. The aluminum-alloy plate spreader with two vertical <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> {{was selected as the}} control group.

One of the heat exchangers had continuous <b>plate</b> <b>fins,</b> and the other had serpentine fins. The performances during dry and wet test conditions were compared and related to theoretical predictions for different assumptions. The influence of air velocity, air humidity, and inclination angle was investigated. The results show that, in most cases, the heat transfer performance is somewhat reduced under wet conditions in comparison with dry test conditions, and that wet heat transfer surfaces lead to an increased pressure drop. At the lower air velocity range that was investigated, the heat exchanger having continuous <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> drained better than the one with serpentine fins...|$|R
25|$|<b>Plate</b> and <b>fin</b> heat {{exchangers}} are usually made of aluminum alloys, which provide high heat transfer efficiency.

5000|$|Process air {{is passed}} through an {{integrated}} heat exchanger (usually a <b>plate</b> <b>fin</b> heat exchanger) and cooled against product (and waste) cryogenic streams. Part {{of the air}} liquefies to form a liquid that is enriched in oxygen. The remaining gas is richer in nitrogen and is distilled to almost pure nitrogen (typically < 1ppm) in a high pressure (HP) distillation column. The condenser of this column requires refrigeration which is obtained from expanding the more oxygen rich stream further across a valve or through an Expander, (a reverse compressor).|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively the {{condenser}} may be cooled by interchanging {{heat with}} a reboiler {{in a low}} pressure (LP) distillation column (operating at 1.2-1.3 bar abs.) when the ASU is producing pure oxygen.

Typical oxygen purities range in from 97.5% to 99.5% and influences the maximum recovery of oxygen. The refrigeration required for producing liquid products is obtained using the Joule-Thomson effect in an expander which feeds compressed air directly to the low pressure column. Hence, a certain part of the air {{is not to be}} separated and must leave the low pressure column as a waste stream from its upper section.|$|E
