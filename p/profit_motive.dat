Salon.com's Andrew Leonard notes that in the Bridge trilogy, Gibson's villains change from multinational corporations and artificial intelligences of the Sprawl trilogy to the mass media– namely tabloid television and the cult of celebrity. Virtual Light depicts an [...] "end-stage capitalism, in which private enterprise and the <b>profit</b> <b>motive</b> are taken to their logical conclusion".

40|$|Shareholder wealth {{maximization}} (SWM) is {{the notion}} that the immediate operating goal of a corporation is and should be to maximize return on equity capital (Windsor, 2010). This notion is as controversial among the general population as it is common to those working in business. This presents us with a problem: most people think SWM is a blatantly bad idea from the viewpoint of ethics. If managers ought to maximize shareholder wealth at all times than how can other legitimate interests be taken into account? Given the moral suspicion of SWM, it stands in need of a moral justification. My question is whether SWM, or other variations of a profit principle which has shareholders as its main beneficiaries, can be justified ethically. In order to evaluate this, I will go over three approaches that attempt to justify SWM or alternative formulations of it, and one approach which denies <b>profit</b> <b>motives</b> altogether. I will argue that the approaches considered here either miss the mark of business ethics, or only partially hit it. I will then suggest an alternative way of looking at business ethics, on which <b>profit</b> <b>motives</b> like SWM seem to lose some of their value...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} commercial factors, such as the need by newspaper publishers to generate and multiply profits to sustain viability and meet shareholder demands, influenced the selection of communities in Soweto as target audiences by community media publisher Caxton Media in the launch of its Urban News community newspapers series. The research is framed {{in the context of the}} growing trend of media commercialism, which has gradually expanded to the previously non-profit community media sector, and looks at how community newspaper publishers have employed various strategies, including targeting the most lucrative and segmented audience markets that are of the most value to advertisers, to maintain and increase profitability. It also examines whether or not community media publishers, while pursuing these <b>profit</b> <b>motives,</b> are able to maintain the thrust of what community media should be and how it should operate. The findings show that despite the perceived ‘normative’ ideals of putting the needs and interests of the community first, commercial factors were the primary factors that Caxton considered prior to the launch of the Urban News community newspapers. Contrary to the hypothesis of this study, it was also found that in a commercial community media setting, <b>profit</b> <b>motives</b> can tie in quite well with the ideals of community media if a link is found between editorial content and advertising content...|$|R
