5|$|The {{east coast}} of the U.S. also began to consume more ice, {{particularly}} as more industrial and <b>private</b> <b>customers</b> found uses for refrigeration.

By the 1840s, ice was being used to transfer small quantities of goods further west across the continent. Eastern U.S. fishermen began to use ice to preserve their catches. Fewer businesses or individuals in the east harvested their own ice independently in winter, most preferring to rely on commercial providers.|$|E
