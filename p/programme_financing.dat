This paper studies an Italian programme of subsidies for the applied development of innovations, exploiting a discontinuity in <b>programme</b> <b>financing</b> due to an unexpected shortage of public money. To identify the effect of the programme, the study implements a regression discontinuity design and compares firms that applied for funding before and after the shortage occurred. The results indicate that the programme was not effective in stimulating innovative investment. R&D, public policy, evaluation...|$|E

The present paper shows that simple cooperation between chemical industries and university laboratories {{can be a}} way to overcome some of the present difficulties. The work carried out at LABOCAT has several industrial interfaces. It involves, among other areas of RDI, the development of anti-HIV-protease (and other virus-related-protease) drugs, the establishment of new (industrial) chemical processes and the implementation of industrial (biodiesel and related) plants. A model based on the present so called RHAE programme is proposed in which, parallel to the fellowship awards of this <b>programme,</b> <b>financing</b> participation of Brazilian Agencies would cover process development...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, an {{uprising}} by the March 23 Movement in North Kivu led to significant internal displacement in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The humanitarian community’s {{strategy was to}} distribute assistance according {{to the principle of}} impartiality. A closer analysis, however, shows that assistance was not so much determined by need as by status and location – in other words, how people were displaced and their proximity to Goma had a large influence on the level of assistance they received. This article argues that such imbalances can be partly explained by policies adopted within the humanitarian community: first, by privileging the political considerations of the Congolese Government when deciding which groups of internally displaced persons would receive better levels of assistance and protection; secondly, through a growing unwillingness by many agencies to negotiate their own access to populations with all parties of the conflict; and thirdly, in an inflexibility towards <b>programme</b> <b>financing</b> and management, which added considerable bureaucratic delays and difficulties to the delivery of assistance. By reflecting on the choices made by aid agencies in the context of mass displacement, this article shows how humanitarianism can restrict rather than enhance the options of forcibly displaced populations...|$|E

40|$|Background: Malaria {{control has}} been {{dramatically}} scaled up the past decade, mainly thanks to increasing international donor financing since 2003. This study assessed progress up to 2010 towards global malaria impact targets, {{in relation to}} Global Fund, other donor and domestic malaria <b>programme</b> <b>financing</b> over 2003 to 2009. Methods. Assessments used domestic malaria financing reported by national programmes, and Global Fund/OECD data on donor financing for 90 endemic low- and middle-income countries, WHO estimates of households owning one or more insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and WHO-estimated malaria case incidence and deaths in countries outside sub-Saharan Africa. Results: Global Fund and other donor funding is concentrated in {{a subset of the}} highest endemic African countries. Outside Africa, donor funding is concentrated in those countries with highest malaria mortality and case incidence rates over the years 2000 to 2003. ITN coverage in 2010 in Africa, and declines in case and death rates per person at risk over 2004 to 2010 outside Africa, were greatest in countries with highest donor funding per person at risk, and smallest in countries with lowest donor malaria funding per person at risk. Outside Africa, all-source malaria programme funding over 2003 to 2009 per case averted ($ 56 - 5, 749) or per death averted ($ 58, 000 - 3, 900, 000) over 2004 to 2010 tended to be lower (more favourable) in countries with higher donor malaria funding per person at risk. Conclusions: Increases in malaria programme funding are associated with accelerated progress towards malaria control targets. Associations between programme funding per person at risk and ITN coverage increases and declines in case and death rates suggest opportunities to maximize the impact of donor funding, by strategic re-allocation to countries with highest continued need...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} German Sickness Insurance Programme {{in the years}} between its enactment in 1883 and its recodification in 1911, as part of Germany's comprehensive social insurance system. It traces the evolution of health policy between 1883 and 1911 and discusses the impact that this landmark policy had on {{the well-being of the}} German population. Although the antecedents to modern German health policy may be traced to the sixteenth century, the period between 1800 and 1911 is a watershed period. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to provide {{a detailed description of the}} German model for countries 1 without a national health service or national health insurance programme and 2) to study the changing roles of consumers and providers and the effect these changes have on access to care and cost containment, two issues which face policy makers throughout the world. As a social political analysis, this study explores proximate rather than definitive sources and causes for policy decisions. It attempts to delineate and explicate the issues surrounding the need for and enactment of the German Sickness Insurance Act of 1883 : Where did the substantive ideas originate. Were they accepted or challenged. By whom. What is the relationship between policy objectives and policy output. How was quality of life affected. The infrastructure of medical services on which the programme relied at its inception is described as are legislative precedents for the Sickness Insurance Act of 1883. The operational aspects of the sickness insurance programme (for example, eligibility criteria, benefit design and <b>programme</b> <b>financing)</b> at the time of its implementation in 1884 are detailed. The study then focuses on the evolution of the programme (that is, changes in eligibility, benefit design and provider reimbursement) and the political and social forces which caused those changes. The interplay between consumer and provider concerns, as well as the changing level of organized input into the policy making process from these two groups is highlighted. The study concludes with an analysis of the programme's impact on the German citizenry, their access to health care and health insurance and the programme's ability to contain costs while expanding access. The analysis specifically assesses the impact that changing roles of consumers and providers have on achieving the goals of access and cost containment. The preconditions for effective implementation of a similarly structured programme elsewhere, specifically the United States, are noted. The limited intervention of the German government in both the financing or administration of the sickness insurance programme as well as its use of a multiple payer system, enhances its political appeal for American legislators and therefore the likelihood that the model could be replicated in the United States...|$|E
