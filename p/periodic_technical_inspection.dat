40|$|The {{increasing}} number of road accidents nowadays seems to by a global problem. Apart from the obvious causes of accidents, such as violation of road traffic rules by drivers and pedestrians, the drunk driving, poor quality of road infrastructure, the technical faults of vehicles should also be take into account. Reasons of technical failures can be the failure of parts, components and assemblies caused by aging, poor quality or non-observance of technological norms when they are installed. It is possible {{to prevent the occurrence}} of faults by applying warning methods, one of which is obligatory <b>periodic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>inspection.</b> The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze the characteristic features of the systems of technical inspections in automotive transport used in Poland and Russia. It makes it possible to identify common features and distinctive features of systems in both countries...|$|E
40|$|Compressed air is {{the most}} common type of energy used in {{underground}} mines. Despite its low efficiency and high cost, it is used for various purposes, especially for drilling. This type of energy is still used relatively frequently, mainly due to its safety benefits and technical matters even though it is generated with a premium in relation to electrical power. However, compressed air that looks to be safe, could cause major accidents in mines and during the installation. The air receiver is similar to any pressure vessel and requires <b>periodic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>inspection</b> to ensure the accuracy of the vessel and its safety devices. In this paper authors try to elaborate on different circumstances, control and calculations surrounding pressure vessels whilst inspecting, based on division 1 section VIII ASMI standard. The results obtained could be used in all underground mines where compressed air is used as a form of energy...|$|E
40|$|Heavy {{operating}} conditions of mining machines {{as well as}} the high level of dynamic loads lead to reduction of their service life. The quantitative estimation of the machine reliability by one of the feature – service life – has become widely distributed in all the branches of engineering. Technical diagnosis is one of the important methods of improving the reliability in {{operating conditions}}. The diagnostics sub-system should provide for: non-destructive inspection of a technical condition of objects, the definition of sudden and parametric failures of mining machines and their systems, the detection of gradual failures by predicting changes in the monitored parameters, a continuous and <b>periodic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>inspection.</b> The obtained results given in this article prove the possibility of creating a group of common diagnostic criteria suitable for assessing the technical state of reducers of mining machines and equipment, but also being a prerequisite for the effective short-term prediction of the parameters under study when developing adaptive mathematical models...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{photovoltaic}} {{technologies have}} been introduced in Cuba for more than 10 years, the long-term stable operation is still an aspiration. With the setting in operation of the first community photovoltaic electrification system, {{it was possible to}} carry out a systematic study of the factors that determine the loss of quality of the operative state of the systems by means of the detection and classification of failures detected in <b>periodic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>inspections.</b> The data analyzed {{on the basis of the}} medium frequency of failures allowed discovering problems of technology and its social adoption. This analysis leads to the design of a system for maintenance and repair that guarantees the sustainability of the project. The technical characteristics of the equipment that adapts better to the real conditions of exploitation in the country were determined as well. Failures PV systems Rural electrification...|$|R
