2500|$|Real-estate {{brokerage}} {{offers an}} example of a modern American guild system. Signs of guild behavior in real-estate brokerage include: standard pricing (6% of the home price), strong affiliation among all practitioners, self-regulation (see National Association of Realtors), strong cultural identity (see realtor), little <b>price</b> <b>variation</b> with quality differences, and traditional methods in use by all practitioners. In September 2005 the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, challenging NAR practices that (the DOJ asserted) prevent competition from practitioners who use different methods. The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission in 2005 advocated against state laws, supported by NAR, that disadvantage new kinds of brokers. [...] U.S. v.

2500|$|While {{the model}} of an offer {{mirroring}} acceptance makes sense to analyse almost all agreements, it does not fit in some cases. In The Satanita the rules of a yacht race stipulated that the yachtsmen would be liable, beyond limits set in statute, {{to pay for all}} damage to other boats. The Court of Appeal held that there was a contract to pay arising from the rules of the competition between The Satanita's owner and the owner of Valkyrie II, which he sank, even though there was no clear offer mirrored by a clear acceptance between the parties at any point. Along with a number of other critics, in a series of cases Lord Denning MR proposed that English law ought to abandon its rigid attachment to offer and acceptance in favour of a broader rule, that the parties need to be in substantial agreement on the material points in the contract. In Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd this would have meant that during a [...] "battle of forms" [...] two parties were construed as having material agreement on the buyer's standard terms, and excluding a <b>price</b> <b>variation</b> clause, although the other court members reached the same view on ordinary analysis. In Gibson v Manchester CC he would have come to a different result to the House of Lords, by allowing Mr Gibson to buy his house from the council, even though the council's letter stated it [...] "should not be regarded as a firm offer". This approach would potentially give greater discretion to a court to do what appears appropriate at the time, without being tied to what the parties may have subjectively intended, particularly where those intentions obviously conflicted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>price</b> <b>variations</b> in Northern Victorian (Australia) ‘clearinghouse’ auction {{markets for}} temporary water entitlements. The analysis assesses {{the role that}} the excess demand of unsatisfied bids and the market power of large volume bids, have on <b>price</b> <b>variations.</b> For four seasons (2002 / 3 to 05 / 6) and trading in the Greater Goulburn zone, results indicate that the excess demand of unsatisfied bids does significantly explain <b>price</b> <b>variations,</b> with elasticities ranging from 0. 12 to 0. 19. This relationship appears to be a result of the natural equilibrating nature of clearinghouse markets, rather than prices adjusting to previous levels of excess demand. Strategically, this implies that it is the accurate anticipation of demand and supply changes which is likely to be of most benefit to market traders. Market power is also illustrated to potentially impact on <b>price</b> <b>variations,</b> however, its impact appears to have been diminished in more recent seasons. Results suggest that large average demand bids (compared to average supply bids) negatively impact on prices with elasticities from - 0. 04 to - 0. 12. These results suggest that large demanders have demonstrated their ability to time their market bids to reap the rewards of lower market prices. water prices; excess demand; auction markets...|$|R

However, total costs for EDLP are higher in many markets, and it is extremely expensive for retailers to switch strategies. Not only is the initial cost high, but the EDLP strategy must be maintained long enough for consumers to associate lower prices with the brand.|$|E

Another government monopoly over liquor was established in 98 BCE, but the majority consensus at a court conference in 81 BCE led to the breaking up of this monopoly. The mathematician and official Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE), who later became Imperial Counselor and one of many former merchants drafted into the government to help administer these monopolies, was responsible for the 'equable transportation' system that eliminated <b>price</b> <b>variation</b> over time from place to place. This was a government means to interfere in the profitable grain trade by eliminating speculation (since the government stocked up on grain when cheap and sold it to the public at a low price when private merchants demanded higher ones). This along with the monopolies were criticized even during Wu's reign as bringing unnecessary hardships for merchants' profits and farmers forced to rely on poor-quality government-made goods and services; the monopolies and equable transportation did not last into the Eastern Han Era (25-220 CE).|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the validity of the much-used assumptions that stock market returns follow a random walk and are normally distributed. For this purpose the concepts of chaos theory and fractals are applied. Two independent models are used to examine <b>price</b> <b>variations</b> in the Norwegian and US stock markets. The rst model used is the range over standard deviation or R=S statistic which tests for persistence or antipersistence in the time series. Both the Norwegian and US stock markets show signi cant persistence caused by long-run “memory ” components in the series. In addition, an average non-periodic cycle of four years is found for the US stock market. These results are not consistent with the random walk assumption. The second model investigates the distributional scaling behaviour of the high-frequency <b>price</b> <b>variations</b> in the Norwegian stock market. The results show a remarkable constant scaling behaviour between di erent time intervals. This means that there is no intrinsic time scale for the dynamics of stock <b>price</b> <b>variations.</b> The relationship can be expressed through a scaling exponent, describing the development of the distributions as the time scale changes.
