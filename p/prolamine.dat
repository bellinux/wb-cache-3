40|$|The mixed reverse {{solid phase}} passive antiglobulin {{haemadsorption}} test (MRSPAH) and the enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) were found equally sensitive and fitted for {{the measurement of}} serum IgG antibodies against alcohol soluble gliadins. Using the ELISA method, three coeliac sera with elevated antibody titres against gliadins and two control sera with low titres were tested for IgG antibodies against the main groups of wheat proteins (acetic acid soluble glutenins, salt soluble albumins and globulins and alcohol soluble gliadins), eight fractions of gliadin and the alcohol soluble proteins of barley, rye, oat, maize and rice. As rice contained little alcohol soluble protein, a test against acid soluble rice proteins was included. In all three patient sera, titres higher {{than or equal to}} that for crude gliadin were found for wheat glutenin and for gliadin fractions seven and eight, both containing alpha gliadins. Similar high titres were found when these coeliac sera were tested against rye, barley and oat <b>prolamines.</b> Maize <b>prolamines</b> gave only low titres and no antibodies could be detected against rice proteins, in line with the tolerance of these latter two cereals by patients with coeliac disease. It would appear that sera from coeliac patients react with more than one antigenic fraction of protein in wheat and other cereals.

40|$|Background and Aim: In {{the present}} paper, the {{toxicity}} of <b>prolamines</b> derived from three cereals {{with a different}} genome was investigated in human colon cancer Caco- 2 /TC 7 and human myelogenous leukemia K 562 (S) cells. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate if species from ancient wheat could be considered as healthy food crops devoid or poor in cytotoxic <b>prolamines</b> for celiac disease. Methods: Cytotoxicity was measured in terms of inhibition of cell growth, activation of apoptosis, release of nitric oxide (NO), detection of tissue transglutaminase (TG II) and alteration of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) on Caco- 2 /Tc 7 and K 562 (S) cell agglutination. Peptic-tryptic (PT) digest from bread wheat (T. aestivum S. Pastore) was used as a positive control. Results: PT digests of prolamins from spelt wheat (T. aestivum ssp. spelta) were found to exert toxic effects on Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells and to agglutinate K 562 (S) cells. Increased amounts of NO and TG II expression were observed in Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells exposed to 1 mg/mL of spelt prolamins, suggesting that spelt wheat can induce cellular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. By contrast, the PT digests from monoccum wheat (Triticum monococcum) and farro wheat (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum) did not exhibit any negative effects on Caco- 2 /TC 7 and K 562 (S) cells. Conclusions: The results have shown a constant and significant toxic effect of spelt wheat which is not shared by the two other ancient cereals. Future studies on celiac intestinal organ cultures are needed to increase the prospects of breeding programs aimed at developing wheat cultivars potentially tolerated by most celiac patients...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the mRNAs encoding the <b>prolamine</b> and glutelin storage proteins are localized to morphologically distinct membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) complex in developing rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm cells. To gain insight about this mRNA localization process, we investigated the association of <b>prolamine</b> polysomes on the ER that delimit the <b>prolamine</b> protein bodies (PBs). The bulk of the <b>prolamine</b> polysomes were resistant to extraction by 1 % Triton X- 100 either alone or together with puromycin, which suggests that these translation complexes are anchored to the PB surface through a second binding site in addition to the well-characterized ribosome-binding site of the ER-localized protein translocation complex. Suppression of translation initiation shows that these polysomes are bound through the mRNA, as shown by the simultaneous increase in the amounts of ribosome-free <b>prolamine</b> mRNAs and decrease in <b>prolamine</b> polysome content associated with the membrane-stripped PB fraction.

To study the transport of <b>prolamine</b> RNAs {{to the surface of}} the <b>prolamine</b> protein bodies in living endosperm cells, we adapted a two-gene system consisting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the viral RNA binding protein MS 2 and a hybrid <b>prolamine</b> RNA containing tandem MS 2 RNA binding sites.

40|$|By {{screening}} two rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed cDNA libraries, recombinant cDNA clones encoding {{the rice}} <b>prolamine</b> seed storage protein were isolated.

All clones contain a single open reading frame encoding a putative rice <b>prolamine</b> precursor (molecular weight = 17, 200) possessing a typical 14 -amino acid signal peptide. The deduced primary structures of both types of <b>prolamine</b> polypeptides are devoid of repetitive sequences, a feature prevalent in other cereal prolamines. Clones of these two homology classes diverge mainly by insertions/deletions of short nucleotide stretches and point mutations. An isolated genomic clone about 15. 5 kilobases in length displays a highly conserved 2. 5 -kilobase EcoRI fragment, repeated in tandem four times, each containing the <b>prolamine</b> coding sequence. Close homology is exhibited by the coding segments of the genomic and cDNA sequences, although the 5 ′ ends of the untranslated regions are widely divergent.

40|$|The {{ability of}} several cereal {{proteins}} {{to act as}} substrates for transglutaminase purified from guinea pig liver was investigated. Among the various dietary proteins tested, wheat glutelins and gliadins, as well as purified A-gliadin, {{found to be the}} most effective acyl donor substrates for transglutaminase. In particular, these proteins seemed to be able to produce not only γ(glutamyl) spermidine adducts but also polymeric complexes, probably through intermolecular ε(γ-glutamyl) lysine crosslinks. In the case of A-gliadin, the single lysyl residue occurring in the amino sequence (Lys- 186) is supposed to act as acyl acceptor site. The peptic-tryptic fragments of gliadins and <b>prolamines</b> of different origin behaved as transglutaminase substrates similarly to native gliadin, mostly in giving rise large Mr, polymers.

The protein composition was determined, and the molecular weight was estimated through chromatographic analysis using gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 and ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and CM-Sephadex. At least 5 separate protein fractions in each of the albumin and globulin concentrates and 8 separate protein fractions in each of the <b>prolamine</b> and glutelin concentrates were found.

Albumins comprised the main protein fraction in raw seeds, globulins were constituted mainly by vicilin, with a smaller proportion of the glutelin and <b>prolamine</b> fractions. Regarding the amino acid profile of pea protein fractions, although differences among pea cultivars were found, in general albumin, glutelin and <b>prolamine</b> fractions presented Asp, Glu and Gly as the major non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and Lys as the main essential amino acid (EAA). The globulin fraction, however, presented Asp, Glu, Gly and Arg as the major NEAA and Leu, Phe, Lys, and Thr as the main EAA. In general, the albumin fraction accounted for more sulphur amino acids and Lys, followed by the glutelin + <b>prolamine</b> fraction. Germination caused an increase in the total protein content of P. sativum cv. ucero and P. sativum cv. ramrod. In the albumin fraction a wide number of proteins underwent degradation and convicilin disappeared from the globulin fraction of pea sprouts whilst vicilin and legumin decreased slightly. In general, all the Osborne fractions of pea sprouts presented higher EAA contents than raw seeds.

Treatment of Caco- 2 cells with whole gliadin digests extracted from a common wheat cultivar increased the epithelial P 31 - 55 translocation by approximately 35 %. Moreover, we observed an atypical chromatographic profile consisting of a double peak. Chromatography using different column temperatures and circular dichroism highlighted the presence of more conformational structures around the amide bond of the two adjacent prolines 38 and 39. These findings confirm that P 31 - 55 is gastrointestinally resistant and is permeable across a Caco- 2 monolayer. Moreover, we hypothesize that the various conformations of P 31 - 55 {{may play a role in}} the activation of innate immunity...|$|R
40|$|Celiac disease (CD) is an {{autoimmune}} disease, {{induced by}} an immune mediated {{reaction in the}} small intestine after ingestion of gluten and related <b>prolamines.</b> There is a strong genetic linkage and most important are the genes that encodes for HLA-DQ 2 and HLA-DQ 8. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has developed new guidelines for investigation of CD in children and adolescents, which include genotyping for HLA-DQ 2 and HLA-DQ 8. Therefore, the clinical microbiological laboratory in Västmanland wants to introduce a method for analysis of these genes. Microarray is a newly developed method for determination of the alleles HLA-DQA 1 and HLA-DQB 1 that encodes for the α- and β-subunits of the HLA-molecules. The method was verified for accuracy and repeatability, and also two extraction methods were compared. Samples from blood donors and laboratory personnel were analysed for HLA-DQ and tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG), and two families were investigated according to the ESPGHAN guidelines. 48. 3 % of the blood donors were positive for HLA-DQ 2 and/or HLA-DQ 8 and 30. 4 % of the laboratory personnel, were positive for HLA-DQ 2 or HLA-DQ 8. Those who were tested for anti-tTG had no antibody response. Genotyping for HLA-DQ 2 and HLA-DQ 8 is {{a simple way to}} exclude CD, {{but it can also be}} used to confirm diagnosis in patients with symptoms and high anti-tTG levels and thus avoiding a biopsy. The results in the accuracy and repeatability tests showed that the microarray is a reliable method for detection of the HLA-DQ 2 and HLA-DQ 8 genes associated with CD...|$|R
