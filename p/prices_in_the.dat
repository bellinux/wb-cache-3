5|$|In Sydney, fear of an {{impending}} Japanese invasion caused {{people to move}} west; housing <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Suburbs dropped, while those beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly.

30|$|No {{matter whether}} under Strategy 1 or under Strategy 2, <b>the</b> optimal <b>price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first period {{increases}} as α increases or β decreases and <b>the</b> optimal <b>price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second period increases as β increases. These results are intuitive because when snobs are more positively {{sensitive to the}} probability of stockout (more conspicuous), the firm is able to charge a higher <b>price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first period. Similarly, when followers are more negatively sensitive to the probability of stockout (more conservative), the firm should set a lower <b>price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first period and a higher <b>price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second period. An interesting result is that under Strategy 1 <b>the</b> second-period <b>price</b> decreases <b>in</b> α while under Strategy 2 <b>the</b> second-period <b>price</b> increases <b>in</b> α. This can be explained as follows. When Strategy 2 is adopted, the stock-out probability and the fraction of snobs are typically small. The increase of α induces the firm to increase <b>the</b> optimal <b>price</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first period to profit more from snobs. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> firm cares {{a lot about the}} second-period profit from followers. So it is optimal for the firm to increase the second-period price simultaneously but at a relatively smaller pace in order to maintain an appropriate price gap under the condition of Strategy 2.|$|R

5|$|In the 2010s, Russia's economy {{suffered}} from a financial crisis, depressed oil prices, and international sanctions put into place during the Ukrainian crisis. With less disposable income to spend, citizens were forced to take drastic measures.

This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank Beamer star in a video asking Hokies fans to buy tickets to the game. Owing to limited demand for tickets, <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secondary market plunged.|$|E
5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E

5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. They {{used to be}} grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as {{the shape of the}} spines. Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E

Environmental, legal, and political debates followed the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, and the pipeline was built only after the oil crisis provoked the passage of legislation designed to remove legal challenges to the project.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E

5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed <b>prices.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was used}} to {{decrease}} the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market {{until the middle of}} the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race, the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced <b>prices.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Some cotton {{crops in}} the Southeast United States {{received}} needed rainfall from Danny, {{while others were}} harmed, as 100,000 acres of cotton fields in Alabama were too heavily damaged for their crop to be salvaged.

A severe drought had been in place in the Mid-Atlantic region during the month of July.
