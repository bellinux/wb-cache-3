As the driver depresses the accelerator pedal, it acts on a <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> integrated in the pedal bracket. This information, {{in the form of a}} voltage, is connected to the ECM which converts the voltage value to a torque request from the driver.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new design {{to control the}} speed of the automobiles at remote places for fixed time. Generally, in automobiles throttle position is controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) mainly according to the one of the inputs received from the accelerator’s <b>Pedal</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> But in the proposed model, instead of ECU, another Microcontroller unit receives the pedal position from the sensor and then Microcontroller unit transfers to the ECU. The Microcontroller unit is also interfaced with the wireless module that is capable of detecting any other transceiver. Now, the automobile can be controlled at the desired places when we deploy the transmitters that send data frames with fields containing maximum speed and time for which this speed limitation is to be imposed...|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) is an automobile technology which electronically [...] "connects" [...] the accelerator {{pedal to the}} throttle, replacing a mechanical linkage. [...] A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain or engine control module (PCM or ECM). The ECM {{is a type of}} electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required throttle position by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the accelerator <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors,</b> engine speed sensor, vehicle speed sensor, and cruise control switches. The electric motor is then used to open the throttle valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM.|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{and control}} of a hybrid {{electric}} vehicle is presented in this paper. A four wheel drive parallel hybrid electric vehicle is built by assembling an auxiliary electrical machine and battery group. Some preliminary instrumentation such as accelerator pedal, brake, clutch <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> and gear ratio estimation are realized to split torque demand into the two power sources. The first power source is {{the internal combustion engine}} and the second one is the permanent magnet electric motor. A rule-based control strategy is developed by setting transition rules between the two power sources. The control strategy is implemented on a proof-of-concept vehicle and road tested. In order to satisfy smooth transient switching between the two power sources, and in order not to disturb the driver by abrupt or retarded transitions, torque splitting is achieved by taking the power source dynamics and vehicle dynamics in the longitudinal direction into account. The internal combustion engine is not operated at its high emission and low fuel efficient regions. Regenerative braking is implemented to charge the electric motor battery pack during braking. 8 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Physical {{analysis}} {{conducted on}} Toyota’s {{electronic engine control}} system including accelerator <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> (APPSs) in 2011 showed {{the presence of a}} significant number of tin whiskers. Tin whiskers are elongated or needle-like structures of pure tin that grow from pure tin and tin alloy surfaces. Toyota's APPS were found to use tin finishes. These tin finishes can produce conductive tin whiskers capable of creating unintended electrical failures such as short circuits. The use of tin finish in Toyota's APPS is therefore a cause for concern. Similarly in 2013, materials used in an automotive engine control unit (ECU) from a 2008 Toyota Tundra truck were analyzed. It was found that pure tin with a nickel underlayer was used as the connector finish in the unit, and analysis revealed tin whiskers on the connector surface. Further testing under a standard temperature-humidity cycling showed tin whisker growth, raising additional reliability and safety concerns. These studies show that poor design choices, {{such as the use of}} tin finishes, result in unintended failures.|$|R
5000|$|A {{criticism}} of the very early ETC implementations {{was that they were}} [...] "overruling" [...] driver decisions. Nowadays, the vast majority of drivers have no idea how much intervention is happening. Much of the engineering involved with drive-by-wire technologies including ETC deals with failure and fault management.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of the free <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> {{adjustment}} on clutching movements of the left lower limb {{as well as on the}} perceived discomfort. Six automotive clutch pedal configurations were tested by 20 subjects (5 young females, 5 young males, 5 older females, 5 older males) using a multiadjustable experimental mock-up. Results showed that the <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> was adjusted to ensure a good starting <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> allowing a less flexed ankle and avoiding unnecessary leg displacement from the foot rest to the position at start depression. <b>Pedal</b> <b>position</b> adjustment seemed not motivated by reducing joint torque though discomfort ratings were found significantly correlated with knee and ankle torques at the end of depression.

40|$|An {{electronic}} <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> for {{use with}} a power operated vehicle accessory, such as a power liftgate. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> includes an elongated resistive circuit that is mounted such that it is stationary and extends along {{the path of a}} track portion of the power operated accessory. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> further includes a contact nub mounted to a link member that moves within the track portion such that the contact nub is slidingly biased against the elongated circuit. As the link member moves under the force of a motor-driven output gear, the contact nub slides along the surface of the resistive circuit, thereby affecting the overall resistance of the circuit. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> uses the overall resistance to provide an electronic position signal to an ECU, wherein the signal is indicative of the absolute position of the power operated accessory. Accordingly, the electronic <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is capable of providing an electronic signal that enables the ECU to track the absolute position of the power operated accessory...|$|R

50|$|The older {{mechanically}} designed accelerator pedals {{not only}} provided a spring return, but the mechanism inherently provided some friction. This friction introduced mechanical hysteresis into the pedal force versus <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> transfer function. Put more simply, once the pedal {{was set at}} a specific position, the friction would help keep the pedal at this setting. This {{made it easier for}} the driver to maintain a <b>pedal</b> <b>position.</b> For example, if the driver's foot is slightly jostledby a bump in road, the accelerator pedal would tend to stay at its setting. While these old purely mechanical designs did have somefriction, the return spring force was always designed to overcome this friction with a considerable safety margin. The return spring force ensured that throttle returned to zero if the pedal force applied by the driver was reduced or removed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} generate car-following patterns for individual drivers. We assume that driving is a recursive process. A driver recognizes a road envi-ronment such as velocity and following distance and adjusts gas and brake <b>pedal</b> <b>positions.</b> A vehicle status changes according to the driver’s operation and the road environment changes according to the vehicle status. Driving patterns of each driver are modeled with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is trained as a joint probability distribution of following distance, velocity, <b>pedal</b> <b>position</b> signals and their dynamics. Gas and brake pedal operation patterns are generated from the GMMs in a maximum likelihood criterion so that the conditional probability is maximized for a given environment i. e., following distance and velocity. Experimental results for a driving simu-lator show that car-following patterns generated from GMMs for three different drivers maintain their individual driving characteristics. I...|$|R
