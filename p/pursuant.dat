5|$|A: In {{those days}} the American {{government}} {{had changed the}} name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico, <b>pursuant</b> to the Act of May 17, 1932.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Gazette Notification No. 179 of 1972 ("Order 179") by the Minister for Home Affairs {{ordered the}} {{dissolution}} of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses <b>pursuant</b> to his powers under section 24(1) of the Societies Act ("SA").|$|E
5|$|The Norse-American medal {{was struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint in 1925, <b>pursuant</b> to {{an act of}} the United States Congress. It was issued for the 100th anniversary of the voyage of the ship Restauration, {{bringing}} early Norwegian immigrants to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} inconsistencies {{the subjective}} test had {{with respect to}} Articles12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved {{with the passing of}} the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted <b>pursuant</b> to this provision from inconsistency with Articles11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article149(3) provided that nothing in Article93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted <b>pursuant</b> to Article149. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and the subjective test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|After Austria-Hungary {{occupied}} Bosnia and Herzegovina {{following the}} 1878 Treaty of Berlin, the Croatian Military Frontier was abolished and the territory returned to Croatia in 1881, <b>pursuant</b> to {{provisions of the}} Croatian-Hungarian settlement. Renewed efforts to reform Austria-Hungary, entailing federalisation with Croatia as a federal unit, were stopped by advent of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Article X {{establishes}} {{the basic structure}} for taxation of personal property in Virginia. <b>Pursuant</b> to this Article, all non-exempt real and personal property is subject to taxation at its fair market value. Section 6 sets out a lengthy list of exempt property, which includes church property, cemeteries, and non-profit school property.|$|E
5|$|Bent on {{securing}} Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian {{government made}} it publicly known on 19 June that, <b>pursuant</b> to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action. Wilson and his Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Arthur Bottomley, were occupied at Chequers, the official country {{residence of the}} British Prime Minister, where they were entertaining the Commonwealth heads of state.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College {{as their}} sole land grant college. <b>Pursuant</b> to the Morrill Act of 1862, this {{designation}} gave federal lands {{to the state}} that the state could then sell {{to raise money to}} develop practical education in agriculture, science, military science and engineering.|$|E
5|$|In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994), the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses by Order No. 179/1972 made <b>pursuant</b> {{to section}} 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act. This {{provision}} {{allows for the}} dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to public peace, welfare or good order. The Minister had also made Order No. 123/1972 and Order No. 405/1994 <b>pursuant</b> to section 3(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act, prohibiting publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications. They appealed and sought to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} Minister's prohibition order and the deregistration of the Jehovah's Witnesses, arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parenting}} schedules {{for joint}} physical custody provide for a more equal time share between parents. For example, parents may choose a form of alternating custody, <b>pursuant</b> to which the children live {{for a period of}} time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1777, {{following}} {{months of}} preparation and some preliminary maneuvers in New Jersey, General Howe and his brother, Admiral Richard Howe, launched a fleet carrying {{most of the}} New York-based army south <b>pursuant</b> to their plan to capture the American capital, Philadelphia, by landing the army at {{the upper end of}} Chesapeake Bay and marching north.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pursuant</b> to this apportionment, the {{constituencies}} are formed. In six EU {{member states}} (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom), {{the national territory}} is divided {{into a number of}} constituencies. In the remaining member states, the whole country forms a single constituency. All member states hold elections to the European Parliament using various forms of proportional representation.|$|E
5|$|Services {{were held}} at the National Cathedral, and over 1,000 persons attended. <b>Pursuant</b> to Justice Black’s wishes, the coffin was “simple and cheap” and was {{displayed}} at the service {{to show that the}} costs of burial are not reflective of the worth of the human whose remains were present.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} in one Ontario riding, Wellington South was postponed <b>pursuant</b> to statute {{after the death}} of the Liberal candidate and MP, Henry Alfred Hosking during the campaign. The Tory candidate, Alfred Hales, defeated Liberal David Tolton and CCF candidate Thomas Withers on July 15, 1957.|$|E
5|$|UBS is a joint-stock company ("Aktiengesellschaft") <b>pursuant</b> to Swiss laws. Its {{shares are}} listed at the SIX Swiss Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As of February 2015, UBS {{is present in}} all major {{financial}} centers worldwide, having offices in 54 countries, with about 34% of its approx. 59,000 employees working in the Americas, 36% in Switzerland, 18% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 13% in the Asia Pacific region.|$|E
5|$|Upon McGill's {{death in}} December 1813, the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning, {{established}} in 1801 by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, added the establishing of a University <b>pursuant</b> {{to the conditions}} of McGill's will to its original function of administering elementary education in Lower Canada.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie sent militia Major George Washington to the Ohio Country (a {{territory}} that was claimed by {{several of the}} British colonies, including Virginia) as an emissary in December 1753, to tell the French to leave. Saint-Pierre politely informed Washington {{that he was there}} <b>pursuant</b> to orders, that Washington's letter should have been addressed to his commanding officer in Canada, and that {{he had no intention of}} leaving.|$|E
5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed <b>pursuant</b> to the Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was buried}} beside {{her husband and}} {{children}} in the Henry VII Chapel on the South Aisle of Westminster Abbey on 24 August. The Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, two months before Anne, so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, inherited the British Crown <b>pursuant</b> to the Act of Settlement 1701. The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne's half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, were ignored. The Elector's accession was relatively stable: a Jacobite rising in 1715 failed. Marlborough was re-instated, and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Article 12(2) {{is subject}} to an express {{contrary}} authorization by the Constitution. Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure {{that members of the}} Malay, Indian and other minority communities are represented in Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates, at least one of whom must be from a minority community. Article 39A(3) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament <b>pursuant</b> to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(3) {{provides}} {{that the right}} to form associations may also be restricted by any law relating to labour or education. The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created <b>pursuant</b> to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Toronto FC {{games are}} {{exclusively}} broadcast by TSN, with certain games (typically against other Canadian MLS franchises) also shown on CTV. Prior to 2017, Toronto FC games were broadcast exclusively by TSN and Sportsnet. Games {{that were not}} covered under national broadcast contracts with MLS or other competition organizers were divided evenly between the two broadcasters, <b>pursuant</b> to agreements between their parent companies (Bell Canada and Rogers Communications respectively) in connection to their joint 2011 purchase of MLSE.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal <b>pursuant</b> to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|Experimental high-definition {{television}} (HDTV) broadcasting {{began in}} Zagreb in March 2007; it was expanded to Split, Rijeka and Osijek in 2008. Experimental HDTV broadcasting ended in February 2011. There were two experimental HDTV channels, operated by Croatian Radiotelevision and Nova TV. <b>Pursuant</b> to the digital television switchover {{developed by the}} Government of Croatia, broadcasting of DVB-T HDTV channels was conducted in MPEG-4. On 11 October 2011 experimental DVB-T2 broadcasting began in Zagreb, using H.264/MPEG-4 AVC coding and a conditional access system.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{in favour}} of Croatia's {{preservation}} of its pre-war borders were the Yugoslav Federal Constitution Amendments of 1971, and the Yugoslav Federal Constitution of 1974. The 1971 amendments introduced a concept that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The 1974 Constitution confirmed and strengthened the principles introduced in 1971. The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, <b>pursuant</b> to decisions of AVNOJ in 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organization of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|French and Indian raids had resumed in {{the years}} {{following}} Phips' 1690 expeditions, so he sought to improve the province's defenses. <b>Pursuant</b> to his instructions from London, in 1692 he oversaw the construction of a stone fort, which was dubbed Fort William Henry, at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine), where a wooden fort had been destroyed in 1689. He recruited Major Benjamin Church to lead a 450-man expedition eventually leading to a tenuous peace agreement with the Abenaki people.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's Basic Law, {{implemented}} in the territory on 1 July 1997, consists of outstanding articles which require bill adoption by the Legislative Council before becoming effective laws. Two {{of the most prominent}} articles include Article 23 ("National Security") and universal suffrage of Chief Executive elections. In 2002, the government's motion of an anti-subversion bill <b>pursuant</b> to Article 23, was met with fierce opposition and eventually dropped. Reform bills on universal suffrage, however, have made partial progress in expanding the Chief Executive election's committee (from 600 to 800 in 2007 and to 1,200 selected members in 2012) and the Legislative Council (from 60 to 70 seats). These additional 10 seats are created through directly elected members of District Offices.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. <b>Pursuant</b> to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Congress {{approved}} {{a bill that}} required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars. When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904, the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar. The Pittman Act, passed in 1918, authorized the melting and recoining of millions of silver dollars. <b>Pursuant</b> to the act, Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921. The design {{was replaced by the}} Peace dollar later the same year.|$|E
5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties {{for a longer period of}} time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty <b>pursuant</b> to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} foil any {{plans for a}} coup d'état, the {{president}} {{took control of the}} military and police, reducing their numbers from 5,300 to 3,500. Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that, <b>pursuant</b> to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961, were stationed at Port-Bouët and could intervene at Houphouët-Boigny's request or when they considered French interests to be threatened. They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an unauthorised political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing to secede.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the protest, the JNA {{increased}} combat readiness of its garrison in Split and elsewhere in Dalmatia and withdrew a part of artillery and personnel from Split to its bases located away from the coast. Furthermore, the Military-Maritime District of the JNA ordered its garrisons to stock up potable water and prepare power generators for use if the supply of electricity were cut. The JNA evacuated itself from Split by 4 January 1992, <b>pursuant</b> to agreements ending the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E
5|$|Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian {{denomination}} {{whose members}} refuse {{to engage in}} any political or national practices, such as saluting the flag or performing national service. This was deemed prejudicial to the public welfare and good order of Singapore, and on 14 January 1972 the Government issued two orders {{to deal with the}} perceived threat to public order. First, Gazette Notification No. 123 of 1972 ("Order 123") was issued by the Minister for Culture <b>pursuant</b> to section 3 of the Undesirable Publications Act ("UPA") to ban works published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society ("WTBTS"), the primary corporation used by Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pursuant</b> to the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy {{the islands}} of Cres, Lastovo and Palagruža and the cities of Zadar and Rijeka and most of Istria went to {{communist}} Yugoslavia and Croatia, while carving out the Free Territory of Trieste (FTT) as a city-state. The FTT was partitioned in 1954 as Trieste itself and the area {{to the north of}} it were placed under Italian control, and the rest under Yugoslav control. The arrangement was made permanent by the Treaty of Osimo in 1975. The former FTT's Yugoslav part was partitioned between Croatia and Slovenia, largely conforming to the area population's ethnic composition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pursuant</b> to the Local Government Code of 1991, the Banton {{municipal}} government {{is composed of}} a mayor (alkalde), a vice mayor (bise alkalde) and eight members (kagawad) of the Sangguniang Bayan or town council, alongside a secretary to the said council, {{all of which are}} elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms. Banton's incumbent mayor is Joseph Fadri of the Liberal Party while the incumbent Vice Mayor is Loijorge Fegalan of the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
