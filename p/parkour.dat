5|$|The video {{featured}} the physical discipline <b>parkour,</b> in which <b>parkour</b> artist Sébastien Foucan performed routines around the buildings of Tokyo. The video begins showing the Tokyo skyline and <b>parkour</b> artists standing on rooftops. As the spoken introduction starts, Madonna {{is shown in}} her wig dancing {{in front of a}} number of neon signs which contain the words Madonna and Jump in Japanese. The song continues with the dancers jumping from buildings and running through the lanes of the city. Madonna dances to the music and swivels around metallic rods in and around her, of the same design present in her tour. Before the final chorus, the dancers cease their <b>parkour</b> routines and stand on a lamppost.|$|E
5|$|A former FBI agent turned criminal. He is in a {{relationship}} with Mia Toretto. Walker did many of his own stunts for the film, training with <b>parkour</b> professional Paul Darnell to improve his movement.|$|E
5|$|Hennigan has {{a passion}} for <b>parkour</b> and {{frequently}} incorporates it into his wrestling style and cites Shawn Michaels, Randy Savage, and Curt Hennig as his favorite wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|Ingels {{was cast}} in My Playground, a {{documentary}} film by Kaspar Astrup Schröder that explores <b>parkour</b> and freerunning, {{with much of the}} action taking place on and around BIG projects.|$|E
5|$|A free weekly parkrun {{takes place}} in the centre of Shrewsbury. The event is {{attended}} by over 250 runners every week and is 'twinned' with Darwin parkrun in Northern Territory, Australia due to the city of Darwin being named after Charles Darwin. Shrewsbury has also seen activity in the physical discipline, <b>Parkour.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mobile phone}} port {{includes}} many <b>parkour</b> {{moves from the}} PC and console versions, however, the perspective is shifted from first person to third person. The game does not feature cutscenes, and the plot is explained with scrolling text in between levels. The iOS version has since {{been removed from the}} app store due to problems with the game on iOS 8.|$|E
5|$|DSi launch {{events were}} {{held on the}} western and eastern coasts of the United States. Nintendo {{sponsored}} an official launch event at the Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles and the Nintendo World Store in New York City. The LA midnight launch party featured several events, including merchandise handouts, signings and art galleries from iam8bit, <b>parkour</b> demonstrations, and performances by Gym Class Heroes. Hundreds attended and over 150 stayed until midnight to purchase a unit at GameStop. A human-sized Lego DSi by artist Sean Kenney was {{on display at the}} Nintendo World Store.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Tokyo during Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour stopover. It portrayed Madonna in a blond bob wig and a leather ensemble singing the song {{in front of a}} number of neon signs. The video also featured dancers who performed the physical discipline <b>parkour.</b> It was also incorporated in her Confessions Tour, where Madonna and her dancers jumped around the stage actively, while singing the song. The song was used in the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2005) and the Ugly Betty season 2 finale.|$|E
5|$|Mirror's Edge {{is set in}} a quasi-futuristic dystopian society, {{in which}} a network of 'runners', {{including}} the main character, Faith Connors, act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, through ventilation shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by <b>parkour.</b> The game has a brightly colored style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment. This allows for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{is a tribute}} to John Travolta, his movies and to dancing in general. Directed by Johan Renck, the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink leotard dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people {{displaying}} their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. It also features the physical discipline <b>Parkour.</b> Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the finale number in 2006's Confessions Tour, a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour and during the 2012 MDNA Tour where the singer performed the song while slacklining.|$|E
5|$|Major interplanetary {{corporations}} {{known as}} Hammond Robotics—a major manufacturing, aerospace and defense contractor—used {{resources of the}} Frontier to make builds of mecha-combatants such as Titans and Spectres. Titans are descendants of present-day fledgling military exoskeletons. In addition to the obvious combat applications, unarmed forms of Titans are used in heavy industries like cargo transport and deep space ship salvage. They are also used in special applications such as deep space search and rescue, and are very effective in inhospitable environments. The use of Titans is widespread throughout the Frontier in both combat and civilian life. As with Titans, the Frontier contains Pilots of many different styles and experiences. Titan Pilots are rated by 'certifications', most of which apply to civilian applications, such as construction, shipping, and heavy salvage industries. The most prestigious {{of these is the}} Full Combat Certification - a widely published series of tests that grade a Titan Pilot's abilities. Because of the extreme physical and mental challenges of mastering both Titan combat & dismounted <b>parkour</b> movement, a fully combat certified Titan pilot is a rare find, and the combat skills of active Pilots in the field varies widely throughout the Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and <b>parkour</b> in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area {{more than twice as}} large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to <b>parkour</b> around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an open world environment with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system {{which can be}} seamlessly explored. The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed with the employment of <b>parkour,</b> which is aided {{by the use of}} zip-lines installed throughout the world. Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with more aggression. To uncover more of the map, one must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks. Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-playable characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World; metal flowers, which when acquired contain poetry; and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artefacts.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{coming to a}} ballet studio {{carrying}} a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges {{with a group of}} people on the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline <b>Parkour,</b> while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a Dance Dance Revolution machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor. The video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform <b>parkour</b> feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E
25|$|International <b>parkour</b> organisations {{include the}} Mouvement International du <b>Parkour,</b> Freerunning et l'Art du Déplacement, the Fédération Internationale des Arts Du Déplacement, the International <b>Parkour</b> Federation, the World Freerunning and <b>Parkour</b> Federation, and <b>Parkour</b> Earth.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>parkour</b> itself {{grew out}} of {{military}} obstacle-course training, {{it has become a}} separate discipline. After the attention that <b>parkour</b> received following the 2006 film Casino Royale, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from <b>parkour</b> into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Marines trained with <b>parkour</b> practitioners with hopes of introducing some of their techniques to his own students. Colorado <b>Parkour</b> began a project to introduce elements from <b>parkour</b> into the U.S. military and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in <b>parkour.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of <b>parkour</b> show-reels and documentaries {{has always been}} crucial {{to the spread of}} <b>parkour,</b> and is common in the <b>parkour</b> community. Jump London is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of <b>parkour,</b> culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their <b>parkour</b> skills. Jump London changed the presence of <b>parkour</b> in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs. It was followed by Jump Britain in 2005. The Australian version of 60 Minutes broadcast a segment about <b>parkour</b> on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parkour</b> - Developed in France, <b>Parkour</b> is a {{training}} discipline with similarities to self-defense or martial arts.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{video games}} {{frequently}} include aspects of <b>parkour</b> as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of <b>parkour</b> movement (called freerunning in the game). The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by <b>parkour,</b> consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles. Brink introduced a <b>parkour</b> mechanic into a realistic first person shooter. Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central <b>parkour</b> mechanic, while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include {{an emphasis on}} gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects. Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard. Tron Evolutions basic movements and combat were based on <b>parkour</b> and capoeira.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parkour</b> is {{not defined}} {{by a set of}} rules or guidelines, which has been {{particularly}} attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation. For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the <b>parkour</b> community. In 2014, the BBC covered youth <b>parkour</b> participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and <b>Parkour</b> Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of <b>parkour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Academic {{research}} on <b>parkour</b> {{has tended to}} describe how <b>parkour</b> provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.|$|E
25|$|David Belle (1973), {{creator of}} <b>Parkour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both <b>parkour</b> and {{freerunning}} {{encompass the}} ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression. Although {{the differences between the}} disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to <b>parkour</b> and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.|$|E
25|$|Champion freerunner Timothy Shieff trained Page in <b>parkour.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Parkour</b> is {{not widely}} practiced in {{dedicated}} public facilities. Although efforts {{are being made}} to create places for it, many traceurs {{do not like the}} idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom. Traceurs practice <b>parkour</b> in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property, and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries. Many <b>parkour</b> organizations around the globe support the Leave No Trace initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit <b>Parkour</b> Visions in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parkour</b> is an {{activity}} that can be practised alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though can be done anywhere. <b>Parkour</b> involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.|$|E
25|$|MTV's show Ultimate <b>Parkour</b> Challenge premiered as {{a one-hour}} special in October 2009 {{starring}} the athletes of the World Freerunning & <b>Parkour</b> Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode {{series of the}} same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{featured}} in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, <b>parkour</b> {{was first introduced}} to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, {{in an attempt to}} catch his favourite BBC programme, and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used. This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of <b>parkour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Joe Taslim as Jah, {{a member}} of Shaw's team who is cold-blooded and skilled with martial arts and <b>parkour</b> during his fight with Han and Roman.|$|E
25|$|Actor Stephen Amell learned <b>parkour</b> at Tempest Academy in {{preparation}} {{for his role as}} Oliver Queen in the television series Arrow. One of his co-stars on Arrow, Caity Lotz, is also a practitioner.|$|E
25|$|Dying Light is a first-person zombie apocalypse-themed game set {{in an open}} world. Players {{traverse}} {{an expansive}} urban environment overrun by a vicious epidemic, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population with a heavy focus on <b>parkour</b> mechanics, allowing players to perform actions such as climbing ledges, leaping off from edges, sliding, jumping from roofs to roofs and zip-lining. <b>Parkour</b> mechanics also applied on combat. Players can perform action such as drop-kicking when engaging combat with enemies. A grappling hook is also featured in the game, allowing players to climb up buildings and travel between places quickly.|$|E
25|$|A jam {{refers to}} a meeting of traceurs, {{involving}} training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first <b>parkour</b> jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.|$|E
25|$|Bathurst, {{with its}} young demographic, has {{established}} modern sporting competitions {{such as the}} Newtons Nation event. At this event, held at Mount Panorama, young people can participate in modern sports such as BMX Dirt Bikes, Mountain Bikes, Wakeboarding, <b>Parkour,</b> Flatland BMX, Krumping, Skateboarding, and Luge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parkour</b> was {{developed}} in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s. The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.|$|E
