30|$|Although <b>pastoralists</b> gain {{customary}} rights over campsites after {{two or three}} years of consecutive seasonal occupation, these rights do not give <b>pastoralists</b> exclusive access over the common-pool grazing resources surrounding the campsite. Thus, access to grazing lands is open, even when <b>pastoralists</b> have {{customary rights}} to campsites within these grazing lands. No one is obliged to ask for permission from traditional or governmental authorities or other <b>pastoralists</b> to set up camp near established campsites. This applies to all <b>pastoralists,</b> including newcomers from other groups or countries. <b>Pastoralists</b> may ask fellow <b>pastoralists</b> whether they can set up camp close by, but this request cannot be refused. Moreover, many <b>pastoralists</b> do not ask out of principle or inform their neighbours about site decisions, not even when they set up camp 250 m from another campsite. These rules are not limited to the floodplain; they also apply to the rainy season grazing areas in the Diamaré.|$|R
5000|$|Pastoralism {{plays an}} {{important}} role in livestock management and food security, since <b>pastoralists</b> can produce food where no crops can grow. This system usually relies entirely on publicly-owned grasslands. <b>Pastoralists</b> move their livestock herds based on the season, which is also known as transhumance. Nomadic <b>pastoralists</b> follow an irregular pattern of movement. Current issues that <b>pastoralists</b> face include conflict over land rights, access to water, limited food resources, integration into global markets, and animal diseases. Climate change has been believed to have a negative impact on <b>pastoralists,</b> but evidence suggests that the root causes of land disputes are historical and political, rather than climate-related. [...] Land rights are an issue for <b>pastoralists,</b> as many governments and organizations, including conservation efforts may restrict their access to valuable resources and land.|$|R
30|$|The {{implementation}} of the PFPA at national level {{is expected to be}} participatory.

Any pastoral intervention package that fails to carry along the <b>pastoralists</b> in both planning and implementation is bound to fail, if not suitable to local factors which only the <b>pastoralists</b> could detect and adapt to appropriately.|$|R

5|$|During colonial times, {{prior to}} the {{establishment}} of the ACT, the European communities of Ginninderra, Molonglo and Tuggeranong settled in and farmed the surrounding land, raising sheep in the main but also breeding horses and growing grain. The region was also called the Queanbeyan/Yass district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities. In 1882, the first allotments in the village of Hall – named after early <b>pastoralist</b> Henry Hall – were sold. By 1901, it was an established town with a hotel, coachbuilder, blacksmith, butcher, shoemaker, saddler, dairy and two stores.|$|E

Instead, he joined the Queensland Reinforcements Referendum Committee, of which he became president. He remained active as a <b>pastoralist</b> and businessman until his retirement in 1920, at which time he moved to England. In 1921, he moved to Howletts, his parents' former home in Bekesbourne, Kent, and remained there until he died on 25 June 1957.|$|E
30|$|Mobility, {{dictated}} {{by the presence of}} grass and water, is very essential in pastoralism; thus, opportunistic movement of the <b>pastoralists</b> in search of these vital resources has always been its main feature. In the past, the major constraint to transhumant <b>pastoralists</b> was environmental such as the incidence of tsetse fly. Thus, as the <b>pastoralists</b> moved to the grass-rich humid south, the only fear was that of trypanosome and other related diseases. These days, the situation is further compounded by growing ethnic intolerance and violence, often with the <b>pastoralists</b> at the receiving end, and therefore, herd mobility is constrained. In the arid northern part of the country, there are sporadic farmer-herder clashes, while in the humid middle belt and south, the situation is catastrophic leading to forced evictions from gazetted rangelands, ethnic cleansing and genocide against the <b>pastoralists.</b> Recently, atrocities against the <b>pastoralists</b> have taken another dimension as there are reported cases of several illegal evictions of the <b>pastoralists</b> from rangelands and some territories by one of the state governments purely on ethnic grounds ([Agbese and Lalo 2009]; [V.O.A 2009]).|$|R

As {{a student}} in the 1960 s, I read some of the now classic studies of East and West African cattle and camel <b>pastoralists</b> and North Asian reindeer <b>pastoralists,</b> but I am not familiar with the recent work on these regions - represented in this book. On the other hand, the contributors to the book appear to have little or no familiarity with <b>pastoralists</b> in the vast region that is more familiar to me and within which I have done fieldwork: the mixed (mainly sheep and goat) <b>pastoralists</b> of mountainous southwest Asia (Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan) and the camel and small stock <b>pastoralists</b> of the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East.|$|R

The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin <b>pastoralist</b> tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Wentworth Wills (19 August 1835– 2 May 1880) was a sportsman who is {{credited}} with being Australia's first cricketer of significance and a founder of Australian rules football.

He befriended local Aborigines, learning their language and customs. At the age of 14, Wills was sent to England to attend Rugby School, where he became captain of its cricket team, and played an early version of rugby football. After Rugby, Wills represented the Cambridge University Cricket Club in the annual match against Oxford, and played at first-class level for Kent and the Marylebone Cricket Club.

5|$|Robert Christian Ramsay {{was born}} in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on 20 December 1861 as the sixth child and fourth son of Robert Burnett Ramsay and Susan, née Lindsay Carnegie. Three of his elder {{siblings}} died in very early childhood {{and his older brother}} Alfred died from appendicitis in 1874 when only 15 years old. Apart from spending five years as a director of mercantile firm Ramsay, Young & Co. in Sydney between 1839 and 1844, Robert Ramsay's father was a <b>pastoralist</b> and politician in Queensland who served as the eighth treasurer of Queensland. Bob Ramsay was at school in Warwick and then briefly at Ipswich Grammar School in Queensland, Australia until the family moved to England in March 1874. He then attended Elstree School and Harrow School. At Harrow, {{he was part of the}} football team in 1878 and 1879, captaining the side in the latter year. He also played for the school's cricket team, alongside his older brother Marmaduke Francis Ramsay, better known as Frank. In 1879, the brothers combined to take seventeen of Eton College's twenty wickets, of which Robert claimed six in the first innings and four in the second.|$|E

5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} <b>pastoralist</b> zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single hollowed out log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. Salt production was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged in trading with European seafarers, exchanging tortoiseshell for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers. More highly educated community members, particularly among the noble class, work in salaried positions as government officials, teachers {{and a variety of other}} trades and professions. The SIRAMA national sugar company factories are located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E

30|$|We have {{referred}} to this system as management of open access (Moritz et al. 2013 a), which we argue is not an oxymoron because there are clear rules about who {{has access to the}} common-pool grazing resources (all <b>pastoralists)</b> and who can be excluded (no one). The rules are reaffirmed in everyday practice every time <b>pastoralists</b> set up camps in new sites without asking. The ethos and practice of open access is a form of everyday management that regulates the use of common-pool resources in that there are two important outcomes: the emergence of an ideal-free-like distribution of mobile <b>pastoralists</b> in which the distribution of grazing pressure matches the distribution of grazing resources (Moritz et al. 2013 b; Moritz et al. 2013 c) and the lack of major conflict among <b>pastoralists</b> (Scholte et al. 2006). These outcomes require the everyday commitment of <b>pastoralists</b> to the ethos and practice of open access. <b>Pastoralists</b> themselves talk about open access not in terms of an absence of rules but in terms of rights for all. Moreover, these rules are meaningful to mobile <b>pastoralists</b> - without access to common-pool grazing resources, they cannot survive in this semi-arid environment (Moritz et al. 2013 a).|$|R

30|$|Pastoralism, as a livelihood, {{is coming}} under {{increased}} pressure across Africa, due to changing social, economic, political and environmental conditions. Prior to the 1950 s, {{a symbiotic relationship}} existed between <b>pastoralists,</b> crop farmers and their environment with <b>pastoralists</b> practising transhumance. During the dry season, <b>pastoralists</b> migrated to the southern parts of the Guinea savannah zone, where there was ample pasture and a lower density of crop farmers. In the wet season, these areas faced high challenge from African animal trypanosomiasis transmitted by tsetse flies, so <b>pastoralists</b> would migrate to visit farmlands within the northern Sudan savannah zone, supplying dairy products to the local farming community. Reciprocally, the farming community supplied <b>pastoralists</b> with grain, and after the harvest, cattle were permitted to graze on crop residues in fields leaving behind valuable manure.|$|R

30|$|Local organisations like CARPA, FEB and the Observatoire du Pastoralisme dans l'Extrême-Nord are {{focusing}} {{their efforts on}} educating stakeholders and other authorities about pastoral systems {{and the importance of}} mobility, developing and promoting new laws and policies for sustainable management of pastoral resources. In addition, they encourage the participation of <b>pastoralists</b> in the management of pastoral resources and infrastructure. The limitations of the current approach are that it is primarily driven by the organisations that work on behalf of mobile <b>pastoralists.</b> <b>Pastoralists</b> attend the process, but they are not taking an active role. One of the main reasons is that very few mobile <b>pastoralists</b> in the far north region have any formal education. They do not speak the official languages (French, English) and do not have a good understanding of the laws and bureaucratic processes. The situation in the far north {{is very different from the}} northwest of Cameroon, which has a long tradition of <b>pastoralists</b> receiving formal education and <b>pastoralists</b> organising themselves in advocacy groups like the Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association (Davis 1995; Pelican 2008). The problem is not limited to <b>pastoralists</b> attending the process; farmers were also not well represented and implicated in the process of delimiting the corridors. We observed heated discussions between farmers and the authorities during their visits to the field as the former felt excluded from the process (Bebisse 2011). The limited involvement of both <b>pastoralists</b> and farmers in the process has implications for the sustainability of the existing infrastructures.|$|R
