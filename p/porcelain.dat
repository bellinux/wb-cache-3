5|$|Porcelain: Although glazed {{ceramics}} existed beforehand, {{the author}} and historian Samuel Adrian M Adshead writes that the earliest type of vitrified, translucent ceramics that {{could be classified as}} true <b>porcelain</b> was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The archaeologist Nigel Wood of the University of Oxford states that true <b>porcelain</b> was manufactured in northern China from roughly the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true <b>porcelain</b> was not manufactured in southern China until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{period was}} also renowned for {{ceramics}} and porcelains.The major production centers for <b>porcelain</b> were the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province and Dehua in Fujian province. The Dehua <b>porcelain</b> factories catered to European tastes by creating Chinese export <b>porcelain</b> by the 16th century. Individual potters also became known, such as He Chaozong, who became {{famous in the}} early 17th century for his style of white <b>porcelain</b> sculpture. In The Ceramic Trade in Asia, Chuimei Ho estimates that about 16% of late Ming era Chinese ceramic exports were sent to Europe, while the rest were destined for Japan and South East Asia.|$|E

40|$|Leucite {{is a major}} {{crystalline}} {{component of}} dental <b>porcelains.</b> The presence of tetragonal leucite in dental <b>porcelains</b> increases their coefficients of thermal expansion due to its high {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (20 – 25 × 10 − 6 /°C). This is particularly useful for those <b>porcelains</b> designed for bonding to precious metals and nickel alloys. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the leucite content of selected commercial dental <b>porcelains</b> in relation to their coefficient of thermal expansion values. The weight fraction of leucite was determined with quantitative x-ray diffraction using copper as an internal standard. Coefficient of thermal expansion values were determined using a thermal dilatometric analyzer. Five commercial body <b>porcelains</b> were studied. Leucite was not detected in samples of Vitadur N and Duceram LFC. An ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in the weight fraction of leucite for Silhouette, Ceramco II, and Optec HSP <b>porcelains.</b> Linear regression revealed a correlation (R = 0. 91) between weight fraction of leucite and the coefficient of thermal expansion for those samples containing leucite. Ducram LFC, which is recommended by the manufacturer for use with metals and leucite-containing <b>porcelains,</b> had no detectable leucite although the coefficient of thermal expansion was found to be 13. 2 ± 0. 4 × 10 − 6 /°C at 25 – 472 °C. A low glass transition temperature contributed to the high average coefficient of thermal expansion value. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

50|$|When Francesco died, {{his younger}} brother Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici {{inherited}} the position of Grand Duke. Ferdinando brought his prized Chinese and Medici <b>porcelains</b> back with him to Florence from the Villa Medici in Rome, along with his paintings and treasured Roman antiquities. But with the ubiquity of European soft-paste and hard-paste <b>porcelains</b> in the eighteenth century, the Medici heirs in the House of Lorraine came to value less and less the imperfect Medici <b>porcelains,</b> with their minute firing cracks and bubbled glazes. In 1772 an auction in the Palazzo Vecchio of objects from storage dispersed the Medici <b>porcelains</b> conserved in Tuscany. The venture disappeared from history until interest revived after the mid-nineteenth century. The 1588 inventory drawn up after Francesco's death listed 310 pieces. Today only some sixty or seventy pieces are known to survive.|$|R

5|$|The Chinese of the Tang period {{employed}} complex chemical formulas for {{an array}} of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a waterproof and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, fireproof cement for glass and <b>porcelain</b> wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as <b>porcelain</b> was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.|$|E

50|$|All {{production}} of Kenton Hills <b>Porcelains</b> {{was brought to}} a halt in early 1943 when the kilns were last fired. They were only sporadically fired in 1942. Seyler had enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1942 and Bopp left for a job with Corning Glass that same year. Dawson and Reichardt {{went to work for the}} war defense industry. Hentschel returned to the Cincinnati Art Academy full-time. The Kenton Hills <b>Porcelains</b> production facility, including the kilns, was leased to the U.S. Army for storage of defense materials. Following the war, the facility was found to be in great disrepair and the kilns were contaminated. Despite all of these setbacks, Rosemary Dickman Seyler was able to keep the Kenton Hills <b>Porcelains</b> salesroom open into 1944.|$|R
5|$|After the British {{settlement}} at Sydney Cove {{was established}} in 1788, {{a significant part of}} the Chinese <b>porcelain</b> shipped to Australia came via British traders living in India. Operating under licences issued by the British East India Company, who held a commercial monopoly in the Far East, this trade was known as the 'Country Trade', the Indian ships were called 'Country Ships' and their captains 'Country Captains'. Examination of the cargo of ships wrecked during the early colonisation of Australia show that the Country Trade played an important role in getting supplies, including Chinese <b>porcelain</b> traded via India often in Indian-built vessels, to the early Australian colonies.|$|E

Mixtures of dental <b>porcelains</b> were tested to duplicate the range of human tooth colors. Vertical movements in the yellow and blue directions were obtained. Horizontal movements in the red and green directions were achieved. Reflectance measurements were made with use of a spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Spectrophotometer measurements were converted to absolute reflectance and then used to calculate CIE a* b* values for a 2 ° standard observer and for illuminant C. Movements in the yellow, red, blue, and green directions for adequate simulation of the tooth color range can be demonstrated with use of dental opaque and modifier <b>porcelains...</b>|$|R

30|$|In α-quartz a {{well-defined}} structure {{results in a}} strong, sharp Raman band, the SiO 2 bending mode of A 1 g symmetry at 464  cm− 1. This broadens in fused silica and shifts to higher wavenumber when submitted to mechanical stress. A useful parameter for glazed <b>porcelains</b> is the degree of polymerisation (DP) which {{can be obtained from}} the relative band intensities of the broad envelopes at 500 and 1000  cm− 1; this has been elegantly summarised by Colomban and co-workers [7, 8, 13]. In general, the A 500 :A 1000 band intensity ratio is in the range of 0.8 – 1.1 for soft-paste <b>porcelains</b> which have been fired between 800 – 900  °C and 1.5 – 7.0 for hard paste <b>porcelains</b> reflecting their higher firing temperature of between 1100 and 1400  °C.|$|R

5000|$|Nearly {{one hundred}} pieces of sixteenth-century Chinese <b>porcelains</b> {{have been found}} in the {{vicinity}} of the Drake's Cove site which “must fairly be attributed to Francis Drake’s Golden Hind visit of 1579.” [...] Arguments do exist suggesting the <b>porcelains</b> came from Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño's 1595 wreck, San Agustin, the only other ship with Chinese <b>porcelains</b> attributed to Point Reyes. However, x-ray fluorescence testing indicates differently. While encouraging further research to provide definitive answers, Dr. Marco Meniketti, tested ceramics from shipwrecks in Mexico, California, and Oregon as well as ceramics linked to Drake found near Point Reyes. The findings indicate the Cermeño ceramics and the supposed Drake ceramics were from two different ships. Meniketti states it appears that these two cargoes can be distinguished based on differences in their key elements.|$|R
