50|$|Option One - Shorter Piston:The stock Chrysler LA {{engine in}} the example above has a main to rod bearing {{centerline}} distance of 1.79 in (4.55 cm), a rod that is 6.123 in (15.55 cm) long, and a piston that is 1.67 in from <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> centerline to top, depending on the application. As the engine stroke is increased {{in the example}} above, the 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) configuration would place the piston 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher in the cylinder at top dead center, and with a distance of 9.585 in (24.36 cm) from crankshaft main centerline to deck, the piston would protrude about 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher than the top deck, or would collide with the cylinder head combustion chamber. To offset this, aftermarket pistons relocate the <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> higher within the piston itself.
