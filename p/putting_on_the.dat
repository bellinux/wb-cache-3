He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a debt as {{established in the}} previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic bomb that Simon stopped to explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a mutagenic puddle and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.|$|E
5|$|The Haunted Mask is the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L. Stine says he {{got the idea for}} the book from his son who was wearing a mask he had trouble getting off.|$|E

5|$|Crunch owner, Howard Dolgon, {{pursued the}} ideal of having his team in an outdoor game, but unlike the National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic the Crunch were {{responsible}} for funding the entire event. In order to afford the cost of hosting an outdoor game sponsorship deals with several independent organizations were made including Mirabito Energy Products, which lent {{its name to the}} title of the event. In part because of his success in <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> event, Dolgon was awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding executive. Following the success of the Mirabito Outdoor Classic other AHL Outdoor Classics were held by other AHL teams.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{made his}} pit stop shortly thereafter, <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soft {{compound}} tyre, while Hamilton stayed out. In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third place, right behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton {{came into the}} pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come out behind both Red Bull drivers. More trouble was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, {{who was in the}} lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into the barriers after his rear right tyre had exploded. This incident sent the safety car out, bringing the field back together. Rosberg was now leading the race from Hamilton, Verstappen, Ricciardo and Räikkönen.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E

5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got away}} well, fending off {{an attack by}} {{teammate}} Hamilton into the first corner. Behind them, Vettel had a bad getaway that saw him get {{in the midst of}} the Red Bull cars. In turn 5, he touched Daniel Ricciardo's car, suffering a puncture that forced him into the pit lane at the end of the first lap. While he was able to get back out, Fernando Alonso ended his race after just one lap due to a loss of power. Therefore, the order after the first lap stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat and Ricciardo. The two Mercedes cars of Rosberg and Hamilton soon opened a gap on the Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo, exchanging fastest laps in the process, while Felipe Massa and Max Verstappen got entangled in a fight for sixth place. Kimi Räikkönen, who was told early on to cool his brakes, made good progress up the field and was in 13th position by lap 8. One lap later, Valtteri Bottas became the first of the front runners to pit, <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> medium compound, followed just a lap later by teammate Massa. While Räikkönen had moved up to eighth place by lap 12, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz Jr. got into a fight for sixth place, with Pérez being asked by his team to stay out as long as possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted two World's Fairs: the Panama-California Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style {{buildings}} that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past. In the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of Balboa Park, but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> celebration went out of business.|$|E
5|$|On lap 28, Kimi Räikkönen was {{the first}} of the top runners to pit, coming out in fourth, but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an {{incident}} from 2014. The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas to stay ahead of him in third after he made a pit stop on lap 30. Hamilton made a pit stop on the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later, both without incident. At this point, Rosberg was about 1.5 seconds behind his teammate. Another four laps later, Sebastian Vettel came in for his second and final stop of the race. Massa came in for his only stop on lap 38, <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> super-soft tyres, and dropped from sixth to ninth. Räikkönen made a pit stop again on lap 42, staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the Broadway {{production}} {{has led to the}} development of an auxiliary show, Behind the Emerald Curtain, created by Sean McCourt – an original Broadway production cast member who played the Witch's Father, among other roles, in addition to understudying the Wizard and Doctor Dillamond, before taking over the latter principal role – and Anthony Galde who was a long-running swing in the Broadway company from 2004 to 2012. The tour features a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes look at the props, masks, costumes and sets used in the show, and includes a question-and-answer session with the cast members. The Broadway tour is currently led by McCourt and long-running ensemble member and Glinda understudy Lindsay K. Northen. The tour also featured in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago sit-down productions, and were each run by different long-serving cast members of the show. The tour provides a behind the scenes look at what goes into <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show every day. Participants get a first hand account of what it is like to be a part of the massive production that Wicked is.|$|E
