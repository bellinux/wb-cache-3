40|$|Fracture {{analysis}} of a standard construction steel <b>platform</b> <b>deck,</b> which {{had been exposed to}} a liquid nitrogen spill, showed that the brittle fracture started at a flaw in the weld as a consequence of low-temperature embrittlement and thermal stresses experienced by the material. In the present study, the permanent effect of a cryogenic spill on the fracture properties of carbon steels has been investigated. Charpy V-notch impact testing was carried out at 0 °C using specimens, from the <b>platform</b> <b>deck</b> material. The average impact energy appeared to be below requirements only for transverse specimens. No pre-existing damage was found when examining the fracture surfaces and cross sections in the scanning electron microscope. Specimens of the <b>platform</b> <b>deck</b> material and a DOMEX S 355 MCD carbon steel were tensile tested immersed in liquid nitrogen. Both steels showed a considerable increase in yield- and fracture strength and a large increase in the Lüders strain compared to the room temperature behavior. A cryogenic spill was simulated by applying a constant tensile force to the specimens for 10 min, at - 196 C. Subsequent tensile tests at room temperature showed no significant influence on the stress-strain curve of the specimens. A small amount of microcracks were found after holding a DOMEX S 355 MCD specimen at a constant force below the yield point.

40|$|This {{project is}} about wave impact on {{horizontal}} platforms. It investigates {{the interaction between}} ocean waves, mainly during hurricanes, and harbour jetties in coastal areas. Various types of loads can be identified when waves hit these kinds of coastal structures. The focus in this report will be on vertical loads (upward and downward) on <b>platform</b> <b>decks.</b> This subject has only had little coverage in studies on hydraulics or wave mechanics so far. The studies that are available differ SUbstantially in everything from their origin and their goal, to their points of interest and their methods used. All this makes that, before adding a new study to this list, {{it is very important}} to thoroughly review the available literature to see which theories have been tested, which references have been looked at, what methods have been used and what results were obtained. Chapter 1 starts with the introduction to the project, describing the problem under investigation, the goal to be achieved and the approach followed to do this. Chapter 2 contains a literature review. This review summarises the work done on the SUbject from around 1970 to today by various researchers and groups of researchers. The first thing that strikes in this review is the non-uniformity and the lack of a clear framework that characterises most projects, at least, as far as the presentation of the respective projects in research papers is concerned. Researchers often follow their own trail, failing to comment on findings by others. Issues that are of considerable importance to the exact understanding of the phenomenon are sometimes not commented on or are solved without proper reasoning. These issues and the way this report deals with them are listed in the end of this chapter. The literature review does not end in a complete understanding on how wave loads should be calculated. It shows a list of theories, analytical attempts and model tests trying to solve the problem, in lots of different ways for lots of different reasons. In chapter 3 the current state of knowledge is summarised. The wave impact process is separated into three components: Fpeak, the initial peak force, F+, the slowly-varying positive load and F-, the negative load. For each of these components, the parameters that influence their shape and magnitude are listed. After this, an overview will be given on how well the various studies found in the literature deal with the issues mentioned above. This will then result in a ranking which reflects the usability of their results. These results will then be quantified for a couple of wave conditions, to see how the models compare. Chapter 4 will describe model tests performed in the labs of HR Wallingford near Oxford. These tests have not been commissioned or designed especially for this project, but many interesting findings have been obtained from it nevertheless. The next chapter, chapter 5, shows the way a model predicting the three impact force components could look like. In important notion here is that the bounds of the validity of this model are defined by the characteristics of the scale model it is derived from. The chapter ends with some guidelines for designing a harbour jetty. The last chapter, chapter 6, contains the conclusions and recommendations this project suggests.

40|$|In this work, the {{permanent}} {{effect of a}} cryogenic spill on the fracture properties of carbon steel was investigated. The experimental work consisted of two main parts. The first part was the examination of a plate of material cut from a NV E 36 carbon steel <b>platform</b> <b>deck,</b> which {{had been exposed to}} a liquid nitrogen spill. This examination consisted of a fracture analysis, in addition to Charpy V-notch impact testing. In {{the second part of the}} experimental work, specimens of the platform material and a DOMEX S 355 carbon steel, were subjected to a simulated cryogenic spill and the material was subsequently examined. The fracture analysis of the platform material, was done by macroscopic observation of the damaged part of the <b>platform</b> <b>deck,</b> in addition to fracture surface examination in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). These examinations indicated that the fracture had started at a flaw in the weld during the liquid nitrogen spill, as a consequence of low-temperature embrittlement and thermal stresses experienced by the material. The fracture appeared to have propagated through the cold regions of the material by a brittle transgranular mechanism, until it encountered material of higher temperature and ductility and eventually was arrested. The paint layer on the steel had cracked in certain regions of the <b>platform</b> <b>deck.</b> This cracking had occurred as a result of different thermal contraction rates of the steel and the paint. Therefore, the paint cracks could be used as an indicator of which regions of the <b>platform</b> <b>deck</b> had been cooled to the lowest temperatures during the spill. Charpy V-notch impact testing was done at 0 C, by using standard transverse and longitudinal specimens from two adjacent regions of the <b>platform</b> <b>deck.</b> The average impact energy was 38, 68 J for the transverse specimens and 102, 83 J for the longitudinal specimens. The impact energy appeared to be below the minimum requirement only for the transverse specimens. The fracture surfaces and cross sections of selected Charpy specimens were examined in the SEM. However, no evidence of pre-existing damage was found. Microcracks were only found at small distances below the brittle fracture surfaces and were believed to have formed during the brittle crack propagation. Simulation of a cryogenic spill was done by tensile testing in liquid nitrogen. The tensile behaviour of both the platform material and the DOMEX S 355 steel at - 196 C, was first examined. Both steels showed a large increase in yield- and fracture strength and a large increase in the Lüders strain, compared to the room temperature behaviour. Examination of their fracture surfaces in the SEM, showed that the fracture mechanism was brittle transgranular. The conditions during a cryogenic spill were simulated by applying a constant tensile force to specimens of the two steels for a period of 10 min, at liquid nitrogen temperature. Subsequent tensile tests at room temperature, showed that this treatment had no significant effect on the tensile behaviour of the specimens. When examining longitudinal cross sections of the tensile specimens in the SEM, some damage was found. A small amount of microcracks were found after holding a DOMEX S 355 specimen for 10 min at a constant force below the yield point, in liquid nitrogen. After tensile testng a specimen of the platform material (NV E 36) to fracture in liquid nitrogen, cracks associated with elongated manganese sulphide inclusions were found through the whole test region. These cracks probably formed as a result of the inclusions having a higher thermal contraction rate than the steel. On cooling, this can cause decohesion or void formation at the inclusion-matrix interface and simultaneous deformation may have caused formation of cracks. Both the microcracks and sulphide related damage may give permanently reduced impact energy after a cryogenic spill...|$|R

The <b>platform</b> <b>deck</b> is moved by six actuator rods connected to DC servo motors, controlled by Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signals.
