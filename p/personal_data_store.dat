Two server-side components are implemented: a centralized registry server for authentication and authorization of all entities in the system, and a distributed <b>Personal</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Store</b> that allows analysis to be run against the stored sensor data and aggregated across multiple Personal Data Stores in a privacy-preserving fashion. The client, implemented for the Android mobile phone operating system, makes use of the Funf Open Sensing framework to collect data and adds the ability for users to authenticate against the registry server, authorize third-party applications to analyze data once it reaches their <b>Personal</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Store,</b> and finally, visualize the result of such analysis within a mobile phone or web browser. A number of example quantified-self and social applications are built on top of this framework to demonstrate feasibility of the system from both development and user perspectives. by Brian M.

40|$|My {{research}} {{investigates the}} following question: What factors affect people's privacy preferences for disclosing data that is collected about them when interacting with mobile applications? Research about information privacy {{has revealed that}} there are relations between the role of context and people's expectations about privacy. But {{it is unclear how}} those findings {{can be applied to the}} ubiquitous environment where mobile apps operate. In order to illuminate this problem I have developed a framework, ContextProbe, which supports both quantitative and qualitative investigations of how user context and other external factors jointly affect people's willingness to disclose personal information to mobile apps. As a consequence of this work, I have learned that people use contextual factors in making decisions about disclosing personal information to apps. Some of the significant privacy contextual factors are people's frequently visited places, specific time slots, who is around, and activities people are engaged in. Although contextual factors help, they do not provide a complete explanation of people's privacy choices. More importantly, I found that other external factors such as purposes of data use and trust in the app itself outweigh contextual factors when considering information disclosure. My study showed that subjects were not aware of context in thinking about disclosure when purpose of data use was presented together in the question. Surprisingly, results drawn from in-situ responses are the exact opposite to previous survey-based approaches on the effect of apps' showing their purpose strings when requesting personal information: showing less information seems to result in greater willingness to disclose. ContextProbe has three major parts: app-building platform, <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> <b>store,</b> and application server. The app-building platform allows experimenters to create apps for ESM studies easily within a visual programming environment. Apps built by ContextProbe can be used to collect sensor data on mobile phones as well as subject-reported data for representing subjects' context. In addition, the apps can probe subjects' privacy preference in-situ with the detected context. The <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> <b>store</b> holds all data collected from subjects' phones and is responsible for sending data automatically to the corresponding application server. It provides a one-stop "dashboard" approach that lets subjects review information collected by the ESM apps. The application server aggregates all collected data in the study and monitors the health status of data collection tasks running on subjects' phone. ContextProbe provides an automatic process for study subjects and experimenters to easily set up <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> <b>store</b> and application server without extra overheads comparing to other existing architectures for ESM studies. My work has opened up the following new questions: how do we best represent the information of privacy-relevant contexts during preference solicitation? And how to balance the trade-offs between sampling in various contexts and the cost of subjects' times? Further research in fields such as behavioral economics that require real-time monitoring of user context, data collection, and in-situ responses might well be conducted using the ContextProbe framework. by Fuming Shih.

It is sufficient {{to think of a}} simple smartphone that enables each one of us to browse the Web, listen to music on online musical services, post messages on social networks, perform online shopping sessions, acquire images and videos and record our geographical locations. This enormous amount of personal data could be exploited to improve the lifestyle of each individual by extracting, analyzing and exploiting user's behavioral patterns like the items frequently purchased, the routinary movements, the favorite sequence of songs listened, etc. However, even though some user-centric models for data management named <b>Personal</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Store</b> are emerging, currently there is still a significant lack in terms of algorithms and models specifically designed to extract and capture knowledge from personal data. This thesis proposes an extension to the idea of <b>Personal</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Store</b> through Personal Data Analytics. In practice, we describe parameter-free algorithms that {{do not need to be}} tuned by experts and are able to automatically extract the patterns from the user's data.

In addition, we propose individual and collective services exploiting the knowledge extracted with Personal Data Analytics algorithm and models. The services are provided for the users which are organized in a Personal Data Ecosystem in form of a peer distributed network, and are available to share part of their own patterns as a return of the service providing. We show how the sharing with the collectivity enables or improves, the services analyzed. The sharing enhances the level of the service for individuals, for example by providing to the user an invaluable opportunity for having a better perception of her self-awareness. Moreover, at the same time, knowledge sharing can lead to forms of collective gain, like the reduction of the number of circulating cars.

Responding to global challenges, generating efficiencies, prediction improvement, democratisation access to information and empowering individuals are a few examples of the economic and social value created by personal information. However, this technological innovation, efficiency and productivity comes at a price -?privacy. As a result, individuals are growingly concerned that companies and governments are not protecting data about them and that they are instead using it in ways not necessarily in their best interests. The objective of this research is to investigate the validity and feasibility of a <b>Personal</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Store</b> (PDS) against the developed a priori framework. Ten qualitative, semi-?structured interviews using the long interview method were conducted with individuals identified as a subject matter expert (SMEs) in the Big Data analytics and the data privacy field. The findings show that the guiding principles of transparency, control, trust and value, ensures the validity and feasibility of the PDS. Furthermore, user-?centricity provides greater control within the Big Data continuum. However, as personal data should not be trusted in the hands of third-?parties, identity management and security must be entrenched at a foundational level of the model. The remaining elements -? selective disclosure, purpose and duration, signalling and data portability - is in fact value adding qualities that allows for the commodification of personal data.

40|$|Abstract In {{traditional}} {{personal data}} markets, companies collect {{vast amount of}} data about their customers, share the data across companies and use it for their own purposes. Individuals have only little or no control over how companies use the data about them. Today, for example transferring own health information from one healthcare provider to another is impossible, because people can’t access to their own data. However, empowering individuals and increasing their ability {{to control their own}} health data would increase individuals’ motivation and opportunity {{to take care of their}} health. The emerging trend is to move towards more human-centered model in personal data management and allow individuals to access and control their own data. In this research, MyData approach is taken, which is suggested as one of these human-centered models. Purpose of this research is to examine what kind of business models there are for platform operators in MyData based ecosystem in the context of preventive healthcare. Aim of this research is to increase understanding about how MyData transformation can be supported with platform operator’s business models. A business model is a description of the roles and value propositions of a platform operator, interactions among the network of actors and platform operator’s value propositions in the ecosystem. This research suggests novel business models for platform operators and illustrates how the ecosystem is shaped from a platform operator’s perspective. The method applied is a qualitative case study. The empirical material consists of questionnaire data from 22 organizations from ten different countries from the Europe and the US. The research contributes to the discussion on networked business models and service ecosystems and creates new knowledge about platform operator’s business models in the context of preventive healthcare. The findings indicate that a platform operator supports actors in exchanging resources and enables value co-creation among individuals and other actors in the ecosystem in four ways: being a representative for individuals and service providers and/or building a trust-based network for actors, and/or facilitating interaction and/or offering a <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> <b>store.</b> This research provides useful insights for managers about the different roles and value propositions a company can have in an ecosystem where an individual is in control over his or her data. The findings of this research provide managers with guidance and inspiration for the development of new MyData based services. This research provides a snapshot of what a MyData based ecosystem looks like today based on one case. Therefore generalization of this research to other ecosystems might be challenging.
