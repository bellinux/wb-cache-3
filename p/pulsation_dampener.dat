40|$|Lecturepg. 39 <b>Pulsation</b> <b>dampeners</b> are {{frequently}} {{used to reduce}} piping pressure pulsations and vibrations in reciprocating pump systems. Despite their extensive use, scientific {{understanding of how the}} dampeners work and what design parameters are important needs considerable development. To advance this understanding, the author?s company initiated an extensive dampener evaluation test program in cooperation with five leading manufacturers of commercial bladder type dampeners. All dampeners were tested in a special test loop under identical conditions to analyze the effect of a dampener?s design on its effectiveness. Pressure measurements at several points in the piping were made as a function of pump speed, bladder precharge pressure, and suction and discharge line pressures for each dampener. Results indicate that the type and location of dampener have a considerable influence on <b>pulsations.</b> <b>Dampeners</b> are effective over a much broader range of precharge pressures than generally believed. Based on these findings, a number of practical recommendations in the selection and use of dampeners are offered...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pipeline {{vibration}} due to reciprocating compressors is a {{major problem}} faced by Oil and Gas industries worldwide. We present a method to reduce the pipeline vibration of 2 HD/ 1 opposed-balanced reciprocating compressor. Vibrational readings are recorded for two of the reciprocating compressors in the plant (ONGC-Uran); Compressor A with major vibration in discharge pipeline and compressor B with vibration within acceptable limits so as to find the source of vibration in compressor A. As per the layout, pipeline design of reciprocating compressor A is done in SolidWorks software. Vibrational analysis of the pipeline by varying the external support locations is carried out using Ansys software. From the study, it is understood that the pressure pulsation in <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampener</b> is the primary reason for pipeline vibration. A suggestion for the vibration reduction is made by adding supports to alter the frequency of the pipeline. We conclude that for overall system performance and vibration reduction, anti-vibration measures as suggested should be implemented...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{pulsations}} commonly {{exist in}} HVACR, energy and automotive industry. They {{are believed to}} be a major source for system inefficiency, vibrations, noises and fatigue failures. It has been widely accepted that gas pulsations mainly take place at the discharge side of a positive displacement (PD) type compressor such as a screw, scroll or internal combustion engine. The pulsation magnitudes, ranging from a fraction to a few bars, are especially significant at off-design conditions of either under-compression (UC) or over-compression (OC). Traditionally, a serial <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampener,</b> often a reactive type silencer, is connected after the compressor or engine discharge. It is capable of reducing pressure pulsation by 10 plus fold; or 20 plus dB. However these dampeners are bulky and impose sizable back pressure losses. This paper discusses an alternative method, a shunt pulsation trap (SPT), using a parallel configuration, which tackles the gas pulsations before the compressor or engine discharge. The SPT method is based on the shock tube theory [1] that characterizes the nature of gas pulsation as a composition of non-linear waves, compression wave (CW) and expansion wave (EW) and induced fluid flow (IFF). The theory also predicts that the dominant source of gas pulsation is a direct result from the sudden discharging process under UC or OC condition. Two prototypes, 75 HP and 350 HP Roots type blowers, were built and tested with and without SPT. The experimental results partially validate the new theory and also indicate a 10 plus fold; or 20 plus dB pulsation reduction by using SPT under different load and speed conditions without suffering any back pressure losses...|$|E
40|$|Twin-screw {{pumps are}} {{currently}} sold by manufacturers without adequate data predicting the pump behavior when pumping multiphase mixtures. In {{light of the}} fact that pump behavior is known to change significantly under these conditions, a new closed-loop test facility has been designed and constructed to allow for testing of twin-screw pumps at high gas volume fractions. With minimal modification, the test facility can accommodate high pressure flows and oil-based liquids for testing. The closed-loop test facility supplies air and water to the inlet of an MR- 200 twin-screw pump of which the performance characteristics are desired. The flow of air and water can be regulated to give the desired inlet pressure, outlet pressure, and gas volume fraction. The resulting mixture is driven to the test pump by its inlet suction. It then passes through the pump to a gravity separator, where it is separated into discrete liquid and gas phases. Inlet pressures up to seventy-five psig can be used, and with minimal modification, up to three-hundred psig. Total flow rates of up to six-hundred-fifty gallons per minute can be accommodated. A two-hundred horsepower electric motor provides the mechanical power for the pump. The test facility includes instrumentation and data acquisition equipment to monitor the pressures and temperatures at various points in the flow loop, as well as the flow rate and motor voltage of the pump. The closed-loop facility is validated by comparing the volumetric efficiency, mechanical efficiency, and pump effectiveness results to a previous open-loop facility that was also used to test the same twin-screw pump. Suggestions are given to replace an air valve to allow for more precise control of the air supply and to add a <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampener</b> that will moderate pressure oscillations. High pressure piping and tubing must be added for testing at higher inlet pressures...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to problems, {{processes}} and systems related to the recently developed water powered percussive rock drilling method. The technology, which uses ordinary water to drive down-the-hole hammers, {{has been used to}} produce more than 6 million meters of blast holes within the mining industry. The method has several advantages such as low energy consumption, dust free environment and the capability to drill to virtually any depth. A natural disadvantage of this method is the need for relatively large amounts of preferably high quality water to drive the hammer tool, occasionally also leading to waste disposal problems. To understand the central hammer tool in the system, the function of a 100 mm diameter hammer has been analysed, modelled and simulated. One- dimensional wave propagation theory was used for modelling impacts and axial motions in a drilling system. The rock was assumed to be an elastic- plastic material, where all absorbed energy was used for crush work. Simulation results show good agreement between measured and simulated piston blow frequencies (~ 60 Hz). A disadvantage with the hammer tool’s function is the discontinuous consumption of water, causing large pressure fluctuations in the feed water line. Measurements indicate peak pressures to be ~ 3 to 4 times larger than the lowest pressure. Since large pressure variations increase the risk of mechanical damages, a flexible element (<b>pulsation</b> <b>dampener)</b> to reduce the variations was developed. Test bench experiments show pressure fluctuations reduced by up to 40 % with the prototype dampener. For all drilling methods, an efficient rock penetration process is essential for the methods overall competitiveness. The process is also significant for the dynamic behaviour of the water powered hammer tool, since different rock properties have been shown to cause variations in the piston blow frequency. The general bit-rock impact process is therefore discussed and field measurements of the penetration rate during ~ 115 mm diameter well drilling are presented. A penetration process was also analysed with the assistance of a non-linear explicit FEM code, where the rock material was represented by an established constitutive model. Results show, e. g., the ratio between the indenter’s rebound- and initial kinetic energy to decrease with increased initial energy, where a small part of this initial energy is transmitted by stress waves into the formation. During the penetration process, crushed rock is flushed away with outlet water from the hammer tool, i. e. used particle contaminated drill water should be recycled when the method is used at locations with limited water access and/or when waste disposal is difficult to accomplish. This has resulted in the development and construction of a prototype mobile cleaning system that makes re-use possible. Hence, this system is described together with measured and simulated results of the unit’s cleaning capacity. Another phenomenon during the drilling process is the dissipation of {{a large part of the}} injected borehole energy into heat. The drill water and the formation will therefore be thermally influenced, providing the possibility to evaluate the ground thermal conductivity with the drill work. This new principle is presented in detail, together with an energy balance equation and a heat transfer analysis during drill work. Godkänd; 2004; 20061005 (ysko...|$|E
30|$|High {{data rate}} pulsars in MPT {{telemetry}} not only create signals that propagate uphole, but also reverse direction, down-going signals that reflect at the drillbit which combine to create constructively or destructively interfering signals. Strong signal reflections are detected {{at the surface}} signal detectors caused by mud pumps, <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampeners,</b> drill string joints and diameter changes, dispersion and filtering of certain frequencies within mud channel (Brackel 2016; Brooks 2015). The ultimate signal that travels up the drillpipe depends on mud velocity, {{the position of the}} pulsar in the drill collar, operating frequency and the bottomhole assembly details forming the host waveguide. The superposition of the main wave from the transmitter and the multiple reflected waves generate either destructive interference or constructive interference pulse signals (Shi et al. 2004). Destructive interference signal can severely limit data rate and transmission distance while the constructive interference signal, if properly applied, can enhance LWD signal strength without the power penalties incurred by mechanical methods. As a matter of fact, signal reflections occur at any impedance mismatch positions in drillstring, reducing its impacts (Cheng et al. 2014 a, b) proposed novel multiple-echo suppression model using two receivers based on the transient pulse responses in uplink and downlink channels.|$|R
30|$|Mud channel signals {{experience}} pressure fluctuations {{and uncertainty}} caused by various MPT system components that potentially change signal properties {{during the course}} of data transmission. The main noise sources that induce pressure fluctuations are mud pumps, <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampeners,</b> surface piping, pressure transducer locations, drill string components, mud properties and the well depth (Klotz et al. 2008 a, c). The mud channel that the pulse signals pass as they propagate to the surface is extremely harsh, demanding complex surface signal detection and extraction. Common mud pulse signal property distortions which degrade signal transmission and data rates are downhole signal strength, signal attenuation, surface induced noise (electrical noise) and surface piping induced signal reflections (Klotz et al. 2008 c). Unpredictable and complex adjustable signal impairments are caused by drilling noise, drill string motion noise within the borehole, attenuation and circulation pumps noise (Shearer 2010). Depending on the severity of the mud channel conditions and signal distortions, to achieve maximum possible data rates, telemetry systems must be robust and flexible, both downhole and at the surface receiver (Klotz et al. 2008 a, b, c). Despite the signal processing complexity and their varying properties, mud pulse systems must adapt the harsh working environment and recover the useful original signals. This section discusses main mud pulse telemetry system signal impairments that affect MPT data transmissions.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 103 Competitive {{marketplace}} {{pressures for}} higher quality products with consistent material properties at lower cost {{are changing the}} face of chemical process manufacturing facilities. More frequently today, critical equipment is installed in unspared service with minimal onsite spare parts, yet demanded to operate reliably without defects for greater periods of time. An important component that helps make this possible is the emergence of increasingly more powerful and lower cost online condition monitoring systems for early failure diagnosis. These systems have moved into the relatively inhospitable chemical plant environment, capability that until recently was largely the domain of the engineering laboratory. High-frequency dynamic measurement, with automated statistical and mathematical post-processing, is now available live, remotely, via the Internet across the globe. This paper examines this technology in applications with several high-pressure process diaphragm pumping systems. Many key learnings are explored along with advances in system design that have been developed as a result of application of these techniques. Numerous real examples illustrate how to recognize improper precharge of gas-padded <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampeners,</b> and even correct while operating.

40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 64 Current {{technologies}} {{now make}} it possible to build turbomachinery without the need for a lubrication and seal oil system. However, there is an established machinery population that still requires support systems for oil wetted bearings and seals. For most companies, it is not economically practical to convert to new bearings and seals to eliminate the oil support system. Indeed, {{this may not be the}} best solution in many cases. Lubrication and seal oil systems can be the single largest cause of spurious and nuisance trips. In most cases, such trips are due to controller degradation, improper operation, or simple neglect. The most common causes of oil system problems, and practical solutions aimed at long term operating reliability are addressed. A chronic cause of spurious trips is oil pump switchover. Usually, such problems can be eliminated by upgrading controllers and/or control valve selection philosophy, installation of hydraulic <b>pulsation</b> <b>dampeners,</b> a design audit of the piping configuration, and, very often, operating procedures. Oil system instability contributes significantly to nuisance trips. Again, a review of system control components and associated hardware can usually minimize this phenomenon. Additionally, improper purging of air has been known to cause similar problems, and frustrate the most experienced operator. There are other problems which can also result in unscheduled downtime of critical rotating machinery. These include collapsing oil filter elements, improper sour seal oil drainer sizing, improper control valve sizing, lack of attention to transient conditions, controller and pressure switch physical location, and oil cooler integrity, to name a few. There is a large installed machinery population that has been in operation for many years, but has never been upgraded to present standards. New developments in control technology lend themselves to increasing oil system reliability, in addition to other component upgrades. Refineries and chemical plants now commonly utilize comprehensive preventive maintenance (PM) programs; however, oil systems do not seem to be included in such programs to the same level as that of their supported machinery. Oil system reliability can be increased, and nuisance trips minimized, by monitoring several key operating points which include valve position, oil temperature and chemical analysis, and filter differential pressure (to name a few) on a scheduled basis. Such data can also be useful in determining or predicting problems with the rotating equipment. It has also become obvious in recent years that process demands, in addition to efforts to improve oil system reliability, have resulted in systems that are more complex. Such complexity has, in some cases, ironically decreased operational reliability due to the introduction of unnecessary hardware. Practical and realistic basic design guidelines will be presented, along with a comparison of the various design philosophies currently being utilized in the industry...|$|R
