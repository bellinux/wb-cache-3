30|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} by McAfee, 4 the cost in lost <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> day per user is approximately equal to US$ 0.50, based on the user’s having to spend 30 s for dealing with only two spam messages each day and the user’s spam filter working at 95 percent accuracy (value {{higher than the average}} achieved by the majority of available anti-spam filters). Therefore, the <b>productivity</b> loss <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> <b>per</b> year due to spam is approximately equal to US$ 182.50.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test whether the use of {{numerical}} and functional flexibility practices in firms affect their performance. Design/methodology/approach - A combined employer/employee Norwegian data set is used to estimate production function like equations. The data stem from a questionnaire among Norwegian work organizations conducted in 2003 and are supplemented by register data from Statistics Norway about the organizations and their employees. Findings - Numerical flexibility measures are negatively associated with wages and <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> although the association is stronger with wages than with productivity. This supports the idea that numerical flexibility fits with a low-cost strategy. It is also found that a negative association between functional flexibility and wages and <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> with the association once again stronger with wages than with productivity, contrary to the hypothesis. The idea that high-commitment human resource (HR) management has positive effects on wages and productivity was confirmed by other indicators of HR management. Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited by a cross-sectional design and its relatively simple indicators of numerical and functional flexibility, which only show whether certain practices are used, rather than the intensity of their use. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies that tests the effects of both numerical and functional flexible work practices on wages and productivity in a regulated labour market...|$|E

This paper analyses the cross relationship among various components of <b>productivity</b> like earning <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> business <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> and profit <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> for public, private and foreign sector banks within the Indian Banking Industry using data for five years i. e. the period starting from 2001 - 02 to 2005 - 06. A range of statistical tools like averages, ACGR, correlation, regression, and parametric tests have been used to establish, evaluate and quantify the cross-sectional relationship among the variables. ■ Ownership characteristics of banks are also incorporated into the analysis to examine productivity across ownership groups. Results show that foreign sector banks are outshining with their performance in all the selected parameters during the period of this study. In terms of ACGR and absolute numbers too, these banks have been on top in all the categories. However the average ACGR, taking all the banks of one sector together, is highest for public sector banks in case of business <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> It shows that public sector banks are growing with consistent pace and intra group variations are also less than other sectors.

Chronic illnesses reduce productivity, are responsible for rising healthcare costs, and should be managed by the employer to reduce healthcare expenditures.

First, there are strong positive impacts of TFP (without and with human capital) on manufacturing employment, as well as ambiguous effects of labour productivity on employment.

40|$|Return on reward, i. e. {{the average}} {{economic}} performance <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> which a company generates {{based on its}} average total labor expenses is a topic {{that seems to have}} received surprisingly little attention in the past. While companies manage their (often fictive) financial indicators (e. g. capital structures and stock prices) in an attempt to create value for their shareholders, the sense that each individual employee is (or at least, should) actually be contributing a certain measurable economic value, is often overlooked. Moreover, in the world of Human Resource Management, the intense debate between economists and psychologists/sociological economists on whether higher incentives actually lead to higher performance, is still largely unsettled. By using a model which measures economic value <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> as a function of <b>productivity</b> and cost <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> {{while at the same time}} looking for trends which indicate a relation between these two, this paper answers the question whether higher average wage bills generate higher productivity. The relationship between the cost of labor and various performance metrics over an 18 -year timespan was empirically examined. The results from this assessment indicated that a positive correlation can be found between the average total labor expenses and average employee productivity, as measured by various different performance metrics. Thus, while current literature is locked in debate on the effects of incentives on motivation and performance, these results provide a strong argument for the fact that incentives positively impact performance. Moreover, from the subsequent findings it can be concluded that providing higher incentives leads to a productivity increase which outweighs the initial cost of the increase. This leads to the conclusion that the economic returns benefit from an increase in average rewards provided to an organization’s workforce. Hence, the results from this study conclude that it does indeed pay off to pay more. ...|$|R
