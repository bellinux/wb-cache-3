500|$|Paul Hainault, {{a retired}} <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{engineering}} from Michigan Technological University, promoted {{a theory that}} began as a student class project. His hypothesis held that Fitzgerald grounded at 9:30a.m. on November 10 on Superior Shoal. This shoal, charted in 1929, is an underwater mountain {{in the middle of}} Lake Superior about [...] north of Copper Harbor, Michigan. It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from , making it a menace to navigation. Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes. A seiche, or standing wave, that occurred during the low-pressure system over Lake Superior on November 10, 1975, caused the lake to rise [...] over the Soo Locks's gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with [...] of water. Hainault's theory held that this seiche contributed to Fitzgerald shoaling [...] of her hull on Superior Shoal, causing the hull to be punctured mid-body. The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull, until the middle third dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck. The stern section acted as an anchor and caused Fitzgerald to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward. The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds. Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow, which sank 18degrees off course. The rear kept going forward with the engine still running, rolled to port and landed bottom up.|$|E

2500|$|Jacot was {{at least}} partly right {{concerning}} vortices. George Vatistas, [...] a researcher and <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> engineering at Concordia in Montreal, {{was the first to}} discover geometrical shapes in the centers of vortices in the lab, and some galaxies have similar central shapes, squares or triangles. Spiral galaxies are, in fact, vortices.

2500|$|In 2009, Luigi Garlaschelli, {{professor}} of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia, {{announced that he}} had made a full size reproduction of the Shroud of Turin using only medieval technologies. Garlaschelli placed a linen sheet over a volunteer and then rubbed it with an acidic pigment. The shroud was then aged in an oven before being washed to remove the pigment. He then added blood stains, scorches and water stains to replicate the original. But according to Giulio Fanti, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> and thermic measurements at the University of Padua, [...] "the technique itself seems unable to produce an image having the most critical Turin Shroud image characteristics".|$|E
2500|$|On April 14, 2009, Griffin {{accepted}} {{a position as}} eminent scholar and a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> and aerospace engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. [...] The university established the eminent scholar position in 1986. Griffin has established the Center for System Studies at the university, which will address the need for [...] "systems thinking" [...] in industry and the government. System studies involve research to understand the many complex ways that technology, nature, people, and society interact so that the workings of an engineered solution are more predictable and more desirable. UA Huntsville is a Space Grant university, and {{has a history of}} cooperation with both NASA at the nearby Marshall Space Flight Center, and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command at Redstone Arsenal.

2500|$|In March 2013 Giulio Fanti, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{and thermal}} {{measurement}} at the University of Padua conducted {{a battery of}} experiments on various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988 Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 BCE to 400 CE, potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth. Because of {{the manner in which}} Fanti obtained the shroud fibers, many are dubious about his findings. The shroud’s official custodian, Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia of Turin, told Vatican Insider: [...] "As there is no degree of safety on the authenticity of the materials on which these experiments were carried out [...] the shroud cloth, the shroud's custodians cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments." [...] Barrie Schwortz, a member of the original STURP investigation team, commented on Fanti’s theory: [...] "But it would be more convincing if the basic research had first been presented in a professional, peer-reviewed journal. If you’re using old techniques in new ways, then you need to submit your approach to other scientists." ...|$|E
