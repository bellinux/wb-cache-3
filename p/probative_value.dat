40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of fingerprints and microtraces {{within the field}} of crimi-nalistics and forensics is well known. To increases <b>probative</b> <b>values</b> of such evidences several techniques of lifting, enhancement and feature extraction exist. An upcoming field is the contactless acquisition of traces, because the integrity of traces is pre-served. Hence, dealing with digital representations of traces is challenging because of the amount of data and their complexity. A further issue from such an acquisition method is the potential presence of perspective distortions, which we already started to deal with in [KCDV 12]. Within the scope of a productive use of contactless acquisition methods, pre-processing steps like the equalization come along. In this short motiva-tional paper we want to give a perspective on requirements for an underlying database and database management system to support the methods of [KCDV 12] as a potential real-case scenario. Thereby, we point out possible starting points for parallelization potential and frequent queries, especially when using filter masks. ...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the common}} view in the Criminal Law Society of Japan,the <b>probative</b> <b>values</b> of most evidences were fixed in advance by law {{in the age of}} feudalism. The modern period,however,tumed it over and secured the freedom of judges to {{estimate}} the value of each evidence. We nowadays call the freedom the free conviction principle. 2 ̆ 71,on the other hand,believe that the view is wrong. It was only the confessions,but not most evidences,the value of which were rated by law. The confession was rated very high and required to find the accused guilty of a crime. The judge could declare the accused guilty with confidence,that is to say,feeling relieved thanks to it. Butthe criminal procedure that doesn 2 ̆ 7 t dispense with a confession inevitably involved the torture. The enlightenment thought in the period of citizens 2 ̆ 7 revolutions first of all attacked the torture as a typical vi­olation of human rights. It was the free conviction principle that made its appearance in the criminal suit to bring the torture to an end. In other words,the criminallaw at that time abandoned to place such a high value on the con­fession as to be a necess紅y condition for a judgment of guilty...|$|R

500|$|In pre-trial proceedings, the {{government}} stipulated that Noriega had received $322,000 from the U.S. Army and the CIA. Noriega {{insisted that he}} had in fact been paid close to $10,000,000, {{and that he should}} be allowed to testify about the work he had done for the U.S. government. The district court held that information about the operations in which Noriega had played a part supposedly in return for payment from the U.S. was not relevant to his defense. It ruled that [...] "the tendency of such evidence to confuse the issues before the jury substantially outweighed any <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> it might have had." [...] One of the witnesses in the trial was Floyd Carlton, who had previously flown shipments of drugs for Noriega.|$|E

There were no marks on him on the night that suggested he had been in a fight. No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered. He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid. There was no <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Bamber had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killing and since.|$|E

50|$|When {{mental health}} {{professionals}} fail to undertake comprehensive, impartial, and scientifically informed assessments, they risk challenges to the admissibility {{of the evidence that}} they present to court and having it dismissed as poor or “junk science.” The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993) provided a basis for determining acceptable science in court, and required judges to function as “gatekeepers” for evaluating the <b>probative</b> or helpful <b>value</b> of the testimony for the case at hand. Two additional, related SCOTUS cases—General Electric Co. v. Joiner (1997) and Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael (1999)- may be added to comprise what is often referenced as the “Daubert trilogy.” A Canadian case that addresses many of the same issues is R. v. Mohan (1994). Some states still function according to Frye, or general acceptance standards, in determination of admissibility to court (Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013, 34 ALR 145 (D. C. Cir 1923). Also, see the Federal Rules of Evidence (United States Government Printing Office, 2009).|$|R
500|$|Information about Noriega's {{connections}} to the CIA, including his relationship with Oliver North and his alleged contact with Bush, were {{kept out of the}} trial. After the trial, Noriega appealed this exclusionary ruling by the judge to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals ruled in the government's favor, despite disagreeing with the lower court. It said: [...] "Our review leads us to conclude that information regarding the purposes for which the United States previously paid Noriega potentially had some probative value;... Thus, the district court may have overstated the case when it declared evidence of the purposes for which the United States allegedly paid Noriega wholly irrelevant to his defense". The Court of Appeals refused to set aside the verdict because it felt that [...] "the potential <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of this material, however, was relatively marginal". On July 10, 1992, Noriega was sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E
500|$|On 13 November, Malaysia's Agent, Ambassador-at-Large Abdul Kadir Mohamad, {{alleged that}} [...] Singapore {{was trying to}} [...] "subvert" [...] a 150-year-old {{arrangement}} under which Singapore operated Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca, which was Malaysia's territory. He also suggested that if permitted to do so, Singapore would upset the peace and stability of {{the area where the}} island is located. He said that if Singapore reclaimed land around Pedra Branca, [...] "uite apart from the possible effects on the environment and navigation in the Strait, this could lead to potentially serious changes to the security arrangements in the eastern entrance of the Strait". According to Malaysian Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail, Singapore had first raised the issue of sovereignty over Pedra Branca on 13 April 1978 during a meeting between officials, saying it had [...] "incontrovertible legal evidence" [...] of its sovereignty over the island though it had never produced any documents in support. Prior to that, the sovereignty of the island had never been disputed. The 1980 statement by the then Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn concerning the [...] "unclear" [...] position of the island had also been premised on these documents which former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had claimed were in Singapore's possession. The statement was therefore merely a friendly and respectful statement of a visiting prime minister at a press conference which had no <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> in court. All Hussein Onn had meant was that the matter required further discussion between the two countries.|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{administrative}} rule requiring employee health benefit plans to cover contraceptive services, many employers are pursuing religious liberty claims against the federal government. In claims under the Religious Freedom Res- toration Act, a prima facie showing by a plaintiff that a federal law substantially burdens the exercise of religion shifts the burden to the government to justify the burden by showing that the law is the least restrictive means of advancing a compel- ling governmental interest. This article focuses on the compelling interest prong of the government 2 ̆ 7 s burden. The text of RFRA and judicial gloss make clear that the government 2 ̆ 7 s burden of proof is not insubstantial: the government must demon- strate, with probative and persuasive evidence, that applying the law to the person challenging it in fact furthers a compelling governmental interest. In the lawsuits, courts and litigants have tended to focus on the exemptions built into the coverage mandate, but the more significant weakness in the government 2 ̆ 7 s case relates to the limited value of the evidence supposedly showing that the contraceptive mandate fur- thers the relevant compelling interest. The article demonstrates that the relevant com- pelling interest is narrower than the interests pointed to by the government in the litigation, and that evidence relied on by the government to show that the mandate furthers the compelling interest lacks <b>probative</b> and persuasive <b>value.</b> More specifically, the compelling interest is the interest in providing coverage for preventive services needed to protect women 2 ̆ 7 s health, and the evidence relied on by the government in the litigation and in the rulemaking process that purportedly shows that contraceptive services promote women 2 ̆ 7 s health suffers from a variety of shortcomings. Congress envisioned that reliance on expert advisors who conducted rigorous risk/benefit assessments would ensure that services would be included in the mandate only if they genuinely promote women 2 ̆ 7 s health and are not merely pop- ular services. The agency confirmed the importance of a risk/benefit assessment as part of the rulemaking process, and delegated the task to the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The government points to the resulting 2011 IOM recommendation as evi- dence justifying the mandate 2 ̆ 7 s burden on the challengers 2 ̆ 7 exercise of religion. How- ever, scrutiny of the methodology used by IOM in the recommendation process and its application to contraceptive services, and scrutiny of sources relied on by IOM in producing its recommendation, reveals obvious gaps, omissions, and logical short- comings that seriously undermine the recommendation 2 ̆ 7 s evidentiary value. Family planning is important for women 2 ̆ 7 s health, but the evidence does not support the proposition that contraceptives are necessary for safe and effective family planning, and thus does not support the proposition that contraceptives are necessary for women 2 ̆ 7 s health. Scrutiny of the 2011 IOM recommendation and the sources relied on by IMO show that ideology was {{the driving force behind the}} contraceptive man- date and, under RFRA, promotion of ideology will not satisfy the government 2 ̆ 7 s bur- den...|$|R

However, these privileges are not absolute, and may be overruled by a judge upon a showing that [...] "the <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> of the information outweighs the effect of disclosure of {{the information on the}} victim, the counseling relationship, and the counseling services", or under a number of other limited circumstances.

2500|$|... 8. Past {{treatment}} by reviewing courts of written medical reports {{in social security}} disability cases is revealing. Until the decision in this case, the courts of appeals, including the Fifth Circuit, with only an occasional criticism of the medical report practice, uniformly recognized reliability and <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> in such reports. The courts have reviewed administrative determinations, and upheld many adverse ones, where the only supporting evidence has been reports of this kind, buttressed sometimes, but often not, by testimony of a medical adviser such as Dr. Leavitt.

Exclusion of evidence on the ground that, although its <b>probative</b> <b>value</b> was unquestionable, it was obtained by methods which the judge considers to be unfair, {{has nothing to do with}} his duty to secure a fair trial for the accused." [...] The sole discretion to exclude evidence is based on the weighing of prejudicial value and <b>probative</b> <b>value.</b> Where the material evidence is being considered for exclusion: [...] "...a judge must determine the value of the evidence based on reliability and the strength of the inference it led to, against the cost presented by such evidence, including things as diverse as the practicalities of its presentation, the fairness to the parties and to witnesses, and the potentially distorting effect the evidence can have on the outcome of the case."
