One hundred and forty seven (147), Shikka brown layers already 12 months in lay were divided into 7 groups of 21 birds each and randomly assigned to the 7 treatment diets in a completely randomized design (CRD). There were significant differences (P 0. 05) among the groups in body weight, egg yolk colour, shell thickness, albumen and yolk indices, horizontal and oblong circumferences and digestibility of dry matter and ash respectively.
