40|$|The {{population}} {{of elderly people}} is rapidly growing {{and in terms of}} safety, senior pedestrians represent one of the most vulnerable group. The pedestrian crossing speed is a significant input parameter in traffic engineering, which can have effect on pedestrians’ safety, especially of older population. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the value of the crossing speed of elderly pedestrians (65 +) for different types of urban crossings. The research was conducted at ten intersections in the city of Belgrade, Serbia, using the method of direct observation and a questionnaire for collecting data. The data were analysed in the statistical software package IBM SPSS Statistics. The results showed that elderly pedestrians walk slower and the crossing type significantly influenced the speed of older population. The order of crossing types in relation to the measured speed is ranked as follows, from the lowest to the highest speed value: unsignalized, signalized, signalized with pedestrian countdown display, signalized with <b>pedestrian</b> <b>island</b> and pedestrian countdown display and finally signalized crossing with <b>pedestrian</b> <b>island.</b> According to the questionnaire results, the elderly recognize the importance of implementing pedestrian counters. This indicates the necessity to provide safe street crossing for the elderly using the corresponding engineering measures...|$|E

40|$|Many Minnesota {{counties}} {{are faced with}} the problem of high vehicle speeds through towns or resort areas that have significant pedestrian traffic. This paper investigates impact of speed reduction strategies in high pedestrian areas (HPAs) in rural counties of Minnesota. Speed data were collected at two selected study sites under their existing conditions (i. e., “no-treatment ” or “before ” condition) and after the proposed speed reduction strategies were installed. Second “after ” data conditions were collected to study the short-term and long-term impact of the implemented strategies. The traffic calming techniques employed at the Twin Lakes site consisted of removable <b>pedestrian</b> <b>islands</b> and <b>pedestrian</b> crossing signs. A dynamic variable message sign that sent a single-word message (SLOW) to motorists traveling over the speed limit was installed at the Bemidji site. The research study shows that the traffic calming strategy deployed in Twin Lakes was effective to significantly reduce the mean speed and improve speed limit compliance in both the short term and long term. Despite proven effectiveness, the deployed speed reduction treatment in Bemidji Lake failed to lower the speed at the study site. The sign’s single-word message and its location as well as lack of initial enforcement were the primary reasons for such failure...|$|R

5|$|Even {{before the}} C {{extension}} {{had been completed}} in 1926, possibilities for the northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear. From 1922, a series of press campaigns called {{for the improvement of}} services at the GNR's Finsbury Park station where interchanges between tube lines, mainline trains, buses and trams were notoriously bad. In June 1923, a petition from 30,000 local residents was submitted to parliament, and, in 1925, the government called a public inquiry to review options. Pick presented plans to relieve the congestion at Finsbury Park by extending the Piccadilly tube north to Southgate. Opposition from the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GNR following the 1923 grouping of railway companies) was again considerable and based on claims that the new Underground line would take passengers from the mainline services. Using data from the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead tube and C extensions, Pick demonstrated that the route planned for the new line would stimulate new residential development and increase passenger numbers for all rail operators in the area, increasing those on the Piccadilly tube by 50 million per year. Parliamentary approval was granted in 1930 to extend the Piccadilly tube north beyond Southgate to a terminus at Cockfosters. The approval also included complementary extensions of the Piccadilly tube from its western terminus at Hammersmith to supplement District Railway services to Hounslow and South Harrow. The development was again financed with government backed loans, this time through the 1929 Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act. To ensure the most efficient integration between the new tube line and the UERL's bus and tram operations, the stations were located further apart than in central areas and where road transport services could be arranged to deliver and collect the most passengers. At Manor House, the station was designed with subway exits directly on to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>islands</b> in the road served by the local trams.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The risk of {{collision}} between pedestrians and powered two-wheelers {{is poorly}} understood today. Other than the study by Paulozzi (2005) which showed that, per kilometer covered in towns, the risk for powered two-wheeler drivers to fatally injure a pedestrian is 2. 02 times (95 % CI: 1. 23; 3. 30) greater than the risk for automobile drivers, no other scientific studies have dealt with this question {{as far as we}} know. The objective of this research is to determine the risk for powered two-wheeler drivers of hitting and injuring a pedestrian per kilometer driven in towns and to compare this risk with that run by four-wheeled vehicle drivers. Method: Using the bodily injury accidents recorded by the police on nine roads in the city of Marseille in 2011 and a campaign of observations of powered two-wheeler traffic, we estimated the risk per kilometer driven by powered two-wheeler drivers of hitting a pedestrian and compared it with the risk run by four-wheeled vehicle drivers. Results: The results show that the risk for powered two-wheeler drivers of hitting and injuring a pedestrian is significantly higher than the risk run by four-wheeled vehicle drivers. On the nine roads studied, it is on average 3. 33 times higher (95 % CI: 1. 63; 6. 78). Taking four more years into account made it possible to consolidate these results and to tighten the confidence interval. Conclusion: There does indeed seem to be problems in the interactions between pedestrians and powered two-wheeler users in urban traffic. These interaction problems lead to a higher risk of hitting and injuring a pedestrian for powered two-wheeler drivers than for four-wheeled vehicle drivers. The analysis of the police reports suggests that part of this increased risk comes from filtering maneuvers by powered two-wheelers. Practical Applications effective: Possible countermeasures deal with the urban street layout. Measures consisting in reducing the width and the number of traffic lanes to a strict minimum and installing medians or <b>pedestrian</b> <b>islands,</b> could be an effective way for the prevention of urban accidents between pedestrians and powered two-wheelers...|$|R
