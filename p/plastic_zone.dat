5000|$|Irwin was {{the first}} to observe that if the size of the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> around a crack is small {{compared}} {{to the size of the}} crack, the energy required to grow the crack will not be critically dependent on the state of stress (the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone)</b> at the crack tip. [...] In other words, a purely elastic solution may be used to calculate the amount of energy available for fracture.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> created around the tips of cracks in glassy polymers, under small scale yielding, can be confronted by using the two {{well-known}} pressure-modified yield criteria and the elastic solution of the problem. There is particular interest {{in the case of}} a cracked body reinforced by another more resisting body under plane-strain conditions. The shapes of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> developed around the tips of the crack subjected to opening mode loading conditions are examined as the crack approaches perpendicularly the bimaterial interface. For the study of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> the exact solution derived from Muskhelishvili's complex potentials was used. Moreover, the <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> are confronted using either the exact solution or Sneddon's asymptotic expansion...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> associated with initial crack-tip yielding, subcritical crack growth, and unstable fracture is discussed. The results of the measurement of the locus of these yield regions, on center-cracked sheet and compact tension specimens of 7075 -T 6, 7075 -T 651, and 2024 -T 3 aluminum, are reported in this paper. It was found that a very accurate representation of the strains was obtained by this method and that the results added significant insight into the fracture process. The <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> {{were found to be}} approximately eight times wider in 2024 -T 3 than in the 7075 -T 6 sheets. The yield zones approached a maximum value after unstable fracture was attained and maintained that size through the fast fracture region. As expected, the <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> in the compact tension specimen were associated only with the formation of the shear lips and no <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> were observed in the fatigue precracked regions of either the center-cracked or compact-tension specimens...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} calculations are performed of crack tip <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> in CT-specimens of the aluminum alloy Al 7075. With specimens of in-plane dimensions sufficient for measuring valid fracture toughnesses KIc the specimen thickness is varied {{over a large}} range. Compared to the “dog-bone ” model the results show characteristic differences: The crack tip <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> near to or at the specimen surface do in general {{not agree with the}} usual results of 2 D plane stress calculations. Furthermore, for specimen thicknesses well above the usual minimum thickness the crack tip <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> have not decayed yet to the size of 2 D plane strain calculations. The conventional minimum size specimen requirements for determining valid fracture toughnesses are addressed in view of the found results...|$|R

5000|$|Models {{of ideal}} {{materials}} {{have shown that}} this zone of plasticity is centered at the crack tip. This equation gives the approximate ideal radius of the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> deformation beyond the crack tip, which is useful to many structural scientists because it gives a good estimate of how the material behaves when subjected to stress. In the above equation, {{the parameters of the}} stress intensity factor and indicator of material toughness, , and the yield stress, , are of importance because they illustrate many things about the material and its properties, as well as about the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> size. For example, if [...] is high, then it can be deduced that the material is tough, whereas if [...] is high, one knows that the material is more ductile. The ratio of these two parameters is important to the radius of the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone.</b> For instance, if [...] is small, then the squared ratio of [...] to [...] is large, which results in a larger plastic radius. This implies that the material can plastically deform, and, therefore, is tough. This estimate {{of the size of the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> beyond the crack tip can then be used to more accurately analyze how a material will behave in the presence of a crack.|$|E
40|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>zones</b> around crack-tips in {{tungsten}} were characterised by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Pre-cracks {{were made}} in ~ 1 mm square cross section beams of pure single-crystal tungsten using a spark erosion method. The beams were loaded at different temperatures {{to a range of}} stress intensity factors below the fracture toughness. High resolution EBSD patterns were recorded in a two dimensional array {{in the vicinity of the}} crack-tip on sectioned samples. Cross-correlation based analysis of these patterns was used to determine lattice rotations associated with the plastic deformation near the cracks. Crystal rotations in the plane of observation were found to dominate over rotations in other planes. For all specimens deformed above the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature, <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> were found to extend from the crack tips on along narrow bands along { 110 } planes. The sizes of the <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> and their associated lattice rotations were determined as a function of loading history...|$|R
40|$|We present here a model which {{explains}} {{the mechanism of}} generation of unrest episodes at Campi Flegrei caldera from a mechanical point of view. The mechanism involves the effects of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> at {{the borders of the}} inner collapsed area on both static deformations and seismicity. The large amount of ground uplift observed necessarily calls for plastic effects. These effects are interpreted as concentrated at the caldera borders: the generation of such <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> is simulated in terms of the mechanisms leading to the caldera collapse. In order to simulate the influence of such <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> on both ground deformations and seismicity we model them as surfaces of discontinuities free from shear stress within an elastic homogeneous half-space. The presence of such discontinuities allows the inner caldera block to move differentially from the outer areas, by slip along the <b>plastic</b> bordering <b>zones.</b> Such a differential uplift of the central block causes the concentration of the ground deformation. Our model explains a lot of puzzling observations at Campi Flegrei in terms {{of the effects of the}} caldera structure. The model is applicable to other caldera areas, which show typical evidence for the effects of such discontinuity zones, during unrest episodes...|$|R
50|$|High {{ductility}} {{and flowing}} material {{can be considered}} a general prerequisite for excessive material transfer and galling because frictional heating is closely linked to the structure of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> around penetrating objects.|$|R
50|$|Inclusions in a {{material}} {{such as a}} second phase particles can act similar to brittle grains that can affect crack propagation. Fracture or decohesion at the inclusion can either be caused by the external applied stress or by the dislocations generated by the requirement of the inclusion to maintain contiguity with the matrix around it. Similar to grains, the fracture {{is most likely to}} occur at the plastic-elastic zone boundary. Then the crack can linkup back to the main crack. If the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> is small or the density of the inclusions is small, the fracture is more likely to directly link up with the main crack tip. If the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> is large, or the density of inclusions is high, additional inclusion fractures may occur within the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone,</b> and linkup occurs by progressing from the crack to the closest fracturing inclusion within the zone.|$|E

50|$|The {{formation}} and constitution (physique) of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> around penetrating objects are arguably a prerequisite {{and the main}} factor for excessive material transfer, lump growth, and galling build-up even in the initial contact process.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} {{inclusions}} on the shape and size of crack tip <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> in engineering materials subjected to static loads by employing the element free Galerkin method (EFGM). The modeling of the discontinuities produced by cracks and inclusions becomes independent of the grid chosen for analysis. The standard displacement approximation is modified by adding additional enrichment functions, which introduce the effects of different discontinuities into the formulation. The level set method {{has been used to}} represent different discontinuities present in the domain. The effect of inclusions on the extent of crack tip <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> is investigated by solving some numerical problems by the EFGM...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} was {{investigated}} in a 001 oriented single crystal specimen, made of a Ni-based superalloy, Haynes 230. Crack propagation was characterized with digital image correlation: crack closure, measured by analyzing the relative displacements of crack flanks, showed closure levels much lower than polycrystal alloys. Reversed <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> were calculated from regressed stress intensity factor ranges and compared to the strain field measured at the crack tip. Experimental results were compared to those provided by a numerical model, which considered both crack propagation and single crystal anisotropic behavior, in terms of crack opening levels and crack tip cyclic <b>plastic</b> <b>zones.</b> Results of the numerical simulations were in good agreement with the experiments...|$|R
50|$|In ductile {{materials}} (and even {{in materials}} {{that appear to}} be brittle), a <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> develops {{at the tip of the}} crack. As the applied load increases, the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> increases in size until the crack grows and the elastically strained material behind the crack tip unloads. The plastic loading and unloading cycle near the crack tip leads to the dissipation of energy as heat. Hence, a dissipative term has to be added to the energy balance relation devised by Griffith for brittle materials. In physical terms, additional energy is needed for crack growth in ductile materials as compared to brittle materials.|$|E
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that {{depending}} on the crystal structure, this behavior can be different. For example, face-centered cubic (FCC) metals remain ductile even at low temperatures, so a <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> is always present.|$|E
50|$|Galling often {{occurs with}} {{aluminium}} compounds {{and is a}} common cause of tool breakdown. Aluminium is a ductile metal, which means it possesses the ability for plastic flow with relative ease, which presupposes a relatively consistent and large <b>plastic</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Residual stress {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} in a thermoplastic composite laminated plate for transverse loading. Low-density polyethylene thermoplastic matrix (LDPE) and steel fibers are used to produce the composite plates by using molds. The first order shear deformation theory and nine nodes Lagrangian finite element is used. Mathematical formulation is given for the residual {{stress analysis}} of a laminated plate for small deformations. Yield points and stresses are obtained for symmetric and antisymmetric laminated plates with a circular hole. Residual stresses in plates are given in tables. The expansion of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> is illustrated for 500, 750 and 1000 load steps. Yield points {{and the expansion of}} <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> are compared for different plates with a circular hole. Mechanical properties of a layer are obtained experimentally...|$|R
30|$|Finally, the {{mechanical}} {{performance of the}} splices, e.g., the ultimate strengths and ultimate deformation capacities, was relatively weak {{compared to that of}} the reinforcing steel bars. This may lead to performance variation in the <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>zones</b> of precast structural members in which grouted splices are used. Particularly, in earthquake-prone areas, the <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>zones</b> must resist earthquake-induced deformations and stresses. The performance of the <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>zones</b> partially depend on {{the mechanical}} performance of the reinforcement and the grouted splices (Ameli et al. 2015). However, this issue {{is beyond the scope of}} this study and needs further research.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a calculation method for thermo-elasto-plastic stressed-deformed state in two-layer cylindrical bodies due to abrupt temperature changes on outer load-free boundary. The boundaries of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> at various relations correlations between stress-strain {{properties of the}} internal and external cylinders and distribution of residual stresses after temperature unloading have determined in the paper...|$|R
50|$|At low temperatures, {{where the}} {{material}} can become completely brittle, {{such as in}} a body-centered cubic (BCC) metal, the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> shrinks away, and only the elastic zone exists. In this state, the crack will propagate by successive cleavage of the grains. At these low temperatures, the yield strength is high, but the fracture strain and crack tip radius of curvature are low, leading to a low toughness.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of grains in a material can affect its toughness by affecting the way cracks propagate. In {{front of a}} crack, a <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> can be present as the material yields. Beyond that region, the material remains elastic. The conditions for fracture are the most favorable at the boundary between this plastic and elastic zone, and thus cracks often initiate by the cleavage of a grain at that location.|$|E
50|$|The {{same process}} as {{described}} above for a single event loading also applies and to cyclic loading. If a crack is present in a specimen that undergoes cyclic loading, the specimen will plastically deform at the crack tip and delay the crack growth. In {{the event of an}} overload or excursion, this model changes slightly to accommodate the sudden increase in stress from that which the material previously experienced. At a sufficiently high load (overload), the crack grows out of the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> that contained it and leaves behind the pocket of the original plastic deformation. Now, assuming that the overload stress is not sufficiently high as to completely fracture the specimen, the crack will undergo further plastic deformation around the new crack tip, enlarging the zone of residual plastic stresses. This process further toughens and prolongs the life of the material because the new <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> is larger than what it would be under the usual stress conditions. This allows the material to undergo more cycles of loading. This idea can be illustrated further by the graph of Aluminum with a center crack undergoing overloading events.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical analysis}} was conducted to investigate {{the effects of a}} new shield tunnel excavation on the internal forces and deformation induced in an existing parallel tunnel and soil <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> around it. Special attention was paid to the influence of relative positions between two tunnels. The results of the analysis show that the relative positions affect the mechanical behavior of the existing parallel tunnel and the soil mass behavior around it. When a new tunnel is driven below or above an existing parallel tunnel, important increments are induced in deformation and bending moment in the lining of existing tunnel at its crown and springline, compared to that of induced by new tunnel excavation in horizontally parallel to the existing one. The <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> around tunnels also extend larger when tunnels are driven in vertically parallel than they are in horizontally parallel. For the safety concern, it is concluded that horizontally parallel configuration model between two tunnels should be adopted in practice...|$|R
50|$|In solid surface contact or unlubricated conditions, {{the initial}} contact is characterised by {{interaction}} between asperities and the exhibition {{of two different}} sorts of attraction: cohesive surface-energy or the molecules connect and adhere the two surfaces together, notably {{even if they are}} separated by a measurable distance. Direct contact and plastic deformation generates another type of attraction through the constitution of a <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> with flowing material where induced energy, pressure and temperature allow bonding between the surfaces on a much larger scale than cohesive surface-energy.|$|E
50|$|But {{a problem}} arose for the NRL {{researchers}} because naval materials, e.g., ship-plate steel, are not perfectly elastic but undergo significant plastic deformation {{at the tip}} of a crack. One basic assumption in Irwin's linear elastic fracture mechanics is small scale yielding, the condition that the size of the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> is small compared to the crack length. However, this assumption is quite restrictive for certain types of failure in structural steels though such steels can be prone to brittle fracture, which has led to a number of catastrophic failures.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{adhesive}} wear {{occurs when}} two bodies slide over or are pressed into each other, which promote material transfer. This {{can be described}} as plastic deformation of very small fragments within the surface layers. The asperities or microscopic high points or surface roughness found on each surface, define the severity on how fragments of oxides are pulled off and adds to the other surface, partly due to strong adhesive forces between atoms but also due to accumulation of energy in the <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> between the asperities during relative motion.|$|E

40|$|An elastic-plastic {{analysis}} of anisotropic laminated composite {{plate with a}} circular hole is carried out using a 2 -dimensional finite element model based on higher order shear deformation theory. The variation in material properties through thickness is defined using discrete layer approach. The generalized Huber-Mises yield criterion for anisotropic material is {{used to determine the}} onset of plastic flow. The inclusion of anisotropic parameters of plasticity generalizes the plastic yield function. These anisotropic parameters of plasticity are updated during the hardening history of anisotropic laminated composite plate. The plastic potential, which is an anisotropic yield function, is used to determine an associated flow rule. Finally, an elastic-plastic incremental constitutive relation is obtained using finite element method. By means of an incremental and iterative procedure, the numerical solution of deformation problems in nonlinear anisotropic laminated plate is achieved using higher order shear deformation theory. The spread of <b>plastic</b> <b>zones</b> around the circular holes are discussed.
