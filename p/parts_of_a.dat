5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins. These may represent two independent polypeptides (such as two <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heterodimer), or may have originally been halves of a single protein that underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides.|$|E

5|$|Fold order. Determining {{the order}} in which {{different}} <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein fold is challenging due to the extremely fast time scales involved. Circularly permuted versions of proteins will often fold in a different order, providing information about the folding of the original protein.|$|E

50|$|Forced {{pregnancy}} is the practice <b>of</b> forcing <b>a</b> woman to become pregnant, often as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forced marriage, or as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> programme <b>of</b> breeding slaves, or as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> programme <b>of</b> genocide.

5|$|Although The Marble Index {{was largely}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it has {{achieved}} acclaim from music critics over time. Nico's unprecedented sound and personal style—both recognised for their tenebrous quality—are considered an influence on several artists. Most notably, they served as a musical and visual prototype for the 1980s post-punk movement's gothic rock scene. Nico and Cale continued working together, releasing two more studio albums in the same vein—Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974)—which are now considered <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trilogy.|$|E

5|$|Dunkeswell Abbey, a Cistercian monastery and {{offshoot}} of Forde Abbey, {{was founded in}} 1201 by William Briwere. The abbey was closed in 1539 and granted to Lord Russell. It was mostly demolished promptly, though a section remained in domestic use until the 19th century. In 1842, a parish church was built {{on a part of}} the site. Some surviving fragments of monastery include the partial end wall of the cellarers range and <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gatehouse.

This form is rare since {{even a small}} amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> population.

5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed {{the presence of}} a second species, G. latidens, from slightly older rocks in Montana than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta. Based on two <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> skeleton collected in 1916 for the American Museum of Natural History, G. latidens is also known from bonebed material. Horner, who described the specimens, considered it to be a less derived species.|$|E
5|$|Hoysala temples have {{distinct}} {{parts that}} are merged {{to form a}} unified organic whole, {{in contrast to the}} temples of Tamil country where different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temple stand independently. Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft soapstone (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate carving, executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.|$|E

5|$|In {{many forms}} of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other {{structural}} elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (or, {{in the case of}} the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poem. For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.|$|E
