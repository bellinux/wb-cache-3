40|$|Abstract in Undetermined In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the roles of}} different diversity mechanisms in two recently proposed six-port MIMO antennas using the effective degree-of-freedom concept. In particular, we confirm that angle and <b>polarization</b> <b>diversities</b> are indeed the dominant diversity mechanisms for the compact antenna {{that is designed to}} replicate the characteristics of the ideal co-located six-port antenna. On the other hand, a physically larger reference antenna is found to offer substantial space diversity, in addition to angle and <b>polarization</b> <b>diversities,</b> allowing it to outperform the compact antenna in propagation scenarios with narrow angular spreads...|$|R

The fabricated antenna has both an acceptable return loss and a broadside axial ratio (AR) lower than 2 dB at each operation frequency. The frequency and <b>polarization</b> <b>diversities</b> of this design could potentially improve the reliability of wireless communication systems...|$|R

50|$|An {{advantage}} {{inherent to}} patch antennas {{is the ability}} to have <b>polarization</b> <b>diversity.</b> Patch antennas can easily be designed to have vertical, horizontal, right hand circular (RHCP) or left hand circular (LHCP) polarizations, using multiple feed points, or a single feedpoint with asymmetric patch structures. This unique property allows patch antennas to be used in many types of communications links that may have varied requirements.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polarization</b> <b>diversity</b> {{combines}} {{pairs of}} antennas with orthogonal polarizations (i.e. horizontal/vertical, ± slant 45°, Left-hand/Right-hand circular polarization etc.). Reflected signals can undergo polarization changes {{depending on the}} medium through which they are traveling. A polarization difference of 90° will result in an attenuation factor of up to 34 dB in signal strength. By pairing two complementary polarizations, this scheme can immunize a system from polarization mismatches that would otherwise cause signal fade. Additionally, such diversity has proven valuable at radio and mobile communication base stations since it is less susceptible to the near random orientations of transmitting antennas.|$|E

The concept is illustrated in Figure 3 (to be uploaded). [...] A diffraction grating breaks the incoming light into a spectrum. A software controlled binary liquid crystal stack, individually tilts each optical channel and a second grating (or a second pass of the first grating) is used to spectrally recombine the beams. The offsets created by the liquid crystal stack cause the resulting spectrally recombined beams to be spatially offset, and hence to focus, through a lens array, into separate fibers. <b>Polarization</b> <b>diversity</b> optics ensures low Polarization Dependent Losses (PDL).|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} and earliest commercial WSS {{were based}} on movable mirrors using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). [...] A schematic of a MEMS-based WSS is shown in Figure 2 (to be uploaded). The incoming light is broken into a spectrum by a diffraction grating (shown at RHS of Figure) and each wavelength channel then focuses on a separate MEMS mirror. By tilting the mirror in one dimension, the channel can be directed back {{into any of the}} fibers in the array. A second tilting axis allows transient crosstalk to be minimised, otherwise switching (eg) from port 1 to port 3 will always involve passing the beam across port 2. The second axis provides a means to attenuate the signal without increasing the coupling into neighbouring fibers. This technology has the advantage of a single steering surface, not necessarily requiring <b>polarization</b> <b>diversity</b> optics. It works well {{in the presence of a}} continuous signal, allowing the mirror tracking circuits to dither the mirror and maximise coupling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{analyze the}} impact of <b>polarization</b> <b>diversity</b> on the {{capacity}} of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in indoor environments. A channel measurement campaign was conducted at 2. 4 GHz to measure the co-polarized and crosspolarized subchannels under line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-ofsight (NLOS) channel conditions. We analyze the measured data in terms of Ricean K-factor, cross-polar discrimination (XPD) and subchannel correlations. A major contribution {{of this paper is}} that in these measured channels, we observe a coincidence of low K factors and high XPD. In such channels, MIMO systems employing <b>polarization</b> <b>diversity</b> incur SNR and diversity deficits, when compared to spatial configurations. On the other hand, our results indicate that <b>polarization</b> <b>diversity</b> can substantially lower the subchannel correlations for compact configurations, even in a LOS scenario.

40|$|Abstract—Both the interchannel {{coupling}} (CC) among multiple compact circuitry {{channels and}} the antenna polarization coupling (APC) due to angular deviation of antennas (ADA) in diversity sys-tems cannot be neglected in practice. The {{effects of these}} two prob-lems are considered in this paper. The investigation of the CC in a two-branch orthogonal <b>polarization</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> system is ex-tended {{to the case of}} a general multibranch <b>polarization</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> system, and the CC is investigated together with APC by applying a network theory framework. Their effects on both the correlation and the mean power ratio among received signals are obtained. It is found that the effects of both kinds of couplings {{as well as that of}} the combining signal processing on the received sig-nals can be considered as a series of weightings. Two equivalent relations among APC, CC, and ADA are developed. Such equiva-lences reveal insights into CC from the point of view of antennas and provide additional degree-of-freedom for system optimization to improve the diversity performance. Furthermore, two kinds of compensation techniques are also developed to mitigate the APC and CC, as well as to enhance the diversity performance. Finally, some numerical results are presented to validate the analyses.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} channel sounding {{technique has}} been used to investigate the cross-polarization of electromagnetic waves in the 5 - 6 GHz band. Experiments were performed in two non-line-of-sight indoor locations, and it was found that there is a strong dependency of the cross-polarization of multipath components on the elevation angle-of-arrival. For a vertically polarized transmitting antenna, clusters of co-polarized multipath components were confined predominantly to the region around the horizontal plane that contains the virtual line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver. In contrast, cross-polarized signals were detected for a variety of elevation angles with considerable power levels. The surroundings of the receiver were identified as the principal source of depolarized signals. In addition, time dispersion analysis of the multipath signals led to the determination of the AoAs where there is a strong correspondence between co- and cross-polarized signals {{as a consequence of the}} partial depolarization of MPCs.

Among the different propagation scenarios, the indoor channels represent a particularly challenging problem given the number and complexity of interactions between the transmitted signal and the environment. This dissertation explores the interrelation between propagation physics and space-time-polarization diversity based on a novel high resolution channel sounding and reconstruction technique. First, a method to reconstruct the indoor complex channel response based on a limited set of samples and the elimination of the interference using deconvolution techniques is presented. Then, the results for the joint angle-of-arrival, delay characterization and depolarization of electromagnetic waves are presented. Finally, a novel approach to using depolarized multipath signals to boost the receiver signal-to-noise performance is presented.
