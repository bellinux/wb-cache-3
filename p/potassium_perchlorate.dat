5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with <b>potassium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> as oxidizer.|$|E

40|$|Liquid water {{processes}} {{that may occur}} {{on the surface and}} near-subsurface of Mars have important implications for the present-day water cycle, habitability, and planetary protection policies. The presence of salts on Mars plays a role in surface-atmosphere interactions as salts enhance the soil 2 ̆ 7 s ability to retain water. This thesis explores the phase transitions of water upon interaction with Mars relevant salt analogs. Water uptake and loss properties of a single and complex Mars analog are examined using a Raman microscope equipped with an environmental cell. The effect of the hygroscopic salts on bacterial spores was evaluated with a focus on potential terrestrial contamination on outbound spacecraft and its influence on planetary protection concerns. Calcium perchlorate (Ca(ClO 4) 2) is a highly deliquescent salt that may exist on the surface of present-day Mars. Here, we quantify the deliquescent relative humidity (DRH) and efflorescent relative humidity (ERH) of Ca(ClO 4) 2 as a function of temperature (223 K to 273 K) to elucidate its behavior on the surface of Mars. Mars relevant temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions were simulated and deliquescence (solid to aqueous) and efflorescence (aqueous to solid) phase transitions of Ca(ClO 4) 2 were characterized. Experimental DRH values were compared to a thermodynamic model for three hydration states of Ca(ClO 4) 2. Calcium perchlorate was found to supersaturate, with lower ERH values than DRH values. Additionally, we conducted a 17 -hour experiment to simulate a subsurface relative humidity and temperature diurnal cycle. This demonstrated that aqueous Ca(ClO 4) 2 solutions can persist without efflorescing for the majority of a martian sol, up to 17 hours under Mars temperature heating rates and RH conditions. Applying these experimental results to martian surface and subsurface heat and mass transfer models, we find that aqueous Ca(ClO 4) 2 solutions could persist for most of the martian sol under present-day conditions. To investigate complex brine mixtures, a salt analog, deemed `Instant Mars, 2 ̆ 7 was developed to closely match the individual cation and anion concentrations as reported by the Wet Chemistry Laboratory instrument at the Phoenix landing site. `Instant Mars 2 ̆ 7 was developed to fully encompass and closely replicate correct concentrations of magnesium, calcium, <b>potassium,</b> sodium, <b>perchlorate,</b> chloride, and sulfate ions.

40|$|Instrumentation {{such as the}} Chemistry and Mineralogy {{instrument}} (CheMin) on {{the ongoing}} Mars Science Lab rover mission is able to gather information from a sample almost immediately upon collection on the Martian surface; however, detecting molecular signs of extinct and extant life, or 28 STAR Closing Conference biosignatures, at low concentrations may require equipment with an even greater level of sensitivity. The capability of detecting biomolecules with a confidence acceptable to the scientific community exists on Earth, and at {{the current state of}} these technologies, it would be extremely challenging to miniaturize all relevant instrumentation for flight. The gathering and return of samples from the surface of Mars is likely paramount in the identification and confirmation of biosignatures. Sample containers would be expected to not corrode on the Martian surface or interact with the samples, and a gap of knowledge exists in this area. There are two parts to this study.

40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} the {{equilibrium}} transition temperatures of materials can be accurately determined using two developed methodologies designed {{to be used with}} differential scanning calorimeters. These methods are the extrapolation to zero heating rate and a stepwise isothermal method. The use of these methods allows for the instrument, which is typically scanning in nature to produce accurate temperature values under near equilibrium conditions. By employing the DSC methodologies for accurate temperature measurements it has been possible to determine a range of temperatures of transition and fusions under near equilibrium conditions for inorganic <b>potassium</b> salts (nitrate, <b>perchlorate,</b> and dinitramide), and rubidium salts (nitrate, and dinitramide) all of which have transitions of pyrotechnic interest. In cases where decomposition occurs at slower heating rates, the modification of the extrapolation to zero heating method to incorporate the use of faster heating rates above 10 °C min- 1 has enabled accurate temperatures of transition to be determined. In addition, this thesis also explores the use of materials with solid-solid transitions susceptible to thermal history such as potassium nitrate and re-evaluates the suitability for use in DSC calibration. The close proximity in temperature of the LGC Limited DSC standards indium and diphenylacetic acid, has enabled a direct assessment to be made of any resulting from the use of a metal or an organic substance in the calibration of DSC equipment. These measurements clearly established that indium may be used as a calibrant when making accurate equilibrium temperature and enthalpy measurements on organic materials in the same temperature range. Accurate enthalpy measurements have also been made on the above inorganic nitrates and perchlorates and measurements on the transitions of rubidium nitrate have established that equivalent values are given by heat flux and power compensated instruments. Enthalpy measurements on organic DSC calibration standards in the range 42 - 147 °C using a power compensated instrument demonstrated that there was no significant error in using indium as a single point calibrant for measurements on the fusion of organic materials at lower temperatures...|$|R

When dissociation was incomplete, two additional peaks were present, peak Ia eluting at the same volume as the whole hemoglobin and peak Ib (200 kDa). Scanning transmission electron micrographs of peak Ia showed it to consist of whole molecules and of incomplete hexagonal bilayer structures, missing an apparent 1 / 12 th. Peak Ib contained all four subunits but was usually deficient in subunits D 1 and D 2, was not always in equilibrium with the whole molecule, and could be dissociated further into II and III. The patterns of dissociation observed at neutral pH were very similar to those observed previously at alkaline pH and at acid pH and appear to be incompatible with the generally accepted multimeric model of Lumbricus hemoglobin subunit structure. A model is proposed in which it is postulated that the stoichiometries of some of the subunits need not be constant and that subunits D 1 and D 2 either form a "bracelet" decorated with complexes of T and M subunits or serve as "linkers" between the latter, to provide the appearance of a two-tiered hexagonal structure. Additional support for the proposed model comes from observations that the fragment II obtained subsequent to dissociation at pH 4, in sodium phosphotungstate, in sodium <b>perchlorate,</b> and in <b>potassium</b> thiocyanate was found to be in equilibrium with a hexagonal bilayer structure IaR(II), whose dimensions were approximately equal to 20 % smaller than those of the native hemoglobin...|$|R
