The aim {{of this paper is to}} clarify the role of multi-target <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> using the case of agri-environmental policy. Employing an {{analytical}} linear optimisation model, this paper demonstrates that there is no general contradiction between multi-target <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> and the Tinbergen Rule, if multi-target <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> are embedded in a policy-mix with a sufficient number of targeted instruments. We show that the relation between cost-effectiveness of the instruments, related to all policy targets, is the key determinant for an economically sound choice of <b>policy</b> <b>instruments.</b> If economies of scope with respect to achieving policy targets are realised, a higher cost-effectiveness of multi-target <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> can be achieved. Using the example of organic farming support policy, we discuss several reasons why economies of scope could be realised by multi-target agri-environmental <b>policy</b> <b>instruments...</b>|$|R

25|$|After the EPA had {{introduced}} watershed-based NPDES permitting in 2007, interest in nutrient removal and achieving regional TMDLs {{led to the}} development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a type of water quality trading, a market-based <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program.|$|E

All five instruments where implemented in countries from the north of Europe (Finland, Norway, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands), which facilitates a comparison since administrational cultures and market conditions are fairly similar. The focus of the paper is to discuss and compare some key factors that contributed to success or failure in the implementation of the five <b>policy</b> <b>instruments.</b> It is argued that there are some important explanatory factors that all, or most, of the <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> have in common.
