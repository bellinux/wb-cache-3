50|$|Unlike {{all other}} species {{previously}} {{placed in the}} genus Pionopsitta, the <b>pileated</b> <b>parrot</b> {{does not have a}} contrasting brownish-olive chest, and recently it was established via mtDNA that it is indeed distinct enough for the others to be moved into a separate genus, Pyrilia, again making Pionopsitta monotypic. The plumage of the <b>pileated</b> <b>parrot</b> is overall green with bluish flight feathers, a faint brownish-maroon auricular patch (lacking in juveniles) and, in the male, a bright red forehead that extends down to just below the eyes.|$|E

50|$|The {{brown-hooded parrot}} (Pyrilia haematotis) {{is a small}} parrot which is a {{resident}} breeding species from southeastern Mexico to north-western Colombia. Until recently, it {{was placed in the}} genus Pionopsitta, which now is restricted to the type species, the <b>pileated</b> <b>parrot.</b> It is sometimes considered conspecific with the rose-faced parrot (P. pulchra). This species has been adversely affected by deforestation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pileated</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pionopsitta pileata), {{also known}} as the red-capped parrot (leading to easy {{confusion}} with the Australian Purpureicephalus spurius), is a medium-small species of parrot with a total length of about 22 cm. It is found in or near the Atlantic Forest in south-eastern Brazil, far north-eastern Argentina and eastern Paraguay. A local name in Paraguayan Guaraní is cúiu cúiu.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was placed}} in the {{monotypic}} genus Purpureicephalus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The generic name is an amalgam of the Latin purpureus [...] "purple", and the Ancient Greek kephalé [...] "head". The specific epithet spurius is the Latin adjective meaning [...] "illegitimate", and refers to the very different adult and immature plumages (hence appearing unrelated). Besides red-capped parrot, vernacular names include <b>pileated</b> <b>parrot,</b> western king parrot, purple-crowned parrot, grey parrot or hookbill.|$|E
