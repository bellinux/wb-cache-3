Increasingly global payment schemes guarantee broad acceptance, and the available technologies and standardization efforts are making transactions more reliable, convenient, and inexpensive for merchants. Perhaps the most important factor, however, in the success of card-based New Terminals, New Trends Financial terminals have become the vehicle for delivering a range of new services from payment-products companies. Terminals are no longer simple card-reading machines. They have become sophisticated computing devices capable of performing transactions, managing inventories, and running business applications. This changing role is clearly indicated by the new terminology used to describe terminals: formerly known as point-of-sale (POS) devices, they are now called point-of-interaction (POI) systems. POI systems must now communicate faster and more easily (e. g., with USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi®, or Bluetooth®).

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{triggered by}} recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and elicits the silencing of gene(s) complementary to the dsRNA sequence. RNAi {{is thought to}} have emerged as a way of safeguarding the genome against mobile genetic elements and viral infection, thus maintaining genomic integrity. dsRNA is first processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNA) by the enzyme Dicer. siRNAs are ~ 21 to 25 -nt long, and contain a signature 5 ’ phosphate group and a two nucleotide long 3 ’ overhang (Bernstein et al., 2001). The siRNA is then loaded into the RNA-induced si-lencing complex (RISC), of which Argonaute is the primary catalytic component (Liu et al., 2004). Energetic asymmetry of the siRNA ends allows for its directional loading into RISC (Khvorova et al., 2003; Schwarz et al., 2003). Argonaute cleaves the passen-ger strand of the siRNA, leaving the guide strand of the siRNA bound to RISC (Gregory et al., 2005; Matranga et al., 2005; Rand et al., 2005). This single-stranded guide strand siRNA bound to Argonaute is able to recognize target mRNA in a sequence-specific manner, and cleaves the mRNA. Argonaute 2 in complex with single-stranded siRNA is sufficient for mRNA recognition and cleavage, thus forming a minimal RISC (Rivas et al., 2005). miRNAs, endogenously expressed small RNA genes which typically contain mismatches and non-Watson-Crick base pairing, are processed by this general pathway, although typically modulate gene expression by translational repression as opposed to cleavage of their target mRNA. The number of Argonaute genes is highly variable between species, ranging from one in S. pombe to twenty-seven in C. elegans. Earlier crystal structures of Argonaute apoen-zymes show the architecture of Argonaute to be a multidomain protein composed of N terminal, PAZ, MID, and PIWI domains (Song et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2005). These multi-domain proteins are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The role of Argonaute proteins in prokaryotes is still unknown, but based similarity to eu-karyotic Argonautes, they may also be involved in nucleic acid-directed regulatory pathways. These proteins have served as excellent models for learning about the struc-ture and function of this family of proteins. RNAi has found a widespread application for the simple yet effective knockdown of genes of interest. The catalytic cycle of RISC requires the binding of a number of different nucleotide structures to Argonaute, and we expect Argonaute to undergo a number of conforma-tional changes during the cycle of mRNA recognition by RISC (Filipowicz, 2005; Tom-ari and Zamore, 2005). Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the multi-domain ar-rangement of Argonaute recognizes and distinguishes between single-stranded and dou-ble-stranded oligonucleotides, which correspond to the Dicer-processed siRNA <b>product,</b> <b>guide</b> strand siRNA, and the guide strand / mRNA duplex. The Argonaute protein from Aquifex aeolicus was cloned, expressed, crystallized and solved by molecular replacement. Relative to earlier Argonaute structures, a 24 ° reorientation of the PAZ domain in this structure opens a basic cleft between the N-terminal and PAZ domains, exposing the guide strand binding pocket of PAZ. A 5. 5 -ns molecular dynamics simulation of Argonaute showed a strong tendency of the PAZ and N-terminal domains to be mobile. Binding of single-stranded DNA to Argonaute was monitored by total internal reflection fluorescence spectroscopy (TIRFS). The experi-ments showed biphasic kinetics indicative of large conformational changes, and re-vealed a hotspot of binding energy corresponding to the first 9 nucleotides, the so-called “seed region” most crucial for sequence-specific target recognition. As RNAi may have evolved as a way of safeguarding the genome viral infection, {{it is not surprising that}} viruses have evolved different strategies to suppress the host RNAi response in the form of viral suppressor protein. (Hock and Meister, 2008; Lecellier and Voinnet, 2004; Rashid et al., 2007; Song et al., 2004; Vastenhouw and Plasterk, 2004). These viral suppressors are widespread, having been identified in a number of different viral families. Not surprisingly, they generally share little sequence homology with one another, although they appear to exist as oligomers built upon a ~ 100 - 200 amino acid protomer. Tomato aspermy virus, a member of the Cucumoviruses, encodes for protein 2 B (TAV 2 B, 95 a. a., ~ 11. 3 kDa) that acts as an RNAi suppressor. Intriguingly, a similar genomic arrangement is seen in RNAi suppressors in the Nodaviruses, a family of viruses that can infect both plants and animals, such as Flock house virus b 2 (FHV b 2). The 2 B and b 2 proteins are both derived from a frameshifted ORF within the RNA polymerase gene (Chao et al., 2005). In spite of this genomic similarity, the 2 B and b 2 proteins share little sequence identity, and it is not well understood how the Cucumovirus 2 B proteins suppress RNAi. To address how TAV 2 B suppresses RNAi, the oligonucleotide-binding properties of TAV 2 B were studied. TAV 2 B shows a preference for double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to siRNAs and miRNAs, and also binds to single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides. A stretch of positively charged residues between amino acids 20 - 30 are critical for RNA binding. Binding to RNA oligomerizes and induces a conformational change in TAV 2 B into a primarily helical structure. These studies sug-gest that suppression of RNAi by TAV 2 B may occur by targeting different stages of the RNAi pathway. TAV 2 B falls under the category of more general RNAi suppres-sors, with potentially multiple targets for suppression. RNA Interferenz (RNAi) ist ein hochkonservierter Mechanismus, der dem silencing von Genen dient. Dieser Prozess findet in den meisten Eukaryoten statt und wird durch die Gegenwart exogener, in die Zelle aufgenommener oder endogener, doppelsträngiger RNA (dsRNA) eingeleitet. Das Vorhandensein dieser dsRNA resultiert in einer sequenzspezifischen Degradation der Ziel-mRNA (Sontheimer, 2005; Tomari & Zamore, 2005; Voinnet, 2005). RNA silencing wurde zufällig in Organismen entdeckt, die transgene DNA trugen, mit exogener DNA behandelt wurden oder mit Virus infiziert waren. Etliche Gen silencing Phänomene auf posttranskriptioneller Ebene wurden in Pflanzen, Pilzen, Tieren und Wimperntierchen entdeckt und stellten somit die Basis für das Konzept des posttranskriptionellen Gen silencing (PTGS) oder RNA silencing dar. RNA silencing wurde zuerst in Pflanzen beobachtet, als Wissenschaftler versuchten, eine stärker violettfarbene Petunie zu generieren. Dazu kreierten sie eine transgene Pflanze, die eine Extra-Kopie des Gens für das Enzym trug, das für die violette Pigmentation verantwortlich ist. Überraschenderweise wies der Abkömmling keine intensivere violette Färbung auf, im Gegenteil, seine Blüten waren weiß. Sowohl die Produktion der transgenen, als auch der Wildtyp Pigmentationsgene der violetten Petunie wurden ausgeschaltet oder co-suppressiert (Napoli et al., 1990; Smith et al., 2000; van der Krol et al., 1990). PTGS kann demnach auch Transgene beeinflussen, die nicht homolog zu endogenen Genen sind, was darauf schließen lässt, dass dieser Prozess keineswegs ein simpler Regulationsmechanismus für die Kontrolle endogener Gene darstellt (Dehio & Schell, 1994; Ingelbrecht et al., 1994). Ein ähnliches Phänomen wurde im Pilz Neurospora crassa als „quelling“ bezeichnet. In diesem Pilz resultierte die Einführung homologer RNA-Sequenzen in einer Degradation endogener Gene (Romano & Macino, 1992). In C. elegans wurden die ersten Erkenntnisse über ein RNA vermitteltes silencing durch die Einführung von Antisense- oder Sense-RNA erhalten. Diese RNA war komplementär zur mRNA des Ziel-Gens. Die Experimente wurden mit der Idee durchgeführt, dass die Antisense-RNA einen Doppelstrang mit seiner komplementären mRNA bilden soll und folglich die Translation zum Protein blockiert wurde (Guo & Kemphues, 1995). 1998 zeigten Wissenschaftler in C. elegans, dass ein silencing der Expression exo- und endogener Gene durch die Injektion von komplementärer dsRNA stattfand. Dieses Phänomen wurde als RNA Interferenz bezeichnet (Fire et al., 1998). [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Greenfield Sluder, Joshua J. Nordberg, Frederick J. Miller and Edward H. Hinchcliffe This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “A Sealed Preparation for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells,” Chapter 18, in *Live Cell Imaging* (eds. Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The continuous long-term observation of cultured cells on the microscope {{has always been a}} technically demanding undertaking. This protocol describes a sealed preparation that allows the continuous long-term observation of cultured mammalian cells on upright or inverted microscopes without environmental CO 2 control. The preparation allows for optical conditions consistent with high-quality imaging and good cell viability for at least 100 hours. The preparation is an aluminum support slide with a square aperture cut in its center. The coverslip bearing the cells is attached {{to the top of the}} slide with a thin layer of silicone grease, and the bottom of the slide is similarly covered with a clean coverslip of the same size. The thickness of the slide is intended to coordinately maximize the volume of the medium while maintaining optical properties that allow Koehler illumination with standard condensers. The chamber is filled in equal parts with HEPES-buffered media containing fetal calf serum and a low-viscosity fluorocarbon oil. These oils have a high solubility for atmospheric gases. The inclusion of the oil in the preparations is intended to provide a source of oxygen and perhaps a sink for some of the CO 2 produced by the cells. Although the inclusion of fluorocarbon oil in the preparation may not be necessary for short-term (~ 24 hr) observations, particularly with cells that are sparsely plated, long-term cell viability is ensured when the oil is present. ### RELATED INFORMATION Support slides should be prepared as described in [A Sealed Preparation for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells: Details of Support Slide Construction]([URL] ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Cells for analysis - *This protocol has been used extensively for BSC- 1, CV- 1, COS- 7, CHO, mouse embryo fibroblasts, and hTERT RPE 1 cells. The FC 47, FC 40, FC 43, and FC 77 oils (see below) all work well for these cells. Most cells appear viable and have normal interphase morphology at 250 hours. Normally, observations of cells stop after 70 - 120 hours because by that time the cells have become confluent. Over the course of 100 hours, all of the cell types show constant motility, and mitoses continue for the duration of the observations with no noticeable prolongation of the cell cycle at later times. Note, however, that at later times, cells often develop small spherical inclusions that are phase-bright. The identity of these inclusions remains obscure, but they may be large pinocytotic vesicles. In any case, they do not appear to have an adverse impact on cell motility, mitosis, or gross morphology*. - Culture medium - *This protocol uses culture medium appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO (catalog no. 15240 - 062) *. - Ethanol (70 %, 95 %) - Fluorocarbon oil - *The oils we use are manufactured by 3 M Corp. and are part of its Fluorinert series of performance liquids ([3 M Fluorinert <b>product</b> <b>guide,</b> 1997]([URL] These are short (primarily eight-carbon) hydrocarbons that are fully substituted with fluorine. They are extremely inert and immiscible with water, and they do not present any recognized significant health hazards. However, it is recommended that all users consult the Material Safety Data Sheets provided by 3 M Corp. for potential health hazards before using these oils. These oils are available from three manufacturers’ representatives in three-quarter gallon (or 11 pound) amounts. 3 M Corp. does not directly sell anything but truckload quantities of these oils. Small sample quantities are available from Acuity Technical Sales (New Hampshire), AMS Materials (Florida), and Semitorr (Oregon) *. - Vaseline:lanolin:paraffin, melted and combined 1 : 1 : 1 (VALAP) ### Equipment 1. Alcohol burner - Aluminum support slide - Beaker, 1 liter - Controlled-temperature environment - *Since this preparation is sealed, control of environmental CO 2 is not needed. However, the cells under observation need to be maintained at 37 °C. This can be achieved by enclosing the entire microscope in a box and using a proportional feedback control apparatus to blow warmed air into the enclosure. Cardboard boxes work well when configured so that the video camera and the mercury arc lamp (when present) are external to the enclosure. The oculars should project from the top edge of the box. A more elegant and user-friendly setup is a Plexiglas enclosure with sliding doors custom-fabricated for the particular microscope. Again, the oculars, camera, and arc lamp housing should be located outside of the box. Three alternative heating strategies include placing the microscope in a 37 °C room, enclosing the volume around the stage with a custom-built Plexiglas box, and warming the preparation alone with a temperature-controlled support apparatus on the stage. This last strategy suffers because there will be a temperature gradient from the margins of the preparation to the cells under observation. The gradient is particularly severe when a water or oil immersion objective is used, unless the objective is equipped with a heated collar or other heating device*. - Coverslip jars - Coverslips, size 1. 5 - Culture dish, 100 × 20 mm - Forceps - Pipettes, 1 ml - Silicone vacuum grease (High Vacuum Grease; Dow Corning) - Spatula - Squirt bottle containing distilled H 2 O - Tissue culture hood - UV light source - Water bath, preset to 37 °C ### METHOD 1. Clean the coverslips used in the construction of this preparation prior to use by sonicating them in distilled H 2 O containing a small amount of detergent and then rinsing the coverslips several times in distilled H 2 O. Store cleaned coverslips in jars containing 95 % ethanol. - *Although the utility of these preparations is not sensitive to coverslip thickness, use number 1. 5 (i. e., 0. 17 mm thick) coverslips, because microscope objectives (without coverslip correction collars) are designed for this thickness of glass. Use of number 1 or number 2 coverslips introduces spherical aberration that degrades image quality*. - To prepare the coverslips for use in growing cells, pass each coverslip through the flame of an alcohol burner to burn off excess ethanol. - To ensure a uniform and lasting seal, do not apply silicone grease to the margins of wet coverslips coming out of a tissue culture dish. Instead, grease the margins of the coverslips before the cells are grown on them by applying a thin and uniform coating of silicone vacuum grease to the margins of the coverslip with a small spatula. - Place the coverslips in a 100 × 20 -mm tissue culture dish. To ensure sterility, place the dish with coverslips in a tissue culture hood, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes. - Following sterilization, plate the cells onto coverslips and culture them in ~ 10 ml of media. - *For our applications, we use the media appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO*. - Wipe the aluminum support slide with a tissue soaked with 70 % ethanol, and then briefly pass the slide through a flame to remove residual alcohol. - Use a small spatula to apply a thin rim of silicone grease around the top and bottom margins of the opening. - Use a thin, even layer of silicone grease. Thicker layers, although they may work well, can lead to dimensional instability as the preparation “settles” at 37 °C. This can lead to a constantly changing focus for the first few hours, even though the microscope may have a stable focus mechanism. - Flame a cleaned blank coverslip (from Step 1) to remove the alcohol, and attach the coverslip to the bottom of the support slide. Use the back of a pair of curved forceps to gently tamp the coverslip to ensure a good seal. - Place the prepared slide in a plastic culture dish, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes in a tissue culture hood. - Warm the media and fluorocarbon oil to 37 °C in a water bath. - Use a sterile 1 -ml pipette to fill the chamber halfway with oil (~ 350 μl). - Use a fresh sterile 1 -ml pipette to add medium until the oil at the margins of the opening just barely overflows from the chamber (again, ~ 350 μl). - Remove a coverslip with cells from the culture dish, and aspirate off excess medium. Quickly place the coverslip, silicone-grease-side down, on the chamber. Tamp the coverslip with forceps to ensure a good seal. Aspirate off any excess media and oil that may have flowed over onto the top of the coverslip. - Wash the top of the preparation prior to use to prevent salts from the medium forming crystals on the coverslips once they air dry. - Fill a 1 -liter beaker with 37 °C water, and place a squirt bottle of distilled H 2 O in it to warm. - When the water is warm, take the assembled chamber out of the incubator. Use a small spatula to apply a small amount of melted 1 : 1 : 1 vaseline:lanolin:paraffin (VALAP) to the edges of the top coverslip to provide an extra seal. Use the squirt bottle to gently wash the top coverslip, and aspirate off any excess water. - *Keep the amount of VALAP used to a minimum to reduce the chance that any will catch on the objective when the preparation is in use. This soft, waxy material is difficult to remove from optical surfaces*. - Proceed with microscopy [...] the culture preparation is now ready for observation. *See Movie 1, which illustrates BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy*. ![Movie 1]([URL] "Movie 1 ") **Movie 1. ** BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy. The sequence shows an individual cell and its subsequent daughter cells undergoing three rounds of cell division (mitosis). The cells are imaged by phase contrast microscopy. Frames are captured every 3 minutes using a CCD camera coupled to a personal computer. ### REFERENCES 1. 3 M Corp.

This incredible breath of information governance capability is what originally drew the attention of EMC Corporation, StoredIQ's first potential acquirer. Initially a strategic investor in StoredIQ, many experts predicted an inevitable acquisition. However, the company shunned their first suitor; leaving EMC to acquire a competitor.|$|R

It is then natural to ask whether a similar result holds in the context of JW-algebras and the JW-tensor <b>product.</b> <b>Guided</b> to some extent by the close {{relationship}} between a JW-algebra M and its universal enveloping von Neumann algebra W*(M), we seek in this article to investigate the answer to this question...|$|R

40|$|From {{theoretical}} consideration {{involving a}} rationalized dimensional {{analysis of the}} rainfall-runoff phenomena, dimensionless products of the pertinent variables are derived. These dimensionless <b>products</b> <b>guided</b> the design and construction of a rainstorm simulator and topographic model. The design and construction of these two basic elements of the physical hydrologic model are described. A description of the instrumentation and several relevant calibration tests {{is followed by a}} discussion of two preliminary verification test sets. The tests indicated that some necessary refinements in equipment and instrumentation were needed before more precise experimental data could be obtained. Further, the tests produced results which encouraged further investigation and would guide the design of further experimental tests...|$|R
