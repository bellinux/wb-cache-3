40|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>ventilators</b> for {{intensive}} care provide information on, {{among many other}} patient respiratory parameters, patient resistance, compliance and ‘work of breathing’ values calculated from pressure and flow data patterns according to a widely utilized algorithm. The effects induced by the breathing circuit and analogue filtering of the ventilator measuring system are experimentally investigated during controlled ventilation. Three main phenomena are observed: (a) errors in calculation of resistance and compliance due to filtering of pressure and flow waveforms; (b) the presence of pressure oscillations {{at the beginning of}} inspiration and expiration phases; and (c) the phase shift between pressure and flow waveforms. The experimental evaluation of the measuring system of a neonatal ventilator is then conducted and: (a) a delay in pressure and flow measurement synchronization equal to 22 + 2 ms is evaluated; moreover, (b) a difference between the values provided by the ventilator and those measured by the reference experimental setup on respiratory parameters such as the compliance, resistance and work of breathing that lies in the range of 7 – 16...|$|E
40|$|Published {{standards}} for the performance evaluation of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilators</b> are mainly directed to manufacturers rather than to end-users and often considered inadequate or not comprehensive. In order to contribute to overcome the problems above, a novel measurement system was proposed and tested with waveforms of mechanical ventilation by means of experimental trials carried out with infant ventilators typically used in neonatal intensive care units: the main quantities of mechanical ventilation in newborns are monitored, i. e. air flow rate, differential pressure and volume from infant ventilator are measured by means of two novel fiber-optic sensors (OFSs) developed and characterized by the authors, while temperature and relative humidity of air mass are obtained by two commercial transducers. The proposed fiber-optic sensors (flow sensor Q-OFS, pressure sensor P-OFS) showed measurement ranges of air flow and pressure typically encountered in neonatal mechanical ventilation, i. e. the air flow rate Q ranged from 3 l min- 1 to 18 l min- 1 (inspiratory) and from - 3 l min- 1 to - 18 l min- 1 (expiratory), the differential pressure ΔP ranged from - 15 cmH 2 O to 15 cmH 2 O. In each experimental trial carried out with different settings of the ventilator, outputs of the OFSs are compared with data from two reference sensors (reference flow sensor RF, reference pressure sensor RP) and results are found consistent: flow rate Q showed a maximum error between Q-OFS and RF up to 13 percent, with an output ratio Q RF/Q OFS of not more than 1. 06 ± 0. 09 (least square estimation, 95 percent confidence level, R 2 between 0. 9822 and 0. 9931). On the other hand the maximum error between P-OFS and RP on differential pressure ΔP was lower than 10 percent, with an output ratio ΔP RP/ΔP OFS between 0. 977 ± 0. 022 and 1. 0 ± 0. 8 (least square estimation, 95 percent confidence level, R 2 between 0. 9864 and 0. 9876). Despite the possible improvements, results were encouraging and suggested the proposed measurement system can be considered suitable for performances evaluation of neonatal ventilators and useful for both end-users and manufacturers...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Medical {{electrical}} equipments {{at health}} care facilities presented malfunction and wrong medical information due to poor electric power quality and to inadequate electrical Installations. Some equipment such as X-ray, computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are considered as polluting ones due to their high amount of harmonics and voltage transients produced on the electrical power supply when in operation, while other equipments, connected to the same power supply, are considered sensitive or victim ones, presenting failure or producing wrong. Approach: The effects on some sensitive medical electrical equipment were verified in a controlled environment at energy quality technological center of the technical school of the University of Sao Paulo. A heart monitor, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilator</b> and pulse oxymeter equipment types were submitted to a controlled voltage supply with high harmonic content and voltage sags. The test methodology used simulated conditions based on Brazilian NBR standards, ANSI/IEEE Std. 519, IEC 60601 and IEC 61000 - 4 - 11 standards. Results: The results of the polluting equipment current consumption measurements {{as well as the}} three sensitive equipments tested were presented and discussed. The <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilator</b> presented problems that range from stoppage to expiratory valve blockage and alarm system failures. The pulse oxymeter presented display malfunctions and it was extremely sensitive to voltage sags. The heart monitor maintained steady operation in all test cases. Conclusion/Recommendations: In spite of several existing recommendations and standards for testing medical electrical equipments, {{there is a lack of}} standard related to test cases considering the effects of high harmonic and voltage sags. The quality of electrical installation in {{health care facilities}} needs to be improved to reduce risks to the patients and to provide better health treatment...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} vitro {{to determine the effect}} of an airway-to-patient circuit on the breathing pattern actually delivered to the patient by a neonatal <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilator.</b> To this end, an automatic measuring system was implemented to record: (a) the ventilation parameter analog output signals provided by the ventilator and (b) the pressure value directly measured at the patient delivery site. The experimental analysis was conducted by examining various circuit configurations (tubes that differ in dimensions and rigidity, with and without humidifier, etc.) and pressure waveform changes. Noticeable differences between the respiratory pattern set by physicians and that actually delivered to the patient were observed and the measured data provide indication for correct air circuit design. Finally, the results contributed to increase the attention of the medical therapist, who is the only one able to estimate the actual patient ventilatory needs and their ranges of variation, to a more accurate ventilator setting in order to assure the correct breathing pattern for neonate health...|$|R
40|$|Tracking lung tissues {{during the}} {{respiratory}} cycle {{has been a}} challenging task for diagnostic CT and CT-guided radiotherapy. We propose an intensity- and landmark-based image registration algorithm to perform image registration and warping of 3 D pulmonary CT image data sets, based on consistency constraints and matching corresponding airway branchpoints. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectivenss and accuracy of this algorithm in tracking lung tissues by both animal and human data sets. In the animal study, the result showed a tracking accuracy of 1. 9 mm between 50 % functional residual capacity (FRC) and 85 % total lung capacity (TLC) for 12 metal seeds implanted in the lungs of a breathing sheep under precise volume control using a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilator.</b> Visual inspection of the human subject results revealed the algorithm’s potential not only in matching the global shapes, but also in registering the internal structures (e. g., oblique lobe fissures, pulmonary artery branches, etc.).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Severe {{pulmonary}} contusions {{occur in}} blunt chest trauma, especially with high velocity injuries. Pulmonary contusions following trauma {{may result in}} significant hypoxemia and decreased compliance which may progress over several days. Extensive contusions may result in respiratory difficulty or progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome, which increases mortality. We decided to review the cases of polytrauma with associated pulmonary contusions to determine the factors which influence outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all cases of trauma with pulmonary contusions on X-ray or CT scan. The cases were examined for age, type of injuries, admission APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA scores, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, {{presence or absence of}} rib fractures, average positive fluid balance, average sedation dose, <b>pulmonary</b> haemorrhage, <b>ventilator</b> days, ICU days and hospital outcome. RESULTS: There were 18 cases of pulmonary contusions. All had associated injuries. 6 patients died, 4 in the ICU and 2 patients died 1 week after transfer to a high dependency unit, one due to sepsis and the other due to massive haemothorax. There was a significant difference in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at admission and throughout the ICU course, fluid balance and sedation dose, but not in ventilator days and ICU days between survivors and nonsurvivors. The incidence, frequency and amount of pulmonary haemorrhage were higher in the nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Close attention to improving gas exchange, and early management of hemoptysis might improve outcome in pulmonary contusion...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and Purpose: This study aims to {{identify}} the risk factors affecting mortality and morbidity in cases that have been seen and treated by tube thoracostomy after being diagnosed with pneumothorax at our hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. Material and Method: 17 cases that have been seen and diagnosed with pneumothorax at the neonatal intensive care unit between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Results: Mortality {{was found to be}} high among infants under 2500 gr and mechanically-ventilated patients. While no non-ventilated cases were lost, 6 (60 %) of the 10 mechanically-ventilated patients were lost. 4 (67 %) of these 6 patients were female, and 2 (33 %) were male. Also, 4 (67 %) of these 6 patients were under 2500 gr. Mortality rate was found to be 35 %. Conclusion:Mortality rate is high in spontaneous pneumothorax patients in the neonatal period. Prematurity, underlying primary <b>pulmonary</b> disease, mechanical <b>ventilator</b> procedures are predisposing factors for the development of pneumothorax. In our study, mortality rate was found to be high consistent with the literature in mechanically-ventilated patients under 2500 gr who also have other anomalies. Pneumothorax should be noted in the sudden deterioration of the general condition particularly in mechanically-ventilated patients. [J Contemp Med 2014; 4 (1. 000) : 10 - 13...|$|R
40|$|Contextualization: Ideal patient-ventilator {{synchrony}} can be {{very difficult}} to achieve, especially during NIV, due presence of. Intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators were designed to function without the presence of leaks and are likely to suffer interference in their presence during NIV, but the latest generation of ventilators incorporated NIV algorithms (âNIV modesâ) to compensate e deal better with leaks. Auto-TrakÂ consists in a technology capable to automatically adjust, cycle by cycle, triggering and cycling mechanisms during PSV. Objectives: Determine the influence of the type of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>ventilator,</b> respiratory mechanics and breathing pattern on patient-ventilator asynchrony during NIV, with and without the use of NIV algorithms, and with and without an automatic triggering and cycling system. Methods: Experimental bench study using the mechanic lung model, ASL 5000 TM. Three profiles of respiratory mechanics were studied: normal, obstructive and restrictive, with neural inspiratory time of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 seconds and maximum intensity of muscle effort (Pmus) fixed in - 7. 5 cmH 2 O. We simulated NIV in five ICU ventilators and in four noninvasive ventilators. Auto-TrakTM was studied when available in the ventilator. Primary outcomes were: respiratory asynchronies, inspiratory delay time and cycling asynchrony time identifying, in the second case, two possible types, late or premature cycling. Results: Inspiratory delay time was shorter on dedicated NIV ventilators in most of situations. A short neural time was associated with late cycling and a long neural time with premature cycling. Dedicated NIV ventilators cycled later than the ICU ventilators, when the neural time was 0, 5 s and mostly in the obstructive pattern, but was associated with a shorter cycling asynchrony time when the neural time was longer (> 1, 0 s). NIV algorithms and Auto-TrakTM had little impact on triggering and cycling, however remained slightly more stable the effective PEEP. Conclusion: Respiratory mechanics and breathing pattern influence the degree of patient-ventilator asynchrony during NIV. Neural time is a determinant factor of triggering and cycling asynchronies, associated to late cycling when short and to premature cycling when long. The type of mechanical ventilator influence, on varying intensity, the degree of asynchrony. NIV algoritms and Auto-TrakTM have little impact on triggering and cycling. Keywords: Artificial Respiration. Respiratory Mechanics. Noninvasive VentilationContextualizaÃÃo: A sincronia paciente-ventilador ideal pode ser muito difÃcil de se alcanÃar, especialmente durante a ventilaÃÃo nÃo invasiva (VNI), devido a presenÃa de vazamentos. Ventiladores de unidades de terapia intensiva (UTI) foram desenvolvidos para funcionarem sem vazamentos e podem sofrer interferÃncias em sua presenÃa, porÃm a geraÃÃo mais moderna incorporou algoritmos (âmodos VNIâ) para compensar e lidar melhor com as fugas. O Auto-TrakÂ consiste em uma tecnologia capaz de ajustar automaticamente, ciclo a ciclo, os mecanismos de disparo e ciclagem durante o modo PSV. Objetivo: Determinar a influÃncia do tipo de ventilador pulmonar, da mecÃnica e do padrÃo respiratÃrios sobre a assincronia paciente-ventilador durante a VNI, com e sem o uso de algoritmos para VNI e com e sem o sistema de disparo e ciclagem automÃticos. MÃtodo: Trata-se de estudo experimental, de bancada utilizando o simulador pulmonar mecÃnico, ASL 5000 Â. Estudaram-se trÃs perfis de mecÃnica respiratÃria: normal, obstrutivo e restritivo, com tempo inspiratÃrio neural de 0, 5, 1, 0, 1, 5 e 2, 0 segundos e intensidade mÃxima do esforÃo muscular (Pmus) fixada em - 7. 5 cmH 2 O. Simulou-se VNI em cinco ventiladores de UTI e em quatro ventiladores especÃficos de VNI. O Auto-TrakÂ foi estudado quando disponÃvel no ventilador. Os desfechos primÃrios foram: assincronias respiratÃrias, tempo de retardo inspiratÃrio e tempo de assincronia de ciclagem identificando, neste segundo caso, dois tipos possÃveis, ciclagem tardia ou precoce. Resultados: O tempo de retardo inspiratÃrio foi menor nos ventiladores especÃficos de VNI na maioria das situaÃÃes. O tempo neural curto se associou Ã ciclagem tardia e o tempo neural longo Ã ciclagem precoce. Os ventiladores especÃficos de VNI ciclaram mais tardiamente que os de UTI no tempo neural de 0, 5 s e sobretudo no padrÃo obstrutivo, mas associaram-se a um tempo de assincronia de ciclagem menor quando o tempo neural foi mais longo (> 1, 0 s). Os algoritmos de VNI e o Auto-TrakÂ mantiveram um pouco mais estÃvel a PEEP efetiva. ConclusÃo: A mecÃnica e o padrÃo respiratÃrios influenciam o grau de assincronia paciente-ventilador durante a VNI. Tempo neural Ã fator determinante de assincronias de disparo e ciclagem. O tipo de ventilador mecÃnico influencia, em intensidade variÃvel, o grau de assincronia. Os algoritmos de VNI e o Auto-TrakÂ tÃm pouco impacto sobre o disparo e a ciclagem.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Brain injured {{patients}} {{have an increased}} risk of extracerebral organ failure, mainly pulmonary dysfunction. The prevalent cause of <b>pulmonary</b> failure is <b>ventilator</b> associated pneumonia (VAP) which increases morbidity and mortality. The respiratory dysfunction is mainly characterized by the presence of alveolar consolidation of the dependent lobes. METHODS: We investigated the mechanical changes of the respiratory system and the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in 10 normal subjects, in 10 brain injured patients without respiratory failure and in 10 brain injured patients with respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 lower than 200 mmHg) due to VAP. RESULTS: We found that: 1) Intra-Abdominal Pressure (IAP) was increased in brain injured patients with or without respiratory failure compared to normal subjects; 2) the Elastance of respiratory system (Est,rs), the Elastance of the chest wall (Est,cw) and Resistance max of the Lung (Rmax,L) increased in brain injured patients independently from the presence of respiratory failure; 3) in brain injured patients with respiratory failure application of 15 cmH 2 O of PEEP increased the Elastance of the Lung (Est,L), Est,rs and Rmax,L, while did not result in significant alveolar recruitment and oxygenation improvement. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in brain injured patients 1) the respiratory mechanics is altered; 2) PEEP is uneffective to improve respiratory function in respiratory failure due to ventilator associated pneumonia. Further studies are warranted to better elucidate the pathophysiology and clinical management of respiratory dysfunction in brain injured patients...|$|R
