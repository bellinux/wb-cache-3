25|$|Arrangements {{with the}} Bedouin left the scrolls {{in the hands}} of a third party until a <b>profitable</b> <b>sale</b> of them could be negotiated. That third party, George Isha'ya, was a member of the Syrian Orthodox Church, who soon {{contacted}} St Mark's Monastery in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached Metropolitan Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as Mar Samuel. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the now famous Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa), the Community Rule, the Habakkuk Pesher (a commentary on the book of Habakkuk), and the Genesis Apocryphon. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor Eleazer Sukenik and Professor Benjamin Mazar, Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, The War Scroll, Thanksgiving Hymns, and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsab).|$|E

2500|$|In October 1962 {{the owners}} {{transferred}} Darlwyn to St Mawes, in Falmouth Harbour, Cornwall. She was taken there by [...] {{a crew of}} six; although the sea trip was accomplished without any serious incident, the crew were critical of the boat's performance in certain weather conditions. They found her top-heavy, difficult to steer, and with a tendency to list. Darlwyne remained at St Mawes until September 1963, when her owners decided to sell her as a potential commercial passenger boat. At Mylor, in the Carrick Roads estuary of the River Fal, she was inspected by a local marine surveyor, George Corke. He noted her poor steering—it was impossible, he said, to navigate a straight course—and thought that much work would be necessary before she was fit for passenger-carrying operations. On 30 May 1964 Corke acted as agent for Lowe and Gray {{in the sale of}} Darlwyne to John Barratt of Penryn, whose main objective was to renovate the vessel with a view to a <b>profitable</b> <b>sale.</b>|$|E

60|$|That gruff mariner was in {{a strange}} state of mind.

Moreover, the said pirate seemed to be in the employ of said merchant, and altogether, things seemed to him to be in as fearsome a mix as they had seemed to Captain Ichabod, but he brought his mind down to the question he had been asked.|$|E
60|$|In the morning, before Mr. M'Kay had {{returned}} to the ship, great numbers of the natives came off in their canoes to trade, headed by two sons of Wicananish. As they brought abundance of sea-otter skins, and there was every appearance of a brisk trade, Captain Thorn did not wait for the return of Mr. M'Kay, but spread his wares upon the deck, making a tempting display of blankets, cloths, knives, beads, and fish-hooks, expecting a prompt and <b>profitable</b> <b>sale.</b> The Indians, however, were not so eager and simple as he had supposed, having learned the art of bargaining and the value of merchandise from the casual traders along the coast. They were guided, too, by a shrewd old chief named Nookamis, who had grown gray in traffic with New England skippers, and prided himself upon his acuteness. His opinion seemed to regulate the market. When Captain Thorn made what he considered a liberal offer for an otter-skin, the wily old Indian treated it with scorn, and asked more than double. His comrades all took their cue from him, and not an otter-skin was to be had at a reasonable rate.|$|E

6000|$|In the train, after {{quarter of}} an hour's indecision between {{thoughts}} of Holly, his morning paper, {{the look of the}} bright day, and his dim memory of Newmarket, Val plunged into the recesses of a small square book, all names, pedigrees, tap-roots, and notes about the make and shape of horses. The Forsyte in him was bent on the acquisition of a certain strain of blood, and he was subduing resolutely as yet the Dartie hankering for a flutter. On getting back to England, after the <b>profitable</b> <b>sale</b> of his South African farm and stud, and observing that the sun seldom shone, Val had said to himself: [...] "I've absolutely got to have an interest in life, or this country will give me the blues. Hunting's not enough, I'll breed and I'll train." [...] With just that extra pinch of shrewdness and decision imparted by long residence in a new country, Val had seen the weak point of modern breeding. They were all hypnotised by fashion and high price. He should buy for looks, and let names go hang! And, here he was already, hypnotised by the prestige of a certain strain of blood! Half consciously, he thought: 'There's something in this damned climate which makes one go round in a ring. All the same, I must have a strain of Mayfly blood.' ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the present}} day, {{when the whole}} field of {{contemporary}} literature is so widely surveyed and amply discussed, and when the current productions of every country are constantly collated and ably criticised, a treatise like that of Goldsmith would be considered as extremely limited and unsatisfactory; {{but at that time}} it possessed novelty in its views and wideness in its scope, and being indued with the peculiar charm of style inseparable from the author, it commanded public attention and a <b>profitable</b> <b>sale.</b> As it was the most important production that had yet come from Goldsmith's pen, he was anxious to have the credit of it; yet it appeared without his name on the title-page. The authorship, however, was well known throughout the world of letters, and the author had now grown into sufficient literary importance to become an object of hostility to the underlings of the press. One of the most virulent attacks upon him was in a criticism on this treatise, and appeared in the [...] "Monthly Review," [...] to which he himself had been recently a contributor. It slandered him as a man while it decried him as an author, and accused him, by innuendo, of [...] "laboring under the infamy of having, by the vilest and meanest actions, forfeited all pretensions to honor and honesty," [...] and of practicing [...] "those acts which bring the sharper to the cart's tail or the pillory." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{to my own}} work, let me correct one or two {{conceptions of}} yours {{respecting}} it. I could, no doubt, induce my friends to publish the work for me, but I am possessed of facts that deter me. I know that the booksellers not only do not encourage, but that they use unjustifiable artifices to injure works published on the authors' own account. It never answered, as far as I can find, in any instance. And even {{the sale of a}} first edition is not without objections on this score--to this, however, I should certainly adhere, and it is my resolution. But I must do something immediately. Now, if I knew that any bookseller would purchase the first edition of this work, as numerous as he pleased, I should put the work out of hand at once, [...] "totus in illo". But it was never my intention to send one single sheet to the press till the whole was [...] "bona fide" [...] ready for the printer--that is, both written, and fairly written. The work is half written [...] "out", and the materials of the other half are all in paper, or rather on papers. I should not expect one farthing till the work was delivered entire; and I would deliver it at once, if it were wished. But, if I cannot engage with a bookseller for this, I must do something else [...] "first", which I should be sorry for. Your division of the sorts of works acceptable to booksellers is just, and what has been always my own notion or rather knowledge; but, though I detailed the whole of the contents of my work so fully to you, I did not mean to lay any stress with the bookseller on the first half, but simply state it as preceded by a familiar introduction, and critical history of logic. On the work itself I meant to lay all the stress, as a work really in request, and non-existent, either well or ill-done, and to put the work in the [...] "same class" [...] with [...] "Guthrie" [...] and books of practical instruction--for the universities, classes of scholars, lawyers, etc. etc. Its <b>profitable</b> <b>sale</b> will greatly depend on the pushing of the booksellers, and on its being considered as a [...] "practical" [...] book, [...] "Organum vere Organum", a book by which the reader is to acquire not only knowledge, but likewise [...] "power". I fear that it may extend to seven hundred pages; and would it be better to publish the Introduction of History separately, either after or before? God bless you, and all belonging to you, and your Chaucer. All happiness to you and your wife.|$|E

40|$|This paper tests an {{empirical}} implication of heterogeneous firm models {{along the lines}} of Melitz (2003) in the context of falling trade costs. Using the EU's intensive liberalization phase (1993 - 2002) as a natural experiment, we investigate freer trade's impact on the frequency of market reorientation across the productivity distribution of active firms to shed light on the presence of a minimum productivity (size) threshold for <b>profitable</b> <b>sales</b> abroad. Contrary to the models' predictions, firms that switch from non-exporting to exporting over the studied period are not concentrated in a particular size range. Our findings, based on a rich data set of French manufacturing enterprises, suggest a scope for fine-tuning of the theoretical framework. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} insight {{in the development}} and success of corporate, academic and independent new high-tech ventures in the Dutch life science industry. It has done so from a venture’s perspective, a very limited examined view. A theoretical framework is developed from a resource-based view. The framework includes intellectual capital, financial capital, and flexibility of a venture. From the developed theoretical framework a conceptual model is derived from which different hypotheses are formulated. These hypotheses are tested on the Dutch life science industry, a developing high-tech industry with many new ventures. A cross-sectional/longitudinal design by means of statistical methods is applied on the BioPartner database that includes 511 cases during the period 2002 - 2005. The results provide a number of interesting insights. Overall, the amount of resources available at any moment in time to a venture should be limited as this forces the venture to focus on <b>profitable</b> <b>sales.</b> <b>Profitable</b> <b>sales</b> require a good process in which the resources of the venture are leveraged to address (new) customer needs, which leads to success. This implies that to force a venture to become successful in terms of gaining profits before realizing large turnovers they should receive no financial support from parent organizations or governmental programs and should have a limited amount of IP. Additionally, the management team plays an important role. The management team should not have a high quality champion as this increases the available financial capital at any moment in time. Furthermore, to improve the ability to commercialize knowledge, and thereby improve the leveraging process, the management team should be diversified and cross-functional. Furthermore, results show that independent ventures are most successful in terms of profit. Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) causing this success is/are not identified yet...|$|R
