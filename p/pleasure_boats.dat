A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley and <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats</b> ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds from Hurricane Dean caused {{considerable}} {{power line}} damage, leaving 65,000 residents without electricity. The winds also caused minor roof damage. In Hamilton Harbor, 20 <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats</b> were damaged or sent adrift {{due to the}} rough seas. Flooding from the hurricane damaged fifteen houses. Sixteen people were injured by the hurricane, five of the injuries were considered serious. There were, however, no reports of fatalities from Dean’s impact on Bermuda. Damage in Bermuda amounted up to $8.9million (1989USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|The Somerset Coal Canal and Wilts & Berks Canal, {{which each}} {{supplied}} {{some of the}} trade from the Somerset Coalfield to the Kennet and Avon, closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. In 1926, following a loss of £18,041 the previous year, the Great Western Railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a Ministry of Transport Order, but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal. Cargo trade continued to decline, but a few <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats</b> started to use the canal.|$|E
5|$|Weymouth is {{a tourist}} resort, and its economy {{depends on its}} harbour and visitor attractions; the town is a gateway {{situated}} halfway along the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site on the Dorset and east Devon coast, important for its geology and landforms. Weymouth Harbour has included cross-channel ferries, and is home to <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats</b> and private yachts, and nearby Portland Harbour {{is home to the}} Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, where the sailing events of the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games were held.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats</b> must give way to commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.|$|E

5|$|The Place de la Bastille still {{occupies}} most of {{the location}} of the Bastille, and the Opéra Bastille was built on the square in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the storming of the prison. The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past. The ditch that originally linked the defences of the fortress to the River Seine had been dug out {{at the start of the}} 19th century to form the industrial harbour of the Bassin de l'Arsenal, linked to the Canal Saint Martin, but is now a marina for <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats,</b> while the Promenade Plantée links the square with redeveloped parklands to the east.|$|E
5|$|The lower river, from Midhurst to its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, {{has been used}} for navigation. Boats used the section from the Arun to Fittleworth following improvements made to the Arun in 1615, and after the Arun Navigation was completed in 1790, the Earl of Egremont made the river navigable up to Midhurst by constructing eight locks and some small cuts. The work was completed in 1794, and many of the bridges built at that time still survive. With the opening of the Mid-Sussex Railway branch to Midhurst in 1859, traffic declined, and commercial use of the river had ceased by the 1880s. <b>Pleasure</b> <b>boats</b> continued to be used on the river for many years, and published accounts of journeys along the decaying navigation appeared in 1914 and 1920. The navigation was officially abandoned in 1936, after an undergraduate pointed out that it was still a public right of way.|$|E
5|$|The locks were {{suitably}} sized for Severn Trows, which were , and could carry 60 tons. The canal was not {{provided with a}} towing path for horses. Some boats sailed along the canal, but most were bow-hauled by men. Framilode lock {{at the entrance to}} the canal was a tide lock, with multiple gates to cope with all states of the tide. When a vessel arrived at the junction, a rope would be taken from it to the shore, and attached to a capstan, which would then be used to haul the boat into the lock. Once the canal was open, the Proprietors worked hard to improve the facilities, and a number of warehouses were built. Many of the shareholders were also involved with the Thames and Severn Canal scheme, which was completed in 1789 and provided a through route between Wallbridge and the River Thames at Lechlade. The navigation was seen as a commercial waterway; <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats</b> were discouraged by the imposition of a charge of £1 (2012:£) for the use of each lock.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Pleasure</b> <b>Boat</b> was {{a reform}} journal {{published}} in Portland, Maine during {{the mid-nineteenth century}} by the Quaker reformer and journalist Jeremiah Hacker. Over the first seventeen years of publication (1845-1862) it went by the names The <b>Pleasure</b> <b>Boat</b> and The Portland Pleasure Boat; and some years later was revived under the new title The Chariot of Wisdom and Love (1864-1866). Hacker, after moving to New Jersey in 1866, briefly returned to the [...] "Boat" [...] theme and published the short-lived journal Hacker's <b>Pleasure</b> <b>Boat</b> (1867). In all of his publications, Hacker promoted such causes as abolition, land reform, juvenile justice, and pacifism.|$|R

5|$|Weymouth Harbour is {{long and}} narrow, and formed the estuary of the River Wey until the {{building}} of a bridge to Westham, which separated the harbour's backwaters from Radipole Lake. For centuries the harbour was a passenger terminal and trade and cargo port: goods handled included wool and spices, and in the 20th century Weymouth was a bulk importer of fertiliser and cars. The old harbourside, {{on both sides of the}} seaward end of the harbour, still hosts a fishing fleet, with docks, unloading areas, and a cross-channel ferry terminal. Fishing and cargo trading employ fewer people in the area since their peak in earlier centuries, but local fishermen catch the largest mass of fish in England and the third largest in the United Kingdom. The inner harbour has been refurbished in two phases, in 1994–1996 and in 2002, to include a new marina with hundreds of berths for <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats,</b> cruisers and sailing boats. Local boats offer fishing and diving trips, pleasure cruises along the Jurassic Coast, and thrill-rides to the Isle of Portland.|$|E
5|$|The port {{remained}} open {{to service}} the papermills, importing wood pulp and esparto grass from Russia and Scandinavia, using mainly East European registered vessels after World War II. Requiring a return load, {{the result was that}} Watchet became a leading UK port for the export of car parts, tractors and other industrial goods. However, with the replacement of coal with oil from the mid-1960s, the port traffic began to terminally decline. The harbour was in commercial use until 2000, the harbour has now been converted into a marina for <b>pleasure</b> <b>boats.</b> It is surrounded by renovated quaysides and narrow streets. The commercial esplanade has been refurbished with new shelters, information points, and the provision of new paving in some areas, as well as railings, lamps, curved benches, planters and new tree plantings. There are several museums in the town, including the Market House Museum, which explores the history of the town and its harbour. The building was constructed in 1820 {{on the site of the}} previous market house which had been demolished in 1805. It was converted into a museum in 1979. It houses a collection of exhibits about the natural history of Watchet and the surrounding area. The focus is on nautical and maritime history of the port. Artefacts include those relating to: Archaeology, Coins and Medals, Land Transport, Maritime, Natural Sciences, Science and Technology and Social History. At the rear of the museum building is the old town lock-up for the temporary detention of people, often drunks who were usually released the next day or to hold people being brought before the local magistrate. The Watchet Boat Museum, which is housed in the 1862 Victorian architecture former railway goods shed, displays the unusual local flatner boats and associated artefacts.|$|E
