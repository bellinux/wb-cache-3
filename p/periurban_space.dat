Therefore, highlights the relationship, often opposite and confrontational, between city and countryside, closing itself the contradiction between economic development projects and environmental preservation. On the other hand, points to a need to the spatial approach of agricultural practices, which can enable theunderstanding of relationships between family farmers and ecological nature, through the study of representations and perceptions of the landscape, which are materially expressed in the territory of family farming.

40|$|The Aim of this {{research}} is to debate the apparent dissociation between the development discourse and its effectiveness in the internal context of small cities, aiming to identify its peculiarities from the case of the city of Esperança, located at the Agreste region of the State of Paraíba. This city represents in its socio-spatial dynamics the dilemmas and contradictions of development in small cities. The deductive hypothetical method was used to analyze the socio-spatial dynamics from its configurations in scales beyond the local area, to those of materialization in the intra-urban dimension. As a result, the scientific scope of the subject was verified in relation to the contribution of sciences, such as Geography, Economics and Sociology. In addition, it was observed the need of enlargement and balance between public policies that drive to the reproduction of urban space and the implementation of development, as a practice of humanity and sustainability, for all who live in small cities. The study of the city of Esperança exemplified the contradiction. First of all, between policies that restricts the perspective of development to the economic dimension of social and political life and, secondly, the mismanagement of the state on <b>periurban</b> <b>spaces</b> (urban fringes) that expose the urgency of Actions to mitigate the lack of public services, especially, to the social groups of low income...|$|R

For periurban poor population, agriculture represents a complement to family income and an alternative for food supplies. For these peoples, the role of UPA (Urban and Periurban Agriculture) is very important. In Latin America, operation of <b>periurban</b> <b>spaces</b> has differentiated functions and roles: most of their inhabitants face conditions of marginalization or at best, subsist through the food self-production. Periurban poors are facing a double situation: the degradation of their activity and the transformation of their peasant condition; at the time, a conflict by the dispute for the space with other social groups, with different interests and meanings. In this paper we discuss about diverse manifestations of territorial restructuration in a global context, specifically in periurban areas of Metropolitan Central Mexico. Above all, its interest lies {{in an analysis of}} these transformations {{within the context of the}} old rural spaces, those which have been affected by the advance of urbanization. The development of peri-urban agriculture in some cities of Central Mexico has established important patterns of territory transformation, either in changes of use of land or in the structure of production, or in social and cultural changes. Periurban agriculture is one of the several activities in this territory, that remains with another non-farming activities, mainly manufactures and tertiary, that are having an quick difussion...|$|R

30|$|Periurban areasa are dynamic spaces with blurred boundaries, highly {{influenced}} by urban interactions. They share qualities both with {{urban and rural}} areas, serving as an interface between them (Bryant, [1995]; Darly and Torre, [2013]). All across the globe agricultural periurban areas usually face the highest urban pressure. From Melbourne (Williams et al., [2005]) to Vietnam (Lodder, [2012]), it is well-documented how land is diverted from agrarian uses {{to the development of}} infrastructure and new residential, commercial, or industrial areas, which tend to disturb agrarian landscapes and social structures (Murdoch and Abram, [1998]).

40|$|The present article, {{as well as}} the dossier it introduces, {{is focused}} on periurban {{agricultural}} land. It describes most of the pictures produced by the contemporary city and its sprawling edges, but also those due to a growing tendency to settle in the countryside. The countryside has always been characterized by slow growth processes and low settlement density, but it is now being affected by new social and economic practices that are transforming rural culture into a hybrid urban-rural form. Among these pictures evolving from different processes of rarefaction and densification of the urban space, both centrifugal and decentralized, the aim in the present work is to make an in-depth examination of the space containing them, often ignored in contemporary urbanist culture because it has not been educated to recognize these aspects. This space is not referable as suburban, an imperfect city produced by its spatial contiguity to the true city, nor can it be regarded as a re-urbanization phenomenon because it is not generated by a sudden hypertrophy of rural settlements sprawling into the countryside and extending into adjacent urban tentacles Even the different forms of agriculture produced by these <b>periurban</b> <b>spaces</b> have their own, innovative character. Unlike those of rural agriculture, which is indifferent to city models, they have drawn creative economic and social models deriving from the ongoing transformation of the rural world but above all from their proximity to the city, inspired by the citizens’ desire to return to nature and to occupy their leisure hours in pleasurable natural pursuits. From some standpoints, {{it might be possible to}} describe this as a new form of suburb, apluralistsuburb, not only urban, built out from the city, but also rural, moving in from the countryside, and thus building a “third territory” halfway between the urban and the rural. This research is an open invitation to town planners to pay a greater attention to this in between agricultural space, awarding it a greater autonomy...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the concept of spontaneous, wild nature has been inspiring renewed {{interest}} and rising social consideration. In the context of safeguarding natural assets, enhancing the value of wilderness is now a leading idea, in which it embodies the symbolic role that was once attributed to preindustrial cultural landscapes. In nations like Germany, always to the forefront in movements for safeguarding nature and environmental planning, the need to foster the dynamic processes of nature (safeguarding of processes) rather than just aiming at a static conservation of natural assets in their current state, has also been acknowledged at the administrative level. In the ambit of landscape planning, too, there is a widepread tendency nowadays to plan green spaces that can guarantee authentic “naturalist experiences”. The meaning of nature, therefore, is changing, together with {{the way it is}} perceived and attributed a symbolic value in the view of life. {{in the same way as}} some landscape gardeners of the French school have long demonstrated in the context of <b>periurban</b> agricultural <b>spaces.</b> Not only natural environments but also representations of its processes are now contemplated in landscape planning projects that are critically different from the previous banal “greening” projects. The present work proposes to extend the meaning of wilderness, searching for some analogies in current urban restoration processes. Can urban planning find support of its actions in a redefinition of the terms decline and regeneration? To what extent can the concept of wilderness become a project for communication and material for planning? This work aims to extend the meaning of wilderness, contrasted with the proliferation of artificiality that landscape design is proposing in the city, and to search for new significance of urban nature that can help to build an urban nature immersed in our present-day culture...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the second}} half of the last century, the spaces around the city acted as the ground {{reservoir}} on which to build new urban expansion. The pictures of the INA Casa settlements are emblematic of this tendency; they stood out against a rural countryside in the prevalently rural society that was Italy immediately after the II World War, beacons of the rapid modernization process that was to ensue. Today, in those spaces, we can read the shorter term movements of the new internal migration phenomena, exoduses against a background of huddles of resistance and immobility of the countryside. At this moment in time, these spaces offer great chances for the city, depending in particular on their ability to compete by proposing new sustainability solutions, featuring a parsimonious use of resources but not excluding even being able to reproduce resources. Urban planning is facing the challenge of blazing a trail in unknown territory, with no recognizable landmarks, at this present time when the possibility of operating social mediation in the urban spaces has declined, people are less and less informed about what is happening around them and few strategies have been identified for collecting and orienting common knowledge. It seemed useful to start from some concrete cases of Italian experiences that have endeavoured to build a city plan involving the <b>periurban</b> agricultural <b>spaces,</b> as a basis on which to draw a preliminary atlas of the state of the art in Italy deriving from these experiences.

40|$|Like in a paradox, urban-rural (<b>periurban</b> and rurban) <b>spaces</b> still {{represent}} an empty space {{to be filled}} within the laws and the models that physical and development planning are facing today, in Italy Indeed, it is paradoxical that, since 1942 (year {{of the first and}} still in force national town planning law), the urban-rural spaces have been dealt with as follows: •	left over and economically marginal in the frame of socio-economic development plans (an important part of planning), even the traditional ones (first generation planning, only based on the land rent mechanism); •	as empty spaces, pending to be filled up by an increasing urbanization, or eventually abandoned, because inaccessible to that; •	as undifferentiated, because too wide and uniform in the organization system to make their central business core visible. Although this “big empty” is easy to ascribe to the functionalist culture – ruling until the eighties, structurally conditioned by the political and economic debate on the profit and the rent topics –, it is necessary to underline that other variables have played against a more accurate positioning of the urban-rural areas in the national planning process. As a starting point, we may call to mind both the results of the agrarian reform and its synthetic derivatives in the “Progetto 80 ”, the discontinuous action of the “Cassa per il Mezzogiorno”, the conflict between intensive and extensive production models, the temporal volatility of the planned European guidelines and the regional policies in respect of the urban or agricoltural development’s cycles, … And we could still go on for long. But, at this time, it is important to discuss and expand on two relationships’ levels: •	to the town •	to the environment It is just from the unsuccessful relationship to the first one (lack of urban entities as in the “Italian Mezzogiorno”, or too close and ambiguous dependence from them {{as in the case of}} the wide Central–Northern urban areas), that the progressive weakening of the environmental values derives. The <b>periurban</b> <b>spaces</b> are bearers of these values, so that this means to disappoint – in a traditional vision – the planning issues, as these are some of the parameters and inalienable characters of the complex regional space in which the territory is organized to dictate its own planning rules. On the other hand, in the discussion on regional periurban planning it is seldom possible to count on a true multi-scalar approach, which breaks down the indicators in relation to the geographical scale (regional, sub-regional, and local). In the same way, it seems difficult to distinguish types of periurban characters in areas which are very different among them, even if the periurban economies are today considered locally vital for the maintenance of productive systems that find no correspondence to stable socio-economic and settlement structures (like in the case of the Rome periurban/rurban area or Molise intermunicipal areas). In such situations, it is still possible to read the sequence of the conflict which precedes the integration: discontinuous human presence, concentrated in areas geo-morphologically and climatically not always favourable; absence of stable environmental protection planning in spite of the high regional degree of naturality; negation of a social and economical value of the environment by the local settlements communities. So, it is right to wonder what might be the future geoeconomic and geopolitic structure to be given to those urban systems where the attitude to a sustainable development based on the performance of <b>periurban</b> <b>spaces</b> seems to be, once again paradoxically, a limit for a balanced growth. Therefore, this research aims at two main goals: •	To provide an operative contribution to the definition of the general or structural characters of the periurban economies in sub-regional area (intermunicipal scale, with particular reference to the Rome province) •	To verify if types of periruban areas could be given an outstanding weight/role for the tuning of suitable development planning policies, and to what degree of innovation. This report aims at discussing urban-rural typologies in a perspective of planning for a vast provincial area, the Provincia of Rome, that, with its frameworks and powers of intervention, cannot neglect facing the “metropolitan district” issue, as one of the fundamental terms to be carefully considered when speaking of the Italian Capital city in a possible European federalist vision. The work, based on a research on subsidiarity typologies for new local and over-local development, tests a method that differs from the past ones, for the inclusion of new formulae and principles -in particular, sustainability- towards which the economic-territorial regionalisation is intended to be oriented. The same principles has prompted geo-economic research into the ESPON Programme, to assess ex-ante the impact that urban-rural system could have on the economic-territorial federalist organisation of Italy (Prezioso 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003). In fact, the assessment of the impacts of transforming the current regional monocentrism to equipotential polycentrism on a local level, provokes the question of the principles upon which the European community itself should model the system of local government (territorial planning of a large area) as well as under which conditions (governing regulations), and if current regulations are to guide the choice, as is the case in Italy, so that local communities maintain potential resources for future generations, though steering them towards progressive growth awareness. This paper deals with two questions concerning the general problem: -	technical-formal, referring to techniques and procedures that are useful in identifying urban-rural areas and frameworks subsidiary to the demand for their organisation, hereby joining the geographical scale to the administrative level most appropriate for the government, as well as the organisation of the territory; -	State-run and managerial, regulations and tools to be employed; an unavoidable condition to uphold economic choices that conform appropriately to the principle of sustainability within prescribed times; acting within the European context of research on the integration (that means transversal concentration including both horizontal and vertical concentrations), which is the driving mechanism for all of the different planning processes in progress. The Italian Research Group has considered the ESPON Programme as an important starting point, in particular by the Research Framework of the 1. 1. 2 Project, which financially supports research on endogenous solutions, by identifying the framework of geo-economic action of local governments in a large area (NUTS 3). In most cases in Italy, this coincides with the spaces of provincial action; the governing bodies alone are able to accomplish all of the instrumental stages that permit the unioning of the qualification and functionality of the spaces (intraregional or intermunicipal areas), which are co-ordinated toward a single, co-operative end, thus involving them in competition on a transnational level. The European Union and many administrative, provincial frameworks have found a meeting point in the search for new planning. Stakeholders, local boards, management, citizens/shareholders-clients in the territory and economy have already confirmed a real wish to overcome, whether literally or figuratively, the borders of their own areas of interest, in order not to leave the realisation of integration, as in the past, to already developed regions where the productive groundwork is firmer. For this purpose, many regions and boundaries have been created, with the univocity of conditions and the cohesion (or coherence) of the distinct units, i. e. regional interrelation, as the main criteria. This is intended as a visible aspect of integration or, rather, a political-economic-geographic work method that makes the realisation of objectives and projects possible because of a voluntary, spontaneous attitude, which, preceded by sharing common principles, manifests itself in planning/project agreements. National and European deliberations on the subject have shown that, at the root of individual experiences, there is an attempt to methodologically unify spaces that are environmentally and functionally different. By creating sub-systems that differ in their efficiency, mass and cohesion, an identical decision-making process (sustainability) tends to guide the management of diversely located, anthropic and physical resources. The layout varies from strategic planning experiences of large areas in progress or computed in recent years in Italy and Europe (Naples, Bari, Turin, Milan, Bologna, Barcelona, Lille), in which the interrelation as one of the planning issues has been derived from a coercive action (the plan of a hierarchical-functional network). In this perspective, the plan becomes the central and centralising place of a strong idea/project offer and it’s indifferent to the real demand and the “bottom up” organisation and development. In these cases, the limits of functional areas are already outlined in the way in which metropolitan, provincial and regional plans are presented (general-territorial or for co-ordination). Importance is attached to highlighting not only those elements that oppose integration and favour competitive co-operation (global competition), acted out on a political-commercial level for the propagation of entrepreneurial and common management models, but also entrepreneurial co-operation when geographical expansion of the integration processes requires regulation of the use of resources. Among the sectors that have assumed a greater weight in outlining integration limits in strategic planning, that of services for knowledge, information and communication infrastructures stands out. At first, the European Union (EU) contributed a structural role in starting up a cohesive dialogue in this regard, hereby presuming that the “best co-operation” (or good governance) among regions would only occur if property, people, capital and information cross a border to be received or supplied. This layout basically leads to the passage from one system to another and it is rather difficult to represent the updating value and perspective dynamics according to conventional urban planning, of which the plan is the instrument. In addition, there are so-called stable structural factors (high speed, data technology, technical and network resources, etc.), which do not necessarily produce coherent planning, even though a logical continuity exists between the integration process and integration product. The more the strategic and functional indicators were studied, broken down and updated to assimilate innovations, the more the territory moved away from the representation of the resource systems that had generated it and the common regulations that had sustained local demand (absence of governance, crisis of technical standards and regulations). On a local level, it is essential to identify elements that define the capacity or physical and political amplitude of the cohesion (e. g. the pertinent metropolitan territory) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies peri-urban {{landscape}}s (the landscape {{between the}} {{rural and urban}} setting), which has until recently gained little attention in academia and even less in planning practice and policy. This {{is largely due to}} a general view of these landscapes as something transient that will be developed in the future. However, some research has recognised these landscapes as important for the leisure and recreation of urban and suburban dwellers. Thus, this thesis is concerned with {{the current state of the}} peri-urban landscape, its characteristics and drivers of change with a focus on accessibility. Accordingly, the interest of the study lies in exploring people’s landscape perceptions and uses in relation to the accessibility of periurban areas and how they change over time. The focus of this thesis is Ljubljana and Edinburgh; these two cities have been selected as the case studies in order to elucidate the spatial and social patterns of the space on the edge of the city. The thesis centres on the perspective of inner-city dwellers’ perceptions, use of, and accessibility to peri-urban green spaces. Guided by the sense of place theory and the landscape planning approach, empirical work is at the heart of this research. A mixed-method approach, comprising questionnaire and focus groups with inner-city dwellers, interviews with authorities and planners and GIS-based analysis, is applied to gain new knowledge of inner-city dwellers’ relationship with <b>periurban</b> green <b>spaces.</b> The research found that people greatly value the established peri-urban green spaces, which have a variety of meanings for them, varying according to people’s socio-demographic and cultural characteristics. Furthermore, the appreciation of extensive semi-natural green spaces and green corridors has been shown to be universal and may imply some clues for further spatial planning of these areas. Conversely, people in general did not use the areas with low intrinsic value that are perceived as messy, ambiguous, etc. It appears that these spaces have lost their sense of place and therefore they are under threat of further development. Their future should thus be considered within long-term planning goals, in order to ensure environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive development...|$|R
