25|$|Interaction {{of actors}} has no {{specific}} beginning or end. It goes on forever. Since {{it does so}} it has very peculiar properties. Whereas a conversation is mapped (due to a possibility of obtaining a vague kinematic, perhaps picture-frame image, of it, onto Newtonian time, <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has a beginning and end), an interaction, in general, cannot be treated in this manner. Kinematics are inadequate to deal with life: we need kinetics. Even so as in the minimal case of a strict conversation we cannot construct the truth value, metaphor or analogy of A and B. The A, B differences are generalizations about a coalescence of concepts {{on the part of}} A and B; their commonality and coherence is the similarity. The difference (reiterated) is the differentiation of A and B (their agreements to disagree, their incoherences). Truth value in this case meaning the coherence between all of the interacting actors.|$|E

Bayles {{argued that it}} was more acceptable to audiences than the art rock [...] "concoctions" [...] of the time because of the cultural climate during the late 1960s: [...] "Tommy was considered more authentic, <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> consists of hard rock, rather than doctored-up Mussorgsky... and avoids the typical pseudoromantic themes of art rock (fairy-tale bliss and apocalyptic angst) in favor of the more up-to-date subject of popular culture itself."

Racine also added that the album makes the listener feel a little [...] "cold", but admired that the singer was [...] "playing the game as well as anyone". Writing an article in defence of Collins in 2010, Gary Mills of The Quietus described the album as [...] "determined dross" [...] which Collins did not deserve to have his career judged by. In 2013, music critic Tom Service of The Guardian was similarly scathing, saying the album had not {{stood the test of}} time and was [...] "unlistenable to today", singling out [...] "Sussudio" [...] for particular criticism, arguing: [...] "the production, the drum machine, the inane sincerity of the lyrics; there's no colder or more superficial sound in popular music, <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> takes itself so seriously." [...] He also compared it unfavourably with the enduring appeal of Collins's 1980s contemporaries such as the Human League and—in particular—the Pet Shop Boys, saying the latter were [...] "geniuses by comparison".|$|E

The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around." [...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one momentthe judge's final speechI wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves". Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, {{each with its own}} tense rhythm and explosive payoff". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's going to do next.

It received rave reviews from critics, most notably from Roger Ebert, who gave it four stars. Ebert described An Officer and a Gentleman as [...] "a wonderful movie <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> so willing to deal with matters of the heart...it takes chances, takes the time to know and develop its characters, and by the time this movie's wonderful last scene comes along, we know exactly what's happening, and why, and it makes us very happy."

40|$|Generally, {{the main}} skeptical {{opposition}} that projects like the Connectome face are statements like: It {{is all very}} well to explain the machinery and mechanisms of the brain, but what will that really teach us about our selves, our minds, what makes us really tick, our mental life?

In its third part, the text criticizes Spivak's interpretative and argumentative strategies, mainly claiming that in her case there is a disappearance not only of the work, but of the object itself. The paper ends with considerations on the consequences of such disappearance, indicating that the representation of the excluded, for all its thematization (or <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it),</b> is more problematical than ever...|$|R
