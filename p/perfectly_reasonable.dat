5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were <b>perfectly</b> <b>reasonable</b> debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, {{there would be no}} stopping point because all contracts would have to spell out every intricacy of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, and yet there would be no real benefit from the increase in mass. The Court decided that it was <b>perfectly</b> <b>reasonable</b> for the union to use terms of art in a contract.|$|E
500|$|Dianetics was poorly {{received}} by the press and the scientific and medical professions. The American Psychological Association criticized Hubbard's claims as [...] "not supported by empirical evidence". Scientific American said that Hubbard's book contained [...] "more promises and less evidence per page than any publication since the invention of printing", while The New Republic called it a [...] "bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and <b>perfectly</b> <b>reasonable</b> common sense, taken from long acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology". Some of Hubbard's fellow science fiction writers also criticized it; Isaac Asimov considered it [...] "gibberish" [...] while Jack Williamson called it [...] "a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology".|$|E

He forgot that it was <b>perfectly</b> possible--indeed, the <b>reasonable</b> course--to wait till the {{performance}} was over, and renew his appeal to Alice to marry him {{on the way back to}} her hotel.

6000|$|On Friday night Mrs. Claughton dreamed {{a number}} of things {{connected}} with her journey; a page of the notes made from this dream was shown to Mr. Myers. Thus her half ticket was not to be taken, she was to find a Mr. Francis, concerned in the private affairs of the ghosts, which needed rectifying, and so forth. These premonitions, with others, were all fulfilled. Mrs. Claughton, in the church at night, continued her conversation with the ghosts whose acquaintance she had made at Rapingham. She obtained, it seems, all the information needful to settling the mysterious matters which disturbed the male ghost who hid his face, and on Monday morning she visited the daughter of Mr. Howard in her country house in a park, [...] "recognised the strong likeness to her father, and carried out all things desired by the dead to the full, as had been requested. [...] . The wishes expressed to her were <b>perfectly</b> rational, <b>reasonable</b> and of natural importance." ...|$|R
500|$|As {{with most}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{the plot of}} Trial by Jury is ludicrous, but the {{characters}} behave as if the events were <b>perfectly</b> <b>reasonable.</b> [...] This narrative technique blunts some of the pointed barbs aimed at hypocrisy, especially of those in authority, and the sometimes base motives of supposedly respectable people and institutions. [...] These themes became favourites of Gilbert {{through the rest of}} his collaborations with Sullivan. [...] Critics and audiences praised how well Sullivan's witty and good-humoured music complemented Gilbert's satire. [...] The success of Trial by Jury launched the famous series of 13collaborative works between Gilbert and Sullivan that {{came to be known as}} the Savoy Operas.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{guide to}} Abdisho’s support the letter must be treated with caution. [...] His claim to the western districts (Amid, Mardin and Seert had Catholic bishops, and he also {{controlled}} the monasteries of Mar Pethion in the Mardin district and Mar Yaqob the Recluse in the Seert district) was <b>perfectly</b> <b>reasonable,</b> and he certainly had two metropolitans in India. [...] His claim to the Erbil, Urmi and Salmas districts {{may also have been}} justified, in view of the support for Sulaqa from their bishops. [...] Alqosh, however, was the stronghold of his rival Shemon VII Ishoyahb, who also controlled Telkepe and Karamlish. [...] Abdisho perhaps felt obliged, as 'patriarch of Mosul', to assert a claim to the Mosul district, and may have had a bishop nominally responsible for the villages of the Mosul plain.|$|E

50|$|Utopia {{contrasts}} {{the contentious}} social life of European {{states with the}} <b>perfectly</b> orderly, <b>reasonable</b> social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, {{men and women are}} educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used monastic communalism (rather than the biblical communalism in the Acts of the Apostles) as his model, although other concepts such as legalizing euthanasia remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.|$|R
60|$|We have next to {{determine}} the average lengths of the A and B generations, which may be roughly done by basing it on the usual estimate of an average generation, irrespectively of sex, at {{a third of a}} century, or say of an average female generation at 31.5 years. We will further take 20 years as being 4.5 years earlier than the average time of marriage, and 29 years as 4.5 years later than it, so that the length of each generation of the A group will be 27 years, and that of the B group will be 36 years. All these suppositions appear to be <b>perfectly</b> fair and <b>reasonable,</b> while it may easily be shown that any other suppositions within the bounds of probability would lead to results of the same general order.|$|R

[...] "We kinda make it up as we go along... and it is <b>perfectly</b> <b>reasonable</b> for the scientific community to want to change those rules." [...] Science writer Philip Ball, in a review of Farewell in The Guardian, stated that Baggott was right [...] "although his target is as much the way this science is marketed as what it contains." [...] Ball cautioned Baggott about criticising scientists that speculate because [...] "conjecture injects vitality into science." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} episode Barry {{was seen}} to chase Natalie to the abortion clinic, where he persuaded her {{to go through with}} the pregnancy. The scenes between Natalie and Barry have been described as some of “the most powerful moments in soap, with the couple battling to decide the fate of their unborn baby”. The character {{was seen to}} give birth to son Jack in January 2002 and her decision to keep her baby in spite of her initial determination to abort [...] has been [...] mocked by Susannah Nightingale – columnist for the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) women's campaign. [...] She sarcastically comments “how lucky that she didn't go through with that patently psychotic urge for an abortion when she first realised she was pregnant [...] It's funny, because Nat seemed so sure at the time: she wasn't ready for a baby, she needed to establish her career and move out of her husband's family home before becoming a mother. <b>Perfectly</b> <b>reasonable,</b> you might think [...] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew – thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction".|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The American Spectator, Jeremy Lott commented {{positively}} {{about the}} protest movement: [...] "While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, {{people across the}} country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold." [...] Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. [...] "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion {{is as important as the}} indignation that comes from the Muslim side," [...] he told the [...] NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). [...] "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [...] Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. [...] "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," [...] he said. In an analysis of the protest movement and surrounding controversy, staff writer Liliana Segura of AlterNet noted, [...] "In a democratic society where free speech is vigilantly protected, it is <b>perfectly</b> <b>reasonable</b> to call out censorship, particularly when it springs from some form of tyrannical religious extremism." ...|$|E

He began, fairly enough, with a modest explanation of his absurd Christian name, which at once checked the merriment of the audience. But as he went on the mad side of him showed itself. He mixed up sense and nonsense in the strangest confusion; he was called to order over and over again; he was even threatened with fine and imprisonment for contempt of Court. In short, he was just like himself--a mixture of the strangest and the most opposite qualities; at one time <b>perfectly</b> clear and <b>reasonable,</b> as you said just now; at another breaking out into rhapsodies of the most outrageous kind, like a man in a state of delirium.

30|$|Watermarking {{researches}} {{have emerged}} for around 15  years, and reversible data hiding is a recently developed branch in watermarking researches [3, 4]. For conventional watermarking, at the encoder, the secret {{information should be}} embedded into the original multimedia contents, digital images in most cases, {{by the use of}} algorithms developed by researchers. Then, the watermarked media can be transmitted to the receiver. Data loss or intentional attacks may be experienced during transmission. After reception of the delivered watermarked media, only the secret information needs to be extracted [1]. In contrast, for reversible data hiding, data embedding is similar to its counterpart with conventional watermarking applications. Different from watermarking, for reversible data hiding, after the reception of marked media, both the original content and embedded secret information need to be recovered and extracted <b>perfectly</b> with a <b>reasonable</b> amount of side information [5, 6]. And this is the origin of the term “reversible” comes from. Besides the development of algorithms, reversible data hiding can be applicable to the protection of medical images [7, 8], or the integration with encryption techniques [9]. Due to this kind of characteristics, during the transmission, the watermarked media need to be kept intact.|$|R
6000|$|Now, {{let us look}} at {{the light}} which we get from the spirit guides upon this {{question}} of Christianity. Opinion is not absolutely uniform yonder, any more than it is here; but reading a number of messages upon this subject, they amount to this: There are many higher spirits with our departed. They vary in degree. Call them [...] "angels," [...] and you are in touch with old religious thought. High above all these is the greatest spirit of whom they have cognizance--not God, since God is so infinite that He is not within their ken--but one who is nearer God and to that extent represents God. This is the Christ Spirit. His special care is the earth. He came down upon it at a time of great earthly depravity--a time when the world was almost as wicked as it is now, in order to give the people the lesson of an ideal life. Then he returned to his own high station, having left an example which is still occasionally followed. That is the story of Christ as spirits have described it. There is nothing here of Atonement or Redemption. But there is a <b>perfectly</b> feasible and <b>reasonable</b> scheme, which I, for one, could readily believe.|$|R

6000|$|The {{alternatives}} fall roughly {{under three}} headings. The {{first is to}} assume there is a best race, to define {{as well as one}} can that best race, and to regard all other races as material for extermination. This has a fine, modern, biological air ("Survival of the Fittest"). If you are one of those queer German professors who write insanity about Welt-Politik, you assume the best race is the [...] "Teutonic"; Cecil Rhodes affected that triumph of creative imagination, the [...] "Anglo-Saxon race"; my friend, Moses Cohen, thinks there is much to be said for the Jew. On its premises, this is a <b>perfectly</b> sound and <b>reasonable</b> policy, and it opens out a brilliant prospect for the scientific inventor for what one might call Welt-Apparat in the future, for national harrowing and reaping machines, and race-destroying fumigations. The great plain of China ("Yellow Peril") lends itself particularly to some striking wholesale undertaking; it might, for example, be flooded for a few days, and then disinfected with volcanic chlorine. Whether, when all the inferior races have been stamped out, the superior race would not proceed at once, or after a brief millennial period of social harmony, to divide itself into sub-classes, and begin the business over again at a higher level, is an interesting residual question into which we need not now penetrate.|$|R
40|$|Basic {{concepts}} of Bayesian inference and relevant applications for GW observations will be presented, {{with emphasis on}} binary systems. The mini-course will include key conceptual aspects of the numerical tech-niques used to apply these methods to general problems in Bayesian in-ference, with specific examples for GW observations and software libraries used in the actual LIGO/Virgo analysis. The exercise sessions will be a hands-on session to design a simple stochastic sampler to measure the masses of binary compact objects and an actual analysis of LIGO/Virgo data with the standard LIGO library analysis tools to locate a source {{in the sky and}} provide information about the relevant astrophysical param-eters. 1 Basic concepts We are so used to the way our brain processes information that we rarely stop to wonder about its mechanisms. For instance, imagine a situation in which a policeman sees a gentleman running with a purse in his hand. He decides immediately that the gentleman is dishonest and starts chasing him. There could be many <b>perfectly</b> legitimate and <b>reasonable</b> explainations for this man running with a purse in his hand, maybe his wife forgot it home ans she is at the train station and he needs to get there in time, however the policeman implicitly deems any explaination other than “he stole the purse ” much less probable. What is the process that leads the policeman to his inference about some observation? What are its principles? Scientific inference is dealing with the same exact proble as the policeman is: given some data which consist of some physical effect and superimposed noise, what do we learn about the physical effect of interest? When do we decide that a given physical effect is real or that a given explanation is “correct”? 1. 1 Fundamentals of logic: propositions A logical proposition is any sentence which can be either true or false.
