40|$|We {{extend the}} fictitious source {{superposition}} method {{in order to}} model linear defects in photonic woodpiles, and we use themethod tomodel a waveguide that is created by changing either the radius or refractive index of a single rod of an infinite woodpile composed of chalcogenide glass cylinders. In one instance, a nearly constant disper-sion was observed over a sizable kx interval, where kx is the Bloch vector in the waveguiding direction, making this a compelling geometry for slow-light waveguides. The principal advantage of the method {{is that it does}} not rely on a supercell, thus avoiding what is possibly the greatest source of inefficiency present in most of the other methods that are used for modeling these structures. Instead, the method proceeds by placing an artificial source inside each rod of the defect layer and then subsequently taking an appropriate field superposition to remove all but one of these sources. The remaining source can then be used to mimic the fields that would be produced by <b>a</b> <b>defec...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two apo{{lipoprotein}} E (apoE) receptors, {{the very}} low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and apoE receptor 2 (apoER 2), are also receptors for Reelin, a signaling protein that regulates neuronal migration during brain development. In the adult brain, Reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons, suggesting a potential {{function as a}} modulator of neurotransmission. ApoE receptors have been indirectly implicated in memory and neurodegenerative disorders because their ligand, apoE, is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease.

40|$|Alkaptonuria is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by an}} accumulation of homogentisic acid due to <b>an</b> enzymatic <b>defec</b> of homogentisate 1, 2 dioxygenase. The homogentisic acid is excreted exclusively by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion leading to the renal parenchyma being exposed to high concentrations of homogentisic acid. The alkaptonuric patients are at higher risk of renal stones (and of prostate stones for males), usually in the later stages of the disease. We describe {{the case of a}} 51 -year-old man whose renal and prostate stones were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, respectively.

A CT scan could preoperatively suggest the diagnosis, which was confirmed by surgical repair of the diaphragmatic defect. In this report, we stress that a CT scan can provide useful information for preoperative evaluation of diaphragmatic injuries.

40|$|B cell {{functional}} heterogeneity {{has been}} well studied {{over the last few}} years. It is now established that different B cell subsets mount productive antibody responses to different antigens (1 - 8), although the exact way in which responses to various antigens will be assigned to B cell subsets is still a matter of some controversy. Particularly useful in these experiments has been the X chromosome-linked defect (xid) carried by the CBA/N mouse. A lesion in the xid gene results in a mouse with low response to certain antigens (9 - 13) and a complete absence of B cells able to respond to type 2 thymus-independent antigens such as trinitrophenylated Ficoll (1). These mice also lack B cells bearing the surface markers Lyb- 3 (14) and Lyb- 5 (15). Lyb- 5 - B cells from normal animals have been reported deficient in their ability to respond to thymus-dependent antigens such as sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) 1 when incubated with the normally stimulatory collection of factors present in the concanavalin A (Con A) -stimulated supernatants (Sn) of normal spleen cells.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to deliver, temporally, bioactive growth factors {{in combination with}} appropriate progenitor and stem cells to sites of tissue regeneration promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis offers therapeutic opportunities in regenerative medicine. We have examined the bone regenerative potential of encapsulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) biodegradable poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds created using supercritical CO(2) fluid technology to encapsulate and release solvent-sensitive and thermolabile growth factors in combination with human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) implanted in a mouse femur segmental defect (5 mm) for 4 weeks. HBMSC seeded on VEGF encapsulated PLA scaffolds showed significant bone regeneration in the femur segmental defect compared to the scaffold alone and scaffold seeded with HBMSC as analysed by indices of increased bone volume (BV mm(3)), trabecular number (Tb. N/mm) and reduced trabecular separation (Tb. Sp. mm) in the defect region using micro-computed tomography.
