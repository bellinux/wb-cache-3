25|$|Bacon is a {{meat product}} {{prepared}} from cured pork. It is first cured using {{large quantities of}} salt, either a brine or a dry packing. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, {{or it may be}} boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It can be made from the <b>pork</b> <b>belly</b> or from back cuts, which has less fat than the belly.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Norman {{gave the}} {{restaurant}} {{three and a}} half stars out of five, following a visit in early 2014 for The Daily Telegraph. He praised the soufflé and the French onion soup, but called the monkfish [...] "bland". The <b>pork</b> <b>belly</b> dish was described by his colleague as [...] "superb, just the right side of too intimately piggy". Norman concluded that the restaurant was a [...] "slick operation", but the [...] "character, vibrancy and fun had been slaughtered on the altar of satisfying the inspectorate".|$|E
500|$|Neil Thomas {{visited the}} {{restaurant}} shortly {{after it was}} awarded a Michelin star. He gave it a rating of five out of five in his review for the Shropshire Star. He praised the Cerwyn cheese soufflé and the pheasant pithiviers starters, as well as three of the mains; a roast duck dish, the <b>pork</b> <b>belly</b> dish, and a venison dish. Around the same time, Sally Williams reviewed the restaurant for the Western Mail, who also praised the soufflé. She called the atmosphere [...] "comfortable" [...] and stated {{that it had a}} home-like quality to it. In 2013, the restaurant was ranked as the second best in Wales, behind The Walnut Tree in Abergavenny, in the Sunday Times list of the 100 best restaurants in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the Chicago Butter and Egg Board traded {{only two}} types of {{contracts}}, butter and eggs.

40|$|Commercial bacon {{processors}} often raise {{concerns regarding}} the management practice of frozen storage of the bellies prior to curing and processing for sliced bacon. Deterioration of quality measures {{is a concern}} and is usually attributed to freezer storage. A secondary issue, {{in the production of}} bacon including those processed from frozen bellies, is the effect of breed and sex of pigs. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to determine the effect of a 15 -day frozen storage time, the genetics, and sex of the pig on the quality and fatty acid profile of <b>pork</b> <b>bellies.</b> Frozen storage of fresh <b>pork</b> <b>bellies</b> did not pose any significant quality problems. However, significant differences in the fatty acid profile of fat from the bellies were observed between breeds of pigs. Fat accounts for about 60 % of the composition of a slice of bacon. Thus, fatty acid differences of fresh bellies due to breed effects may {{have a significant impact on}} bacon fatty acid composition...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the loss}} of the lucrative onion trading market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was brought to the brink of bankruptcy. In order to stay solvent, they began trading in <b>pork</b> <b>bellies</b> in 1962. <b>Pork</b> <b>bellies</b> proved to be a popular product and brought fresh growth as meat packing {{companies}} joined the exchange. At Harris' insistence, the exchange also began trading in live cattle in November 1964. Harris later described the introduction of live cattle trading as his [...] "monument". Harris celebrated the beginning of live cattle trading by parading an Angus calf around the trading floor. Cattle trading later became one of the mainstay products of the exchange. The Chicago Board of Trade later began offering live cattle trading to compete with the Mercantile Exchange. Harris accused the Board of Trade of [...] "violating an unwritten law of commodity trading" [...] by offering the same product that was launched by a neighboring exchange. Though Harris circulated a public petition which demanded the Board of Trade cease copying the Mercantile Exchange, the Board of Trade continued trading in live cattle futures.|$|R
500|$|The term {{bacon in}} this book does not refer to the sliced and {{pre-packaged}} bacon that is ubiquitous in American markets, but instead the cured whole side of the pig. Furthermore, the differences between bacon in the United States and in the United Kingdom are quite pronounced, and the book refers only to cuts common in the United Kingdom. The cut {{that is used to}} produce [...] "American bacon" [...] is a cut referred to as [...] "streaky bacon" [...] in the United Kingdom. Most bacon consumed in the United Kingdom is known as back bacon and consists of both <b>pork</b> <b>belly</b> and pork loin in a single cut. The Wiltshire cut was a way to divide up the meat, and was marketed to consumers in still further cuts.|$|E

The Pasta section has {{a recipe for}} [...] "Bacon Mac and Cheese" [...] from Julie Taras Wallach, the chef and {{co-owner}} of the Tipsy Parson and Little Giant restaurants in New York City. Her variant on the traditional macaroni and cheese uses cavatelli pasta seasoned with dijon mustard, thyme, rosemary, garlic, and nutmeg and incorporates sauteed onion and pieces of grilled bacon. One of the recipes in the Meat section, [...] "Veal and Foie Gras Meatloaf Wrapped in Bacon", comes from Mark Allen, who in 1997 became the youngest chef, and the first American, to have headed The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston. Allen also contributed a recipe for the Fish section, [...] "Whole Roasted Branzino with Carrots and Bacon". Other dishes in that section include [...] "Pancetta-Wrapped Monkfish with Cauliflower Flan" [...] and [...] "Bluefish with Corn, Avocado, and Bacon Salad".|$|E
25|$|A {{commodities}} exchange is an exchange where various commodities and derivatives are traded. Most commodity markets {{across the world}} trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, cocoa, coffee, milk products, <b>pork</b> <b>bellies,</b> oil, metals, etc.) and contracts based on them. These contracts can include spot prices, forwards, futures and options on futures. Other sophisticated products may include interest rates, environmental instruments, swaps, or freight contracts.|$|R
50|$|The {{smoke house}} is {{essential}} for the preservation and long term storage of hams, shoulders, bacon sides, and <b>pork</b> <b>bellies.</b> The meat is hung on racks and hooks in the smokehouse; and later smoked. Fragrant hardwood, such as hickory, beech, or cherry is allowed to smolder slowly in a pit below the hanging meat. This gives added flavor and color to the meat as well as serving to dry cure the pork.|$|R
40|$|The lean hog futures {{contract}} is replacing the live hog {{futures contract}} at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange {{beginning with the}} February 1997 contract. The lean hog futures will be cash settled based on a broad-based lean hog price index, eliminating terminal markets from the price discovery process. Using this index over a twenty-month period {{as a proxy for}} the lean hog futures price, this paper compares the hedging effectiveness of the live hog futures contract to the hedging potential of the lean hog futures contract for cash live hogs as well as four cash meat cuts. Frozen <b>pork</b> <b>bellies</b> futures are also examined for the cash meats. Both long- term and short-term hedges are simulated, using the minimum- variance approach, which utilizes only unconditional information, and the Myers-Thompson approach that incorporates conditional information. The results show that the lean hog futures should perform better than either the live hog or the frozen <b>pork</b> <b>bellies</b> futures as a hedging instrument for Omaha cash hogs and cash loins. The strongest evidence of this is for the short-term hedging of cash hogs. For the other three meats, no futures contract demonstrated a clear hedging advantage. ...|$|R
500|$|Writing for The Sacramento Bee, Allen Pierleoni {{recommended}} {{the book as}} a gift for Father's Day, and called the work [...] "entertaining and informational, full of anecdotes, history, recipes and explanations of what <b>pork</b> <b>belly</b> has brought to the popular culture". Rita Zekas of the Toronto Star also {{recommended the}} book as a Father's Day gift. Kerry J. Byrne noted that the book covers [...] "everything from bacon-curing methods to bacon blogs" [...] and includes [...] "easy recipes". Publishers Weekly reviewed called the book a [...] "voluminous look at all things bacon"; the review concluded, [...] "Readers who, like Lauer, possess a borderline-obsessive love for bacon are likely to embrace this as their new Bible, but anyone else will quickly get their fill."

500|$|The {{distinctive}} claw, on {{the second}} digit of dromaeosaurids, has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon; its assumed use being to cut and disembowel prey. In the [...] "Fighting Dinosaurs" [...] specimen, the Velociraptor lies underneath, with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of Protoceratops is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker. This suggests Velociraptor may have used its sickle claw to pierce vital organs of the throat, such as the jugular vein, carotid artery, or trachea (windpipe), rather than slashing the abdomen. The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not unusually sharp, which may have precluded any sort of cutting or slashing action, although only the bony core of the claw is known. The thick abdominal wall of skin and muscle of large prey species {{would have been difficult}} to slash without a specialized cutting surface. The slashing hypothesis was tested during a 2005 BBC documentary, The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs. The producers of the program created an artificial Velociraptor leg with a sickle claw and used a <b>pork</b> <b>belly</b> to simulate the dinosaur's prey. Though the sickle claw did penetrate the abdominal wall, it was unable to tear it open, indicating that the claw was not used to disembowel prey.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages". Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese <b>pork</b> <b>belly.</b> For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E
50|$|The loss of {{a lucrative}} trading product was devastating to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The other {{products}} that were traded, including futures contracts on eggs, turkeys, and potatoes, were not large enough to support the exchange.

These proved to be popular products and eventually restored lost popularity to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.|$|R
40|$|Using {{settlement}} {{prices and}} {{nine years of}} daily commitments for large reporting traders in the frozen <b>pork</b> <b>bellies</b> futures market, the authors find that these traders generate significant profits {{and the distribution of}} trader returns over time is not random. Further analysis finds that a subset of large elite traders possesses significant forecasting ability, indicating that they not only are able to consistently anticipate the direction of price changes but are also {{on the right side of}} the market when large price changes occur.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{volatility of}} commodity market {{prices in the}} 19702 ̆ 7 s and early 1980 ^s has sharply increased {{the risks associated with}} commodity procurement and inventory management in most food processing and distribution firms. Many firms dealing in commodities which have futures markets can use the futures markets as procurement or inventory management tools, but many commodities have no viable futures market. For example, most wholesale meat products (with the exception of <b>pork</b> <b>bellies,</b> boneless beef, and iced broilers) are traded only on cash markets, so hedging pork loins, hams, and most other beef and pork products cannot be done in a directly comparable futures market [...] ...|$|R
