50|$|The health {{burden of}} tobacco usage and in {{particular}} tobacco smoking is very well known. Tobacco smoking is a major global health epidemic with an estimated 1.3 billion individuals regularly smoking tobacco products across the world, predominantly cigarettes. It is well established that the key pharmacological element of tobacco addiction is the delivery of nicotine to the brain, leading {{to the release of}} a range of neurotransmitters such as dopamine which yield powerful feelings of “reward” and “pleasure” to the individual. The tobacco cigarette is a highly efficient nicotine delivery system that achieves rapid <b>pulmonary</b> <b>delivery</b> and sharp increases in the nicotine concentration in both arterial and venous blood. Although nicotine is the predominant addictive chemical in tobacco smoke, it is the other (approximately 4000) chemicals, including carcinogenic agents in the particulate phase, that lead to the well-established adverse health consequences of smoking. The World Health Organisation estimates that tobacco usage killed around 5.4 million people a year and by 2030 projections estimate this figure will rise to around 8.3 million deaths per year.|$|E

There are two reasons for choosing csMSN as carrier for improving PAC solubility.

According to the Noyes-Whitney and Ostwald-Freundlich equations, this would increase the dissolution rate of PAC. Secondly, csMSN has a regular shape, low density, and good flowability which make them suitable as a carrier for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>delivery.</b> In the work, we wished to investigate whether csMSN {{could be used as}} a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>delivery</b> carrier using a lung absorption study at a cellular level.|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is an {{autosomal recessive}} monogenetic disease that afflicts nearly 70 000 patients worldwide. The mutation {{results in the}} accumulation of viscous mucus in multiple organs especially in the lungs, liver and pancreas. High associated morbidity and mortality is caused by CF {{due to the lack}} of effective therapies. It is widely accepted that morbidity and mortality caused by CF is primarily due to the respiratory manifestations of the disease. Consequently, several approaches were recently developed for treatment of lung complications of CF. However, the lack of effective methods for delivery and especially targeted delivery of therapeutics specifically to lung tissues and cells limits the efficiency of the therapy. Local <b>pulmonary</b> <b>delivery</b> of therapeutics has two major advantages over systemic application. First, it enhances the accumulation of therapeutics specifically in the lungs and therefore increases the efficiency of the treatment. Second, local lung delivery substantially prevents the penetration of the delivered drug into the systemic circulation limiting adverse side effects of the treatment on other organs and tissues.

40|$|Small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{has a huge}} {{potential}} for the treatment or prevention of various lung diseases. Once the RNA molecules have successfully entered the target cells, they could inhibit the expression of specific gene sequence through RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism and generate therapeutic effects. The biggest obstacle to translating siRNA therapy from the laboratories into the clinics is delivery. An ideal delivery agent should protect the siRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape inside the cells, with negligible toxicity. Lung targeting could be achieved by systemic delivery or <b>pulmonary</b> <b>delivery.</b> The latter route of administration could potentially enhance siRNA retention in the lungs and reduce systemic toxic effects. However the presence of mucus, the mucociliary clearance actions and the high degree branching of the airways present major barriers to targeted <b>pulmonary</b> <b>delivery.</b> The delivery systems need to be designed carefully {{in order to maximize}} the siRNA deposition to the diseased area of the airways.
