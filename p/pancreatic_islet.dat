50|$|The <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> or islets of Langerhans are {{the regions}} of the {{pancreas}} that contain its endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) cells, discovered in 1869 by German pathological anatomist Paul Langerhans. The <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> constitute 1 to 2% of the pancreas volume and receive 10-15% of its blood flow.

2500|$|The first {{promoter}} {{from the}} 5' end, {{referred to as}} the [...] "upstream" [...] or neuroendocrine promoter, is active in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islet</b> cells, neural tissue, and enterocytes (small intestine cells) to produce the [...] "neuroendocrine isoform" [...] of glucokinase. The second promoter, the [...] "downstream" [...] or liver promoter, is active in hepatocytes and directs production of the [...] "liver isoform". The two promoters have little or no sequence homology and are separated by a 30 kbp sequence which has not yet been shown to incur any functional differences between isoforms. The two promoters are functionally exclusive and governed by distinct sets of regulatory factors, so that glucokinase expression can be regulated separately in different tissue types. The two promoters correspond to two broad categories of glucokinase function: In liver, glucokinase acts as the gateway for the [...] "bulk processing" [...] of available glucose, while, in the neuroendocrine cells, it acts as a sensor, triggering cell responses that affect body-wide carbohydrate metabolism.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Voronoff's {{negative}} {{reputation was}} softened. In November 1991, {{one of the}} oldest peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, The Lancet, suggested that the file on Voronoff's work be reopened and in particular that [...] "the Medical Research Council should fund further studies on monkey glands." [...] By 1994, there were calls for a qualified apology from the orthodox medical establishment for dismissing Voronoff's work. In particular, since modern medicine has established that the Sertoli cells of the testes constitute a barrier to the immune system, rendering the testes an immunologically privileged site for the transplantation of foreign tissue, the thin slices of monkey testicles Voronoff implanted into the patient's testicles may in theory have survived to produce some benefit. There have recently been successful experiments reducing insulin requirements in diabetics by implanting into them <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islet</b> cells from pigs coated in Sertoli cells to insulate them from attack by the immune system. [...] No immunosuppressive drugs were required. In 1998, the sweeping popularity of Viagra brought forth references to Voronoff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} islet {{transplantation}} is not new. [...] Investigators {{as early as}} the English surgeon Charles Pybus (1882–1975) attempted to graft pancreatic tissue to cure diabetes. Most, however, credit the recent era of islet transplantation research to Paul Lacy's studies dating back more than three decades. In 1967, Lacy's group described a novel collagenase-based method (later modified by Dr. Camillo Ricordi, then working with Dr. Lacy) to isolate islets, paving the way for future in vitro and in vivo islet experiments. Subsequent studies showed that transplanted islets could reverse diabetes in both rodents and non-human primates. In a summary of the 1977 Workshop on <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>Islet</b> Cell Transplantation in Diabetes, Lacy commented on the feasibility of “islet cell transplantation as a therapeutic approach [...] the possible prevention of the complications of diabetes in man”. Improvements in isolation techniques and immunosuppressive regimens ushered in the first human islet transplantation clinical trials in the mid-1980s. The first successful trial of human islet allotransplantation resulting in long-term reversal of diabetes was performed at the University of Pittsburgh in 1990. Yet despite continued procedural improvements, only about 10% of islet recipients in the late 1990s achieved euglycemia (normal blood glucose). In 2000, Dr. James Shapiro and colleagues published a report describing seven consecutive patients who achieved euglycemia following islet transplantation using a steroid-free protocol and large numbers of donor islets, since referred to as the Edmonton protocol. This protocol has been adapted by islet transplant centers around the world and has greatly increased islet transplant success.|$|E

40|$|Melatonin diminishes insulin release {{through the}} {{activation}} of MT 1 receptors {{and a reduction}} in cAMP production in isolated <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> of neonate and adult rats and in INS- 1 cells (an insulin-secreting cell line). The pancreas of pinealectomized rats exhibits degenerative pathological changes with low islet density, indicating that melatonin plays a role to ensure the functioning of pancreatic beta cells. By using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis we demonstrated, in isolated rat <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets,</b> that melatonin induces insulin growth factor receptor (IGF-R) and insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine phosphorylation and mediates the activities of the PI 3 K/AKT and MEK/ERKs pathways, which are involved in cell survival and growth, respectively.

The metabolic {{mechanism by which}} glucose catabolism is coupled to insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cells from MSG-treated rats is understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate glucose metabolism in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> from MSG-treated rats subjected to swimming training. Methods: MSG-treated and control (CON) rats swam for 30 minutes (3 times/week) over a period of 10 weeks. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> were isolated and incubated with glucose in the presence of glycolytic or mitochondrial inhibitors. Results: Swimming training attenuated fat pad accumulation, avoiding changes in the plasma levels of lipids, glucose and insulin in MSG-treated rats. Adipocyte and islet hypertrophy observed in MSG-treated rats were attenuated by exercise. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> from MSG-treated obese rats also showed insulin hypersecretion, greater glucose transporter 2 (GLUT 2) expression, increased glycolytic flux and reduced mitochondrial complex III activity. Conclusion: Swimming training attenuated islet hypertrophy and normalised GLUT 2 expression, contributing to a reduction in the glucose responsiveness of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> from MSG-treated rats without altering glycolytic flux. However, physical training increased the activity of mitochondrial complex III in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> from MSG-treated rats without a subsequent increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion...|$|R

40|$|Insulin {{deficiency}} in {{type 1 diabetes}} leads to disruptions in glucose, lipid, and ketone metabolism with resultant hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and ketonemia. Exogenous insulin and hepatic insulin gene therapy cannot mimic the robust glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from native <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets.</b> Gene therapy of streptozotocin-diabetic mice with neurogenin 3 (Ngn 3) and betacellulin (Btc) leads to the induction of periportal oval cell-derived neo-islets that exhibit GSIS. We hence hypothesized that this gene therapy regimen {{may lead to a}} complete correction of the glucose and lipid metabolic abnormalities associated with insulin deficiency; we further hypothesized that the neo-islets formed in response to Ngn 3 -Btc gene delivery may display an ultrastructure and transcription profile similar to that of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets.</b> We injected streptozotocin-diabetic mice with helper-dependent adenoviral vectors carrying Ngn 3 and Btc, which restored GSIS and reversed hyperglycemia in these animals. The treatment also normalized hepatic glucose secretion and reversed ketonemia. Furthermore, it restored hepatic glycogen content and reinstated hepatic lipogenesis-related gene transcripts back to nondiabetic levels. By transmission electron microscopy, the neo-islets displayed electron-dense granules that were similar in appearance to those in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets.</b> Finally, using RNA obtained by laser capture microdissection of the periportal neo-islets and normal <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets,</b> we found that the neo-islets and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> exhibited a very similar transcription profile on microarray-based transcriptome analysis. Taken together, this indicates that Ngn 3 -Btc gene therapy corrects the underlying dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-deficient diabetic mice by inducing neo-islets in the liver that are similar to <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> in structure and gene expression profile...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAutoimmune type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) development {{results from}} the interaction between pancreatic β-cells, and the innate and the adaptive immune systems culminating with {{the destruction of the}} insulin-secreting β-cells by autoreactive T cells. This diabetogenic course starts during the first postnatal weeks by the infiltration of the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> by innate immune cells and particularly neutrophils. Here, we aim to determine the cellular and molecular mechanism leading to the recruitment of this neutrophils in the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Here, we show that neutrophil recruitment in the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets</b> is controlled by inflammatory macrophages and β-cells themselves. Macrophages and β-cells produce the chemokines CXCL 1 and CXCL 2, recruiting CXCR 2 -expressing neutrophils from the blood to the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>islets.</b> We further show that pancreatic macrophages secrete IL- 1 β-inducing CXCR 2 ligand production by the β-cells. Finally, the blockade of neutrophil recruitment at early ages using CXCR 2 antagonist dampens the diabetogenic T-cell response and the later development of autoimmune diabetes, supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach...|$|R
