5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E

After an experimental treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some <b>people</b> <b>will,</b> out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe <b>people</b> <b>will</b> stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most <b>people</b> <b>will</b> have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
5|$|In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, {{published}} in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will {{and argued that}} it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what <b>people</b> <b>will</b> do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.|$|E

5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} benign MS, although <b>people</b> <b>will</b> still build up some degree of disability in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis. 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

Contemptuously, Naritsugu announces that both {{the people and the}} samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lords.

Naritsugu and Shinzaemon mortally wound each other. As the lord crawls away in mud crying and experiencing fear and pain for the first time, he thanks Shinzaemon for showing him excitement before Shinzaemon chops his head off.|$|E

2500|$|Maher Abd Al-Hafiz Hajjar, {{formerly}} {{from the}} <b>People's</b> <b>Will</b> Party, a 43-year-old MP from Aleppo. This party {{is led by}} veteran opposition leader Qadri Jamil who supported the initial protests in 2011 but then described calls for {{the overthrow of the}} government as [...] "unrealistic and useless". Jamil {{was a member of the}} committee that drafted the new Constitution of Syria in 2011.

Jamil was nominated Deputy Prime Minister by President Assad in June 2012 but was removed in October 2013. The small number of MPs from the party indicates that most of his nominations must have come from either independents or MPs from the ruling National Progressive Front. A statement from the <b>People's</b> <b>Will</b> Party on 27 April distanced the party from Hajjar, claiming that Hajjar was no longer a member of either the <b>People's</b> <b>Will</b> Party, or the Popular Front for Liberation and Change. Instead the statement claimed that Hajjar represented only himself.|$|R

5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), <b>people</b> <b>will</b> typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|Unwilling {{to allow}} the Aztecs to {{continue}} their practices, Madoc instigates war between the Aztecs and the much smaller Hoamen nation. While the Aztecs bring a large army, Madoc is able to use Welsh technology and superior tactics to overcome them. The Hoamen are able to take many prisoners while the Aztec king contracts a mortal illness. Following the battle Madoc shocks the Aztecs by releasing the prisoners instead of sacrificing them, and provides leeches to help the Aztec king recover from his disease. This leads to a treaty between the Aztecs and the Hoamen which abolishes human sacrifice. The Aztec priests fear to stop the practice, so the Aztec king decides that his <b>people</b> <b>will</b> abandon their religion and take up a monotheistic religion based on a God of love.|$|E
