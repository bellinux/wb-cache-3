However, after Laurer's death, her sister Kathy Hamilton told Bleacher Report that the couple disagreed about having children (Levesque wanted children while Laurer did not), and Laurer's addictions and mental health problems also contributed to their breakup.|$|E

[...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the tone of his voice.

On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and what he stands for, mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E

50|$|In {{interview}}s, Walcott {{has both}} affirmed and denied that Omeros {{is tied to}} the epic form. In one interview he stated that it was a type of epic poem, but in another interview he said the opposite, stating as part of his evidence that there are no epic-like battles in his poem. In Omeros Walcott implies that he has never read Homer, which is probably untrue based on the character names derived from Homer. Walcott's denial of his poem being tied too heavily to the epic form may stem from his concern that <b>people</b> <b>might</b> only <b>think</b> of it as being an epic-influenced poem instead of transcending the epic genre.|$|R

2500|$|The statues were {{destroyed}} by dynamite over several weeks, starting on 2 March 2001. The destruction {{was carried out in}} stages. Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery. This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them. During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal lamented that, [...] "This work of destruction is not as simple as <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>think.</b> You can't knock down the statues by shelling as both are carved into a cliff; they are firmly attached to the mountain". Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines {{at the bottom of the}} niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines. In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas. After one of the explosions failed to completely obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head.|$|E

I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>think,</b> there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine?

In week four, it peaked at #3, it scored #5 in week five, and fell to #37 in week six. This was because radio programmers removed the song from their playlists, fearing anger from <b>people</b> who <b>might</b> <b>think</b> it was ridiculing the mentally ill. This occurred most notably in the New York market, where both the New York Top 40 music radio stations of the time (WABC and WMCA) banned broadcasting of the song.

500|$|Jason Kaufman, a Harvard {{professor}} who teaches {{the sociology of}} culture, wrote that MOBA {{is part of a}} social trend he calls [...] "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, [...] "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles." [...] Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in Arlington, Virginia, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way.

40|$|Three {{views of}} the ideal of {{democracy}} dominate contemporary think-ing.

The fi rst view is that democracy is a system designed to empower the public will. It suggests that we can think about a democratic <b>people</b> as we <b>might</b> <b>think</b> about an individual, as a corporate body with a mind of its own. The assumption is that the people, considered in this collective sense, forms a will about who should be in government; what policies government should pursue; and what constitutional and other constraints government should operate under.

At the end of the day, whatever medium you work in, it is about storytelling and holding your audience. There are big differences of course, between film and television.

She also criticized our current pedophilia laws for emphasizing [...] "punishment, not prevention," [...] because these laws, according to her, [...] "ignore pedophilia until after the commission of a sexual offense." [...] She expected to receive about 95% negative emails in response to the column, but told Philadelphia that same day that she had instead [...] "gotten so many positive ones." [...] The article received more than 1200 online comments within a week, some of which were rejected by the Times moderators for attacking Kaplan and/or other commenters who expressed sympathy for pedophiles. Kaplan said she was not surprised by the negative comments her column received, saying, “People commonly confuse pedophilia with child sexual abuse. So if you even mention something that sounds empathetic to the mental disorder of pedophilia, <b>people</b> <b>might</b> incorrectly <b>think</b> you are excusing child sexual abuse.” Two days later, Keith Ablow responded to Kaplan's column, arguing that although he agreed with it on many points, he thought that Kaplan [...] "is wrong to suggest that, merely because something is a known disorder, it should result in protections under the law" [...] and arguing that [...] "If a pedophile wants to not attack children, he can receive confidential psychiatric treatment - including Depo-Provera to lower testosterone levels - to make it much less likely." ...|$|R
40|$|By {{around the}} age of 4 years, {{children}} “can work out what <b>people</b> <b>might</b> know, <b>think</b> or believe” {{based on what they}} say or do. This is called “mindreading,” which builds upon the human ability to infer the intentions of others. Game theory makes a strong assumption about what individual A can expect about B's intentions and vice versa, viz. that each is a self-interested opponent of the other and will reliably analyze games by using such basic principles as dominance and backward induction, and behave as if the normal form of an extensive form game is equivalent to the latter. But the extensive form allows intentions to be detected from actual sequential play and is therefore not necessarily equivalent psychologically to the normal form. We discuss Baron-Cohen's theory of the mindreading system [Baron-Cohen, S. (1995) Mindblindness: An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA) ] to motivate the comparison of behavior in an extensive form game with its corresponding normal form. As in the work of Rapoport [Rapoport, A. (1997) Int. J. Game Theory 26, 113 – 136] and Schotter et al. [Schotter, A., Wiegelt, K. & Wilson, C. (1994) Games Econ. Behav. 6, 445 – 468], we find consistent differences in behavior between the normal and extensive forms. In particular, we observe attempts to cooperate, and in some treatments we observe the achievement of cooperation, occurring more frequently in the extensive form. Cooperation in this context requires reciprocity, which is more difficult to achieve by means of intentionality detection in the normal as opposed to the extensive form games we study...|$|R
40|$|Placebos are an {{essential}} tool in randomised clinical trials, {{where they are}} used to control for bias and contextual healing effects. Placebos and their effects are also studied from multiple diverse perspectives, but the perspectives of placebo recipients are seldom considered. Research shows that people form cognitive and affective representations of active treatments such as medicines, and that they use these representations to guide their behaviour; it seems reasonable to suggest that <b>people</b> <b>might</b> also <b>think</b> about and develop representations of placebos. We adopted a qualitative approach to examine in detail how participants in one RCT, conducted in the USA, conceptualised placebos. 12 people were interviewed 3 times each, at the start, middle, and end of a trial of placebo effects and acupuncture for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The interview data were analysed inductively and we identified four ways in which the participants conceptualised placebos: placebos are necessary for research; placebo effects are fake; placebo acupuncture is not real acupuncture; placebos have real effects mediated by psychological mechanisms. Participants' conceptualisations of placebos were dynamic and situated in a broader psychological and socio-cultural context. Seeing placebo effects as legitimate seemed to be facilitated by having more holistic models of healing, viewing IBS as psychological, and seeing treatment as multifactorial. However, some participants maintained a negative view of placebo effects (e. g. as illusions) that was apparently inconsistent with their other beliefs (e. g. in mind-body healing mechanisms). This may indicate a dominance of negative discourses around placebos at a socio-cultural level. Negative views of placebos are inconsistent with evidence that placebo treatments can have positive effects on symptoms. RCT participants should be informed about potential benefits of placebo treatments to avoid misunderstandings and unease. Future work should improve methods of providing participants with full accurate information about placebos and their effects...|$|R
