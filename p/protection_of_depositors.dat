40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the protection of}} taxpayers and depositors in the resolution of banks in the Banking Union. The research question concerns how the protection of taxpayers and depositors has been organized in the Banking Union. The thesis focuses on the Single Resolution Mechanism and Deposit Guarantee Schemes and will not discuss the {{other elements of the}} Banking Union. The protection of taxpayers is discussed vis-à-vis the allocation of the costs of banks under resolution and the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors</b> in terms of bail-in and Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The thesis answers the research question by employing the doctrinal and practical research methods and thus aims to systematize, interpret and assess the provisions critically. The thesis first {{discusses the}} relevant legal theory on the topic. After that, the thesis provides an outline of the Banking Union and analyses first the allocation of costs of banks in resolution and then the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors</b> in bail-in and in the Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The primary method used in the burden-sharing arrangement is bail-in, in which the shareholders and creditors of a bank are the first ones to bear losses. The deposits of natural persons and SMEs bear losses after other creditors, and the last ones to bear losses are the Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which cover losses in lieu of covered deposits. A central element of the Single Resolution Mechanism is the Single Resolution Fund, which will be used to cover losses after a bail-in of 8 % of the total liabilities of the bank. In addition to the Single Resolution Fund, the burden-sharing arrangement is supported by the direct recapitalization instrument of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Legal scholars have presented conflicting views on the effectiveness of bail-in, and the new regime may entail risks to taxpayers. However, the negative effects of bail-in seem smaller than the effects of bailouts, so the introduction of bail-in in the burden-sharing system can be deemed an improvement compared to the current situation. The Single Resolution Fund can also improve the position of taxpayers, since the Fund can prevent or at least reduce the need for taxpayers’ funds in the resolution of a bank. However, the target size of the Fund and the long transition period may impair the effectiveness of the Fund. Legal scholars have questioned the effectiveness of bail-in and the Single Resolution Fund especially in a systemic crisis. Because of the uncertainty associated with these instruments as well as the problems concerning the ESM direct recapitalization instrument the position of taxpayers remains risky, and the possibility of bailing out banks with taxpayers’ money cannot be fully excluded. On the other hand, the Banking Union is still work in progress, so the robustness of these instruments remains to be tested. The <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors</b> in bail-in has been ensured in several ways: the deposits of natural persons and SMEs have been granted preference in the order of loss absorption over shareholders and other creditors. The deposits can also be excluded from bail-in under exceptional circumstances. Additionally, deposits not exceeding EUR 100 000 are fully protected from bail-in. The new Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive will improve the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors</b> in multiple ways. The Directive will provide more consistent level of protection in the Member States and confirms EUR 100 000 as the level of guarantee coverage. The Directive will gradually reduce the payout period of covered deposits from the current 20 working days to 7 working days by 2024. The Directive will establish consistent rules on the funding of Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which will be threefold and the target level of which will be 0. 8 % of covered deposits by 3 rd July 2024. The Directive will also improve the conveyance of information to depositors on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and facilitate the payout process. The Directive will also promote the equal treatment of depositors. The Directive will therefore improve the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors</b> remarkably and may increase depositors’ confidence in Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The provisions also entail some risks, such as the option of deferral concerning the payout of certain deposits, which, if interpreted broadly, may impair the protection of those depositors to whom the provision applies and place them in a weaker position than other depositors. A major downside of the new Directive {{is the fact that it}} maintains national Deposit Guarantee Schemes and will not introduce an EU wide or at least a euro zone wide common Deposit Guarantee Scheme, which would be much more effective in terms of depositor protection than multiple national ones. The introduction of a common Deposit Guarantee Schemes should be considered in the future, although its introduction does not seem very likely at the moment...|$|E
40|$|Banks provide {{credit and}} take deposits. Whereas {{a high price}} in the credit market {{increases}} banks’ retained earnings and attracts more deposits, it reduces lending if borrowers are sufficiently poor to be tempted by diversion. Thus optimal bank market structure trades off the benefits of monopoly banking in attracting deposits against losses due to tighter credit. The model shows that market structure is irrelevant if both banks and borrowers lack resources. Monopoly banking induces tighter credit rationing if borrowers are poor and banks are wealthy, and increases lending if borrowers are wealthy and banks lack resources.

To date, the literature and policy debate on deposit insurance have been heavily colored by U. S. banking history and focus almost exclusively on explicit deposit protection schemes. Analysis of Japan’s safety-net experience suggests that (1) deposit insurance, for all its flaws, is superior to the real-world alternative—implicit government <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors</b> and discretionary regulatory intervention in bank distress; (2) a well-designed explicit deposit insurance system that includes a credible bank-closure policy is {{the starting point for}} the design of effective private alternatives to a government-run safety net; and (3) the trend toward greater institutionalization of the Japanese safety net—culminating in recent legislation to address the financial crisis—reflects increased political competition and greater emphasis on legal as opposed to reputational systems of economic ordering in that country...|$|E

Hence the importance of this “brainstorming conference, ” whose title (Rethinking Macro Policy II: First Steps and Early Lessons) modestly but rightly reminds us of the limits of our knowledge in these areas. Concerning financial regulation—the object of this panel—let me briefly discuss three items for reform: structural reforms (in which I would include governance and the interaction with shadow banking), solvency and liquidity regulation, and institutional/supervisory reforms. Before starting, let me make two preliminary remarks. First, we need to step back a moment and think about why the banking sector is regulated in the first place, regardless of its degree of competition. There are multiple rationales for regulation. The most universal is the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors,</b> or the deposit insurance fund and the taxpayer if deposits are explicitly or implicitly covered. The state represents the interests of depositors who do not have the expertise, the information, or the incentive to monitor the balance sheet and offbalance-shee...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the current}} {{regulatory}} scheme, banks directly engaged in mutual fund activities are regulated {{under the federal}} banking laws by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, whereas bank subsidiaries and non-bank affiliates engaged in mutual fund activities must be registered broker-dealers that are subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulation under the federal securities laws. The regulatory tools provided to the banking regulators by the federal banking laws were designed {{to provide for the}} <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>depositors</b> and for the safety and soundness of the bank. The remedies available under the federal banking laws dealing with violations involving the sales of securities, however, are not as comprehensive as those available under the federal securities laws. Mr. Caldarelli contends, in this very comprehensive Article, that while previous efforts to allow for functional regulation of securities have failed, the time is right to give the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to regulate all securities activities regardless of whether the entity engaging in the activities is a bank or a securities firm. In conclusion, Mr. Caldarelli argues that because of several pivotal reasons the bank exclusion from the statutory provision of the federal securities laws defining 2 ̆ 2 broker/ dealer 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 investment adviser 2 ̆ 2 should be eliminated, which, in effect, would result in the Securities and Exchange Commission obtaining functional regulation of all participants in the securities markets...|$|E

Jeromi* Re-emergence of informal financial institutions (IFIs) in the provision of credit has been a policy challenge in recent years in India. Though they meet the credit requirements of a section of the society, who are not served by the formal financial institutions, their unbridled growth, unlawful activities and links with other institutions may pose threats to the stability of financial system and makes the monetary policy less effective. Furthermore, they create social problems when they charge usurious rates of interest and resort to unethical practices for recovery of loans, which in turn, leads to suicides committed by indebted farmers. In this context, the study attempts to analyse the working of money lenders in Kerala. Based on a sample survey, the paper has estimated the volume of deposits and credits of money lenders in Kerala and brought out the undesirable aspects of their working {{and its impact on the}} society.

Without stronger banks, further financial opening bears high risks, but without more profitable state enterprises healtheir banks are likely to prove elusive. Both countries' financial systems have evolved dualistic structures. On one side, the state bank/state enterprise link has proven difficult to sever, reinforced as it often is by government (introducing a strong element of moral hazard). On the other, an array of loosely regulated bank and non-bank financial institutions has emerged to serve two sorts of clients: connected borrowers (often bank owners) and the high-risk segment of the credit market (small and medium-sized enterprises). The challenge facing both countries is to unify this dual structure by subjecting the state banks to commercial banking disciplines (e. g., freeing them from policy lending) and ensuring effective prudential regulation of the non-state banks and other financial institutions (and adequate <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> small <b>depositors).</b> Given limited bank supervision capacity, priority {{should be given to}} enforcing controls on connected lending.

40|$|If {{we are to}} {{modernize}} our regulatory system and allow banks the flexibility to adapt to financial change, {{it is essential that}} we ask the right questions about the purposes of bank regulation. Currently, much of the regulatory debate focuses on the age-old question: Where do we draw the line between banks and other financial and nonfinancial institutions? As important as this question is, however, it begs a more fundamental question: Why do we regulate banks differently than other institutions? Unless we can answer this basic question, it is possible that we may never achieve consensus on fundamental reform and will continue to rely on an incremental, reactive approach to bank regulation. > In an article based on comments made at the 1996 Federal Reserve/Deloitte Touch Banking Symposium in Houston, Mr. Hoenig suggests that we need to look beyond traditional arguments for bank regulation that focus on <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>depositors</b> and the federal safety net.
