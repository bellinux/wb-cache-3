5|$|Ashbrook has {{compared}} the surviving autograph scores of L'ange de Nisida and La favorite to determine <b>precisely</b> <b>how</b> much material L'ange {{provided for the}} latter. While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and little remains of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death is essentially the same from one opera to the other, and some of the character names are also similar or identical.|$|E
5|$|No {{further action}} was taken until the summer of 1834, when {{officials}} suggested that proof coin sets be prepared as gifts for Asian dignitaries. After examining Mint records, personnel incorrectly concluded that the last Draped Bust dollars minted were dated 1804, so they chose that date for the coins. It is unknown why the current date was not used, but numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests the coins were predated to prevent coin collectors from becoming angered when they {{would be unable to}} obtain the newly dated coins, which were struck in very small numbers. It is unknown <b>precisely</b> <b>how</b> many 1804 dollars were struck, though eight are known to be extant.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} obvious effects of the conquest was the {{introduction}} of Anglo-Norman, a northern dialect of Old French, as {{the language of the}} ruling classes in England, displacing Old English. French words entered the English language, and a further sign of the shift was the usage of names common in France instead of Anglo-Saxon names. Male names such as William, Robert and Richard soon became common; female names changed more slowly. The Norman invasion had little impact on placenames, which had changed significantly after earlier Scandinavian invasions. It is not known <b>precisely</b> <b>how</b> much English the Norman invaders learned, nor how much the knowledge of French spread among the lower classes, but the demands of trade and basic communication probably meant {{that at least some of}} the Normans and native English were bilingual. Nevertheless, William the Conqueror never developed a working knowledge of English and for centuries afterwards English was not well understood by the nobility.|$|E
5|$|Rain hit {{the circuit}} on Saturday afternoon, ending {{three hours before}} the session started, {{resulting}} in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates {{making it difficult for}} drivers to tell <b>precisely</b> <b>how</b> wet or dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton was third fastest, two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa. Rosberg was fifth, ahead of Webber and Nico Hülkenberg. Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the liver}} hepatocytes, the RNA genome is {{released}} from the protein coat and is translated by the cell's own ribosomes. Unlike other picornaviruses, this virus requires an intact eukaryote initiating factor 4G (eIF4G) for the initiation of translation. The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis, unlike other picornaviruses. The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery which may explain its poor growth in cell culture. Presumably for this reason, the virus has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. <b>Precisely</b> <b>how</b> this strategy works is not quite clear yet.|$|E

25|$|Others, though, have {{questioned}} the evidence for <b>precisely</b> <b>how</b> John might {{have been influenced by}} Boscan and Garcilaso.

However, Peter Thompson disputes this, arguing it is not definite John would have been familiar with Garcilaso from an early age, and even so the influence has been overemphasised by other commentators.|$|E
25|$|The Arawakan-speaking Taíno {{moved into}} Hispaniola {{from the north}} east region {{of what is now}} known as South America, {{displacing}} earlier inhabitants, c. AD 650.

The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, and four hundred thousand to two million. Determining <b>precisely</b> <b>how</b> many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist.

25|$|It is thus an {{extremely}} early {{witness to the}} reception of al-Tabari's text-indeed much earlier than the sources that are customarily pressed into service to improve {{our understanding of the}} Ta'rikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk, e.g., Miskawayh, Ibn 'Asakir, Ibn al-Athir, and Ibn Khallikan. Second, since al-Azdi was writing in the decades following al-Tabari, his Ta'rikh can say something about the reception of al-Tabari's Ta'rikh among those who immediately followed the great master. That al-Tabari's history was immensely significant we can all agree; but as to <b>precisely</b> <b>how</b> he became so significant there is no clear consensus.8 Third-and returning to Forand's insight-al-Azdi frequently drew on the same authorities tapped by al-Tabari, but whose works are for the most part now lost, such as Abu Ma'shar (170/786), Abu Mikhnaf (157/774), al-Haytham ibn 'Adi (207/822), al-Mada'ini (around 228/843), and 'Umar ibn Shabba (262/878).|$|E
