40|$|Particle image {{velocimetry}} {{measurements and}} simultaneous force measurements {{have been performed}} on the DelFly II flapping-wing MAV, to investigate the flow-field behavior and the aerodynamic forces generated. For flapping wing motion {{it is expected that}} both the clap and <b>peel</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the occurrence of a leading edge vortex during the translational phase {{play an important role in}} unsteady lift generation. Furthermore, the flexibility of the wing foil is also considered of primary relevance. The PIV analysis shows a strong influx between the wings during the peel but no downward expelling jet during the clap. The force measurements reveal that the peel, oppositely to the clap, contributes significantly to the lift. The PIV visualization suggests the occurrence of a leading edge vortex during the first half of the in- and outstroke, which is supported by a simultaneous augmentation in lift. The early generation of a leading edge vortex during the flex cannot be assessed from the PIV images due to optical obstruction, but is likely to appear since the wing flexing is accompanied with a large increase in lift. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{analysis and}} results {{for a small}} and agile wall climbing robot’s ability to regain lost adhesion due to degradation of dry fibrillar adhesives. To regain the lost adhesion, two feet are set {{to the surface and}} the robot performs a rocking motion on the side where the adhesion has dropped below a safety threshold. The rocking motion applies normal forces to preload the front and rear feet without letting the other foot detach from the surface by alternating the direction of the motor and only allowing small rotation of the leg. Experimental results show that the rocking motion is successful in regaining lost adhesion while using dry fibrillar adhesives on a smooth, vertical acrylic surface. The performance of the fibers over time limits the adhesion that can possibly be mechanically regained and as a result the fibers are over-designed, which gives rise to the need for a power efficient <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism</b> uses a conditionally locked ankle, implemented with magnets, and a slot to allow the axle to change a pulling force normal to the surface to be a pulling force perpendicular to the surface, which peels the fibers using the uneven loading. Experimental results illustrate that a passive <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism</b> is successful in reducing the required power to peel. The presented advancements can be applied to other climbing robots using adhesives to allow for safer, more efficient climbing. I...|$|R

Detailed analysis of atomic motion inside the clusters reveals that the Vacancy Mechanism is the most important mechanism for the rapid diffusion in alkali halide clusters.

The cladding composition for the core/clad preforms were also reversed. Fe clad and Ti clad fibres were successfully drawn with an average diameter of between 30 ~ 50 μm.

40|$|As {{the lightest}} {{structural}} metal, magnesium alloys have been attractive to reduce vehicle weight and emissions by lightweight {{design in the}} automotive industry. Crashworthiness is not a physical property itself, but correlates with the material’s ductility and structural design. Magnesium {{is known to be}} a material with lower failure strain than other metallic structural materials. Therefore the use of magnesium in crash-related areas is more challenging compared to steel and aluminum. In structures with a bending load, like e. g. the bumper or the sill, crash properties can be significant improved by filling profiles with a stabilizing core. In order to evaluate the crashworthiness of this hybrid structure under bending loads, both empty and polyurethane foam-filled rectangular section beams were constructed and tested by using the quasi-static/dynamic three-point bending facilities at German Aerospace Centre (DLR) – Institute of Vehicle Concepts. For structures with axial crash loads the normal buckling mode will lead to a very early fracture of the magnesium part. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Windsor and the University of Waterloo, novel technologies for energy absorption which are based on cutting or <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been developed and investigated, which allow the use of magnesium in these challenging applications.

40|$|Nanocomposite gels {{were formed}} by mixing {{organically}} modified clay into a linear polymer, dicarboxyl-terminated polybutadiene (CTPB). Two similar but differently sized counterions {{were chosen for}} preparing the organoclay. The polymer-clay interaction causes the clay aggregates to break up into particles, which swell, exfoliate, and eventually assume a stable dispersion in the polymer matrix. The bulkiness of the different-sized counterions affects the dispersion process and the final, stable clay-polymer network structure. The use of two different organoclays allows comparison of the observed phenomena. Parameters of the study are clay concentration [straight phi] and distance from the gel point. As a main result, the nanocomposite with the larger counterion exfoliates faster but requires more clay to form a percolating structure. It also forms the weaker gel. These seaming contradictions (fast exfoliation but weak gel) are attributed to steric effects of the large counterion. The low frequency linear viscoelastic behavior was analyzed using a percolation model (near the percolation threshold [straight phi]c) and the power law (far above the percolation threshold). The degree of agreement between the experimental data and models was used to theorize that the particle-polymer interactions are the controlling factor in the increasing solid-like behavior with increasing clay content. Rheology is also employed to study the dynamics of structure development for a model nanocomposite of clay in a low Mw polymer. The clay, organically modified with macro-counterions, gradually exfoliates in an endfunctionalized linear polymer. Polymer and clay connect into a sample spanning network with increasing modulus and decreasing relaxation time as the exfoliation proceeds {{and more and more}} clay surface becomes accessible. The product of modulus and relaxation time stays constant as observed earlier for another physical gel. The rheological measurements suggest that the classical diffusion model of exfoliation is incomplete. Trends in the ripening time, the distance to the final stable clay dispersion and in changing concentrations support a layer-by-layer <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism</b> over the traditional exfoliation theory. The layer-by-layer <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism</b> proposes that the polymer chains follow Langmuir isothermal adsorption and pull on the clay stacks, first breaking the clay pack into smaller stacks, and then possibly peeling the clay sheets off one-by-one if the force required to break the stack becomes too great. Intermittent flow forward (IFF) and intermittent flow reverse (IFR) protocol are used to study the structure breakdown and reformation in CTPB/organoclay nanocomposites, which is found to be caused by the clay layers orientation. The orientation relaxation is accelerated due to the strong interaction between the CTPB and clay surface via hydrogen bonding. A new optical linear rheometer was developed that allows simultaneously conducting rheological experiments, light scattering, and microscopy. Unlike rotational motor in commercial rheometers, a linear motor is used, which ensure uniform shear through samples...|$|R

A legged robot with four-bar based kinematics is designed and fabricated with elastomeric footpads. The proposed robot has a passive <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism</b> for energy efficient and vibration free detachment. A rocker-type mechanism in the leg and compliant foam under the footpads are utilized for passive alignment on concave and convex surfaces. Adhesion experimental data is used to estimate the adhesion and preload saturation on the footpads on different angled acrylic surface. It is showed that although the initial preload {{does not affect the}} adhesion and preload saturation point, the orientation and the weight of the robot, roughness of the surface, and waiting time between consecutive steps greatly effect the climbing performance. Experimental results revealed that the robot can climb in any direction in 3 D space on smooth surfaces, such as acrylic and glass. It can carry a payload of up to 2 N, which is almost twice as its own weight, on a smooth inverted surface.

40|$|The present {{doctoral}} thesis investigated the buckling and postbuckling behavior of stringer reinforced fiber composite materials placing particular emphasis upon {{the analysis of}} stringer <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which may occur {{as a result of}} buckled skin fields. The theoretical model requires a combination of a global postbuckling analysis and a local three-dimensional stress determination. The postbuckling condition was calculated using a geometrically nonlinear mixed finite element method (FiPPS) based on an generalized working principle in accordance with Hellinger-Reissner. With stinger-skin joints idealized by the developed isoparametric interface element, which is based on a multi-dimensional spring model, therefore both qualitative and quantitative statements can be made with reference to the stringer's proneness to peeling. In addition, one advantage of this spring model lies in the possibility of taking into account delaminations simply by reducing the spring stiffnesses of the corresponding elements, without having to make a re-idealization. Accordingly, in this way, existing damage can be discretized, and any possible damage propagation can be acquired numerically. The physically nonlinear material behavior of the resin system can also be taken into account by iterative degradation of contact element stiffnesses. The failure hypothesis established has proved to be efficient with respect to all three modes of interlaminar failure. The quality of the theoretical investigations was verified using a series of tests including in particular shear tests with stringer reinforced carbon fiber composite square plates the stringer geometries and stiffnesses of which were varied.

40|$|The {{potential}} of amorphous polymers in heavy-duty tribological applications are less explored. We {{have attempted to}} explore the governing mechanism in the wear behavior of behavior of amorphous polymers. In this research, tribological investigations are performed for amorphous polymers such as Polycarbonate (PC), Polyetherimide (PEI) and Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU). Moreover, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is also chosen as a reference material from the semi-crystalline group. Large scale wear tests were performed with a flat-on-flat configuration with 4 MPa contact pressure and 50 mm/sec sliding speed. Among the four polymers, PC and PEI had similar wear performance with increased wear rate. However, within the amorphous group, PPSU has better wear performance. Nevertheless, PPSU has increased wear rate when compared with semi-crystalline PET. All three amorphous polymers has flaky wear debris, however this was not prevalent in the semi-crystalline PET. Significant amount of debris were found in PC and PEI when compared with PPSU and PET. The poor performance of PEI and PC {{can be attributed to}} wear mechanism and interfacial behavior. The material removal process in the amorphous polymer represent a <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism</b> where flaking of consecutive layers was evidenced. Amorphous polymers due to its meagre plastic flow characteristics evades adhesion and thereby hindering the formation of transfer layer. The inability to form the protective transfer layer is the main reason for poor wear performance of PC and PEI. In the morphological investigation, PPSU and PET had significant amount of transfer layer and hence better wear performance. This concludes that the governing mechanism in the wear performance of amorphous polymer relies on the capability of transfer layer formation.

40|$|For many cell types, growth, differentiation, and {{motility}} {{are dependent}} on receptor-mediated adhesion to ligand-coated surfaces. Focal contacts are strong, specialized, adhesive connections between cell and substrate in which receptors aggregate and connect extracellular ligand to intracellular cytoskeletal molecules. In this paper, we present a mathematical model to examine how focal contact formation affects cellular adhesive strength. To calculate adhesive strength with and without focal contacts, we use a one-dimensional tape peeling analysis to determine the critical tension necessary to peel the membrane. Receptor-ligand bonds are modeled as adhesive springs. In the absence of focal contacts, we derive analytic expressions for the critical tension at low and high ligand densities and show how membrane morphology affects adhesion. Then, focal contacts are modeled as cytoplasmic nucleation centers which bind adhesion receptors. The extent of adhesive strengthening upon focal contact formation depends on the elastic rigidity of the cytoskeletal connections, which determines the structural integrity of the focal contact itself. We consider two limits to this elasticity, very weak and rigid. Rigid cytoskeletal connections give much greater attachment strengths. The dependence of attachment strength on measurable model parameters is quite different in these two limits, which suggests focal contact structure might be deduced from properly performed adhesion experiments. Finally, we compare our model to the adhesive strengthening response reported for glioma cell adhesion to fibronectin (Lotz et al., 1989. J. Cell Biol. 109 : 1795 - 1805). Our model successfully predicts the observed detachment forces at 4 degrees C and yields values {{for the number of}} fibronectin receptors per glioma cell and the density of cytoskeletal connection molecules (talin) involved in receptor clusters which are consistent with measurements for other cell types. Comparison of the model with data at 37 degrees C suggests that while cytoskeletal cross-linking and clustering of fibronectin receptors significantly increases adhesion strength, specific glioma cell-substratum attachment sites possess little mechanical rigidity and detach through a <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism,</b> consistent with the view that these sites of < or = 15 nm cell-substrate separation are precursors to fully formed, elastically rigid focal contacts...|$|R

40|$|The continual {{deterioration}} of infrastructure has motivated researchers {{to look for}} new ways of repairing and monitoring existing structures. A particularly challenging problem confronting engineers in {{the revival of the}} infrastructure is the rehabilitation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Traditionally, the repair of RC beams has been achieved by bonding steel plates to the structure. Although this technique has proven to be reasonably effective, it has several distinct disadvantages such as susceptibility of the steel plates to corrode and the excessive weight of steel plates when used in long-span beams. Recently, there has been an emergence of structural engineering applications employing fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites as an alternative to steel plates. FRP composites are well known for their high strength- and stiffness-to-weight ratios, corrosion resistance, durability, and ease of application. Numerous studies have been conducted to prove the efficiency of bonding FRP on structural elements. In spite of this, industrial practitioners are still concerned about premature debonding of the plates before reaching the desired strength or ductility. Premature debonding initiates from the ends of the plate or from intermediate cracks (IC) in the concrete. While end initiated debonding and <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been researched extensively, researchers have unanimously recognized the lack of data for the FRP-RC structural members subjected to IC debonding. The scarcity of data compiled exemplifies the need to develop more refined numerical analysis tools to reduce the high cost and significant time required to conduct full-scale physical testing. In this study, the results of a comprehensive numerical investigation are presented to assess the failure mechanisms caused by different types of flexural and shear crack distributions in RC beams strengthened with FRP composites. The model is based on damage mechanics modeling of concrete and a bilinear bond-slip relationship with softening behaviour to represent the FRP-concrete interfacial properties. A discrete crack approach was adopted to simulate crack propagation through a nonlinear fracture mechanics based finite element analysis to investigate the effects of crack spacing and interfacial parameters such as stiffness, local bond strength, and fracture energy on the initiation and propagation of the debonding and structural performance. Results from the analysis reveal that the debonding behaviour and load-carrying capacity are significantly influenced by interfacial fracture energy and crack spacing. The debonding propagation is mainly governed by mode II fracture mechanisms. The results provide an insight on the long-term behaviour of a repair system that is gaining widespread use and will be of interest to researchers and design engineers looking to successfully apply FRP products in civil engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} to {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM) {{is critical to}} various cellular processes like cell spreading, migration, growth and apoptosis. At the tissue level, cell adhesion {{is important in the}} pathological and physiological processes that regulate the tissue morphogenesis. Cell adhesion to the ECM is primarily mediated by the integrin family of receptors. The receptors that are recruited to the surface are reinforced by structural and signaling proteins at the adhesive sites forming focal adhesions that connect the cytoskeleton to further stabilize the adhesions. The functional roles of these focal adhesions extend beyond stabilizing adhesions and transduce mechanical signals at the cell-ECM interface in various signaling events. The objective of this research is to analyze the role of the spatial distribution of the focal adhesions in stabilizing the cell adhesion to the ECM in relation to cell 2 ̆ 7 s internal force balance. The central hypothesis was that peripheral focal adhesions stabilize cell adhesion to ECM by providing for maximum mechanical advantage for resisting detachment as explained by the membrane <b>peeling</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Micropatterning techniques combined with robust hydrodynamic shear assay were employed to test our hypothesis. However, technical difficulties in microcontact printing stamps with small and sparse features made it challenging to analyze the role of peripheral focal adhesions in stabilizing cell adhesion. To overcome this limitation, the roof collapse phenomenon in stamps with small and sparse features (low fill factor stamps) that was detrimental to the reproduction of the adhesive geometries required to test the hypothesis was analyzed. This analysis lead to the valuable insight that the non-uniform pressure distribution during initial contact caused by parallelism error during manual microcontact printing prevented accurate replication of features on the substrate. To this end, the template of the stamp was modified so that it included an annular column around the pattern zone that acted as a collapse barrier and prevented roof collapse propagation into the pattern zone. Employing this modified stamp, the required geometries for the cell adhesion analysis were successfully reproduced on the substrates with high throughput. Adhesive areas were engineered with circular and annular patterns to discern the contribution of peripheral focal adhesions towards cell adhesion strength. The patterns were engineered such that two distinct geometries with either constant adhesive area or constant spreading area were obtained. The significance of annular patterns is that for the same total adhesive area as the circular pattern, the annular pattern provided for greater cell spreading thereby increasing the distance of the focal adhesions from the cell 2 ̆ 7 s center. The adhesion strength analysis was accomplished by utilizing hydrodynamic shear flow in a spinning disk device that was previously developed. The results indicate that for a constant total adhesive area, the annular patterns provide for greater adhesion strength by enhancing cell spreading area and providing for greater moment arm in resisting detachment due to shear. The next examination was the effect of the cell 2 ̆ 7 s internal force balance in stabilizing the cell adhesion. The working hypothesis was that microtubules provide the necessary forces to resist the tensile forces expressed by the cell contractile machinery, thereby stabilizing cell adhesion. Since microtubule disruption is known to enhance cell contractility, its effect on the cell adhesion strength was examined. Moreover, the force balance in cells was altered by engineering adhesive areas so that the cells were either spherical or completely spread and then disrupted microtubules to understand the significance of the force balance in modulating the cell adhesion strength. The results indicated that disruption of microtubules in cells on adhesive islands resulted in a 10 fold decrease in adhesion strength compared to untreated controls whereas no significant change was observed in completely spread cells between treated and untreated controls. This is in surprising contrast to the previous contractility inhibition studies which indicate a less pronounced regulation of adhesion strength for both micropatterned and spread cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the internal force balance regulated by cell shape strongly modulates the adhesion strength though the microtubule network. In summary, this project elucidates the role of peripheral focal adhesions in regulating the cell adhesion strength. Furthermore, this study also establishes the importance of the internal force balance towards stabilizing the cell adhesion to the ECM through the microtubule network...|$|R
40|$|Biomass recalcitrance {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the major barriers that hided the cost-effective conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bioethanol, therefore the current bioconversion process require an essential step known as pretreatment to increase the cellulose accessibility. This thesis provides information about changes in cellulose accessibility upon different pretreatments, along with how these pretreatments alter the chemical and physical structures of biomass, will be extremely helpful to further optimize the current pretreatment process. Multiple promising analytical techniques including Simons’ stain, NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, mercury porosimetry was introduced and successfully applied on pretreated biomass samples to characterize the cellulose accessible surface area and biomass porosity. Different pretreatments increase cellulose accessibility through different mechanisms to different extent. Dilute acid pretreatment is more effective than steam explosion in terms of increasing accessible surface area of cellulose as reflected by Simons’ stain and NMR cryoporometry, while NMR relaxometry suggested steam explosion is more effective at pore expansion for the cell wall water pools detected by changes in NMR relaxation time. Alkaline pretreatment decreased cellulose degree of polymerization, cellulose crystallinity, lignin content and subsequently increased cellulose accessibility, with sodium hydroxide pretreatment proved to be much more effective compared lime or soaking in ammonia pretreatment. Delignification through alkaline-based pretreatment is found less effective than removal of hemicellulose using acid in terms of cellulose accessibility increase. Lignin didn’t directly dictate cellulose accessibility but rather restricted xylan accessibility which in turn controls the access of cellulase to cellulose. Pore size distribution analysis based on mercury porosimetry also indicated that the most fundamental barrier in terms of biomass porosity scale for efficient enzymatic hydrolysis is the nano-pore space formed between coated microfibrils, despite some of the porous architecture such as cell lumen and pit could be severely destroyed after pretreatment. The action of cellulase on the characteristics of cellulosic fractions obtained from pretreated biomass was also investigated. Cellulose accessibility was found to increase at the beginning of hydrolysis, and after reaching a maximum value then starting to decrease. Enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in a rapid decrease in the cellulose degree of polymerization then gradually leveled off, suggesting the existence of a synergistic action of endo- and exo-glucanases that contribute to the occurrence of a <b>peeling</b> off type <b>mechanism.</b> Ph.

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) is a surgery technique that {{is carried out}} through small incisions in the skin with thin, long instruments. In order for the surgeon to see his actions with his instruments, a small camera with a light source (an endoscope) is used to look inside the person that is operated. MIS, also called laparoscopy when {{carried out in the}} abdominal cavity, has many advantages compared to traditional surgery such as less operative trauma and reduced hospitalization time. However, there are many disadvantages as well. Especially for the surgeon a lot of aspects of surgery have become more difficult. The instruments that the surgeon uses are small and have tiny forceps in order to fit through the incisions. A problem that occurs with these forceps is that of not having good grip on the slippery tissue. The surgeon tries to prevent this by using a large pinch force and using forceps that are provided with a saw-tooth profile. The consequence however is that due to these two solutions the tissue sometimes gets damaged. Since a lot of research is done nowadays on adhesives that stick to mucus tissue (mucoadhesives), it is interesting to investigate whether it is worthwhile to design and develop a laparoscopic forceps that provides the grip with the tissue by means of such a mucoadhesive so that large pinch forces and profiles are not necessary anymore. This thesis gives background information on this subject by studying chemistry, physics, patent and biological literature. From physical and chemistry information, insight was gained on the working principles of adhesion in general. For using a mucoadhesive on a laparoscopic forceps in order to manipulate the tissue, the adhesion mechanism between forceps and tissue must be temporary. This adhesion mechanism must be strong enough but must have a quick release or deactivation mechanism as well. From a patent research came forward that there is very little done on the area of manipulating tissue by means of an adhesive. The main problem of using an adhesive to create grip with tissue is how to loosen the adhesive again from the tissue. No patent was found that explained a method of loosening the adhesive again, which confirmed that {{this is the most important}} problem that has to be solved to come to a good design. In order to investigate methods for undoing adhesion, research in biological literature was done, because temporary adhesion is something that is used by a lot of animals for instance to walk upside down a ceiling. From a number of examples of temporary adhesion mechanisms a number of release mechanisms were found. From the demands that the release mechanism should suffice to be used on a laparoscopic forceps, two interesting release mechanisms came forward. These release <b>mechanisms,</b> <b>peeling</b> and hydration of the mucoadhesive need further investigation. Overall can be concluded that from the background information presented in this thesis it can be recommended to do further research for the design of a laparoscopic forceps that has grip by means of a mucoadhesive. Peeling of the mucoadhesive or hydrating are the most interesting release mechanisms that could be applied in such a forceps.
