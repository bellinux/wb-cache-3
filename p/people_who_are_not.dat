5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> reported to have died abroad. She argues that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the reason is that the runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} he is a good actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the member}} check {{procedure}} {{is used in}} a sample of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> the original participants in the study, the procedure can be used to assess transferability. If the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> the original participants do not agree with the information, then the findings can be said to <b>be</b> biased or <b>not</b> transferable since transferability is the process of being able to apply the findings from one study to others in similar situations. A question to ask is whether the findings [...] "ring true" [...] in others' experiences.|$|R

25|$|Self {{containment}} by housing {{people in}} private rooms {{is important to}} prevent the spread of C. difficile between patients. Contact precautions are an important part of preventing the spread of C. difficile. C. difficile does not often occur in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> taking antibiotics so limiting use of antibiotics decreases the risk.|$|E
25|$|The venom {{contains}} a neurotoxin called mandaratoxin, a single-chain polypeptide with a molecular weight around 20 kD, {{which can be}} lethal even to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allergic if the dose is sufficient (i.e., if multiple stings are received; a single wasp cannot inject a lethal dose). However, if the victim is allergic to the venom, this greatly {{increases the risk of}} death.|$|E
25|$|Doctors perform surgery {{with the}} consent of the patient. Some {{patients}} are able to give better informed consent than others. Populations such as incarcerated persons, people living with dementia, the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> able to make decisions with the same authority as a typical patient have special needs when making decisions about their personal healthcare, including surgery.|$|E

Members of the Venda culture in South Africa also sing familiar children's songs in the key in which the songs were learned.|$|E

25|$|In typical <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{known to}} be {{at high risk of}} PE, imaging is helpful to confirm or exclude a {{diagnosis}} of PE after simpler first-line tests are used. Medical societies recommend tests such as the D-dimer to first provide supporting evidence for the need for imaging, and imaging would be done if other tests confirmed a moderate or high probability of finding evidence to support a diagnosis of PE.|$|E
25|$|Holders of priesthood {{offices are}} {{organized}} into quorums.
