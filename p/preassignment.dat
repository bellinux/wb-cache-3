In global routing, it first uses two reduction techniques to prune redundant solutions and create a global-routing path for each net. Without loss of the solution optimality, our reduction techniques can further prune the ILP variables (constraints) by 99. 9 % (99. 9 %) on average. The detailed routing applies X-based gridless routing to complete the routing.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} graph {{drawings in}} which vertices {{are assigned to}} layers and edges are drawn as straight line-segments between vertices on adjacent layers. We prove that graphs admitting crossing-free h-layer drawings (for fixed h) have bounded pathwidth. We then use a path decomposition {{as the basis for}} a linear-time algorithm to decide if a graph has a crossing-free h-layer drawing (for fixed h). This algorithm is extended to solve a large number of related problems, including allowing at most k crossings, or removing at most r edges to leave a crossing-free drawing (for fixed k or r). If the number of crossings or deleted edges is a non-fixed parameter then these problems are NP-complete. For each setting, we can also permit downward drawings of directed graphs and drawings in which edges may span multiple layers, in which case the total span or the maximum span of edges can be minimized. In contrast to the so-called Sugiyama method for layered graph drawing, our algorithms do not assume a <b>preassignment</b> of the vertices to layers. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new fuzzy {{regression}} model, i. e., the fuzzy system constructed by rule generation and iterative linear support vector regression (FS-RGLSVR) for structural risk minimization. The FS-RGLSVR {{is composed of}} Takagi-Sugeno (TS) -type fuzzy IF-THEN rules. These rules are automatically constructed by a self-splitting rule generation algorithm that introduces the self-splitting technique to the k-means clustering algorithm. This new algorithm regards a cluster as a fuzzy rule, where no <b>preassignment</b> of the cluster (rule) number is necessary. The cost function for parameter learning is defined based on structural risk instead of empirical risk minimization {{in order to achieve}} generalizability. Tuning all of the free parameters in the FS-RGLSVR using linear support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to minimize the cost function. Each of the consequent and antecedent part parameters is expressed as a linear combination coefficient in a transformed input space so that the linear SVR is applicable. This paper introduces iterative linear SVR to tune antecedent and consequent parameters. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of FS-RGLSVR by two simulated and four practical regression examples.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the recent developments concerning Saint-Venant's principle. The task of determining, {{within the framework of the}} linear theory of elasticity, the stresses and displacements in an elastic cylinder in equilibrium, under the action of loads that arise solely from tractions applied to its plane ends has come to be called Saint- Venant's problem. Saint-Venant's construction does not permit the arbitrary <b>preassignment</b> of the point-by-point variation of the end tractions giving rise to these forces and moments; indeed, this variation is essentially determined as a consequence of the special assumptions made in connection with his so-called semi-inverse procedure. The early work of Saint-Venant and Boussinesq furnished the seeds from which grew a large number of more general assertions, most referring to elastic solids of arbitrary shape and many being rather imprecise, concerning the effect on stresses within the body of replacing the tractions acting over a portion of its surface by statically equivalent ones. Such propositions usually went by the name of Saint-Venunt's principle, despite the fact that Saint-Venant's original conjecture was intended to apply only to cylinders. This chapter discusses in detail about flow in a cylinder, a representation for the exact solution, and energy decay for other linear elliptic second-order problem. Linear elastostatic problems are also stated in the chapter...|$|E
40|$|Scheduling {{problems}} are often modeled as resource constrained problems in which critical resource assignments to tasks are known {{and the best}} assignment of resource time must be made subject to these constraints. Generalization to resource scheduling, where resource assignments are chosen concurrently with times results in a problem {{which is much more}} diÂ±cult. A simpliÂ¯ed model of the general resource scheduling model is possible, however, in which tasks must be assigned a single primary resource, subject to constraints resulting from <b>preassignment</b> of secondary, or auxiliary, resources. This paper describes extensions and enhancements of Tabu Search for the special case of the resource scheduling problem described above. The class of problems is further restricted to those where it is reasonable to enumerate both feasible time and primary resource assignments. Potential applications include shift oriented production and manpower scheduling problems as well as course scheduling where classrooms (instructors) are primary and instructors (rooms) and students are secondary resources. The underlying model is a type of quadratic multiple choice problem which we call multiple choice quadratic vertex packing (MCQVP). Results for strategic oscillation and biased candidate sampling strategies are shown for reasonably sized real and randomly generated, synthetic, problem instances. These strategies are compared with other variations using consistent measures of solution time and quality developed for this study. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Distributed {{real-time}} applications usually {{consist of}} several component tasks {{and must be}} completed by its end-to-end (E-T-E) deadline. As long as the E-T-E deadline of an application is met, the strategy used for dividing it up for component tasks {{does not affect the}} application itself. One would therefore like to ``slice'' each application E-T-E deadline and assign the slices to component tasks so as to maximize the schedulability of the component tasks, and hence the application. Distribution of the E-T-E deadline over component tasks is a difÂ®cult and important problem since there exists a circular dependency between deadline distribution and task assignment. We propose a new deadline-distribution scheme which has two major improvements over the best scheme known to date. It can distribute task deadlines prior to task assignment and relies on new adaptive metrics that yield signiÂ®cantly better performance in the presence of high resource contention. The deadlinedistribution problem is formulated for distributed hard real-time systems with relaxed locality constraints, where schedulability analysis must be performed at pre-run-time, and only a subset of the tasks are constrained by <b>preassignment</b> to speciÂ®c processors. Although it is applicable to any scheduling policy, the proposed deadlinedistribution scheme is evaluated for a non-preemptive, time-driven scheduling policy. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed adaptive metrics deliver much better performance (in terms of success ratio and maximum task lateness) than their non-adaptive counterparts. In particular, the simulation result...|$|E
