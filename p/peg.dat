To estimate the treatment effect of consistent <b>pegs</b> properly, we must carefully control for the self-selection problem of regime adoption because a country 2 ̆ 7 s exchange rate regime choice is non-random. We thus use matching estimators as a control for the self-selection problem. We find interesting and robust evidence that consistent <b>pegs</b> significantly decrease the probability of currency crises compared with other exchange rate policies...|$|R

5|$|The {{locations}} are themed around {{the idea of}} a traditional Southern U.S. general store.

In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and a traffic light. The <b>peg</b> games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee.

40|$|<b>PEGs</b> were formalized by Ford in 2004, {{and have}} several pragmatic {{operators}} (such as ordered choice and unlimited lookahead) for better expressing modern programming language syntax. Since these operators are not explicitly {{defined in the}} classic formal language theory, it is significant and still challenging to argue PEGs' expressiveness {{in the context of}} formal language theory. Since <b>PEGs</b> are relatively new, there are several unsolved problems. One of the problems is revealing a subclass of <b>PEGs</b> that is equivalent to DFAs. This allows application of some techniques from the theory of regular grammar to <b>PEGs.</b> In this paper, we define Linear <b>PEGs</b> (LPEGs), a subclass of <b>PEGs</b> that is equivalent to DFAs. Surprisingly, LPEGs are formalized by only excluding some patterns of recursive nonterminal in <b>PEGs,</b> and include the full set of ordered choice, unlimited lookahead, and greedy repetition, which are characteristic of <b>PEGs.</b> Although the conversion judgement of parsing expressions into DFAs is undecidable in general, the formalism of LPEGs allows for a syntactical judgement of parsing expressions.
