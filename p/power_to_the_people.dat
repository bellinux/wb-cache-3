5|$|During the 1995 {{legislative}} campaign, Ryzhkov {{defended his}} own tenure as Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, claiming that Russians were far worse off under capitalism than Soviet communism. Russian TV channel NTV broadcast a debate featuring only Ryzhkov and Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal politician who strongly supported economic reforms. At the election, {{he was elected}} to the State Duma Federal Assembly as an independent candidate. Once elected, he headed the <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> bloc, a communist faction with nationalist tendencies. The <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> bloc came about through the merger of Ryzhkov's supporters and the All-People's Union headed by Sergey Baburin. Its policies were left-wing and included revival of the Soviet Union, the introduction of a planned economy, more state involvement in the economy and the promotion of nationalism and patriotism. During the 1996 presidential election Ryzhkov endorsed Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) candidate, for the presidency.|$|E

On 17 September 2003, he resigned his seat in the Duma and {{became a member of}} the Federation Council.

500|$|Just {{before the}} dedication, the slogan [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] (a {{reference}} to the Quebec sovereignty movement) was painted on the fountain at night, and the graffiti was erased. During the dedication, attended by Thomas Hoving, director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, a rock band played, and Armand Vaillancourt himself painted [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] on the fountain in as many places as he could reach. A redevelopment agency employee started to paint over the slogans during the ceremony, but Herman stopped him, saying {{it could be done}} later. When asked about why he defaced his own fountain with graffiti he responded, “No, no. It's a joy to make a free statement. This fountain is dedicated to all freedom. Free Quebec! Free East Pakistan! Free Viet Nam! Free the whole world!” Vaillancourt said his actions were [...] "a powerful performance" [...] intended to illustrate the notion of <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] has been an alternate name for the fountain since.|$|E
500|$|The process {{leading to}} Namibia's {{independence}} began with UN General Assembly Resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966. This {{was followed by}} the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 264, adopted on 20 March 1969. In that resolution the UN assumed direct responsibility for the territory and declared the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia illegal, calling upon the Government of South Africa to withdraw immediately. International negotiations for a peaceful solution to the Namibian problem increased. In December 1978, in what was known as the Brazzaville Protocol, South Africa, Cuba and Angola formally accepted UN Security Council Resolution 435 outlining a blueprint for Namibian independence. The protocol envisioned a phased withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola over a two-year period, set 1 April 1989 as the date for the resolution's implementation and planned to reduce South African forces in Namibia to 1,500 by June 1989. The resolution established UNTAG, approving a report by the Secretary-General and outlining its objective: [...] "the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration from Namibia and the transfer of <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Namibia {{with the assistance of the}} United Nations". Resolution 435 authorised a total of 7,500 military personnel as UNTAG's upper limit.|$|E

On May 22 at Over the Limit, Kelly unsuccessfully challenged Brie Bella for the WWE Divas Championship. The following month, on the <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> special edition of Raw on June 20, Kelly won a fan vote to determine the challenger for the Divas Championship that night; Kelly went on to win her first Divas Championship by defeating Bella. Her win later garnered her a Slammy Award for [...] "Divalicious Moment of the Year". At Money in the Bank in July, Kelly made her first title defense, successfully defeating Brie Bella in a rematch. On August 1, Beth Phoenix won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Kelly's championship, and afterward attacked Kelly to provoke a feud between the two. Kelly went on to successfully defend her championship against Phoenix at SummerSlam on August 14. Following SummerSlam, Kelly continued to feud with Phoenix, defeating her at Night of Champions, before dropping the championship to her at Hell in a Cell on October 2, ending her reign at 104 days. She failed to reign the championship on the October 14 episode of SmackDown in a rematch. Kelly again challenged Phoenix for the Divas Championship at , but was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|During {{both the}} late 1990s and the 2000s, glam metal {{began to have}} {{something}} of a revival. Some established acts who had managed to weather the storm enjoyed renewed popularity, others reformed and new bands emerged to emulate the glam metal style. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with [...] "It's My Life" [...] (2000). They branched into country music with a version of their 2005 song [...] "Who Says You Can't Go Home", which reached {{number one on the}} Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 and the rock/country album Lost Highway which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound and reached number one on the Billboard 200. Mötley Crüe reunited with Vince Neil to record the 1997 album Generation Swine and Poison reunited with guitarist C.C. DeVille in 1999, producing the mostly live <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> (2000); both bands began to tour extensively. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007). The long-awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum in the US, produced no hit singles, and failed to come close {{to the success of the}} band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. Europe's [...] "Final Countdown" [...] enjoyed a new lease of popularity as the millennium drew to a close and the band reformed. Other acts to reform included Ratt, Britny Fox, Stryper (annually), and Skid Row.|$|E
500|$|Wind power gives {{variable}} power {{which is very}} consistent {{from year to year}} but which has significant variation over shorter time scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur. Power management techniques such as having excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing sources, sufficient hydroelectric power, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, or reducing demand when wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems. In addition, weather forecasting permits the electric power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur. Blyth's [...] high, cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at Marykirk in Kincardineshire and was used to charge accumulators developed by the Frenchman Camille Alphonse Faure, to power the lighting in the cottage, thus making it the first house in the world to have its electric power supplied by wind power. Blyth offered the surplus electric <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electric power was [...] "the work of the devil." [...] Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of Montrose the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.|$|E

The Predator debuted at number one on both the pop and R charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from The Predator included [...] "It Was a Good Day" [...] and [...] "Check Yo Self", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after The Predator, Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album Lethal Injection, which was released {{at the end of}} 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the G-Funk sound of Dr. Dre's The Chronic, was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from Lethal Injection, including [...] "Really Doe", [...] "Bop Gun (One Nation)", [...] "You Know How We Do It" [...] & [...] "What Can I Do?". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, Kausion, and Da Lench Mob.|$|E
