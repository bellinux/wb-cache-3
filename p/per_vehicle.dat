5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying {{they used the}} wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million <b>per</b> <b>vehicle.</b> However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million <b>per</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E

Skylon has been designed with the target of achieving no less than 200 flights <b>per</b> <b>vehicle.</b> According to the company, its business plan is to sell vehicles for $1 billion each, for which it has forecast a market for at least 30 Skylons, while recurring costs of just $10 million per flight are predicted to be incurred by operators. While the REL intends to manufacture some components directly, such as the engine precooler, other components have been designed by partner companies and a consortium of various aerospace firms is expected to handle full production of Skylon.|$|E

5|$|The first lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S-22 prototype, which {{rolled out}} of the factory door on 1 August 1945. After a short and {{intensive}} testing period, serial production began on 29 October 1945 but because of a shortage of materials and component quality problems, the first vehicles were not ready until early 1946. The capabilities of the domestic suppliers proved to be very limited and the company was dependent on imported gearboxes, steering components, drive shafts and electrical systems until domestic companies could {{set up their own}} production. The Finnish suppliers were unable to meet the requirements with the available materials and experienced severe quality problems. Total production in 1946 was 147 Sisu S-22 vehicles, which was far below the target of 2,000 vehicles. The original, calculated price <b>per</b> <b>vehicle</b> had been 765,000marks but the eventual cost was 800,000marks.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the tests}} in Oslo, a {{delegation}} {{was sent to}} look at compatible systems outside Oslo. After it had returned, the company went into negotiations with three manufacturers: Duewag, Bautzen and Ansaldo/Firema. Oslo Sporveier {{signed a contract with}} Ansaldo/Firema for delivery of 17 units in 1997–98, with options for additional 15 units. The first 17 units cost , or NOK20million <b>per</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The option rights were later exercised, and the total order was increased to 32. This allowed Oslo Sporveier to replace all trams that were not articulated, and would give a maximum age in the tram fleet to 18 years. While Oslo Sporveier at first had planned to debt-finance the purchase, by 1999 it was decided that the trams would be leased from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. Due to a labor dispute about privatizing the operation of the tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} riders who will share a vehicle {{is a key}} unknown.

25|$|The MRAP program's lack of {{a common}} design {{presents}} a potential wartime logistic challenge, but others saw the diversity of MRAP vehicles as an advantage. The vehicle's weight and size severely limits its mobility off main roads, in urban areas, and over bridges, as 72 percent of the world's bridges cannot hold the MRAP. Its heft restricts transport by C-130 cargo aircraft or amphibious ships. Three MRAP vehicles (or five Oshkosh M-ATVs) fit in a C-17 aircraft, and airlifting is expensive, at $150,000 <b>per</b> <b>vehicle,</b> according to estimates by the U.S. Transportation Command. The US Air Force contracted several Ukrainian Antonov An-124 heavy-cargo aircraft, which became a familiar sight above cities such as Charleston, South Carolina where some MRAPs are produced. For comparison, sealifting costs around $13,000 <b>per</b> <b>vehicle,</b> but takes 3–4 weeks for the vehicle to arrive in theater. In December2007, the Marine Corps reduced its request from 3,700 vehicles to 2,300. and the Army also reassessed its MRAP requirements in Iraq. In January2010, 400 were flown into Afghanistan, increasing to 500 a month in February, but the goal of 1,000 a month was scaled back, because of difficulties in distribution and training drivers.|$|E
