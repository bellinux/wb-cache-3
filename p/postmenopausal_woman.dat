40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} of the height difference and bone density (BD) of premenopausal and <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women.</b> Methods: The height values of 191 premenopausal and <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women</b> were recorded, and the BD values of lumbar vertebrae and hip were detected by double energy X-ray BD detector. Results: The lower the height of the <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women,</b> the less the BD value. The BD of lumbar vertebrae dropped 0. 025 5 g/cm 2 with each 2 cm of the shortened height, and the BD of hip joint dropped 0. 029 2 g/cm 2.

The second purpose was to investigate the differences in vocal characteristics between two types of HT: estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogen therapy (E-PT). Methods : To determine the vocal characteristics in both groups, objective (aerodynamic measurements, vocal range measurements, acoustic analysis, and a determination of the dysphonia severity index) and subjective assessment techniques (perceptual evaluation, videostroboscopic evaluation, and voice handicap index) were used. Results : The <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women</b> without HT showed a significantly lower speaking fundamental frequency and were able to phonate lower compared with <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>women</b> with HT.

50|$|Bartholin gland {{carcinoma}} is {{an uncommon}} type of malignancy in the Bartholin gland {{that accounts for}} 1% of all vulvar malignant neoplasms. It is most common in women in their mid-60s. The tumor can become large before a woman is aware of symptoms. One of the first symptoms can be dyspareunia. In other instances a woman may find a mass or ulcer in the vulva area. Many clincians assume that an enlarged Bartholin gland is malignant in <b>postmenopausal</b> <b>woman</b> until proven otherwise. The growth of the tumor can spread to nearby {{areas such as the}} ischiorectal fossa and inguinal lymph nodes. Approximately 50% of bartholin gland carcinomas originate from squamous cell carcinomas.

The following five autonomic functional tests were performed on the study group: heart rate response to deep breathing, heart rate response to Valsalva maneuver, heart rate response to standing up from supine position, blood pressure response to sustained hand grip, and blood pressure response to standing up from supine position.
