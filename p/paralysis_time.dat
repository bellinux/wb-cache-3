40|$|AbstractThe insecticidal {{efficacy}} towards Helicoverpa armigera lepidopteran larvae of recombinant Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedroviruses, expressing depressant and excitatory scorpion anti-insect selective toxins, was investigated. The ET 50 (effective <b>paralysis</b> <b>time</b> 50 %) values {{obtained with}} the recombinant viruses expressing the depressant toxin, LqhIT 2, and the excitatory toxin, LqhIT 1, were 59 h and 66 h, respectively, whereas the ET 50 {{value of the}} wild-type virus was longer, 87 h post infection. The insecticidal effects obtained when using two distinct temporally regulated viral promoters revealed advantage for the very late p 10 promoter over the p 35 early promoter.

40|$|Abstract: The {{historical}} {{method for}} the detection of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is represented by the mouse bioassay (MBA) measuring the animal survival rate. Since the endpoint of the MBA is the death of the mice due to paralysis of the respiratory muscle, an ex vivo animal replacement method, called mouse phrenic nerve (MPN) assay, employs the isolated N. phrenicus-hemidiaphragm tissue. Here, BoNT causes a dose-dependent characteristic decrease of the contraction amplitude of the indirectly stimulated muscle. Within the EQuATox BoNT proficiency 13 test samples were analysed using the MPN assay by serial dilution to a bath concentration resulting in a <b>paralysis</b> <b>time</b> within the range of calibration curves generated with BoNT/A, B and E standards, respectively. For serotype identification the diluted samples were pre-incubated with polyclonal anti-BoNT/A, B or E antitoxin or a combination of each. All 13 samples were qualitatively correctly identified thereby delivering superior results compared to single in vitro methods like LFA, ELISA and LC-MS/MS.
