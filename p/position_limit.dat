Given the growing roles of liquidity and <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> in finance along with recent Wall Street legislation changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, we carry out studies to test how effectively price impact liquidity measures measure liquidity, whether <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> have impacts on market liquidity, and how optimal speculative <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> should be modeled, based on microstructure theories. Using the major New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) energy futures data from Bloomberg, we compare low-frequency liquidity proxies with high-frequency liquidity benchmarks, run an event study on futures contracts’ liquidity following the launching of the Dodd-Frank Act, and develop a theory-based <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> model.

40|$|Mutual {{funds are}} often {{restricted}} to allocate certain percentages of fund assets to certain securities that have {{different degrees of}} illiquidity. However, the existing literature on how mutual funds should trade has largely ignored the coexistence of <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> and differential illiquidity and thus the optimal trading strategy for a typical mutual fund is largely unknown. In this paper, we use a novel approach to study the optimal trading strategy of mutual funds who face both <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> and differential illiquidity. We show the existence, uniqueness, smoothness, and characterization of the optimal trading strategy. We provide extensive analytical comparative statics for the optimal trading strategy and an efficient numerical method for computing the optimal trading strategy. As expected, the presence of <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> can significantly increase liquidity premium, but surprisingly, liquidity premium can be higher when the limits are less stringent. We find that other seemingly intuitive trading strategies can be very costly. We also examine the optimal choice of <b>position</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R

40|$|Subcommittee”) {{released}} a report on June 23, 2009 concluding that excessive speculation by large index funds in the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat futures market resulted in over-valued futures prices, a large carry in the futures price structure, and a wide divergence between futures and cash prices during the 2006 through 2008 period. 1 The main findings of the Subcommittee are summarized as follows, This Report finds that there is significant and persuasive evidence to conclude that these commodity index traders, in the aggregate, {{were one of the}} major causes of “unwarranted changes”—here, increases—in the price of wheat futures contracts relative to the price of wheat in the cash market. The resulting unusual, persistent and large disparities between wheat futures and cash prices impaired the ability of participants in the grain market to use the futures market to price their crops and hedge their price risks over time, and therefore constituted an undue burden on interstate commerce. Accordingly, the Report finds that the activities of commodity index traders, in the aggregate, constituted “excessive speculation ” in the wheat market under the Commodity Exchange Act. (USS/PSI, 2009, p. 2) Based on these findings, the Subcommittee recommended that: 1) existing <b>position</b> <b>limit</b> waivers for index traders in wheat be phased out, 2) if necessary, impose additional restrictions on index traders, such as a <b>position</b> <b>limit</b> of 5, 000 contracts per trader, 3) investigate index trading in other agricultural markets, and 4) strengthen data collection on index trading in non-agricultural markets...|$|E

40|$|This is {{part two}} {{in a series of}} papers in which we {{investigate}} an approach based on Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) to study the non-linear evolution of the large-scale structure distribution in the universe. Firstly, we compute the matter bispectrum in real space using LPT up one-loop order, for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions. In the initial <b>position</b> <b>limit,</b> we find that the one-loop bispectrum computed in this manner is identical to its counterpart obtained from standard Eulerian perturbation theory (SPT). Furthermore, the LPT formalism allows for a simple reorganisation of the perturbative series corresponding to the resummation of an infinite series of perturbations in SPT. Applying this method, we find a resummed one-loop bispectrum that compares favourably with results from N-body simulations. We generalise the resummation method also to the computation of the redshift-space bispectrum up to one loop.

In such a grinding process, there is a high-speed airflow rotating {{around the edge of}} grinding wheel which hinders the grinding fluid from injecting into the contact area and makes the fluid atomization and splash during grinding process, so as to decrease the ratio of effective grinding fluid into contact area and affect the surface integrity of workpiece. In this paper, the structure and properties of grinding fluid jet is analyzed, the velocity distribution field of the round turbulent jet is discussed theoretically and simulated. Based on the pressure balance principle, a mathematical model is established for the jet velocity at the fluid nozzle, which enables the grinding fluid to pass through the high speed airflow and enter into the contact area. According to the analysis of the grinding fluid velocity in the jet core, an engineering formula is given to calculate the <b>position</b> <b>limit</b> of nozzle during grinding process, as well as a practical design example for the high speed grinding machine is presented...|$|E

To date, the application of state space forecasting to commodity and financial markets has been limited. This study examines a system for trading futures contracts using state space forecasts of commodity futures prices. The system is evaluated for a speculative asset (gold) and a nonspeculative commodity (copper). Price forecasts are developed from multivariate state space models, and the variables considered in the models are those which, according to economic theory, may influence price movements. It is demonstrated that {{the relative importance of}} the different economic variables changes over time. Through simulated trading of copper and gold futures contracts, it is also shown that significant profits can be generated from the state space forecasting approach, especially when prices are trending upward or downward fairly continuously. Relaxing the <b>position</b> <b>limit</b> of one contract substantially increases profits.

40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act {{mandated}} the CFTC {{to implement}} <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> {{on a number}} of commodities exempted from such limits currently. CFTC has proposed establishing <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> on commodity index trading, effectively classifying this group as speculators. At the center of this debate is whether the rise in commodity index trading was responsible for creating a speculative bubble in a number of commodity markets. A central tenet of proponents of a speculative bubble is the apparent close association between the change in commodity index trading and prices, particularly during 2007 - 2008 when oil prices and other commodity prices rose sharply. As is shown in the study, simple correlation does not imply causation. In fact, upon closer inspection of the theory of commodity markets and the empirical literature, by far the evidence supports the theory that underlying market fundamentals in commodity markets are directly responsible for commodity price effects. The evidence supporting the speculative bubble theory was found to have a number of limitations that call into question the robustness of the results. The paper also outlines empirical findings that deep and active commodity index trading activity promotes price discovery and liquidity in futures markets, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of these markets for hedgers. The implication for public policy is clear; imposing <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> on commodity index trading activity ignores the extensive literature refuting the speculative bubble theory and in so doing would negatively affect commodity markets, investors and hedgers while increasing risk...|$|R
