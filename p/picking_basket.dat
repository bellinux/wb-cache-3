60|$|He {{shook his}} head and she <b>picked</b> up her <b>basket</b> again, smiling.|$|R
60|$|He <b>picked</b> up the <b>basket,</b> {{and for a}} {{few minutes}} they walked along in silence.|$|R
60|$|Having {{finished}} his text he <b>picked</b> up her <b>basket,</b> and she mechanically resumed her walk beside him.|$|R
60|$|On a chair, by {{the door}} opening into the garden, sat George, the doctor's man, who was coachman, groom, and gardener, and who, having <b>picked</b> a <b>basket</b> of peas, had been {{requested}} to shell them. By an open window, Amanda, the chambermaid, was extracting the stones from a little dish of olives.|$|R

60|$|The man <b>picked</b> up a <b>basket</b> of linen {{that stood}} in the angle by the door. He hoisted it {{on his back and}} shuffled away with it across the landing and out through the gate.|$|R
50|$|Flowers are {{gathered}} to decorate Buddha images. In the afternoons people collect fresh flowers. Senior monks take the younger monks to a garden filled with flowers, where they pick flowers {{and bring back}} to the wat to wash. People who didn't participate in the flower <b>picking</b> bring <b>baskets</b> to wash the flowers so the flowers can shine with the Buddha statues.In the evening lao people usually go to the temple to worship the Buddhas.|$|R

Near {{her on the}} ground is a basket full of fruits.; Handwriting on the back reading: "Kaktusfeigen wachsen wild in den trockenen Gegenden der Kapprovinz u. Transvaal. Diese schwarze Frau von Jericho hat sich einen Korb voll dieser Früchte gepflückt. " ("Indian figs grow wild in the dry areas of the Cape Province and Transvaal. This black woman from Jericho has <b>picked</b> a <b>basket</b> full of these fruits. "...|$|R
60|$|After {{they had}} wandered {{on for a}} long time it began to grow dark. At last they reached a great plain {{overgrown}} with bushes, and when they looked around them, they saw, as much as they could in the darkness, that they were among the same beautiful raspberry bushes from which they had <b>picked</b> their <b>baskets</b> and their aprons full. Then they were so tired that they sat down on a stone and began to cry.|$|R
50|$|Day 11: The tribes met {{and thought}} an {{immunity}} challenge would happen but instead, a tribal shuffle was held. Each pair {{was asked to}} <b>pick</b> two <b>baskets</b> face-to-face on a table that would contain their new buffs, which determine what tribe they would be. Mara and KC became a pair while any <b>basket</b> Gino <b>picked,</b> the other <b>basket</b> {{in front of it}} would be Stef's. When the baskets were opened, it was revealed that the pairs would be broken down with one going to Bulan and the other in Tala. Back at the camps, each tribe welcomed the new members warmly. At Bulan, talks on behind their backs were already circulating with the original Tala members, Arthur and Betong and the original Bulan members, KC, John and Gino in strategies {{to get rid of the}} original Bulan or Tala members respectively. At Tala, Arnold and Mara felt the warmth being there at their new tribe.|$|R
50|$|Skaggs {{was also}} against the {{prevailing}} high-cost {{system of the}} grocer having clerks serving all the needs of each customer. He was an early proponent of the self-service concept where customers <b>picked</b> up <b>baskets</b> {{as they entered the}} store, selected what they wanted from the shelves, and paid for their purchases at a checkout counter. His self-service stores expanded from the one he bought from his father in 1915 to a 418-store chain eleven years later (1926) that became the dominant element of the Safeway Company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{favourable}} {{conditions for}} large {{production in the}} country is on account of availability of land, cheap labour, and rainfall pattern. [...] Harvesting techniques incorporate hand‐held poles and <b>baskets,</b> <b>picking</b> the crop when it is mature, though still hard. In 1985, production estimates were 401,000 MT.|$|R
60|$|CORNELIUS [appearing at {{the house}} door with Mat]. Patsy'll drive the pig over this evenin, Mat. Goodbye. [He {{goes back into the}} house. Mat makes for the gate. Broadbent stops him.

6000|$|... "There, now! I forgetted {{all about}} my chickeys, and the shadow 'membered 'em; and I'm glad of it," [...] said Will, {{scattering}} dabs of meal {{and water to}} the chirping, downy little creatures who pecked and fluttered at his feet. Little shadow hunted for eggs, drove the turkeys out of the garden, and <b>picked</b> a <b>basket</b> of chips: then it went to play with Sammy, a neighbor's child; for, being a small shadow, it hadn't many jobs to do, and plenty of active play was good for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} try to save you, Unc," [...] he said, just as if the marble image could hear him; and then he shook the crooked hand of the Crooked Magician, who was already busy hanging the four kettles in the fireplace, and <b>picking</b> up his <b>basket</b> left the house.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{separate}} {{male and female}} changing facilities, and domed structures containing showers at either end. The original basket room is still used for visitors who need to store their valuables in a safe location. A customer <b>picks</b> up a <b>basket</b> on entry to the pool area, once filled it is handed into the basket room and exchanged for a numbered elastic band.|$|R
60|$|So, {{when they}} were rested, Dorothy <b>picked</b> up her <b>basket</b> and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and {{sunshine}} to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, {{they could have been}} very happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Warmish, buddy," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "But a regular Paradise Lost for elegance of scenery and be-yooty of geography. Ye're wakened every morning by the sweet singin' of red birds with seven purple tails, and the sighin' of breezes in the posies and roses. And the {{inhabitants}} never work, for {{they can reach}} out and <b>pick</b> steamer <b>baskets</b> of the choicest hothouse fruit without gettin' out of bed. And there's no Sunday and no ice and no rent and no troubles and no use and no nothin'. It's a great country {{for a man to}} go to sleep with, and wait for somethin' to turn up. The bananys and oranges and hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat comes from there." ...|$|R
60|$|Farmer Brown's boy {{gave the}} little sliding door a hasty push, <b>picked</b> up his <b>basket</b> of eggs, locked the {{henhouse}} door and hurried {{out through the}} gate without stopping to close it. You see, {{he was in a}} hurry to find out what Bowser was making such a fuss about. Bowser was yelping and whining and tugging at his chain, and it was plain to see that he was terribly eager to be set free.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try," [...] said Jo, winking hard as {{she knelt}} down to <b>pick</b> up the <b>basket</b> she had joyfully upset. [...] "I'll take a leaf out of her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute of happiness. But it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful disappointment," [...] and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.|$|R
60|$|<b>Picking</b> up <b>baskets</b> {{of chips}} was the common {{punishment}} that Bella {{was subjected to}} for her childish misdemeanors. There was a bin in the stoop, where she used to put them, and a small basket hanging up {{by the side of}} it. The chip-yard was behind the house, and there was always an abundant supply of chips in it, from Albert's cutting. The basket, it is true, was quite small, and to fill it once with chips, was but a slight punishment; but slight punishments are always sufficient for sustaining any just and equitable government, provided they are certain to follow transgression, and are strictly and faithfully enforced. Bella was a very obedient and submissive child, though she had scarcely ever been subjected to any heavier punishment than picking up chips.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} badly crushed hat, {{and when he}} turned away Helen laughed, a half-hysterical laugh. His fierce energy had, so to speak, left her breathless; she was shaken by {{confused}} emotions. It was for her sake he had plunged into the quarrel, but she felt disturbed by his savageness. For all that, something in her approved, {{and it was really}} this that troubled her. <b>Picking</b> up the <b>basket,</b> she crossed the field with a very thoughtful look.|$|R
6000|$|... “What is the matter? Haven’t you {{the whole}} gang under your hand? The very <b>pick</b> of the <b>basket?</b> That old {{terrorist}} Yundt is here. I see him walking about Piccadilly in his green havelock almost every day. And Michaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle—you don’t mean to say you don’t know where he is? Because if you don’t, I can tell you,” Mr Vladimir went on menacingly. “If you imagine {{that you are the}} only one on the secret fund list, you are mistaken.” ...|$|R
5000|$|This type of AWP is {{the most}} likely of the types to be known as a [...] "cherry picker", owing to its origins, where it was {{designed}} for use in orchards (though not just cherry orchards). It lets the picker standing in the transport <b>basket</b> <b>pick</b> fruit high in a tree with relative ease (with the jointed design ensuring minimum damage to the tree). The term [...] "cherry picker" [...] has become generic, and is commonly used to describe articulated lifts (and more rarely all AWPs).|$|R
60|$|He ran lightly {{down the}} steps and into the kitchen, <b>picked</b> up a <b>basket,</b> filled it {{haphazard}} with vegetables and threw a cloth over the top. Then {{he made his way to}} the front door, peered out for a moment, swung through it on to the step, and, turning round, commenced to belabour it with his fist. Two plain-clothes men stood at the end of the street. A police automobile drew up outside the gate. Inspector French, attended by a policeman, stepped out. The former looked searchingly at Quest.|$|R
50|$|As of 2008 (the {{last year}} for which records are available), Domaine Ponsot has {{produced}} wine from 10 vineyards. The domaine grows wine with a serious nod to biodynamic processes, using no fertilizer, pesticides, or weed killer, although the domaine makes no claim to being organic or biodynamic. At harvest time (Domaine Ponsot {{is one of the last}} producers to pick grapes in the Côte de Nuits), the grapes are selected in the vineyard (the domaine does not use a sorting table), <b>picked</b> into wicker <b>baskets,</b> generally not having been destemmed, for crushing on the winery's 1945-era vertical press.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} memorable games was a quiz called [...] "Double or Drop", where each of three contestants was given a prize to hold for each {{question}} answered correctly, but given a cabbage if they were incorrect. They were out of the game if they dropped any of the items awarded or received a third cabbage. While the winner took his or her <b>pick</b> from a <b>basket</b> of toys, every runner-up won a much-envied marbled propelling pencil as a prize, which became so popular that in 1961 Queen Elizabeth was presented with Crackerjack! pencils for Anne and Charles.|$|R
60|$|While {{these things}} were in progress, the Neshamony was not idle. She made six voyages between the Reef and the Peak in that month, {{carrying}} to the last, fish, fresh pork, various necessaries from the ship, as well as eggs and salt. Some of the fowls were caught and transferred to the Peak, as well as half-a-dozen of the porkers. The return cargo consisted of reed-birds, in large quantities, several other varieties of birds, bread-fruits, bananas, yams, cocoa-nuts, and a fruit that Heaton discovered, which was of a most delicious flavour, resembling strawberries and cream, and which was afterwards ascertained to be the charra-moya, the fruit that, of all others, when good, is thought to surpass everything else of that nature. Bridget also <b>picked</b> a <b>basket</b> of famously large wild strawberries on the Summit, {{and sent them to}} Anne. In return. Anne sent her sister, not only cream and milk, by each passage, but a little fresh butter. The calves had been weaned, and the two cows were now giving their largest quantity of milk, furnishing almost as much butter as was wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Mary Erskine to Bella, [...] "you must study a and b {{for half}} an hour. I shall tell you when I think the half hour is out. If {{you get tired of}} sitting at your desk, you may take your board and your chalk out to the door and sit upon the step. You must spend all the time in making the letters on the board, and you may say a and b while you are making the letters, but besides that you must not speak a word. For every time that you speak, except to say a and b, after I tell you to begin, you will have to <b>pick</b> up a <b>basket</b> of chips." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Detour in this leg was Flores (Flowers) and Árbol (Tree). In Flores, teams {{made their}} way to Lago Negro. Once there, teams had to take a swan boat out and paddle to the other shore to <b>pick</b> up a <b>basket</b> of flowers from a {{villager}}. Then they {{had to go back to}} the dock and give the basket to a female villager to receive their next clue. In Árbol, teams {{made their way}} to the Aldeia Do Papai Noel. Once in the village, teams searched in the [...] "Arvore dos desejos" [...] for a [...] "Mimo" [...] with their names written on it, which they had to give to a Goblin in order to receive their next clue.|$|R
5000|$|Snake Charmer: The warriors must {{listen to}} three snake charmers, picking {{the one that}} plays the tune that matches that played to them previously. On picking the correct charmer, they must {{individually}} select one of five baskets surrounding that snake charmer, with each warrior volunteering to take their turn; whilst four baskets are empty and will transport that warrior to the Temple when they climb inside, one basket contains a snake, and for the warrior choosing that basket, their quest is over. Taylan, who chose to go second after Marca, <b>picked</b> the second <b>basket</b> from the right, which contained the snake, and was eliminated from the quest. This challenge was based on luck.|$|R
2500|$|In 627, the Meccans, {{accompanied}} by tribal allies {{as well as}} the Banu Nadir - who had been very active in supporting the Meccans - marched against Medina - the Muslim stronghold - and laid siege to it. It is unclear whether their treaty with Muhammad obliged the Qurayza to help him defend Medina, or merely to remain neutral, according to Ramadan, they had signed an agreement of mutual assistance with Muhammad. The Qurayza did not participate in the fighting - according to David Norcliffe, because they were offended by attacks against Jews in Muhammad's preaching - but lent tools to the town's defenders. According to Al-Waqidi, the Banu Qurayza helped the defense effort of Medina by supplying spades, <b>picks,</b> and <b>baskets</b> for the excavation of the defensive trench the defenders of Medina had dug in preparation. According to Watt, the Banu Qurayza [...] "seem to have tried to remain neutral" [...] in the battle but later changed their attitude when a Jew from Khaybar persuaded them that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed and though they did not commit any act overtly hostile to Muhammad, according to Watt, they entered into negotiations with the invading army.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Captain Jabez, [...] "but this ain't New York city. No, sir, {{not by a}} long shot. I am just as willin' to {{accommodate}} a fellow-man, or a fellow-woman, for that matter, as any reasonable person is; but if the President of the United States, and Queen Victoria, and the prophet Isaiah was to come to me of a Saturday night, after I'd just got home from a week's work, and ask me to start straight off and take them to Sanpritchit, I'd tell 'em that I'd be glad to oblige 'em, but it couldn't be done: and that's what I say to ye, sir,--neither more nor less." [...] And with this he <b>picked</b> up his <b>basket</b> and went into the house.|$|R
5000|$|Taking {{the five}} loaves {{and the two}} fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples <b>picked</b> up twelve <b>baskets</b> full of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was about five {{thousand}} men, beside women and children. In John's Gospel, the multitude has been attracted around Jesus because of the healing works he has performed, and the feeding of the multitude is taken as a further sign (σημεῖον) that Jesus is the Messiah, the prophet who (according to the promise in [...] ) is {{to come into the}} world" [...] (...)
