I think people are quite used to girls in this industry really being able to move in front of the camera, but I'm just rubbish at that kind of thing.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 Australian {{portrait}} photographer Michel Lawrence published All of Us, a book containing photographs of people born in 200 other countries, but who were {{now living in}} Australia. Lawrence said the All of Us project was wholly inspired by the Cronulla riots. “You watch this stuff on TV and you wonder why <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> this - this is no way for a multicultural society to behave,” said Lawrence.|$|E

500|$|Addressing his approach, Weisman {{said that}} {{eliminating}} {{the human element}} eliminated the [...] "fear factor" [...] that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> something wrong or that they will die; {{it is meant to}} be read as a fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of Spiked related the book to [...] "today's romanticisation of nature" [...] in that it linked [...] "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" [...] with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the [...] "Nature knows best" [...] notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.|$|E
500|$|For {{the series}} almost two-minute long title sequence, Karin Winslow rented {{a car and}} with the help of a camera {{assistant}} traveled in the eight featured countries of the first season and captured over a hundred shots. [...] "My directive from Lana was to go out and describe each country by what you see; find the nuances, find the food, find what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> get a feel for the place," [...] said Winslow. In the second season some of the footage was replaced by new shots, including a shot of the Wachowskis' parents. The closing credits of each episode credit Winslow for the [...] "main title design".|$|E

Every now and then people need to be reminded of things that can be done." [...] "Sun Tea" [...] was filmed on October 23 and November 10, 2009.|$|E
500|$|... "A Quiet Night In" [...] was {{submitted}} to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award. In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did {{think it was a}} shame that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|Lancaster, however, {{kept an eye}} on {{the public}} {{scrutiny}} surrounding Lopez. Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which more and more <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E
5000|$|About {{the sound}} of the track, Krewella stated:"We went back to the roots for that one,” says Yasmine. “The reason why we fell in love with dance music <b>is</b> <b>people</b> like Daft Punk, Justice, MSTRKRFT ... all those <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> this grungy, punk-y dance stuff and we wanted to channel that for the new song that’s out." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening {{episode of the}} serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is [...] "probably {{as good as it}} [...] The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy [...] and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." [...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> something you would never have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now a lot of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E
500|$|NME {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} six out of ten: [...] "It tails off towards the end, and TBS never quite shake the feeling that other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> {{this sort of thing}} far more thrillingly elsewhere." [...] Now {{reviewer}} Evan Davies wrote that although the group's fans and label had expectations, it [...] "doesn't mean you have to put out the exact same fucking album twice in a row." [...] According to Davies, Taking Back Sunday writes two kinds of songs: [...] "energetic pop rock with whiny vocals, and midtempo power rock, again with whiny vocals." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that the group [...] "amped up their sound," [...] with Valentine [...] "delivering a turbocharged attack spiked with dark, catchy melodies and giant choruses." [...] Hoard called most of the album's songs [...] "skull-rattling slasher with enough pop smarts to keep the heartbroken agony from becoming too much to handle." [...] For Stylus Magazine, Ian Cohen wrote that the album [...] "tables the discussion" [...] of whether Taking Back Sunday [...] "embrace their arena destiny or disappear into the basement for cred that never really existed." [...] Cohen concluded, [...] "As was the case with pop-metal, 'albums' weren't the objective, so much as a few ace singles and album tracks that hold serve, which is Louder Now in a nutshell." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1996, Bopol {{was living}} in the United States. [...] Georges Collinet {{reported}} on an edition of his radio program Afropop Worldwide devoted to Les Quatre Etoiles, [...] "After more than ten years living in France, Bopol and Nyboma have now come to the US, looking for a new base, because they say that in America, business is business, while in France, people are always looking at the color of your skin." [...] Collinet continued, translating from his interview in French with Bopol for the program, [...] "Bopol says, if there were good studios in Zaire I would prefer to work there, because there I have lots of inspiration -- you can see what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> [...] We compose our songs by observing people around us.

[...] Kahn {{described the}} clip's premise as [...] "epic minimalism," [...] saying [...] "I think every music video right now has big sets, big things, big everything, and we're going to see how small {{we can make it}} and still make it big." [...] The clip fulfilled the intention of [...] "creating a world around her," [...] desiring to have an [...] "iconic" [...] aura. Kahn exclaimed [...] "the great thing about Janet is that her videos go all out, and that's risk-taking. She's not just doing what other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> she's willing to go and try to create something new." [...] Jackson responded [...] "I enjoy trying different things, video wise as well as make-up and costuming, that's fun for me.

2500|$|With Kasdan's {{advice to}} cast good actors and write for them instead of shoehorning {{them into the}} other roles, Meriwether was {{prepared}} to deviate from her pitched characters during casting. Basing Nick Miller on a friend also surnamed Miller, she originally imagined Nick as the smartest {{one of the group}} who doesn't need to say that and thought of him as [...] "the everyman one, who's stepping away and commenting on what all the crazy <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> around him." [...] She sent the New Girl pilot script to movie actor Jake Johnson, with whom she had enjoyed working on No Strings Attached. As he had never auditioned for a TV pilot, she guided him through the audition process. Casting was done mainly through chemistry tests, and Johnson auditioned with Max Greenfield, who impressed the producers in his first audition as Schmidt. The actors auditioning for Schmidt were more varied in appearance than those auditioning for Nick, and Johnson and Greenfield were initially worried that they looked too much alike. Johnson got the role of Nick after he agreed to lose 15 pounds at the network's request; Greenfield learned the same day that he was cast.|$|E

Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there.
