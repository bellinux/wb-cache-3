40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} master load {{magnitude}} a drum and its changes under lacking picks condition, {{find out the}} influence on drum loads when lacking <b>picks</b> <b>on</b> helical vanes, explore failure reasons of a shearer drum, a mathematical model of shearer drum loads was analyzed and established in the paper, using Matlab computer analysis program, drum loads and their changes under several conditions were simulated when lacking <b>picks</b> <b>on</b> helical vanes, and the influence to shearer drum load of lacking <b>picks</b> <b>on</b> different positions was analyzed. The results indicate that, the closer lacking pick position to the seam exposed surface, the smaller drum load fluctuation is when existing one lacking <b>pick</b> <b>on</b> helical vane; the load fluctuation and position angle of two lacking <b>picks</b> <b>on</b> the drum inversely proportional when existing two lacking <b>picks</b> <b>on</b> helical vane, which is roughly {{in accord with the}} actual situation...|$|R
