After a literature review about project success factors, {{it was found that}} the current research effort is mainly focused on information technology, engineering and software development projects, not yet on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>projects.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> <b>projects</b> have a different focus, are concerned on providing conditions in which people can be healthy, and are essential for populations’ welfare.

A model of success factors would help in the identification, control and minimization of issues that increase the likelihood of going in the wrong direction and strengthen those that create value or increase the probability of going successfully. It would also be useful as a tool for prediction and diagnosis in evaluating objectively and gradually minimize the probability of project failure, and thus assist in improving the project performance.
