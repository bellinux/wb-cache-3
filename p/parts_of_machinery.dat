2500|$|Classical {{mechanics}} {{describes the}} motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>machinery,</b> and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies. Within classical mechanics are sub-fields, including those that describe the behavior of solids, liquids and gases. Classical mechanics provides extremely accurate results when studying large objects that are not extremely heavy (i.e. their Schwarzschild radius is negligibly small for a given application) and speeds not approaching the speed of light. When the objects being examined are sufficiently small, it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of mechanics: [...] quantum mechanics. This sub-field adjusts {{the laws of physics}} of macroscopic objects for the atomic nature of matter by including the wave–particle duality of atoms and molecules. When neither quantum nor classical mechanics apply and the objects are not extremely heavy, such as at the quantum level with high speeds, quantum field theory (QFT) becomes applicable. In case that objects become extremely heavy, deviations from Newtonian mechanics become apparent and can be quantified by using the Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism. In that case, General relativity (GR) becomes applicable. However, until now there is no theory of Quantum gravity unifying GR and QFT {{in the sense that it}} could be used when objects become extremely small and heavy.|$|E

5000|$|In case {{of failure}} to achieve any gains by a strike, the worker resorts to sabotage, the silent strike by which are gained all the {{advantages}} of the open strike without its dangers; i.e., the men keep their places at their machines, thus preventing and making unnecessary the employment of scabs, pretending to do the work for which they receive their pay, but actually doing only so much of it as is needed to deceive the overseers. At the same time the worker employs many methods of attacking the employer, such as breaking delicate <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>machinery,</b> mixing wrong ingredients into compounds, telling truth or lies to customers, anything, in short, to force the employer to terms.It is useless to assert that these methods will not appeal to AngloSaxon workers, as does one writer on the subject.
