25|$|The {{activated}} sludge process {{was discovered in}} 1913 in the United Kingdom by two engineers, Edward Ardern and W.T.

25|$|From the outset, Brazil’s {{nuclear program}} has been {{shrouded}} in secrecy. Nuclear issues are still considered {{a matter of national}} security and sovereignty, despite Brazil’s democratic makeup and transition away from military dictatorship. There is little transparency regarding the various nuclear activities under the government’s purview and the potential impact these can have on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Moreover, numerous attempts to keep radioactive accidents and incidents secret have undermined credibility of nuclear enterprises and led to distrust among the public.|$|E
25|$|Today, several unrecognized {{villages are}} in the process of recognition. They have been {{incorporated}} into the Abu Basma Regional Council created for the purpose of dealing with specific problems of the Bedouin. So far they remain without water, electricity and garbage services, although there is a certain improvement - for example, in al-Sayyid two new schools were built and a medical clinic has been opened since its recognition in 2004. Development has been hampered by urban planning difficulties and land ownership problems. Due to the lack of municipal waste services and trash pickup, backyard burning has been adopted on a large scale, impacting badly on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} sewage sludge is {{controlled}} under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants {{and those that do}} not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.|$|E

2500|$|The Hazard Ranking System [...] is a {{scoring system}} used to {{evaluate}} potential relative risks to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> from releases or threatened releases of hazardous wastes at uncontrolled waste sites. Under the Superfund program, the EPA and state agencies use the HRS to calculate a site score (ranging from 0 to 100) based on the actual or potential release of hazardous substances from a site through air, surface water or groundwater. A score of 28.5 places the site on the National Priorities List, making the site eligible for long-term remedial action (i.e., cleanup) under the Superfund program.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1998 the Dutch {{government}} provided {{technical assistance}} to prepare a second national water plan. The National Water Resources Plan (NWRP) was completed in 2003 with a time horizon until 2017. The plan, which is not publicly available, is based on four principles: to develop additional resources, make better use of existing resources, protect <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> and improve institutional arrangements. According to the FAO the plan includes both [...] "vertical expansion" [...] through more efficient water use and increased agricultural productivity and [...] "horizontal expansion" [...] by increasing the existing agricultural area of 7.8 million feddan (about 3.12 million ha) by an additional 1.4 million feddan (about 560 000 ha). In June 2005 the Ministry presented an Integrated Water Resources Management Plan, which was prepared with technical assistance from the World Bank, as a [...] "transitional strategy including further reform interventions" [...] building on the NWRP. The Plan, which reads more like a World Bank report than {{a report by the}} Egyptian government, includes 39 actions in the fields of institutional reform and strengthening, policies and legislation, physical interventions, capacity building, technological and information systems, water quality, economic and financial framework, research, raising awareness, monitoring and evaluation and transboundary cooperation. The physical interventions mentioned include irrigation improvement and rural sanitation without mentioning the government's mega-projects that {{are at the heart of}} Egypt's actual water policy.|$|E
