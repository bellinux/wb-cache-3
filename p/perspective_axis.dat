50|$|The line {{which goes}} through the points where the figure's {{corresponding}} sides intersect {{is known as the}} axis of perspectivity, <b>perspective</b> <b>axis,</b> homology axis, or archaically, perspectrix. The figures are said to be perspective from this axis. The point at which the lines joining the corresponding vertices of the perspective figures intersect is called the center of perspectivity, perspective center, homology center, pole, or archaically perspector. The figures are said to be perspective from this center.|$|E

First, an antialiasing extension {{to the basic}} splatting algorithm is introduced that mitigates the spatial aliasing for high-resolution volumes. Aliasing can be severe for high-resolution volumes or volumes where a high depth of field leads to converging samples along the <b>perspective</b> <b>axis.</b> Next, {{an analysis of the}} common approximation errors in the splatting process for perspective viewing is presented. In this context, we give different implementations, distinguished by efficiency and accuracy, for adding the splat contributions to the image plane. We then present new results in controlling the splatting errors and also show their behavior in the framework of our new antialiasing technique. Finally, current work in progress on extensions to splatting for temporal antialiasing is demonstrated. Here, we present a simple but highly effective scheme for adding motion blur to fast moving volumes...|$|E
50|$|The {{triangle}} whose sidelines are externally {{tangent to}} the excircles of triangle ABC is the extangents triangle of triangle ABC. A triangle ABC and its extangents triangle are in <b>perspective</b> and the <b>axis</b> of perspectivity is the antiorthic axis of triangle ABC.|$|R
50|$|The {{tangential}} {{triangle of}} triangle ABC is the triangle TATBTC {{formed by the}} tangents to the circumcircle of triangle ABC at its vertices. Triangle ABC and its tangential triangle are in <b>perspective</b> and the <b>axis</b> of perspectivity is the Lemoine axis of triangle ABC.|$|R
50|$|A {{reference}} triangle and its tangential triangle are in <b>perspective,</b> and the <b>axis</b> of perspectivity is the Lemoine axis of {{the reference}} triangle. That is, the lines connecting the vertices of the tangential triangle and the corresponding vertices of the reference triangle are concurrent. The center of perspectivity, where these three lines meet, is the symmedian point of the triangle.|$|R
40|$|Sixteenth-century Genoa {{produced}} a distinctively {{new type of}} urban space in the Strada Nuova (or, since 1882, the Via Garibaldi) —the residential palace street or linear piazza—designed to legitimize and enhance the authority of a ruling elite. ¹ Laid out in 1550 - 51 and built between 1558 and 1591, the Strada Nuova (Fig. 1), when taken as a whole, represents two significant themes {{for the history of}} Genoa and the interpretation of Renaissance cities. First, this major example of Italian Renaissance architecture and urban planning was conceived, and indeed, functioned as a classical stagelike space for the old nobility, who governed and controlled the tightly restrictive Genoese aristocratic republic of 1528. ² This scenographic urban enclave proclaimed the exclusive social, economic, political, and ceremonial position of the old noble families who commissioned ostentatiously rich, decorated palaces along the Strada Nuova 2 ̆ 7 s central, monumental <b>perspective</b> <b>axis</b> (Figs. 1, 19, 23). As such, the Strada Nuova became the major public presentation space for the regime these families led...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{algorithm}} for {{automatic coding}} of pathology reports using a multi-axial codification (ADICAP) is described and evaluated. It extracts « significant words » or expressions from a corpus and records the statistical relationships {{between them and}} the modalities of the different axes. Different weighting functions are evaluated. With the best settings, in more than two cases out of three the correct modality was found among the top 5 list of candidates, except for the « organ » axis. Several ways of improvement are discussed especially regarding the poor results on the « organ » <b>axis.</b> <b>Perspectives</b> of a two stages assembling algorithm completing this first step are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Architecture and {{applications}} of a {{massively parallel processor}} are described. Volumes of 256 x 256 x 128 voxels can be visualized at a frame rate of 10 Hz using volume oriented visualization algorithms. A prototype of the scalable and modular system is currently set up. 3 D rotation around an arbitrary rotation <b>axis,</b> <b>perspective,</b> zooming, and arbitrary gray value mapping are provided in real-time. Multi-user access over high-speed networks is possible. A volume oriented visualization algorithm is used that is tailored to the requirements in medicine [5]. With this algorithm, small structures of a size down to the pixel resolution, and structures without defined surfaces can be visualized as well as semi-transparent objects. One application {{of the system is}} therapy planning in heart surgery...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} work, {{we developed a}} virtual colonoscopy system on a high-end 16 -processor SGI Challenge with an expensive hardware graphics accelerator. The goal of this work is to port the system to a low cost PC {{in order to increase}} its availability for mass screening. Recently, Mitsubishi Electric has developed a volume-rendering PC board, called VolumePro, which includes 128 MB of RAM and vg 500 rendering chip. The vg 500 chip, based on Cube- 4 technology, can render a 256 &sup 3; volume at 30 frames per second. High image quality of volume rendering inside the colon is guaranteed by the full lighting model and 3 D interpolation supported by the vg 500 chip. However, the VolumePro board is lacking some features required by our interactive colon navigation. First, VolumePro currently does not support perspective projection which is paramount for interior colon navigation. Second, the patient colon data is usually much larger than 256 &sup 3; and cannot be rendered in real-time. In this paper, we present our solutions to these problems, including simulated <b>perspective</b> projection and <b>axis</b> aligned boxing techniques, and demonstrate the high performance of our virtual colonoscopy system on low cost PCs...|$|R
40|$|This {{thematic}} {{issue of}} the BJL presents eight contributions {{on the notion of}} framing, ranging from theoretical to applied perspectives, and reflecting a range of issues on lexico-grammatical and discourse issues. More than forty years after Charles Fillmore’s (1968, 1977) seminal work on case grammar, the general objective of this volume is to show the vividness of the linguistic debate which arose out of Fillmore’s frame semantics. We do so both by bringing together a range of empirical materials reaching from strictly grammatical and lexical to discourse patterns, and by stimulating discussions with other, cognitively or socially oriented models and applications. More specifically, the contributions in this volume cluster around two axes. The first one concentrates on how a form-meaning model of language in frame semantics interacts not only with its ‘sister theory’ of construction grammar (Östman and Fried 2004 : 5) and other cognitive frameworks, but also with work on framing from a social <b>perspective.</b> The second <b>axis</b> deals with applying these sister theories to objects and corpora of different dimensions, from lexico-grammatical issues at the sentence level to larger stretches of discourse. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract XX century {{culture has}} {{emphasized}} specialization paradigm in all knowledge domains, including Engineering one. World culture, naturally, has increased complexity on globalization times putting real challenge to educators {{looking for an}} International Engineer profile for XXI century. On this direction, this paper presents core aspects from a knowledge based educational model- Thematic Oriented Methodology- which is centered in complex modeling axis just to treat knowledge domain. This methodology theoretical orientation, is in accordance with Complex Thought research from UNESCO Edgar Morin itinerant cathedra for XXI century education. The present proposal combines those generic principles enounced by Edgar Morin, and a concrete knowledge modeling tool, born in Informatics- Object Oriented modeling tool. From complex information systems, this informatics tool can be, yet, applied at educational <b>perspective.</b> The central <b>axis</b> of Thematic Educational Methodology is knowledge treatment as a complex system, integrating vertical and horizontal knowledge categories. This facilitates pedagogic and harmonic integration of contents, from abstract issues like social, ethical and cognitive to concrete issues like math’s and physics, or even computer programming. Here, it seems crucial to discuss about a definition of complexity that is, at first, quite ambiguous word, if they are considered different kinds of knowledge paradigms. Definition of complexity, under open knowledge paradigm, added with complexity of object of study definition, constitutes a contribution to international perspective in Engineering curriculum. They are presented some practical examples combining abstract and concrete issues related with an Informatics discipline for Engineering cours...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{feasibility}} {{to extract the}} proportion of pigs located in different areas of a pig pen by advanced image analysis technique is explored and discussed for possible applications. For example, pigs generally locate themselves in the wet dunging area at high ambient temperatures {{in order to avoid}} heat stress, as wetting the body surface is the major path to dissipate the heat by evaporation. Thus, the portion of pigs in the dunging area and resting area, respectively, could be used as an indicator of failure of controlling the climate in the pig environment as pigs are not supposed to rest in the dunging area. The computer vision methodology utilizes a learning based segmentation approach using several features extracted from the image. The learning based approach applied is based on extended state-of-the-art features in combination with a structured prediction framework based on a logistic regression solver using elastic net regularization. In addition, the method is able to produce a probability per pixel rather than form a hard decision. This overcomes some of the limitations found in a setup using grey-scale information only. The pig pen is a difficult imaging environment because of challenging lighting conditions like shadows, poor lighting and poor contrast between pig and background. In order to test practical conditions, a pen containing nine young pigs was filmed from a top view <b>perspective</b> by an <b>Axis</b> M 3006 camera with a resolution of 640 × 480 in three, 10 -min sessions under different lighting conditions. The results indicate that a learning based method improves, in comparison with greyscale methods, the possibility to reliable identify proportions of pigs in different areas of the pen. Pigs with a changed behaviour (location) in the pen may indicate changed climate conditions. Changed individual behaviour may also indicate inferior health or acute illness...|$|R
40|$|As imaginatively {{inviting}} as The Tempest is, it retains {{significance in}} a parable-like manner. The import of Prospero's project {{is not as}} manifest as might first be thought. What Shakespeare Romantically dramatizes is man's ongoing attempt to conceive himself as a relational existence. Formally, Shakespeare stages the parabolic mystery of medial man. Historically, he supplies basic imaginative terms for subsequent approaches to the mystery. In examining Shakespeare's precedent along with Robert Browning's "Caliban upon Setebos" and W. H. Auden's The Sea and the Mirror, we come to appreciate the vitality and importance of the Tempest legacy. Shakespearean Romance develops the dialectic potential of pastoral tragicomedy. In The Tempest that potential is realized in concentrated form, as antithetical concepts enter into active exchange across the middle earth of human placement. Poised between the exegetical dialectic of St. Augustine's confessional manner, and the existential dialectic of Soren Kierkegaard's philosophy, the Tempest's vision balances faith and skepticism, concern for authority and acceptance of nescience. "Caliban upon Setebos" is also carefully poised; in the arrested dialectic of its natural speaker we may glimpse the satirically deflected hesitancies of a poet uncomfortable with contemporary positivist enthusiasms. While Browning throughout the 1860 's seems to tend toward an equivocation of his Christian faith in human mediacy, Auden in the early 1940 's draws on The Tempest to express his emerging conviction of the necessary in the possible, and the self's relational fullness. Among the three works is intimated a middle way between idolatrous superstition and despairing agnosticism, a ground between angry sky and insensate sea. A distinguishing feature of Tempest-related works is the cultivation of a contemporary sense of human proportion. The variety of imaginative experience subsumed within this group might be traced between Milton and Eliot, Pope and Pynchon, Coleridge and Beckett. In a broad <b>perspective,</b> the East-West <b>axis</b> traversing the Tempest complex balances the interchanges between Europe and the American New World against those between Europe and the Levantine/classical Old World. A dialectically indrawn coda to Shakespeare's career, The Tempest is an influential precedent for the wedding of formalist and historicist impulses...|$|R
40|$|Futurity: {{integrating}} {{form and}} intersubjective meaning Context – In {{contrast to the}} vast literature on modality, only few cognitive linguistic studies have been devoted exclusively to the expression of futurity. This paper shows how cognitive linguistics (CL) may contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the linguistic form and meaning of futurity in Italian and German. Three theoretical cognitive frameworks – We combine the following theoretical constructs inspired by CL. (1) Langacker’s (1991 : 244) extended epistemic offers a temporal and modal template for situating future predications, which overlaps with a second, discursive time-line: a conceptualizer’s current discourse space (CDS, Langacker 2001) which represents time as discourse unfolds (Chilton 2005). (2) We pursue Verhagen’s (2005) idea that linguistic structures do not only profile the object of conceptualization but also potential (inter) subjective viewpoints of multiple, embedded conceptualizers, who refer to specific temporal positions on Langacker’s time-line. (3) We discuss the constructional patterns and conceptual representations used in blended (Fauconnier & Turner 2002) co-occurrence of futurity and actuality. Research questions – We describe the blending of intersubjective positions which implies 4 aspects: (1) the relation between conceptualizations of present and future time positions, like a precursive (present) perspective and prospective (future) counterpart; (2) the shifts between <b>perspectives</b> on the <b>axis</b> of represented time which occur along temporal, and eventually, through modal and spatial discourse vectors, (3) the fact that these vectors are set up by heterogeneous enunciative subjects; (4) the German and Italian constructional patterns exploited for blending temporal positions, perspectives and subjects. Methodology and sample data – Our corpus-based approach combines cognitive approaches with authentic language data in popularizing discourse: a publication ordered by Cordis (European Commission) to the German Science and Training department (BMBF), and its Italian translation by Veneto Nanotech (approximately 100 pp.). Science popularization typically deals with representing possible future everyday applications of complex concepts in scientific theory. One of these popularized concepts is nanotechnology, which deals with the miniaturization of technological artefacts. There is a growing social and political concern about popularization of nanosciences: how can a multilingual audience be convinced of their assets. Results – We provide a typology and evidence for the CL representation of futurity, based on Italian and German. Generally speaking, the case shows the nexus between conceptualization in CL and its strategic implications for the political-institutional and societal aspects of nanotechnology. More specifically, this grammatical description shows the creative and dynamic nature of meaning construction, which blends multiple temporal representations. It shows how creating new concepts strongly relies on futurity. References Chilton, P. 2005. Vectors, Viewpoint and viewpoint shift. Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics, Volume 3. 78 – 116.
