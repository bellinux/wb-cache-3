5|$|Finnegans Wake {{comprises}} seventeen chapters, {{divided into}} four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles {{as he had done}} for Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice is to indicate <b>part</b> <b>number</b> in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third part.|$|E

25|$|A second {{generation}} model (known as Dual Ethernet or Snow, model M8440, <b>part</b> <b>number</b> M8209LL/A) was introduced on November 13, 2001. It features a second Ethernet port {{when compared to}} the Graphite design, allowing for a shared Internet connection with both wired and wireless clients. Also new (but available for the original model via software update) was the ability to connect to and share America Online's dial-up service—a feature unique to Apple base stations. This model is based on Motorola's PowerPC 855 processor and contained a fully functional original AirPort Card, which can be removed and used in any compatible Macintosh computer.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} AirPort Base Station (known as Graphite, model M5757, <b>part</b> <b>number</b> M7601LL/B) {{features a}} dial-up modem and an Ethernet port. It employs a Lucent WaveLAN Silver PC Card as the Radio, and uses an embedded AMD Elan processor. It was released July 21, 1999. The Graphite AirPort Base Station is functionally {{identical to the}} Lucent RG-1000 wireless base station and can run the same firmware. Due to the original firmware-locked limitations of the Silver card, the unit can only accept 40-bit WEP encryption. Later aftermarket tweaks can enable 128-bit WEP on the Silver card. Aftermarket Linux firmware has been developed for these units to extend their useful service life.|$|E
25|$|The XLR {{connector}} {{was invented}} by James H. Cannon, founder of Cannon Electric in Los Angeles, California (now part of ITT Corporation), {{and for this reason}} it was sometimes colloquially known as a Cannon plug or Cannon connector. Originally manufactured as the Cannon X series, by 1950 a locking mechanism was added (Cannon XL) and by 1955 a version surrounding the female contacts with a synthetic rubber polychloroprene insulation using the <b>part</b> <b>number</b> prefix XLR. There was also an XLP series which used a hard plastic insulation, but was otherwise the same. ITT Cannon originally manufactured XLR connectors in two locations Kanagawa, Japan and Melbourne, Australia. The Australian operation was sold to Alcatel Components in 1992 and then acquired by Amphenol in 1998. ITT Cannon continues to manufacture XLR connectors in Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Model M was {{designed}} to be more cost effective than the Model F keyboards it replaced. Production of Model M's began in 1985; they were often bundled with new IBM computers. They were produced at IBM plants in Lexington; Greenock, Scotland and Guadalajara, Mexico. The most common Model M variant is the <b>part</b> <b>number</b> 1391401, the US English layout keyboard of the IBM PS/2. Until around 1993, most Model M's included a sturdy, coiled, detachable cable, with either an AT (pre-1987) or PS/2 connector, in 5- and 10-foot lengths (1.5 and 3 metres). From about 1994 onwards, flat non-detachable cables were used to reduce manufacturing costs; however, IBM retained its 101-key layout, never implementing the Microsoft Windows keys common on other keyboards from that time. Unicomp later designed a 104-key Model M with Windows keys.|$|E
