Thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships, both submarines and surface ships, using countershading, but failed to convince the US Navy to adopt his ideas.|$|E
5|$|A forced {{variation}} {{that involves}} a sacrifice and usually {{results in a}} tangible gain is called a combination. Brilliant combinations– {{such as those in}} the Immortal Game– are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a <b>position</b> <b>where</b> a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.|$|E

As a senior in 1996, he was nominated to be the Burlington Spectator Athlete of the Week for his contributions to the football team.

In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium <b>position</b> <b>where</b> the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E

5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a <b>position</b> <b>where</b> the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient.

5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space shuttle program, a {{high-level}} <b>position</b> <b>where</b> Lunney found himself responsible for setting the agenda for the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|In February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell {{colleague}} Klaus Fuchs {{was arrested}} for espionage, and the AERE began to take security more seriously, and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE. While Arnold had no evidence that Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy, he did feel {{that he was a}} security risk, and recommended that he be moved to a <b>position</b> <b>where</b> he did not have access to Top Secret material. Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.|$|E

5|$|McCarty was {{shifted from}} playing mostly {{as a backup}} {{tailback}} to the fullback <b>position,</b> <b>where</b> he started all 18 regular season games. In his new position, McCarty was primarily used for blocking and remained involved on special teams and as a receiver. He continued his extremely limited role as a rusher, finishing the season with just eight carries. McCarty had 16 catches for 123 yards and two touchdowns, {{as well as a}} career-high 12 special-teams tackles.|$|E

While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a <b>position</b> <b>where</b> his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a <b>position</b> <b>where</b> they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebral}} {{region of}} the brain is separated {{from the rest of}} the brain by a distinct compression caused in the endocranial cavity. The rearmost part of the cerebral {{region of the}} braincase has a top with a small expansion. This is different from Jainosaurus. However, relatively much larger expansions are known in the diplodocoid sauropods Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus. In MCCM-HUE-8741, the small opening in the skull roof middle is responsible for a swelling on the endocast that is suggestive of a pineal system. It is in the exact <b>position</b> <b>where</b> the pineal gland is expected to have been, between the forebrain and the midbrain.|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current <b>position</b> <b>where</b> stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each <b>position</b> <b>where</b> it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Australian {{commander}} {{issued a}} new operation order, reassigning {{the task of}} capturing the Christmas Hills area to the 24th Infantry Brigade and pulling the 20th Infantry Brigade back to Nongora to rest up for {{the next phase of}} the campaign, which would see them advance up the coast. The strain of the advance along the coastal route, which had been the 24th Infantry Brigade's main effort, however, had taken its toll. As a result, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion was called forward again as the 2/28th was plagued by sickness and the 2/43rd was physically worn out. On the night of 4/5 December, the Japanese withdrew from their forward positions, leaving behind a large quantity of equipment and their dead. The following morning, a composite force of Australians from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions then took up the advance towards the Christmas Hills, ranging west, and undertaking a series of flanking moves in order to break into the Japanese main defensive <b>position,</b> <b>where</b> the Japanese were well-entrenched. A firefight ensued in which six Japanese and seven Australians were killed, before the Australian attack was turned back.|$|E
5|$|By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) {{remaining}} large warships {{were unable}} to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about half her anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No.7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby in a <b>position</b> <b>where</b> {{she was able to}} protect the battleship with her 25mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
