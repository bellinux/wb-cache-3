Harmonies emphasizing 2nds, 4ths and 7ths led to <b>polymodality.</b> His later output consists predominantly of chamber and orchestral works, e. g., the song cycle Ad astra (1961), based on poems by Štefan Žáry, the mixed choir cycle O človeku ("On Man"), the Poème macabre for violin and piano, Contemplations for narrator and piano, Six Compositions for Strings, the Rhapsodic Suite for piano and orchestra and the Symfonická fantasia na BACH (1971). His piano cycle Kaleidoscope also exists in a version for piano, string orchestra and percussion. His last works include a Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra, Elegy, Toccata, and the song cycles Glimpse into the Unknown and Three Songs for Bass.|$|E

40|$|The northeastern Lithuanian vocal sutartines {{feature a}} great {{diversity}} in their polyphonic structure: they vary in texture (polyphonic and heterophonic), modal structure (polymodal and monomodal), and rhythm (polyrhythmic and homorhythmic). Since the prevailing melodic style of sutartines is mixed rather than homogeneous, {{it is probable}} that these polyphonic songs originally evolved through the interaction of different folk music styles. Most of polyphonic sutartines, according to Latvian and Lithuanian ethnomusicologists, were composed by juxtaposing monophonic melodies. This was proved by comparing the melodic structure of sutartines with that of the monophonic melodies from the adjacent regions. Such characteristics of sutartines as <b>polymodality,</b> cannot be fully explained in regard to the development of vocal melodies. This leads to an admission that vocal sutartines underwent a considerable melodic influence of instrumental music. The polyphonic polymodal sutartines have probably derived from the process of playing the two daudytes rather than singing. The <b>polymodality</b> could have resulted from the performance on two daudytes of different length. Historical sources provide us with evidence that earlier the tradition of performing daudytes was highly significant. Thus it appears that the influence of instrumental music on modal structure of vocal sutartines was much more considerable than it was generally thought...|$|E

40|$|A major gap in our {{understanding}} of sensation is how a single sensory neuron can differentially respond to a multitude of different stimuli (<b>polymodality),</b> such as propio- or nocisensation. The prevailing hypothesis is that different stimuli are transduced through ion channels with diverse properties and subunit composition. In a screen for ion channel genes expressed in polymodal nociceptive neurons, we identified Ppk 26, a member of the trimeric degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family, as being necessary for proper locomotion behavior in Drosophila larvae in a mutually dependent fashion with coexpressed Ppk 1, another member of the same family. Mutants lacking Ppk 1 and Ppk 26 were defective in mechanical, but not thermal, nociception behavior. Mutants of Piezo, a channel involved in mechanical nociception in the same neurons, did not show a defect in locomotion, suggesting distinct molecular machinery for mediating locomotor feedback and mechanical nociception...|$|E

The structure of the process and the basic structures of CBP subprocesses were analyzed. Self-regulating processes and those that do not have self-regulation were allocated. The decision-making problems of these processes were formalized on the basis of modeling of the CBP structure and its subprocesses. The model is presented in the equations system form. The decision-making problem of the CBP management is reduced to discrete optimization problem based on efficiency criterion. As an efficiency criterion a profit obtaining efficiency based on probability of erroneous decisions is used. Large dimension and nonlinearity of the system, fuzziness of the most subprocesses? descriptions and criterion <b>polymodality</b> cause the necessity of construction of CBP simulation model in the control system. The main steps of the CBP management were submitted. Generalized decision-making algorithm with the usage of the simulation model was given.

40|$|Aggregation {{processes}} {{are known to}} play an important role in volcanic particle dispersal and sedimentation. They are also a primary source of uncertainty in ash dispersal forecasting since fundamental questions, such as the timing and deposition dynamics of volcanic aggregates, still remain unanswered. Here, we applied a state-of-the-art combination of field and numerical strategies to characterize volcanic aggregates. We introduce a new category of aggregates observed with high-speed-high-resolution videos, namely cored clusters. Cored clusters are mostly sub-spherical fragile aggregates that have never been observed in the deposits nor on adhesive tape as they typically break at impact with the ground. They consist of a core particle (200 - 500 mu m) fully covered by a thick shell of particles < 90 mu m. The low preservation potential of cored clusters in ash deposits explains the poor documentation in the literature and the low consideration attributed so far. Cored clusters can also better explain the deposition of fine ash in proximal and medial regions and the <b>polymodality</b> observed in many ash deposits. In addition, numerical inversions show how cored clusters can rapidly form within 175 s from eruption onset. Finally, our observations represent the first field-based evidence of the so-called rafting effect, in which the sedimentation of coarse ash in cored clusters is delayed due to aggregatio...|$|E
40|$|The article {{proposes that}} a {{construct}} I call the Dasian space provides an effective framework to interpret harmonic aspects of scale relations in twentieth-century <b>polymodality,</b> {{particularly in the}} music of Bartók. Based on Bartók’s intuition that the pitch space modeled after his notion of polymodal chromaticism retains integral “diatonic ingredients,” the Dasian space (named after the medieval homonymous scale) establishes a system of relations between all potential diatonic segments, without relying upon traditional constraints, such as complete diatonic collections, harmonic functions, or pitch centricity. The Dasian space is a closed, nonoctave repeating scalar cycle, where each element is identified by a unique coordination of pitch class and modal quality. The dual description of each element enables both the specification of location in a given cycle {{and the emergence of}} a group structure, whose generators—named transpositio and transformatio—are also characteristic musical motions and relations. The proposed analytical methodology is probed in a couple of short pieces of Bartók’s Mikrokosmos and in the third movement of his Piano Sonata. The article argues that, unlike other tonal and atonal classic approaches, the Dasian framework enables the analyst to reconcile the constructional character of a Bartókian idiomatic feature (the combination of distinct and integral scale strata) with the interpretation of harmonic space in terms of scale-segment interaction and formal processes. The article then contextualizes the structure of the Dasian space within a larger class of constructs, which I call affinity spaces, by generalizing some of its group-theoretical properties that model relations between nondiatonic scalar materials. The analytical pertinence of affinity spaces is probed in Bartók’s “Divided Arpeggios,” an intriguing posttonal piece appearing late in the Mikrokosmos set...|$|E
40|$|The {{emphasis}} of this PhD {{is in the}} field of original/contemporary musical composition and I have submitted a portfolio of original compositions (volume 1 / 2, comprising of music scores of both acoustic and electroacoustic music compositions [totalling c. 114 : 30 minutes of music] as well as written material relating to notation and artistic motivation), along with an academic commentary (volume 2 / 2 [totalling c. 19, 500 words], which places the original compositional work in the portfolio in its academic context). The composition works in first volume are varied and broad ranging in scope. In terms of pitch organisation, the majority of works adopt some form of modality or <b>polymodality,</b> whilst certain works also incorporate post-tonal chromaticism and serialism into their syntax. Certain key works also explore extended timbre and colouration (in particular for bowed strings, voices, flute and electronics) and adopt the use of timbral modifications, harmonics, microtones, multiphonics, sprechgesang (i. e. ‘speech-song’), phonetics and the incorporation of electroacoustic sampling, sound synthesis and processing. The academic commentary in the second volume sets out several initial theoretical pitch organisation models (namely relating to modes, polymodes, rows, serial techniques and intervallic cells), with a particular emphasis placed on the formation of a melodic/harmonic language which is fundamentally polymodal, polychordal and polyharmonic. The commentary then takes a closer look at various works within the portfolio which adopt modal, polymodal and chromatic forms of pitch-organisation (whilst intermittently discussing wider musical parameters, such as rhythm, counterpoint, timbre, structure etc [...] .). Separate chapters also discuss a work for flute and electronics and a lengthy work for string quartet (inspired by urban dystopian film) in greater depth. The commentary also discusses my style of writing, placing individual works within the portfolio in their academic context alongside key influences as well as contextualising non-musical aesthetics and sources of artistic inspiration relating to my work...|$|E
40|$|The three {{recitals}} {{consisted of}} performances of original eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth century solo works for trombone {{with the exception}} of Lyric Suite for Euphonium and Piano by Donald White, Divertimento for Trumpet, Trombone and Piano by Boris Blacher, and Dialogue and Dance for Trombone and Tuba by Newel Kay Brown. The premiere performance of Straight As An Arrow for B-flat-F Trombone and Prepared Tape by Ronn Cox and Dean Crocker was also included. After presenting a brief biography and discussing Gordon Jacob's (1895 - 1984) stylistic influences, the lecture continues with a Tonal, Motivic and Formal analysis of his three works for solo tenor trombone: Concerto for Trombone and Orchestra, Concertino for Trombone and Wind Orchestra, and the Trombone Sonata. Tonality, modality, <b>polymodality</b> and free association of pitches are elements that are present {{at one time or another}} in these compositions. Jacob's inclination for using the folk song style is evident in his writing, especially in the slow movements. Introductions, transition areas, and secondary themes, with tonally ambiguous harmonies and instrumental concepts of melodies, create a tension that is released by the return to tonality in the areas that follow. Treatment of rhythmic and melodic motives helps produce the special quality found in Gordon Jacob's compositions. Over half the themes in the works being investigated are built around motivic development. Neoclassicism results from the use of forms rooted in earlier centuries, but the choice of key centers gives these forms a new life. Jacob's composition of absolute music, as well as his use of the older compositional techniques of parallel harmonies and slow introductions, reflect neoclassical practices. The performance of Jacob's pieces is facilitated by his use of musical materials idiomatic to the instrument...|$|E
40|$|The article singles out modern {{scientific}} and methodological approaches to forming future technology teachers’ professional {{image in the}} educational process at the university. The basic position and acmeological and axiological approaches are analyzed. They are {{the basis for the}} system of the future technology teachers’ professional image forming and they will ensure its effectiveness. The personal “terminal” values of vocational and professional development and cultural identity of a future technology teacher are classified. The internal “terminal” values (the components of the image “I” as a person and professional) and external “terminal” values (the components of the image of external characteristics) are determined. From axiological position all target reference points of the future technology teachers’ vocational and professional and cultural identity as terminal values are classified into three groups: 1) values – aims of the competence level; 2) values – aims of the basic cultural level (this includes professional image values); 3) values – aims of the acmeological level. The second group is determined as the key values, these are the aims, the core of which is the category of “technology teacher’s basic professional culture”. Acmeological approach allows to identify a set of methodologically educated future technology teacher’s competences, which should be the new components of his image of "I" as a professional at the highest level of his/her development: the ability to self-actualization and self-realization in professional pedagogical and social activities; the ability to realize the highest meaning of the technology teacher’s pedagogical activity with the phenomenological reduction tools; readiness for the continuous humanization of technology lessons; ability to professional pedagogical reflection at the conceptual level; <b>polymodality</b> of pedagogical thinking, the ability to master artistic and graphic, technological and other components of an educational lesson content; ability to ensure his own professional and cultural self-development at the conceptual and practical levels. Prospects of further scientific studies include developing practical ways of implementing the identified methodological approaches and guidance for the teachers on their implementation into the teaching practice...|$|E
40|$|Background: Avoidance of {{noxious stimuli}} is {{essential}} for the survival of an animal in its natural habitat. Some avoidance responses require polymodal sensory neurons, which sense a range of diverse stimuli, whereas other stimuli require a unimodal sensory neuron, which senses a single stimulus. <b>Polymodality</b> might have evolved to help animals quickly detect and respond to diverse noxious stimuli. Nematodes inhabit diverse habitats and most nematode nervous systems are composed of a small number of neurons, despite a wide assortment in nematode sizes. Given this observation, we speculated that cellular contribution to stereotyped avoidance behaviors would also be conserved between nematode species. The ASH neuron mediates avoidance of three classes of noxious stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans. Two species of parasitic nematodes also utilize the ASH neuron to avoid certain stimuli. We wanted to extend our knowledge of avoidance behaviors by comparing multiple stimuli in a set of free-living nematode species. Results: We used comparative behavioral analysis and laser microsurgery to examine three avoidance behaviors in six diverse species of free-living nematodes. We found that all species tested exhibit avoidance of chemo-, mechano- and osmosensory stimuli. In C. elegans, the bilaterally symmetric polymodal ASH neurons detect all three classes of repellant. We identified the putative ASH neurons in different nematode species by their anatomical positions and showed that in all six species ablation of the ASH neurons resulted in an inability to avoid noxious stimuli. However, in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, the ADL neuron in addition to the ASH neuron contributed to osmosensation. In the species Caenorhabditis sp. 3, only the ASH neuron was required to mediate nose touch avoidance instead of three neurons in C. elegans. These data suggest that different species can increase or decrease the contribution of additional, non-ASH sensory neurons mediating osmosensation and mechanosensation. Conclusion: The overall conservation of ASH mediated polymodal nociception suggests that it is an ancestral evolutionarily stable feature of sensation. However, the finding that contribution from non-ASH sensory neurons mediates polymodal nociception in some nematode species suggests that even in conserved sensory behaviors, the cellular response network is dynamic over evolutionary time, perhaps shaped by adaptation of each species to its environment. ...|$|E
40|$|The age structure, {{growth rates}} and {{movements}} of M. cephalus and A forsteri in the Swan-Avon river system {{have been investigated}} using data obtained from beach seining and gill netting carried out between February 1977 and June 1980. Length-frequency data and scale readings show that the populations of both species consist predominantly of 0 + and 1 + fish. From the times when the smallest fry (20 - 30 mm) {{were present in the}} lower part of the river system, and from the condition of the gonads of older fish, the breeding seasons of the sea and yellow-eye mullets have been estimated as extending from March to September and from March to August respectively. The bimodality or <b>polymodality</b> exhibited by the length-frequency distributions for the 0 + year classes suggest that in both species groups of individuals spawn at slightly different times. The range of mean total lengths and weights of animals caught in May near the end of the first year of life was 178 - 222 mm and 64 - 119 gin M. cephalus and 136 - 154 mm and 19 - 30 g in A. forsteri, which shows that the growth of each of these two species of mullet is relatively very rapid in the Swan-Avon river system. 1 + and 2 + fish tend to leave the estuary for varying periods. Although 0 + fish of both species utilized the shallow banks of the estuary throughout the year. the sea mullet moved further upstream and were not as consistently abundant in the lower estuary. Since 0 + yellow-eye mullet 40 - 100 mm long were also abundant in marine coastal waters between January and May. and sea mullet of comparable age were rarely observed in these regions, it would appear that M. cephalus is the more estuarine-dependent of the two species. Commercial catches of M. cephalus were greater than those of A. forsteri. This feature can be related in part to the much faster growth rate of M. cephalus, which results in a larger proportion of its youngest year classes reaching the minimum legal size for capture prior to the time when they leave the estuary in large numbers...|$|E
