5|$|With {{a record}} of 40 wins and 6 losses (one through concession) in the UK Robot Wars series, Razer is {{recognised}} {{as one of the}} most successful competitors in the programme's history. It was featured on Robot Wars merchandise including a DVD and video games, and had a <b>pull-back</b> toy created in its image—one of which was later modified by Ian Lewis to function as a fully radio controllable miniature version of the team's original heavyweight machine. Razer also competed in the American television series BattleBots, winning three of its five head-to-head battles and the 1999 Gigabot Rumble. The team behind Razer later constructed a new combatant called Warhead specifically for this competition. After retirement, Razer appears in non-combat demonstrations as part of Robo Challenge educational displays and events. It returned to active combat in the 2016 revival of Robot Wars but lost in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Team Razer was {{acknowledged}} {{for having}} devised and popularised the crushing and piercing arm weapon. Razer's success spawned {{a number of}} imitations: SuicidalTendencies, Ming3 and Tiberius are amongst the other heavyweight robots to have adopted such a weapon, whilst the featherweight robot Venom is a scaled-down replica of Razer. In 2001, Razer appeared in cartoon form on the front cover of the seventeenth issue of Robot Wars Magazine. It was {{also included in the}} Robot Wars video games. The version of Razer which competed in the fourth series of Robot Wars was used as the model for a <b>pull-back</b> toy powered by friction motors. This was sold alongside a model stunt ramp and barrels. A small metal toy based on Razer was available as part of the Robot Wars minibots range and, alongside Chaos 2 and Hypno-Disc, Razer was one of three competitor robots chosen to appear on a personalised DVD as part of the Robot Wars Ultimate Warrior Collection series.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the strongest}} trends start {{in the middle of}} the day after a {{reversal}} or a break-out from a trading range. The <b>pull-backs</b> are weak and offer little chance for price action traders to enter with-trend. Price action traders or in fact any traders can enter the market in what appears to be a run-away rally or sell-off, but price action trading involves waiting for an entry point with reduced risk - <b>pull-backs,</b> or better, <b>pull-backs</b> that turn into failed trend line break-outs. The risk is that the 'run-away' trend doesn't continue, but becomes a blow-off climactic reversal where the last traders to enter in desperation end up in losing positions on the market's reversal. As stated the market often only offers seemingly weak-looking entries during strong phases but price action traders will take these rather than make indiscriminate entries. Without practice and experienceenough to recognise the weaker signals, traders will wait, even if it turns out that they miss a large move.|$|R

If Fib is the full subcategory of A(Top) consisting of arrows that are projection maps of fibre bundles, then FibS is the category of fibre bundles on S and Fib is fibred over Top. A choice of a cleavage amounts to a choice of ordinary inverse image (or <b>pull-back)</b> functors for fibre bundles.|$|E
500|$|The final scene, {{featuring}} Burt's face superimposed {{onto the}} cityscape, {{was created by}} special effects supervisor Mat Beck. The only actual footage in the scene is a <b>pull-back</b> shot of the carnival that was filmed 110 {{feet in the air}} via crane. A CGI cityscape was then created that resembled Burt Reynolds' head. The two shots were sewn together, and a blur effect was added to [...] " [...] it sell". An alternate version of the scene was created that featured Chris Carter's head instead of Reynolds'. This version was included as a bonus feature on the season nine DVD set. The score for the episode, {{like the rest of the}} series, was composed by Mark Snow. Snow based much of the music in the episode on records made by Karl Zéro, on the request of Carter.

Typical to these situations is that to a suitable type of a map f: X → Y between base spaces, there is a corresponding inverse image (also called <b>pull-back)</b> operation f* taking the considered objects defined on Y to {{the same type of}} objects on X.

40|$|The Weyl algebra A of {{continuous}} functions and exponentiated fluxes, introduced by Ashtekar, Lewandowski and others, in quantum geometry is studied. It is shown that, in the piecewise analytic category, every regular representation of A having a cyclic and diffeomorphism invariant vector, is already unitarily {{equivalent to the}} fundamental representation. Additional assumptions concern the dimension of the underlying analytic manifold (at least three), the finite wide triangulizability of surfaces in it {{to be used for}} the fluxes and the naturality of the action of diffeomorphisms – but neither any domain properties of the represented Weyl operators nor the requirement that the diffeomorphisms act by <b>pull-backs.</b> For this, the general behaviour of C ∗-algebras generated by continuous functions and <b>pull-backs</b> of homeomorphisms, as well as the properties of stratified analytic diffeomorphisms are studied.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} Frequency domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) in guiding stent implantation procedures. Methods: Dragonfly™-imaging catheter was used pre-intervention, after pre-dilatation or at various stages of stent deployment/post-dilatation to assess lesion severity, characteristics and guide stent expansion/apposition. Results: We performed 398 OCT <b>pull-backs</b> in 108 consecutive patients. The 371 <b>pull-backs</b> analysable, had an average length of 35 mm and encompassed 193 lesions (1. 8 lesions per patient). Seventy-six percent of patient had AHA-ACC-class B-C lesions. In the pre-intervention group deferral of treatment was decided for 13 / 68 pullbacks (19. 1 %), whereas strategies different from conventional predilatation (e. g. thrombectomy, rotablator, cutting-balloon) were decided in 23 cases (33. 8 %). After full lesion dilatation 96 pullbacks (25. 9 %, pre-stenting group) were performed, 46 (47. 9 %) of which suggested proceeding directly with stenting while 50 (52. 1 %) suggesting further treatment. Out of the 207 pullbacks in post-stenting group, 29 (14 %) suggested new stent implantation because of dissection or residual stenosis; 64 (30. 9 %) suggested further optimization with high pressure/larger-sized balloon. Average number of <b>pull-backs</b> per patient was 3. 4 requiring 75. 8 ± 19. 3 ml of iopamidol. No major complications were observed. Five cases (4. 6 %) of contrast-induced nephropathy were reported. Conclusions: Repeated examinations with FD-OCT can be safely used to guide stent selection and improve stent expansion and apposition. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} multi-stage {{train formation}} with mixed usage tracks at a marshalling yard without departure yard. A novel integer programming model for scheduling shunting tasks {{as well as}} allocating arrival yard tracks and classification bowl tracks is presented. By taking a comprehensive view of the marshalling yard operations, more effective schedules can be found, {{and a variety of}} characteristics can be optimised, including shunting work effort, number or cost of tracks, and shunting task start times. Two different objective functions are evaluated: minimising work effort in terms of wagon <b>pull-backs</b> and minimising track costs. A procedure for finding a hot-start solution with few wagon <b>pull-backs</b> is also presented. The proposed model is tested on real data from Sävenäs marshalling yard in Sweden. The results show that the method is able to return an optimal schedule for a planning period of 4 days if the hot-start solution is optimal or the remaining problem is tractable for the heuristics in CPLEX. ...|$|R
