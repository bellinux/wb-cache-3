5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E
5|$|Later work by Wolfram {{identifies}} the one-dimensional Rule 37R automaton as being <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> in this respect. When {{run on a}} finite array of cells with periodic boundary conditions, starting from a small seed of random cells centered within a larger empty neighborhood, it tends to fluctuate between ordered and chaotic states. However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E

5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at solid material surfaces. The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest-neighbor jumps. Tunneling diffusion is a <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect.|$|E
5|$|Member states remain optimistic of {{the union}} and key {{partners}} in the region, namely China, Iran, Turkey remain interested in it. A common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential {{over the next two}} decades, with experts predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion. The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative policies are <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E

One <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> fish is the mudskipper, a gobioid that {{climbs out of the}} water into mudflats and even climbs trees.|$|E

The town is known unofficially {{as one of}} the wettest places on earth, with an average annual rainfall of 8 metres per annum, and a peak rainfall of 10 metres per annum.

50|$|The {{changes were}} sparked by {{observations}} that lymphopoiesis {{did not always}} break into two lineages {{at the level of}} the CLP. Worse, some macrophages (long considered a myeloid lineage) could be generated by lymphoid lineage progenitors. In essence focus has been shifted away from the CLP to the MLP (lymphoid-specified progenitors), which are clearly lymphoid progenitors yet retain some myeloid potential, <b>particularly</b> the <b>interesting</b> ability in both man and mouse to make macrophages - one of the most versatile of immune cell defenders - and also many dendritic cells, the best 'watchdogs' of antigen invaders.|$|R

25|$|Consider a link L in M, {{which is}} a {{collection}} of l disjoint loops. A <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> observable is the l-point correlation function formed from the product of the Wilson loops around each disjoint loop, each traced in the fundamental representation of G.

25|$|In human SOD {{the active}} metal is copper, as Cu(II) or Cu(I), coordinated tetrahedrally by four {{histidine}} residues. This enzyme also contains zinc ions for stabilization and is activated by copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS). Other isozymes may contain iron, manganese or nickel. Ni-SOD is <b>particularly</b> <b>interesting</b> as it involves nickel(III), an unusual oxidation state for this element. The active site nickel geometry cycles from square planar Ni(II), with thiolate (Cys2 and Cys6) and backbone nitrogen (His1 and Cys2) ligands, to square pyramidal Ni(III) with an added axial His1 side chain ligand.|$|E

30|$|We can {{intuitively}} {{see that}} {{if only one}} neuron, neuron n, has a high characteristic variance, then it acts like the single-neuron integrator as g_[n] approaches N, and neuron n dominates the global feedback signal. This scenario is not <b>particularly</b> biophysically <b>interesting.</b> However, if many neurons have high characteristic variance, then no individual neuron will dominate the feedback signal. In the special case that all neuron parameters are identical, a symmetry argument shows that g_[n] will be close to 1 for all n—no single synapse {{is strong enough to}} make a single neuron an integrator, but the fluctuations in network firing rate cause correlated fluctuations in the individual firing rates, which collectively reinforce the network rate fluctuations, causing the network as a whole act as an integrator.|$|R
