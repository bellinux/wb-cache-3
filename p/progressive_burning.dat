25|$|Orders from {{countries}} fighting World War I required determining charges for different European military rifle cartridges, and production volume supported research for improvements. Improved military rifle propellants included a longitudinal perforation converting each grain to a tube with a <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> interior surface allowing a more consistent gas generation rate through the reaction period. Early propellants {{were identified by}} a two-digit number. As the number of experimental variations increased, each improved military rifle propellant was identified by a four-digit number. In addition to the canisters available from DuPont, the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM) sold surplus improved military rifle propellants {{to members of the}} National Rifle Association. By 1936 improved DuPont process control produced batches conforming to published reloading data rather than requiring different charge specifications for each batch; and those propellants have remained in production. Non-conforming batches were used to load commercial and military cartridges following traditional testing procedures.|$|E

5000|$|Flake powders are in {{the form}} of flat, round flakes which have a {{relatively}} high surface-area-to-volume ratio. Flake powders have a nearly constant rate of burn, and are usually formulated as fast pistol or shotgun powders. The last common shape is an extruded powder, which is {{in the form of}} a cylinder, sometimes hollow. Extruded powders generally have a lower ratio of nitroglycerin to nitrocellulose, and are often <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> [...] - [...] that is, they burn at a faster rate as they burn. Extruded powders are generally medium to slow rifle powders.|$|E
40|$|A 63 year-old woman {{presented}} with a persistent, red, papular, itching skin eruption localised on the face, right shoulder and the right upper member. The evolution was longer than ten years with a permanent <b>progressive</b> diffuse facial <b>burning</b> sensation and unaesthetic aspect despite topical antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatments. The clinical and the histological diagnosis corresponded to prurigo. She was treated by omeprazole for gastric reflux since more than ten years, {{and she had a}} viral C hepatitis. The relationship between prurigo and omeprazole was evidenced by the complete resolution of symptoms after the drug’s interruption and the recurrence after the omeprazole re-introduction. The immediate and late skin tests were negative for the tested drugs. Clinical cross-reactivity was observed with pantoprazole and lansoprazole; this suggested a late hypersensitivity to drugs of the proton pump inhibitors class. To our knowledge, it is the first case of prurigo induced by these drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} transformations undergone by lignocellulosic biomass (freeze-dried rye grass, Lolium rigidum) {{subjected to}} <b>progressive</b> isothermal heating (<b>burning</b> at 350 °C under oxidizing conditions for 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 s) have been monitored by Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatographymass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). The pyrograms suggest that even charred residues after severe heating (carbon loss ca. 50 %) still contain substantial concentrations of some resistant plant structural components. Several trends were observed when monitoring the relative concentrations {{of the different}} groups of pyrolysis compounds released during successive charring stages: (i) the tetrapyrrole moiety of chlorophylls is rapidly destroyed {{as indicated by the}} decreasing yields of pyrroles and pyrrolines, whereas the phytol backbone is comparatively more resistant, leading to phytadienes after dehydration and reduction; (ii) the increasing yields of imidazoles from progressively heated samples (maximum at 45 s stage) suggest accumulation of newly formed nitrogen-containing compounds that may survive natural fires; (iii) the lignin backbone shows a relative resistance, the yields of aromatic products pointing to progressive demethoxylation; and, (iv) a selective accumulation of recalcitrant alkyl material occurred, which is interpreted as the result of thermal condensation of hydrocarbons and fatty acids into macromolecular materials in the charred residue. In terms of the intensity of the isothermal heating, the yields of the different classes of alkyl compounds follow the order phytadienes < fatty acids < alkanes < wax esters < sterols.

5000|$|John Olin, {{the son of}} founder Franklin W. Olin, {{improved}} shotgun cartridge {{designs in}} the 1920s by using harder shot and <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> powder. Western produced 3 billion rounds of ammunition in World War II, and the Winchester subsidiary developed the U.S. M1 carbine and produced the carbine and the M1 rifle during the war. Western ranked 35th among United States corporations {{in the value of}} wartime production contracts. Cartridges made by Western are stamped WCC. Western Cartridge Company produced the now collectible [...] "Western Xpert" [...] brand of shotgun shells in both 12 and 16 gauge sizes.|$|E
5000|$|Primer {{actuated}} firearms use {{the energy}} of primer setback to unlock and cycle the firearm. John Garand developed the system in an unsuccessful bid to replace the M1903 bolt-action rifle in the early 1920s. Garand's prototypes worked well with US military [...]30-06 ammunition and uncrimped primers, but then the military changed from a fast burning gunpowder to a <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> Improved Military Rifle (IMR) powder. The slower pressure rise made the primer actuated prototypes unreliable, so Garand abandoned the design for a gas operated rifle that became the M1 Garand. AAI Corporation used a primer piston in a rifle submitted for the SPIW competition. Other rifles to use this system were the Postnikov APT and Clarke carbine as described in [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a {{solid propellant rocket engine}} with a controlled rate of thrust buildup to a desired thrust level are discussed. The engine uses a regressive burning controlled flow solid propellant igniter and a <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> main solid propellant charge. The igniter is capable of operating in a vacuum and sustains the burning of the propellant below its normal combustion limit until the burning propellant surface and combustion chamber pressure have increased sufficiently to provide a stable chamber pressure...|$|E
40|$|A 55 -year-old {{woman on}} {{treatment}} with capecitabine and paclitaxel for breast carcinoma presented with {{history of a}} tingling sensation {{in her hands and}} feet with a <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> sensation. She also noted discomfort, minimal pain and stiffness while holding objects. On examination, there was patchy hyperpigmentation of both the palms and soles, and the dorsa of hands and feet. This was accompanied by a thickening of the skin more over the knuckles and toes. In addition there was a moist desquamation around the toes and over the palmar creases and a bluish discoloration of the lunulae of both thumbnails. She was diagnosed with hand and foot syndrome and started on pyridoxine and emollients. The finding of keratoderma noted in our patient is not seen commonly in hand and foot syndrome...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{investigation}} of the burning of grain-molded propellant comprises <b>progressive</b> <b>burning,</b> ignition and internal ballistic property. The grain-molded propellant is extruded by high energy nitramine propellant in the professional mould. The grain-molded propellant was studied by closed-bomb test, ignition simulation equipment test and 30 mm simulation gun test. The characteristics of p-t and L-B curves were analyzed for different density of grain-molded propellant. The influence law of density on the burning property of the grain-molded propellant was obtained. The {{results show that the}} bigger the density of the grain-molded propellant is, the better its progressivity is. And the progressivity of sample 3 is the best, whose density is 1. 25 g•cm- 3. The muzzle velocity of sample 3 increases 5. 3 % than that of high energy nitramine propellant...|$|E
40|$|In this article, an {{enhanced}} flame spread model {{is used to}} simulate a rail car compartment fire test. The model {{was found to be}} able to reproduce the following experiential results: the predicted <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> locations are consistent with the experimental record; the predicted temperatures and heat fluxes at various locations essentially follow the measured trends; and the predicted onset of flashover is within 9 % of the measured time of 180 s. The sensitivity of the predicted time to flashover is assessed using 18 fire scenarios in which the uncertainties in the measured material properties are systematically examined. The time to flashover is found to be most sensitive to changes in seat material properties. For the investigated rail car compartment, the impact of porosity of the overhead luggage rack structure on time to flashover is also examined and found to be significant for small ignition source fires...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a solid-propellant rocket igniter system that would build up thrust at a controlled rate of less than 0. 2 G/sec. The system consisted of a long burning, regressive burning, controlled flow igniter and an inhibited <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> surface in the main rocket motor. The igniter performed the dual role of igniting, under vacuum backpressure and low L* (motor free volume/nozzle throat area ratio) conditions, the nonrestricted portion of the propellant and providing the mass addition necessary to sustain combustion until the propellant burning area had increased sufficiently to provide a stable motor-chamber pressure. Two series of tests were conducted with existing small test motor hardware to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, (2) determine the important parameters governing the system, and (3) obtain design guidelines for future scaled-up motor tests. A quasi-steady-state mass balance for the ignition system was written and programmed for use as a motor design tool...|$|E
40|$|Rhabdophis tigrinus is {{a common}} {{colubrid}} snake {{that can be found}} in an extensive geographical region in East Asia. It consists of two subspecies: R. t. tigrinus (yamakagashi) and R. t. formosanus (Taiwan tiger keelback). R. tigrinus possesses two different sets of poisonous glands: the Duvernoy's glands in the maxilla, and the nuchal glands in the dorsal skin of the neck. We report the first case in current English literature of toxin ophthalmia caused by the nuchal gland secretion of R. t. formosanus. The patient was a 40 -year-old man whose right eye was sprayed by the nuchal gland fluid of R. t. formosanus. He presented with symptoms of foreign body sensation, <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> pain, and blurred vision. Ophthalmologic examination revealed diffuse superficial punctate keratitis, corneal stromal edema with Descemet folds, and conjunctival congestion. The patient responded well to topical treatment with a corticosteroid, antihistamine, and antibiotic, and had a favorable clinical course and outcome...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{changes in}} {{lignocellulosic}} biomass heated under conditions {{comparable to those}} encountered in several types of natural or planned burnings have been studied by solid-state 13 C- and 15 N-CPMAS NMR spectroscopy of 15 N-enriched ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) after being subjected to progressive thermal treatment. The solid-state 15 N-NMR spectra of biomass subjected to severe heating revealed amide-N in forms which are resistant to the thermal treatment. <b>Progressive</b> <b>burning</b> was found to occur in two well-defined stages: In the early stage the free amino acid and some NH 2 groups were removed, but no substantial disruption of the peptide structure was observed. In {{the final stage of}} burning the amide-N was converted to heterocyclic structures such as pyrroles, imidazoles and indoles. Some evidence for the presence of pyridines and phenazines was also found at this stage. These findings suggest that a major portion of the N is in forms that may survive most natural fires and that their stability towards further microbial degradation is increased by the heating. The solid-state 13 C-NMR spectra revealed that the carbohydrate fraction is converted into condensed dehydrated material producing intense signals in the aromatic region. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A 44 -year-old {{woman had}} <b>progressive</b> <b>burning</b> parasthesias and sensory loss in both {{upper and lower}} limbs, {{followed}} by weakness of distal muscles of the hands and feet for four years. She had redness and swelling of both hands and feet, multiple painless ulcers over the dorsum of the fingers (Figure 1 A) and feet (Figure 1 B), and thickened, non-tender, bilateral, ulnar, superficial cutaneous branch of radial and common peroneal nerves. She also had pre-dominant small fiber sensory polyneuropathy in a glove and stocking pattern, intrinsic muscle weakness of the hands and feet, and intact deep tendon reflexes. Results of hema-tologic and biochemical tests were within references ranges. Tests results for vasculitis and viral markers were negative. A nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical predomi-nantly axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (Figure 3) and absent waveforms on sympathetic skin response testing on both upper and lower limbs. A split skin smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli by Ziehl-Nielsen staining (Figure 2 A, B). A skin biopsy from the leg showed dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, nerve twig inflammation, and posi-tive staining for lepra bacilli. Glove and stocking sensory loss in lepromatous leprosy is caused by involvement of small dermal sensory and auto-nomic nerve fibers, 1 whereas non-trophic ulcers are caused by cutaneous vasculitis and small fiber involvement by lepra bacilli. 1, 2 The patient was given a multi-bacillary regimen 2 (dapsone, 100 mg/day; rifampicin, 600 mg/day; and clofazimine, 50 mg/day) and showed symptomatic healing of cutaneous ulcers and reduction of burning paraesthesias at two-months follow-up...|$|E
