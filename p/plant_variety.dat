500|$|A {{number of}} Amici Curiae also filed briefs {{on behalf of}} the parties. For example, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, arguing on behalf of Monsanto, wrote that [...] "xhaustion of the right to control {{propagation}} of patented seed would disrupt the balance created by Congress between the Patent Act and the <b>Plant</b> <b>Variety</b> Protection Act." [...] The American Seed Trade Association, also arguing on behalf of Monsanto, wrote that [...] "atented seed technology benefits farmers, consumers and the environment". The National Farmers Union, arguing on behalf of Bowman, wrote that [...] " [...] patent exhaustion exception for self-replicating technologies is inconsistent with this Court’s precedent and the competition policies reflected in the first-sale doctrine", and the Center for Food Safety wrote that [...] "arming is not genetic engineering".|$|E

2500|$|J.E.M. {{responded that}} Pioneer’s patents that purport to confer {{protection}} for corn plants are invalid because sexually reproducing plants are not {{patentable subject matter}} {{within the scope of}} 35 U.S.C. § 101 [...] J.E.M. maintained that the <b>Plant</b> <b>Variety</b> Protection Act (PVPA) (and perhaps also the Plant Patent Act of 1930 (PPA)) and set forth the exclusive statutory means for the protection of complex plant life. J.E.M. argued that these statutes are more specific than § 101, and thus carve out subject matter from § 101 for special treatment. J.E.M. said that awarding utility patents for plants upsets the scheme of protection contemplated by Congress. Part of that scheme is that the PVPA provides exemptions for farmers to save seed from their crops for planting subsequent crops. Utility patents do not contain such exemptions.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Considering ways {{to solve}} {{issues related to}} soil cover study at the {{institutions}} for <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> examination. Methods. Fieldandanalytical ones. Results. Issues are identified that arise during soil sampling at institutions for <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> examination within the state system of <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> protection. The author considered in detail the current soil sampling techniques for agrochemical tes­ting for humus, nitrogen (compounds to be easily hydrolyzed), mobile P 2 O 5, exchangeable K 2 O, hydrolytic acidity and others. Attention was paid to violation of methodological requirements concerning the time of soil sampling and number of samples for agrochemical testing at the experimental field, {{to the lack of}} devices for meteorological observation and appliances for soil and leaf diagnostics. The article also touches upon the issues associated with the study of soil cover at fields with scientifically-based crop rotation that belong to institutions for <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> examination within the state system of <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> protection. Conclusions. It should be necessary to follow recommended practice when sampling at elementary sites for agrochemical testing and performing all operations in accordance with crop cultivation flowcharts. General recommendations for agrochemical testing of fields in case of conventional crop rotations in farms are not suitable for fields with scientifically-based crop rotations at institutions for <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> examination...|$|R
