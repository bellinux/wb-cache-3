2500|$|GTN {{is useful}} in {{decreasing}} angina attacks, perhaps more so than reversing angina once started, by supplementing blood concentrations of NO, also called endothelium-derived relaxing factor, before the structure of NO as the responsible agent was known. This {{led to the development}} of transdermal patches of glyceryl trinitrate, providing 24-hour release. However, the [...] effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate is limited by development of tolerance/tachyphylaxis within 2–3 weeks of sustained use. Continuous administration and absorption (such as provided by daily pills and especially skin patches) accelerate onset of tolerance and limit the usefulness of the agent. Thus, glyceryl trinitrate works best when used only in short-term, pulse dosing. Glyceryl trinitrate is useful for acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and pulmonary edema, again working best if used quickly, within a few minutes of symptom onset, as a <b>pulse</b> <b>dose.</b> It may also be given as a sublingual or buccal dose in the form of a tablet placed under the tongue or a spray into the mouth for the treatment of an angina attack.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{antidepressant}} effect of a single <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> of intravenous clomipramine (200 mg i. v.) followed by oral administration as an alternative method to electroconvulsive therapy. Methods: Twenty-one inpatients (8 male, 13 female) with major depression were included. Depression severity was measured by Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) and Clinical Global Impression severity scale (CGI-S) before the <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> and 1 week after. The day after the <b>pulse</b> <b>dose,</b> the patient was medicated with 75 mg of oral clomipramine and from day two with 150 mg clomipramine daily. Results: The MADRS score dropped with 39 % ± 22 % and the CGI score with 28 % ± 19 % in one week. The improvement of the MADRS score after one week was 13. 1 (C. I. 9. 5 - 17. 0). CGI-ratings dropped from a mean of 5. 5 (SD 1. 2) to 3. 9 (SD 1. 1), an improvement of 28 % ± 19 %. (C. I. 1. 0 - 2. 1). Both improvements were significant (p< 000. 1).

40|$|Objective: The {{pulmonary}} vascular targeted {{treatment for}} systemic lupus erythematosus–associated {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} is similar to other connective tissue disease–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, there {{also appears to be}} a role for immunosuppression in the overall management. However, the optimal immunosuppressive regimen and what patients will respond to treatments are currently not clearly elucidated given the lack of randomized controlled trials on the subject. Our objective is to highlight the importance of early immunosuppression in systemic lupus erythematosus–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension and the role of <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> steroids in management. Methods: This case describes a 23 -year-old woman who presented with pulmonary arterial hypertension diagnosed by right heart catheterization with mean pulmonary artery pressure of 74 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mmHg, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 1908 dyne s cm− 5. Due to the aggressive nature of her disease, she declined despite management with epoprostenol and sildenafil. Because of coexisting systemic lupus erythematosus with hemolytic anemia and worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension, intensive immunosuppressive therapy with <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> steroids was initiated. Results: Shortly after initiation of <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> steroids and maintenance immunosuppression, she had a dramatic symptomatic and hemodynamic response with a decrease in her pulmonary vascular resistance from 1908 to 136 dyne sec cm− 5 and improvement in her mean pulmonary artery pressure from 74 to 27 mmHg on repeat right heart catheterization. Conclusion: Early immunosuppression is important to consider in those with systemic lupus erythematosus–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension. Limited studies are available, but most have focused on the use of cyclophosphamide. <b>Pulse</b> <b>dose</b> steroids may be a potentially less toxic but equally effective manner to aid in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus–pulmonary arterial hypertension when intensive immunosuppression is being considered...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{majority}} of Lyme disease patients can be cured, at least 10 - 20 % of the patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms such as fatigue, muscular and joint pain, and neurologic impairment after standard 2 - 4 week antibiotic treatment. While the causes for this post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms are unclear, one possibility is due to B. burgdorferi persisters that are not effectively killed by current antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin used to treat Lyme disease. A previous study showed that four rounds of ceftriaxone <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> treatment eradicated B. burgdorferi persisters in vitro using a relatively young late log phase culture (5 day old). In this study, we investigated if ceftriaxone <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> could also eradicate B. burgdorferi persisters in older stationary phase cultures (10 day old) enriched with more resistant microcolony form of persisters. We found that ceftriaxone <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> could only eradicate planktonic log phase B. burgdorferi spirochetal forms and round body forms but not more resistant aggregated biofilm-like microcolony persisters enriched in stationary phase cultures. Moreover, we found that not all drugs are suitable for <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing,</b> with bactericidal drugs ceftriaxone and cefuroxime being more appropriate for <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> than bacteriostatic drug doxycycline and persister drug daptomycin. We also showed that drug combination <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> treatment was more effective than single drug <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing.</b> Importantly, we demonstrate that <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> treatment impaired {{the activity of the}} persister drug daptomycin and its drug combination against B. burgdorferi persisters and that {{the most effective way to}} kill the more resistant biofilm-like microcolonies is the daptomycin/doxycycline/ceftriaxone triple drug combination without <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing.</b> Our findings indicate <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> may not always work as a general principle but rather depends on the specific drugs used, with cidal drugs being more appropriate for <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> than static or persister drugs, and that drug combination approach with persister drugs is more effective at killing the more resistant microcolony form of persisters than <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing.</b> These observations may have implications for more effective treatment of Lyme disease.

This study compares standard thrice-daily <b>dosing</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> of metronidazole against Bacteroides spp. in an in vitro model. Two American Type Culture Collection Bacteroides fragilis isolates (metronidazole MIC for each organism = 1 mg/liter) were exposed to metronidazole for 48 or 96 h. Human pharmacokinetics were simulated for an oral 500 -mg dose given every 8 h (maximum concentration of drug [Cmax] = 12 mg/liter; half-life = 8 h; area under the curve [AUC] = 294 mg[*]·[*]h/liter) and for <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing.</b> <b>Pulses,</b> each producing an increase in metronidazole concentration of 9 mg/liter, were administered at times 0, 2, 4, and 6 h of each 24 -h cycle, with a targeted half-life of 8 h (AUC = 347 mg[*]·[*]h/liter). A metronidazole-resistant B. fragilis strain (metronidazole MIC = 32 mg/liter) was exposed to both dosing regimens and, additionally, to a regimen of 1, 500 mg administered once daily (Cmax = 36 mg/liter; AUC = 364 mg[*]·[*]h/liter). Furthermore, regimens against one B. fragilis isolate and one B. thetaiotaomicron isolate corresponding to one-fourth and one-eighth of the thrice-daily and <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> regimens, mimicking peak metronidazole concentrations achieved in abscesses, were simulated in 48 -h experiments (metronidazole MIC = 1 mg/liter). Time-kill curves were generated for each experiment and analyzed for bactericidal activity, defined as a bacterial burden reduction ≥ 3 log 10 CFU/ml. The results of paired (Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test) and nonpaired (Mann-Whitney test) statistical analyses conducted on time to 3 log 10 kill data and area under the kill curve data {{from each of the}} thrice-daily dosing experiments versus each of the <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> experiments were considered not significant for a given isolate-dosing regimen combination.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sinus {{bradycardia}} {{has been}} reported after administration of <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> steroids, although most cases have occurred in children and are asymptomatic. We report a case of acute symptomatic sinus bradycardia due to <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> steroids in a woman with multiple sclerosis. Interestingly, this patient also suffered from inappropriate sinus tachycardia due to autonomic involvement of multiple sclerosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48 -year-old Caucasian woman with multiple sclerosis and chronic palpitations due to inappropriate sinus tachycardia was prescribed a 5 -day course of intravenous methylprednisolone for treatment of an acute flare. Immediately following the fourth dose of intravenous methylprednisolone, she developed dyspnea, chest heaviness, and lightheadedness. She was referred to the emergency department where an electrocardiogram showed marked sinus bradycardia (40 beats per minute). Initial laboratory test results, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic profile and cardiac biomarkers, were normal. She was admitted for observation on telemetry monitoring. Her heart rate gradually increased and her symptoms resolved. Her outpatient dose of atenolol, taken for symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia, was resumed. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient 2 ̆ 7 s acute symptoms were attributed to symptomatic sinus bradycardia due to <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> steroid treatment. Although several theories have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, the exact mechanism still remains unknown. It does not warrant any specific treatment, {{as it is a}} self-limiting side effect that resolves after discontinuing steroid infusion.

Five ruminally cannulated steers were fitted with abomasal infusion lines that were inserted through their ruminal cannulas. There were 5 treatments, a control (CON) of only water, a single <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> of 1 g/kg of oligofructose (OL 1) or starch (ST 1) or 4 staggered doses of 0. 25 g/kg of oligofructose (OL 4) or starch (ST 4) administered every 6 h.

In the second phase,the equivalent dose in 2 Gy/fraction (EQD 2) for the tumor, rectum and bladder in treatments performed with both techniqueswas evaluated and statistically compared. All evaluated patients had stage IIB cervical cancer and were treatedwith External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) plus two Brachytherapy (BT) applications. Data were collected from 48 patients(26 patients treated with LDR and 22 patients with PDR). Results: In the analyses of the influence of PDR parameters in the biological equivalence between LDR and PDRtreatments (Phase 1), it was calculated that if the <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> in PDR was kept equal to the LDR dose rate, a small therapeuticloss was expected. If the <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> was decreased, the therapeutic window became larger, but a correction inthe prescribed dose was necessary. In PDR schemes with 1 hour interval between pulses, the pulse time did not influencesignificantly the equivalent dose. In the comparison between the groups treated with LDR and PDR (Phase 2) weconcluded that they were not equivalent, because in the PDR group the total EQD 2 for the tumor, rectum and bladderwas smaller than in the LDR group; the LQM estimated that a correction in the prescribed dose of 6 % to 10 % was ne -cessary to avoid therapeutic loss. Conclusions: A correction in the prescribed dose was necessary; this correction should be achieved by calculatingthe PDR dose equivalent to the desired LDR total dose...|$|E

The pharmacokinetics of terbinafine favors its efficacy in <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing.</b> Objectives: To compare the efficacy of terbinafine in continuous and <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> schedules {{in the treatment of}} toenail dermatophytosis. Methods: Seventy-six patients of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and culture positive dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis were randomly allocated to two treatment groups receiving either continuous terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks or 3 pulses of terbinafine (each of 500 mg daily for a week) repeated every 4 weeks. Patients were followed up at 4, 8 and 12 weeks during treatment and post-treatment at 24 weeks. At each visit, a KOH mount and culture were performed. In each patient, improvement in a target nail was assessed using a clinical score; total scores for all nails and global assessments by physician and patient were also recorded. Mycological, clinical and complete cure rates, clinical effectivity and treatment failure rates were then compared. Results: The declines in target nail and total scores from baseline were significant at each follow-up visit in both the treatment groups. However, the inter-group difference was statistically insignificant. The same was true for global assessment indices, clinical effectivity as well as clinical, mycological, and complete cure rates.

40|$|Alterations in the {{frequency}} of calcium influx signals to rat pituitary cells can regulate the expression of gonadotropin sub-unit mRNAs in a differential manner, producing effects that are similar to those previously found for GnRH. The present study was conducted to investigate whether this reflects a transcrip-tional response to calcium pulse frequency, as determined by alterations in primary transcript (PT) expression. Perifused rat pituitary cells were given pulses of the calcium channel-activa-tor Bay K 8644 (BK; with 10 mM KCl in the injectate) for 6 h. The response to alterations in <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> was examined by giving pulses of 1, 3, or 10 mM BK at 60 -min intervals. Maximal in-creases in LHb and FSHb PTs were obtained with the 3 -mM BK <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> and with the 10 -mM dose for a. To investigate the effect of calcium pulse frequency, 3 -mM BK pulses were given at intervals of 15, 60, or 180 min. Alpha PT was selectively stim-ulated by 15 -min pulses and LHb by 15 - and 60 -min pulses of BK. In contrast, FSHb PT was maximally stimulated by the slow-er, 180 -min pulse interval. These findings reveal that pulsatile increases in intracellular calcium stimulate a, LHb, and FSHb transcription in a differential manner. Thus, intermittent changes in intracellular calcium appear to be important in the transmis-sion of GnRH pulse signals from the plasma membrane to the gene, and they may mediate the differential actions of pulse frequency on gonadotropin subunit gene expression. calcium, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, mechanisms of hor-mone action, pituitary hormones, signal transductio...|$|E

Given that antibiotic resistance has not been observed for B. burgdorferi, {{the reason for the}} recalcitrance of late-stage disease to antibiotics is unclear. In other chronic infections, the presence of drug-tolerant persisters has been linked to recalcitrance of the disease. In this study, we examined the ability of B. burgdorferi to form persisters. Killing growing cultures of B. burgdorferi with antibiotics used to treat the disease was distinctly biphasic, with a small subpopulation of surviving cells. Upon regrowth, these cells formed a new subpopulation of antibiotic-tolerant cells, indicating that these are persisters rather than resistant mutants. The level of persist-ers increased sharply as the culture transitioned from the exponential to stationary phase. Combinations of antibiotics did not improve killing. Daptomycin, a membrane-active bactericidal antibiotic, killed stationary-phase cells but not persisters. Mito-mycin C, an anticancer agent that forms adducts with DNA, killed persisters and eradicated growing and stationary cultures of B. burgdorferi. Finally, we examined the ability of <b>pulse</b> <b>dosing</b> an antibiotic to eliminate persisters. After addition of ceftriax-one, the antibiotic was washed away, surviving persisters were allowed to resuscitate, and the antibiotic was added again. Four <b>pulse</b> <b>doses</b> of ceftriaxone killed persisters, eradicating all live bacteria in the culture. All pathogens studied to date form persisters, dormant variantsof regular cells which are tolerant to killing by antibiotics. Th...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pulsed</b> <b>dose</b> rate (PDR) {{brachytherapy}} is {{a treatment}} modality that combines physical advantages of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy with the radiobiological advantages of low dose rate brachytherapy. The {{aim of this}} review was to describe the effective clinical use of PDR brachytherapy worldwide in different tumour locations. We found 66 articles reporting on clinical PDR brachytherapy including the treatment procedure and outcome. Moreover, PDR brachytherapy has been applied in almost all tumour sites for which brachytherapy is indicated and with good local control and low toxicity. The main advantage of PDR is, {{because of the small}} pulse sizes used, the ability to spare normal tissue. In certain cases, HDR resembles PDR brachytherapy by the use of multifractionated low-fraction dos...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} conducted: (1) develop forage intake models for {{lactating}} cows with different milk production; and (2) investigate methods of administering Ytterbium (Yb) {{as a marker}} to estimate fecal output of confined and grazing animals. In the first study, 24 beef cows, eight from each production level (low, L; medium, M; and high, H) were grouped in pairs based on similar past performance and used in two 42 -d feeding trials (early and late lactation) to measure ad libitum intake of chopped Sandhills meadow hay. Daily dry matter intake and milk consumption had a positive linear relationship (P 3 ̆c. 05) among L, M and H cows during both trials. Intake expressed as g/unit body weight had a positive linear (P 3 ̆c. 05) and quadratic (P 3 ̆c. 01) relationship. ^ Three experiments conducted in the second study used grazing and penned animals to measure accuracy and precision of six methods of administering Yb for estimating fecal output. All animals were fitted with fecal collection bags and a paired difference test was conducted to determine differences between estimated and measured fecal output. Methods within an experiment were compared using estimated deviation from measured output (absolute value) in a one way analysis of variance. Confined sheep in Experiment 1, were orally dosed with either a <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> (P) or a once daily dose (C). Both method over estimated fecal output, however, the standard error for C was. 78 compared to 2. 17 for P. In Experiment 2, a cross-over design {{was used to compare}} output estimates by <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> (PR) and once daily dosing (CP) via rumen cannulas in steers grazing dormant forage. Although both methods were relatively accurate CR had a lower standard error (2. 36) than PR (3. 64).

40|$|Gressley, Tanya F. This study {{consisted}} of three experiments to evaluate the bioavailability of mineral supplements. The aim of Experiment 1 {{was to determine the}} bioavailability of the organic forms of copper (2 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl-thiobutyrate; HMTBa Cu) and zinc (HMTBa Zn) when administered abomasally. Experiment 2 was performed to determine the bioavailability of two organic forms and one inorganic form of Zn administered abomasally, and measure neutrophil phagocytic ability and L-selectin mRNA. Experiment 3 determined the bioavailability of the same forms of organic zinc and ZnSO 4 administered via ruminal infusion. In all experiments, 4 ruminally cannulated Holstein steers, were assigned to a 4 × 4 Latin square design where each period {{consisted of}} 6 d rest and 1 d of treatment. Diets consisted of only alfalfa silage and corn silage to minimize dietary Cu and Zn. Jugular catheters were inserted 24 h prior to treatment and blood samples were taken from 0 to 12 h post treatment (Exp. 1) and 0 to 24 hours post treatment (Exp. 2 and 3). Additional blood samples were taken at 0 and 9 h in Experiment 2 for neutrophil measurements. In Experiment 1, a <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> of 4 g HMTBa Cu, raised plasma Cu from 0. 5 - 1. 5 h following infusion but decreased dry matter intake (DMI). A <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> of 8 g HMTBa Zn increased plasma Zn from 1 - 12 h but also decreased DMI whereas 4 g caused an increase in plasma Zn with no side effects. In Experiment 2, both ZnSO 4 and HMTBa Zn increased plasma Zn at 1 - 8 h and 1. 5 - 7 h respectively. There were no differences found in neutrophil phagocytosis or L-selectin mRNA level. The organic forms of HMTBa Zn and AA-Zn increased plasma Zn at 8, 9, 12, - 16 and 24 h and 8, 9, 12 - 16 and 24 h respectively over the control in Experiment 3. The ZnSO 4 increased plasma levels at 9, 13, 16 and 24 h. The results of these experiments provide evidence to support an increase the respective plasma concentrations with Cu or Zn supplementation and an equal bioavailability of both organic and inorganic Zn.

Past history {{revealed}} treatment with <b>pulse</b> <b>dose</b> of intravenous steroids followed by oral steroids at 1  mg/kg body weight, dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex, Allergan), and co-trimoxazole for presumed ocular toxoplasmosis. This long-term use of systemic steroids {{at a high}} dosage leads to an immunosuppressed state thereby leading to a disseminated form of infection. Past investigations like complete hemogram, VDRL, HIV, HBsAg, Toxo IgG /IgM, and Mantoux test were normal. At our center, examination by internist revealed normal examination except for erythematous area with small pustule on the sternal aspect of chest. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of chest showed loculated pericardial effusion in anterior part along with small foci of subsegmental collapse and bronchiectasis in the left upper lobe, paracardiac part of the right medial lobe and left lingual along with few subcentimeter lymph nodes in the right paratracheal chain. Sternal pus sample was drawn which showed acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on Ziehl-Neelsen staining, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was detected by gene expert.|$|E
