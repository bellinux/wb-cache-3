The processes of boiling heat transfer in the <b>porous</b> corrosion <b>deposits</b> typically involve phase changes in finite volumetric regions in the porous media. The study examined such processes in two porous media configurations, without chimneys (homogeneous porous structures) and with chimneys (heterogeneous porous structures). A 1 -D model and a 2 -D model were developed to simulate two-phase flows with phase changes, without dry-out, inside the porous media for both structural configurations. For closure of the governing equations, an empirical correlation of the evaporation rate for phase changes inside the porous media was introduced. In addition, numerical algorithms were developed to solve the coupled nonlinear equations of mass, momentum, energy, capillary pressure, and evaporation rate. The distributions of temperature, thermodynamic saturation, liquid pressure, vapor pressure, liquid velocity, and vapor velocity were predicted.

40|$|Random walks (RW) of {{particles}} adsorbed {{in the internal}} walls of <b>porous</b> <b>deposits</b> produced by ballistic-type growth models are studied. The particles start at the external surface of the deposits and enter their pores, in order to simulate an external flux of a species towards a porous solid. For short times, the walker concentration decays as a stretched exponential of the depth z, but a crossover to long time normal diffusion is observed in most samples. The anomalous concentration profile remains at long times in very porous solids if the walker steps are restricted to nearest neighbors and is accompanied with subdiffusion features. These findings are correlated with a decay of the explored area with z. The study of RW of tracer particles left at the internal part of the solid rules out an interpretation by diffusion equations with position-dependent coefficients. A model of RW in a tube of decreasing cross section explains those results by showing long crossovers from an effective subdiffusion regime to an asymptotic normal diffusion. The crossover position and density are analytically calculated for a tube with area decreasing exponentially with z and show good agreement with numerical data. The anomalous decay of the concentration profile is interpreted as a templating effect of the tube shape on {{the total number of}} diffusing particles at each depth, while the volumetric concentration in the actually explored porous region may not have significant decay. These results may explain the anomalous diffusion of metal atoms in <b>porous</b> <b>deposits</b> observed in recent works.

The nano-fluid used in this research was prepared using two-step method and was stabilized using nonylphenol ethoxylate nonionic surfactant, pH setting, and sonication process as well. Influence of different operating parameters such as heat flux (0 - 1546 kW/m²), mass concentration of nano-fluids (weight concentration 0. 1 - 0. 3 %), bubble formation, critical heat flux (1170 kW/m² for water, 1230 kW/m² (wt%= 0. 1), 1320 kW/m² (wt%= 0. 2), 1450 kW/m² (wt%= 0. 3) and fouling on pool boiling heat transfer coefficient of nano-fluid as a thermal performance index were experimentally investigated and briefly discussed. Results demonstrated that the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient increases with increasing the mass concentration and the applied heat flux. In addition, the rate of bubble formation is significantly intensified at higher heat fluxes and subsequently, larger bubbles detach the surface due to the intensification of bubble coalescence. In terms of fouling formation, it can be stated that fouling of nano-fluids is a strong function of time and rate of deposition is increased over the extended time while the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient was not decreased over the time, as <b>porous</b> <b>deposited</b> layer on the surface are detached from the surface by bubble interactions.

30|$|An {{article by}} Keblinski et al. [50] {{is a good}} {{overview}} of enhanced heat conduction in nanofluids, and the possible mechanisms involved. Several mechanisms for the enhancement of thermal conductivity are presented in their article such as Brownian motion of the particles, molecular-level layering of the liquid at the liquid-particle interface and the clustering effect of nanoparticles leading to direct solid-solid paths. Boiling enhancement in nanofluids {{is thought to be}} due to several mechanisms: firstly an enhancement via nanoparticle interactions with bubbles [46]; secondly, an improvement in the thermal conductivity at the heater surface due to the accumulation of highly conductive nanoparticles forming a <b>porous</b> <b>deposit</b> there [32]. Several researchers have noticed this nano-deposition at the heater surface, which can alter the surface area, the surface wettability and the bubble nucleation. Conversely, the nanoparticles gathering at the heater surface as a deposit results in a {{decrease in the number of}} nanoparticles available to interact with bubbles. Also the nanoparticle deposit at the heater can result in a loss of nucleation sites at the surface, since the nanoparticles may fill the micro-cavities, resulting in a loss of boiling performance [13, 23, 30, 32, 51]. The nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter and bubble frequency are all affected by nanofluid boiling. It has been found by several researchers [4, 32] that bubble diameters increase during boiling with nanofluids, but the nucleation site density decreases with the addition of nanoparticles to the base fluid. Further studies focusing on bubble dynamics and bubble parameters will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms by which nanoparticles affect the heat transfer coefficient.|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis can be {{characterized}} as a research project about nuclear engineering. The object of this thesis is the primary system of Vandellós II nuclear power plant. Specifically, it has been focused on the dynamic behavior of corrosion products in the nuclear fuel of a nuclear core Vandellós II PWR. The report describes the operation of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS), highlighting and making a detailed study of an existing and common problem in different nuclear plants around the world, the so-called Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA). The occurrence of PWR Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA) is a limiting operational condition preventing many PWRs from operating with efficient core designs. AOA occurs when boron incorporates in corrosion products deposited in the steaming regions of high-duty fuel assemblies causing the reactor neutron flux to be skewed. It is for these reasons that in industry placed a high priority on developing a capability to assess fuel behavior and AOA risk for any particular core design. An expectation emerged that this capability would be versatile enough to model any PWR geometry and fuel design and would include the known physical parameters related to AOA. Therefore, the first objective of this project consists to study the consequences that produce this anomaly: The AOA phenomenon is believed to result from three interrelated aspects: 1) Sub cooled boiling on high-duty assemblies cause, 2) enhanced corrosion product deposition on those rods, and as the deposits thicken (CRUD formation), 3) boron is incorporated in those deposits causing a depression in neutron flux. After that, the second objective was to provide the different solutions to prevent mitigate or avoid this phenomenon. Among these solutions, there is the use of Boron-induced Offset Anomaly Risk Assessment Tool or “BOA” code. So, using BOA code methodology an assessment of AOA risk and strategies of Zinc injection (as a proposed solution to this problem) is done and accurate risk assessment tool (AOA risk) for projected cycle core designs of Vandellós II are performed. In this section, the BOA code development incorporated the above processes (1), 2), 3)), first requiring a thermal-hydraulic code input to establish the requisite heat flux and assembly steaming. Then, a system-wide mass balance approach to corrosion product release and deposition was applied. A boiling (<b>porous)</b> <b>deposit</b> model was added to address solute concentration processes as the deposits thicken. Finally, boron deposition processes have been incorporate based on both precipitation and physicsorption phenomena. By this process a Conservative and Best Estimate study are done. In addition, different sensitivity studies to analyze the effect of certain parameters on the behavior of the core in order to assess the AOA and to work with an optimal chemical strategy. On the other hand, an important aspect to reduce AOA risk is the ultrasonic fuel cleaning equipment. So, the third objective is the investigation of the Ultrasonic Fuel Cleaning (UFC) equipment. Ultrasonic Fuel Cleaning is a mechanical cleaning process developed by EPRI for reduction of CRUD inventory from irradiated fuel assemblies. UFC reduces susceptibility of PWRs to Axial Offset Anomaly or CRUD Induced Power Shift (AOA/CIPS), and is expected to become increasingly important in CRUD inventory reduction for CRUD-induced fuel failure mitigation, and radioactive material source term reduction initiatives. However, in order to take proper credit for UFC application when using core design tools such as BOA, a quantitative measure of CRUD removal is required. It {{is for this reason that}} the last objective is to propose a new method for quantifying UFC crud removal, and therefore, the effective of the UFC equipment.

Generally, the activity concentrations are lower in <b>porous</b> <b>deposits</b> and sludges than in scales. The activity concentration of 210 Pb is relatively low in hard deposits but may reach levels of thousands of Bq/g in sludges and in the very thin layers found in gas production. Huge amounts of NORM waste exceeding the exemption level of 10 Bq/g of 226 Ra and 228 Ra are generated as a result of both onsite and offsite decontamination of tubulars and different types of topside equipment. Onsite decontamination is the preferred option when components cannot reasonably be removed and replaced or need no other treatment before re-installation or continued use. One example of onsite decontamination is the removal of accumulated sludges from separators and systems handling produced water. Offsite decontamination is carried out when onsite decontamination cannot be performed effectively and radiologically safe, when components will have to be refurbished by specialised companies prior to their reuse, and when components not to be reused for their original function has to be cleaned.

To determine water quality changes associated with hyporheic flow, we studied six bar deposits positioned between the river and closed lentic side-channel alcoves. At each site we measured water levels and water quality in river, hyporheic, and alcove water. At all sites we found hyporheic flow paths from the river through the bar deposits to the alcove surface water. At {{a majority of the}} sites hyporheic dissolved oxygen and ammonium decreased relative to river water, while hyporheic specific flow rates, hyporheic temperature decreased relative to river water, and there was little change in temperature at the other three sites. Hypoheic changes most affected receiving alcove water quality at sites with fast hyporheic flow rates. Strategies to promote ecosystem functions provided by hyporheic flow should focus on restoring natural hydrogeophmorphic river channel processes to create high porosity deposits conducive to hyporheic flow...|$|R

These behaviors are compatible and related to the surface modification that was observed due to the <b>porous</b> nanoparticle layer <b>deposited</b> via boiling.|$|R
