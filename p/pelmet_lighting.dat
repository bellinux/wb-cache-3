50|$|The lower foyer was extensive, with {{interior}} finishes of {{dark brown}} brick and horizontal timber panelling stained dark brown; {{the ceiling was}} also lined with the same dark timber. This theme is continued through to rubbish bins, ashtrays and display units which are made of the same timber with strong horizontal design elements and aluminium details. Boxed, timber <b>pelmet</b> <b>lighting</b> ran along the walls throughout both {{the upper and lower}} foyers and the stairs. The foyer space was arranged symmetrically with staircases of identical detailing {{on either side of the}} centrally located ticket office. The ticket office was located in the space beneath the stairs to Cinema Two (which was previously occupied by a fountain and decorative light fitting). Bold geometric carpet with a pattern of purple, green and blue circles and ellipses in a black background covered the floor throughout the entire foyer area, including the stairs.|$|E
50|$|The church {{walls are}} lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove tulip oak boards laid diagonally, {{radiating}} out from the apex with center infill panels at the intersection in a dark stained sheet material. <b>Lighting</b> <b>pelmets</b> lining the side walls are decorated with a triangular motif and have triangular cut outs in the base to allow light to wash both {{up and down the}} walls. Suspended lighting baffles at the apex filter light from the roof lights above. The chancel has a screen, altar, lectern and planter that also incorporate triangular forms. Behind the screen is a single flight of stairs to the ground floor.|$|R
