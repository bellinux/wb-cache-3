A flat, smooth, oval slab, {{weighing}} about fifteen pounds, and a stone roller six inches in diameter, worked with both hands, {{and the weight}} of the body kneeling ungracefully upon it on [...] "all fours," [...] are used to triturate the holcus grain. At times water must be sprinkled over the meal, until a finely powdered paste is ready for the oven: thus several hours' labour is required to prepare a few pounds of bread. About 6 A.M. there appears a substantial breakfast of roast beef and mutton, with scones of Jowari grain, the whole drenched in broth. Of the men few perform any ablutions, but all use the tooth stick before sitting down to eat. After the meal some squat in the sun, others transact business, and drive their cattle to the bush till 11 A.M., the dinner hour. There is no variety in the repasts, which are always flesh and holcus: these people despise fowls, and consider vegetables food for cattle. During the day there is no privacy; men, women, and children enter in crowds, and will not be driven away by the Geradah, who inquires screamingly if they come to stare at a baboon. My kettle especially excites their surprise; some opine that it is an ostrich, others, a serpent: Sudiyah, however, soon discovered its use, and begged irresistibly for the unique article. Throughout the day her slave girls are busied in grinding, cooking, and quarrelling with dissonant voices: the men have little occupation beyond chewing tobacco, chatting, and having their wigs frizzled by a professional coiffeur. In the evening the horses and cattle return home to be milked and stabled: this operation concluded, all apply themselves to supper with a will. They sleep but little, and sit deep into the night trimming the fire, and conversing merrily over their cups of Farshu or millet beer. [21] I tried this mixture several times, and found it detestable: the taste is sour, and it flies directly to the head, in consequence of being mixed with some poisonous bark. It is served up in gourd bottles upon a basket of holcus heads, and strained through a <b>pledget</b> of cotton, fixed across the narrow mouth, into cups of the same primitive material: the drinkers sit around their liquor, and their hilarity argues its intoxicating properties. In the morning they arise with headaches and heavy eyes; but these symptoms, which we, an industrious race, deprecate, are not disliked by the Somal--they promote sleep and give something to occupy the vacant mind. I usually slumber through the noise except when Ambar, a half-caste Somal, returning from a trip to Harar, astounds us with his contes bleus, or wild Abtidon howls forth some lay like this:-- ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe use of <b>pledgeted</b> sutures {{to secure}} the {{prosthetic}} valve to the annulus during aortic valve replacement is thought to decrease the incidence of paravalvular leak. We hypothesized that use of nonpledgeted sutures in aortic valve replacement would provide equivalent outcomes to those of a <b>pledgeted</b> suture technique. MethodsBetween January 1995 and April 2009, a total of 802 patients (511 nonpledgeted, 291 <b>pledgeted)</b> underwent isolated aortic valve replacement, including 671 patients who underwent primary, isolated aortic valve replacement (412 nonpledgeted, 259 <b>pledgeted).</b> Preoperative risk, intraoperative findings, and postoperative complications, including operative mortality, were evaluated. ResultsOperative mortalities in isolated AVR operations were similar at 2. 5 % and 3. 1 % (P >. 66) for nonpledgeted and <b>pledgeted</b> groups, respectively. Paravalvular leak rates after aortic valve replacement were equivalent in nonpledgeted and <b>pledgeted</b> groups (0. 8 % vs 1. 4 %, respectively, P = . 47). Reoperation for paravalvular leak was rare in both groups. Importantly, the nonpledgeted technique incurred significantly shorter aortic crossclamp time (58. 1  ± 0. 3 minutes vs 61. 6  ± 0. 4 minutes, P < . 001) and cardiopulmonary bypass time (87. 5  ± 0. 8 minutes vs 90. 3  ± 0. 8 minutes, P = . 02) than did the <b>pledgeted</b> technique. ConclusionsA nonpledgeted suture technique offers an equivalent alternative to the traditional use of <b>pledgets</b> during aortic valve replacement, with no increase in paravalvular leak rate. This nonpledgeted suture technique provides a time efficient and safe approach to aortic valve replacement operations...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To examine {{risk factors}} for major paravalvular leak (PVL) events after {{mechanical}} heart valve replacement. Methods: We analyzed outcome of 807 patients randomized into the Artificial Valve Endocarditis Reduction Trial (AVERT). The mean follow-up time was 30. 6 months and 21 major PVL events were reported. Three additional major PVL events associated with endocarditis were excluded from analysis. All baseline medical history variables, as well as operative parameters (including use of <b>pledgets</b> and suture technique) were examined using Cox regression. Results: Major PVL was reported after 11 aortic, 9 mitral, and 1 double valve replacement. 6 / 404 (1. 5 %) patients with conventional valves experienced a major PVL event versus 15 / 403 (3. 7 %) in the Silzone group. 10 / 172 (5. 8 %) patients with valve suture technique without <b>pledgets</b> experienced a major PVL event versus 11 / 635 (1. 7 %) patients with <b>pledgets.</b> Final multivariable model showed that only suture technique without <b>pledgets</b> (p = 0. 005) was an independent significant risk factor for major PVL events.

Batches of Culex annuhrostris Skuse and Culex gelidus Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) were orally infected with Japanese encephalitis (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, JEV), Kunjin (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, KUNV; a subtype of West Nile virus), and Murray Valley encephalitis (family Flaviviridae, genus Flaviviris, MVEV) viruses. After a 7 -d extrinsic incubation, these mosquitoes were offered sucrose meals via cotton pledgets, which were removed daily and processed for viral RNA by using real-time TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. JEV, MVEV, and KUNV RNA was detected in all pledgets removed from batches of Cx, gelidus on days 7 - 14 postexposure. In contrast, detection rates were variable for Cx. annuhrostris, with KUNV detected in 0. 3 M sucrose pledgets on all days postexposure, and JEV and MVEV detected on 57 and 50 % of days postexposure, respectively. Higher concentrations of sucrose in the <b>pledget</b> did not increase virus detection rates.

Formalin instillation is often effective for intractable haemorrhage unresponsive to other agents, but carries the risk of significant morbidity.

MethodsEleven patients with intractable haemorrhage {{secondary to}} radiation cystitis were treated by intravesicle 4 % formalin instillation (Group I) and eight were treated by the endoscopic placement of 10 % formalin-soaked <b>pledgets</b> on the bleeding points for 15 minutes (Group II).

Four major and several minor complications were found in Group I, and only three minor complications were found in Group II.

We present three case reports in which we used a layer of posterior rectus fascia-peritoneum to bolster oversewing a short infected aortic stump after removal of an infected aortic graft. All three patients underwent staged extra-anatomic axillary-to-femoral artery bypass procedures, with subsequent removal of the infected aortic graft as a second operation. Two of the three procedures were semi-elective, and one was done urgently because of a recurrent aortoenteric fistula.

In each instance a segment of autogenous posterior rectus fascia-peritoneum was harvested and used as a circumferential <b>pledget</b> to bolster the anastomosis.

Settings and Design: A pilot study of consecutive cases which underwent 25 gauge vitrectomy under topical anesthesia. Materials and Methods: Seven eyes of 7 patients underwent 25 gauge vitrectomy under topical anesthesia with a <b>pledget</b> soaked in anesthetic, for vitreous hemorrhage (2 eyes), retained cortex (1 eye) and postoperative endophthalmitis (4 eyes). Subjective pain and discomfort were graded from 0 (no pain or discomfort) to 4 (severe pain and discomfort).
