5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature. This was inspired {{in part by the}} retraction of a high-profile paper from 2004 which originally described the computational design of a protein with improved enzymatic activity relative to its natural form. The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> method. This type of <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to <b>protein</b> <b>design.</b> In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than <b>protein</b> <b>design,</b> because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

5|$|Of all {{the major}} {{distributed}} computing projects involved in protein research, Folding@home {{is the only one}} not using the BOINC platform. Both Rosetta@home and Folding@home study protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but Folding@home does so much more exclusively. Folding@home almost exclusively uses all-atom molecular dynamics models to understand how and why proteins fold (or potentially misfold, and subsequently aggregate to cause diseases). In other words, Folding@home's strength is modeling the process of protein folding, while Rosetta@home's strength is computing <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> and predicting protein structure and docking.|$|E

In August2001, the company partnered with Seattle Genetics to manufacture {{a component of}} their top experimental antibody drug SGN-15. In November2001, Icos signed a production agreement with GPC Biotech to manufacture a class of GPC's antibodies that targeted B-cell lymphomas.

40|$|A general {{strategy}} is described for <b>designing</b> <b>proteins</b> that self assemble into large symmetrical nanomaterials, including molecular cages, filaments, layers, and porous materials. In this strategy, one molecule of protein A, which naturally forms a self-assembling oligomer, An, is fused rigidly to one molecule of protein B, which forms another self-assembling oligomer, Bm. The {{result is a}} fusion protein, A-B, which self assembles with other identical copies of itself into a designed nanohedral particle or material, (A-B) p. The {{strategy is}} demonstrated through the design, production, and characterization of two fusion proteins: a 49 -kDa <b>protein</b> <b>designed</b> to assemble into a cage approximately 15 nm across, and a 44 -kDa <b>protein</b> <b>designed</b> to assemble into long filaments approximately 4 nm wide.

500|$|With Jay Ponder in 1987, {{as part of}} an {{exploration}} of using internal packing of sidechains to enumerate the possible sequences compatible with a given protein backbone structure (a foreshadowing of protein engineering and design), Richards developed the first side-chain rotamer library.

500|$|RosettaDesign, a {{computing}} {{approach to}} <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> based on Rosetta, began in 2000 with {{a study in}} redesigning the folding pathway of Protein G. In 2002 RosettaDesign was used to design Top7, a 93-amino acid long α/β protein that had an overall fold never before recorded in nature. [...] This new conformation was predicted by Rosetta to within 1.2 Å RMSD of the structure determined by X-ray crystallography, representing an unusually accurate structure prediction. Rosetta and RosettaDesign earned widespread recognition by being the first to design and accurately predict {{the structure of a}} novel protein of such length, as reflected by the 2002 paper describing the dual approach prompting two positive letters in the journal Science, and being cited by more than 240 other scientific articles. The visible product of that research, Top7, was featured as the RCSB PDB's 'Molecule of the Month' in October 2006; a superposition of the respective cores (residues 60–79) of its predicted and X-ray crystal structures are featured in the Rosetta@home logo.|$|E

500|$|Nanotechnology {{is often}} {{defined as the}} study of {{materials}} and devices with features on a scale below 100 nanometers. [...] DNA nanotechnology, specifically, {{is an example of}} bottom-up molecular self-assembly, in which molecular components spontaneously organize into stable structures; the particular form of these structures is induced by the physical and chemical properties of the components selected by the designers. [...] In DNA nanotechnology, the component materials are strands of nucleic acids such as DNA; these strands are often synthetic and are almost always used outside the context of a living cell. DNA is well-suited to nanoscale construction because the binding between two nucleic acid strands depends on simple base pairing rules which are well understood, and form the specific nanoscale structure of the nucleic acid double helix. These qualities make the assembly of nucleic acid structures easy to control through nucleic acid design. [...] This property is absent in other materials used in nanotechnology, including proteins, for which <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> is very difficult, and nanoparticles, which lack the capability for specific assembly on their own.|$|E
50|$|Rational <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> {{dates back}} to the mid-1970s, {{although}} initial <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> approaches were based mostly on sequence composition and did not account for specific interactions between side-chains at the atomic level. Recently, however, improvements in molecular force fields, <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> algorithms, and structural bioinformatics, such as libraries of amino acid conformations, have enabled the development of advanced computational <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> tools. These computational tools can make complex calculations on protein energetics and flexibility, and perform searches over vast configuration spaces, which would be unfeasible to perform manually. Due to the development of computational <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> programs, and important successes in the field (e.g., see examples below), rational <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> {{has become one of the}} most important tools in protein engineering.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{sequence}} prediction algorithm and a novel sampling method to <b>design</b> <b>protein</b> sequences for the WW domain, a small β-sheet motif. The procedure, referred to as SPANS, designs sequences to be compatible with an ensemble of closely related polypeptide backbones, mimicking the inherent flexibility of <b>proteins.</b> Two <b>designed</b> sequences (termed SPANS-WW 1 and SPANS-WW 2), using only naturally occurring l-amino acids, were selected for study and the corresponding polypeptides were prepared in Escherichia coli. Circular dichroism data suggested that both purified polypeptides adopted secondary structure features related {{to those of the}} target without the aid of disulfide bridges or bound cofactors. The structure exhibited by SPANS-WW 2 melted cooperatively by raising the temperature of the solution. Further analysis of this polypeptide by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that at 5 °C, it folds into a structure closely resembling a natural WW domain.

5000|$|Some <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> {{algorithms}} {{are listed}} below. Although these algorithms address {{only the most}} basic formulation of the <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> problem, Equation (...) , when the optimization goal changes because designers introduce improvements and extensions to the <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> model, such as improvements to the structural flexibility allowed (e.g., protein backbone flexibility) or including sophisticated energy terms, many of the extensions on <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> that improve modeling are built atop these algorithms. For example, Rosetta Design incorporates sophisticated energy terms, and backbone flexibility using Monte Carlo as the underlying optimizing algorithm. OSPREY's algorithms build on the dead-end elimination algorithm and A* to incorporate continuous backbone and side-chain movements. Thus, these algorithms provide a good perspective on {{the different kinds of}} algorithms available for <b>protein</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
50|$|The goal of <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> {{is to find}} {{a protein}} {{sequence}} that will fold to a target structure. A <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> algorithm must, thus, search all the conformations of each sequence, with respect to the target fold, and rank sequences according to the lowest-energy conformation of each one, as determined by the <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> energy function. Thus, a typical input to the <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> algorithm is the target fold, the sequence space, the structural flexibility, and the energy function, while the output is one or more sequences that are predicted to fold stably to the target structure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>design,</b> however, has {{requirements}} that {{can sometimes be}} limited in molecular mechanics force-fields. Molecular mechanics force-fields, which have been used mostly in molecular dynamics simulations, are optimized for the simulation of single sequences, but <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> searches through many conformations of many sequences. Thus, molecular mechanics force-fields must be tailored for <b>protein</b> <b>design.</b> In practice, <b>protein</b> <b>design</b> energy functions often incorporate both statistical terms and physics-based terms. For example, the Rosetta energy function, one of the most-used energy functions, incorporates physics-based energy terms originating in the CHARMM energy function, and statistical energy terms, such as rotamer probability and knowledge-based electrostatics. Typically, energy functions are highly customized between laboratories, and specifically tailored for every design.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{similarities}} and differences between the energy landscapes of proteins that have been selected by nature and those of some <b>proteins</b> <b>designed</b> by humans. Natural proteins have evolved to function as well as fold, and this is a source of energetic frustration. The sequence of Top 7, on the other hand, was designed with architecture alone in mind using only native state stability as the optimization criterion. Its topology had not previously been observed in nature. Experimental studies show that the folding kinetics of Top 7 is more complex than the kinetics of folding of otherwise comparable naturally occurring proteins. In this paper, we use structure prediction tools, frustration analysis, and free energy profiles to illustrate the folding landscapes of Top 7 and two other <b>proteins</b> <b>designed</b> by Takada. We use both perfectly funneled (structure-based) and predictive (transferable) models to gain insight into the role of topological versus energetic frustration in these systems and show how they differ from those found for natural proteins. We also study how robust the folding of these designs would be to the simplification of the sequences using fewer amino acid types. Simplification using a five amino acid type code results in comparable quality of structure prediction to the full sequence in some cases, while the two-letter simplification scheme dramatically reduces the quality of structure prediction...|$|R
