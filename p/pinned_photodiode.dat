50|$|The {{standard}} CMOS APS pixel today {{consists of}} a photodetector (a <b>pinned</b> <b>photodiode),</b> a floating diffusion, a transfer gate, reset gate, selection gate and source-follower readout transistor—the so-called 4T cell. The <b>pinned</b> <b>photodiode</b> was originally used in interline transfer CCDs due to its low dark current and good blue response, and when coupled with the transfer gate, allows complete charge transfer from the <b>pinned</b> <b>photodiode</b> to the floating diffusion (which is further connected to {{the gate of the}} read-out transistor) eliminating lag. The use of intrapixel charge transfer can offer lower noise by enabling the use of correlated double sampling (CDS). The Noble 3T pixel is still sometimes used since the fabrication requirements are easier. The 3T pixel comprises the same elements as the 4T pixel except the transfer gate and the photodiode. The reset transistor, Mrst, acts as a switch to reset the floating diffusion which acts in this case as the photodiode. When the reset transistor is turned on, the photodiode is effectively connected to the power supply, VRST, clearing all integrated charge. Since the reset transistor is n-type, the pixel operates in soft reset. The read-out transistor, Msf, acts as a buffer (specifically, a source follower), an amplifier which allows the pixel voltage to be observed without removing the accumulated charge. Its power supply, VDD, is typically tied to the power supply of the reset transistor. The select transistor, Msel, allows a single row of the pixel array to be read by the read-out electronics. Other innovations of the pixels such as 5T and 6T pixels also exist. By adding extra transistors, functions such as global shutter, as opposed to the more common rolling shutter, are possible. In order to increase the pixel densities, shared-row, four-ways and eight-ways shared read out, and other architectures can be employed. A variant of the 3T active pixel is the Foveon X3 sensor invented by Dick Merrill. In this device, three photodiodes are stacked {{on top of each other}} using planar fabrication techniques, each photodiode having its own 3T circuit. Each successive layer acts as a filter for the layer below it shifting the spectrum of absorbed light in successive layers. By deconvolving the response of each layered detector, red, green, and blue signals can be reconstructed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the present}} paper, {{we have been}} {{investigated}} deeply and parametrically the speed response of Si <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> employed in high temperature-irradiated environment. The radiation-induced photodiodes defects can modify the initial doping concentrations, creating generation-recombination centres and introducing trapping of carriers. Additionally, rate of the lattice defects is thermally activated and reduces for increasing irradiation temperature {{as a result of}} annealing of the damage. Nonlinear relations are correlated to investigate the current-voltage and capacitance-voltage dependences of the Si <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes,</b> where thermal and gamma irradiation effects are considered over the practical ranges of interest. Both the ambient temperature and the irradiation dose possess sever effects on the electro-optical characteristics and consequently the photo-response time and SNR of Si <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes.</b> In this paper, we derive the transient response of a Si <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiode</b> for photogeneration currents, when it is exposed to gamma radiation at high temperature.

The radiation induced direct current response for single <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> with different active areas, {{as well as for}} multiple <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> connected in parallel, has been investigated. Three types of commercial silicon <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> have been chosen for evaluation - S 1223, BPW 34, and PS 100 - 6 -CER 2 PIN. During the experiment, five samples have been tested - three samples made of single <b>PIN</b> <b>photodiodes</b> (one sample of each photodiode type) and two samples formed by connecting multiple photodiodes in parallel (two BPW 34 photodiodes in parallel and four BPW 34 photodiodes in parallel). The samples have been irradiated with a 60 Co gamma ray source and the relations between the induced photocurrent and the dose rate, and between the accumulated charge and the absorbed dose, have been determined. For measuring the photodiodes response, a custom made auto-ranging electrometer controlled by a personal computer, and capable of measuring direct currents from 50 pA to 10 mA with relative error less than 2. 5 %, has been used. Obtained results have shown very good linearity between the dose rate and the induced photocurrent for dose rates ranging from 0. 93 Gy/h to 67 Gy/h. Also, very good linearity has been observed between the accumulated charge and the absorbed dose for all tested samples, within the investigated range of absorbed doses from 472 mGy to 3. 3 Gy. On the basis of the obtained results, a simple model has been derived, enabling the estimation of the photodiode’s current response {{as a function of the}} dose rate and the photodiode’s geometry (active area and depletion layer width).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{demonstrates}} {{the existence of}} dark current blooming in <b>pinned</b> <b>photodiode</b> CMOS image sensors {{with the support of}} both experimental measurements and TCAD simulations. It is usually assumed that blooming can appear only under illumination, when the charge collected by a pixel exceeds the full well capacity (i. e. when the photodiode becomes forward biased). In this work, it is shown that blooming can also appear in the dark by dark current leakage from hot pixels in reverse bias (i. e. below the full well capacity). The dark current blooming is observed to propagate up to nine pixels away in the experimental images and can impact hundreds of pixels around each hot pixel. Hence, it can be a major image quality issue for state-of-the-art <b>pinned</b> <b>photodiode</b> CMOS Image Sensors used in dark current limited applications such as low-light optical imaging and should be taken into account in the dark current subtraction process. This work also demonstrates that one of the key parameter for dark current optimization, the transfer gate bias during integration, has to be carefully chosen depending on the application because the optimum bias for dark current reduction leads to the largest dark current blooming effects...|$|E
