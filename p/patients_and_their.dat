According to the 2007 Archdiocese of Miami Official Catholic Directory, the two Catholic hospitals, Mercy Hospital in Miami and Holy Cross Hospital in Ft. Lauderdale, served 1,278,516 people; three CHS {{health care centers}} served 7,896; three homes for the aged assisted 2,578 senior citizens; two residential care centers for children served 376; seven day-care centers served 1,885; two specialized homes assisted 383; twelve special centers for social services served 81,320; and eleven other institutions served 1,432 people in 2007. Catholic Hospice Care is a partnership between the Archdiocese of Miami and Mercy Hospital.

Catholic Health Services also operates two Catholic cemeteries, Our Lady Queen of Heaven in Broward County and Our Lady of Mercy in Miami-Dade.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> guardians must be apprised of {{any serious}} risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E

25|$|In the Netherlands, <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> doctors (GPs) have {{different}} {{perceptions of the}} efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS.

25|$|In {{all these}} fields, local and {{qualitative}} ethnographic research is indispensable {{for understanding the}} way <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> social networks incorporate knowledge on health and illness when their experience is nuanced by complex cultural influences.

25|$|The {{hospital}} {{was not just}} a place to treat patients: it also served as a medical school to educate and train students. Basic science preparation was learned through private tutors, self-study and lectures. Islamic hospitals were the first to keep written records of <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> medical treatment. Students were responsible in keeping these patient records, which were later edited by doctors and referenced in future treatments.|$|E

30|$|It is very {{important}} to discuss the different treatment options with the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> partners in order to better understand <b>their</b> needs, worries <b>and</b> perspectives of <b>their</b> treatment.

25|$|The TMAS {{has been}} proven {{reliable}} using test-retest reliability. O’Connor, Lorr, and Stafford found there were five general factors in the scale: chronic anxiety or worry, increased physiological reactivity, sleep disturbances associated with inner strain, sense of personal inadequacy, and motor tension. This study showed that persons administered the test could be display different anxiety levels across these areas.

25|$|Most {{symptoms}} of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not {{turn out to}} represent underlying breast cancer. Fewer than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous, and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms.

25|$|A study made by Takaki {{and colleagues}} (2006), {{focused on the}} gender {{differences}} with relationship to {{internal locus of control}} and self-efficacy in hemodialysis <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> compliance. This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advices compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, AVS {{and its allies}} in the family {{planning}} movement launched an intensive campaign to promote sterilization. Concurrently, AVS launched—together with the ACLU and Zero Population Growth—"Operation Lawsuit": a series of successful lawsuits against various U.S. hospitals for refusing to comply with patients' requests for sterilization. These campaigns resulted in the increasingly widespread acceptance in the medical profession that sterilization was an effective birth control method, and that sterilization decision making was purely a matter between <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> physicians. AVS also worked to establish the first informed consent and client-counseling components in health services and produced {{one of the first}} manuals on family planning counseling.|$|E
