5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the <b>purple</b> <b>sandpiper</b> take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
25|$|There are 33 {{species of}} fish in the waters, none of which are {{abundant}} or commercially exploitable. The most common are polar cod, which reach lengths of , and liparidae. There are no endemic species within the archipelago. Forty-one species of birds have been documented in the archipelago, of which fourteen breed. These are dominated by seabirds such as fulmar, kittiwake, Brünnich's guillemot, black guillemot and little auk are common throughout the archipelago, while seven other species prefer nesting on flat tundra: common eider, <b>purple</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> Arctic skua, glaucous gull, ivory gull, Arctic tern and snow bunting. Some ivory gulls, little auks and Brünnich's guillemots opt to spend the winter on the islands.|$|E

40|$|Winter {{north of}} the Arctic circle in {{northern}} Norway is colder, windier and there is less solar radiation than in eastern Scotland, at a latitude 13 degrees further south. We predicted from equations derived from heated taxidermic mounts that the maintenance metabolism (Basal Metabolic Rate plus extra costs for thermoregulation) for <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Calidris maritima wintering in these climatic conditions in Norway would be 1. 3 times greater than for <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> {{of the same size}} in Scotland. Adaptations to the more extreme environment and greater energy requirements were investigated by measuring differences in the body size and composition of <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> from northern Norway and Scotland. As predicted, the Norwegian <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> had more fat stores, but these were still at relatively low levels (6. 5 % of fresh body mass) compared with other waders wintering in cold climates. The Norwegian birds were slightly larger so will probably have a relatively lower thermal conductance than Scottish birds. Also, there were large differences in the relative sizes of the intestine (1. 5 times heavier in Norwegian birds) and liver (1. 3 times heavier). This suggests Bat <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> wintering in Norway eat and process a greater amount of food than the birds in Scotland. Ln this way, the additional energy demands for thermoregulation in a colder environment are probably met...|$|R

40|$|The <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris maritima) are {{the most}} common waders in the high arctic {{archipelago}} of Svalbard, Norway. There they have to cope with a very short summer season and high metabolic costs of migrating far north and breeding in an arctic environment. The food on land is usually scarce, whereas there are rich feeding grounds in the littoral zone, such as in the intertidal zone of river flats. These feeding grounds are though only available to the <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers</b> during low tide {{and as long as the}} estuary is not covered by sea ice. One of these intertidal flats was used as the fieldwork area in this study. To study when the birds are coming to this intertidal flat for feeding, a count study was performed during the entire stay of the <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers</b> in Svalbard in summer 2010. Point counts were performed at low tide during 118 different days. Additionally, point counts were performed at twenty days during the six hours of the entire low tide period, to study when during the tidal cycle most sandpipers were feeding at the estuary. Most sandpipers were counted at the intertidal flat at the beginning of June with the highest number, 921 individuals, on 8 th June. When the tundra was free of snow and the birds could start breeding, numbers where rapidly declining with very few sandpipers left in the estuary in July and the first part of August. From the end of August numbers were increasing again with a second but lower peak in the end of September and beginning of October. By the end of October all sandpipers had left the estuary. The study on the appearance of <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers</b> at the estuary at the different periods of low tide showed that there were significantly more sandpipers between low tide and half an hour later than at the rest of the low tide period. This might be due to better access to their prey at that time. This knowledge could be used in future studies aiming at recording the maximum numbers. The result of the phenologic study could be included in a long term monitoring to see if the numbers and the timing of <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers</b> are stable in this area or not: Are the peak numbers differing significantly? Is the timing of the arrival, the stay on the tundra and the timing of leaving the archipelago in the fall changing? Long-term monitoring would be especially interesting in the view of possible influences of the climate change on the <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> Rising sea level as a result of the climate change would change the morphology of the estuaries and thereby influence the food resources available for sandpipers...|$|R
40|$|The masses Of 3229 <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Calidris maritima from Britain were {{analysed}} for differences related to age, season and size. First-year birds were lighter by 2 g. There {{was only a}} slight increase in mass in mid-winter, in contrast to other waders wintering in Britain, suggesting that <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> are less at risk to cold weather and food shortages. Their winter fat reserves were low but their breast muscles were relatively larger than other small waders wintering in Britain. Their plumage was slightly heavier and their breast and belly feathers were longer. There was a large increase in mass in May by first-year and adult birds prior to migration. The 'long-billed' population showed a greater relative increase in May, compared with the 'short-billed' population, perhaps reflecting different migration distances...|$|R

40|$|Many {{bird species}} need to {{accumulate}} fat deposits prior to long distance migration. The surplus energy {{required to achieve}} this {{can be obtained by}} increasing food intake. There are two main ways of attaining an increased food intake; by increasing feeding day length or by an increase in the rate of feeding. The foraging and roosting behaviour of Turnstones, Arenaria interpres, and <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> Calidris maritima, was studied in the spring pre-migratory period at Hartlepool, N. E. England. Adult Turnstone increase both their feeding day length and feeding rate. First year Turnstones show no lengthening of their feeding day and only a small increase in feeding rate, they do not undergo long distance migration so do not need to deposit fat. <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> do not exhibit an increase in their feeding day length, due to the availability of their feeding areas being strictly tidally controlled, and rely on an increased feeding rate alone to achieve fat deposition. Associated with the increased feeding rates is a reduction in time spent vigilant, suggesting a trade off occurs as increased time spent foraging becomes more beneficial. The possible conseqences of redevelopment of the West Harbour roost site are discussed and suggestions made for future study...|$|R

50|$|Both {{birds are}} {{distinctive}} medium-sized waders. Roughly speaking, length is typically between 20 and 25 cm, with a wingspan between 50 and 60 cm {{and a body}} mass between 110 and 130gm. For waders their build is stocky, with short, slightly upturned, wedge shaped bills. They are high Arctic breeders, and are migratory. Their strong necks and powerful, slightly upturned bills are adapted to their feeding technique. As the name implies, these species overturn stones, seaweed, and similar items in search of invertebrate prey. They are strictly coastal, prefer stony beaches to sand, and often share beach space with other species of waders such as <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Predators of the {{dog whelk}} include various species of crabs and birds. Protection against {{predation}} from crabs which attempt to pull the soft body out through the shell aperture can be afforded by growing teeth {{around the edge of}} the aperture. Many predators cannot smash the strong shell of an adult dog whelk, but juveniles are vulnerable to attack from many predatory species. Eider ducks and various other birds simply swallow the entire body with its shell, while oystercatchers and various crustaceans are often capable of crushing or breaking the shells. In the winter they endure more predation from <b>purple</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and similar wading birds, but in the summer crabs represent a greater threat. In general, the dog whelk can be thought of as being vulnerable to birds when emersed, and to crabs when immersed.|$|R
40|$|Bird {{migration}} is generally scheduled to avoid other energetically expensive {{events in the}} annual cycle (e. g. moult) and seasons when survival can be difficult (e. g. northern winters). <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> winter at relatively high latitudes compared to other waders. It is suspected that the majority that winter in Britain and Ireland originate from Canada, {{but there is no}} primary evidence of their breeding grounds and migratory routes. These birds, characterised by their long bills, start to arrive in Britain and Ireland in late October/early November, after completing their post-nuptial moult at an unknown location. Fifty geolocators were attached to <b>Purple</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> in northern Scotland and southwest Ireland and we established for the first time their Canadian origin (Baffin Island and Devon Island), migration routes and post-nuptial moulting areas. Spring departure from Scotland and Ireland took place mainly in late May, followed by staging in Iceland and/or southwest Greenland before reaching the breeding grounds. Those that staged in Iceland departed earlier than those that flew directly to Greenland. Post-nuptial moulting areas were in southern Baffin Island, northern Quebec/Labrador (the Hudson Strait), and southwest Greenland. Migration from Baffin Island and Labrador took place during late October – early November, and during mid to late December from Greenland, usually in a single trans-Atlantic flight. Therefore, this migration was scheduled {{at a time when most}} other wader species are already on their wintering grounds. No birds staged in Iceland on the return trip. The flight from Baffin Island to Scotland and Ireland was accomplished in about 2. 5 days at an average speed of about 1400 km per day. Freezing of coastal waters may be the reason for the eventual departure from the Hudson Strait. The more northerly route via Iceland, taken in spring by most birds, and the more southerly route in early winter were associated with seasonal shifts in the Atlantic low pressure systems (depressions) whose anti-clockwise wind-flows would have assisted flights...|$|R
40|$|Shorebirds at {{northern}} latitudes during the nonbreeding season typically carry relatively large lipid stores and exhibit an up-regulation of lean tissues associated with digestion and thermogenesis. Intraspecific variation in these tissues across sites primarily reflects differences in environmental conditions. Rock (Calidris ptilocnemis (Coues, 1873)) and Purple (Calidris maritima (Brunnich, 1764)) sandpipers {{are closely related}} species having the most northerly nonbreeding distributions among shorebirds, living at latitudes up to 61 degrees N in Cook Inlet, Alaska, and up to similar to 71 degrees N in northern Norway, respectively. Cook Inlet is the coldest known site used by nonbreeding shorebirds, and the region's mudflats annually experience extensive coverage of foraging sites by sea and shore-fast ice. Accordingly, Rock Sandpipers increase their fat stores to nearly 20 % of body mass during winter.
