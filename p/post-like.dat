Using the "floating sphere at emitter-plate potential" (FSEPP) model, it re-examines the electrostatics and mathematics of three simple systems of identical <b>post-like</b> emitters. For the isolated emitter, various approaches are noted. On need consider only {{the effects of}} sphere charges and (for separated emitters) image charges. For the 2 -emitter system, formulas are found for "charge-blunting" and "neighbour-field" effects, for widely spaced and "sufficiently closely spaced" emitters. Mutual charge-blunting is always dominant, with a related (negative) fractional AFEF-change δ_two. For sufficiently small emitter spacing c, |δ_two| varies as 1 /c; for large spacing, |δ_two| decreases as 1 /c^ 3. In a 3 -emitter linear array, differential charge-blunting and differential neighbor-field effects occur, but the former are dominant, and cause the "exposed" outer emitters to have higher AFEF (γ_ 0) than the central emitter (γ_ 1). Formulas are found for the exposure ratio Ξ=γ_ 0 /γ_ 1, for large and for sufficiently small separations. The FSEPP model for an isolated emitter has accuracy around 30...|$|E
40|$|With a large-area field {{electron}} emitter, when {{an individual}} <b>post-like</b> emitter is sufficiently resistive, and current through it is sufficiently large, then voltage loss occurs along it. This letter provides a simple analytical and conceptual demonstration that this voltage loss is directly and inextricably linked {{to a reduction in}} the field enhancement factor (FEF) at the post apex. A formula relating apex-FEF reduction to this voltage loss was obtained in the paper by Minoux et al. [Nano Lett. 5, 2135 (2005) ] by fitting to numerical results from a Laplace solver. This letter derives the same formula analytically, by using a “floating sphere” model. The analytical proof brings out the underlying physics more clearly and shows that the effect is a general phenomenon, related to reduction in the magnitude of the surface charge in the most protruding parts of an emitter. Voltage-dependent FEF-reduction is one cause of “saturation” in Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots. Another is a voltage-divider effect, due to measurement-circuit resistance. An integrated theory of both effects is presented. Both together, or either by itself, can cause saturation. Experimentally, if saturation occurs but voltage loss is small (< 20 [*]V, say), then saturation is more probably due to FEF-reduction than voltage division. In this case, existing treatments of electrostatic interaction ("shielding") between closely spaced emitters may need modification. Other putative causes of saturation exist, so the present theory is a partial story. Its extension seems possible and could lead to a more general physical understanding of the causes of FN-plot saturation...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} an accurate numerical {{study of the}} electrostatics of systems formed by individual nanostructure mounted on support substrate tip, a theoretical prototype for applications in field electron emission or for construction of tips in probe microscopy requiring high resolution. We modeled substrate tip with height h_ 1, radius r_ 1 and characteristic field enhancement factor (FEF) γ_ 1, and the top nanostructure with height h_ 2, radius r_ 2 <r_ 1 and FEF γ_ 2, both hemisphere on <b>post-like</b> structures. Then, nanostructure mounted on support substrate tip has characteristic FEF, γ_C. Defining the relative difference η_R ≡ (γ_C - γ_ 1) / (γ_ 3 - γ_ 1), where γ_ 3 corresponds to reference FEF for a hemisphere on post structure with radius r_ 3 =r_ 2 and height h_ 3 =h_ 1 + h_ 2, our results suggest, from numerical solution of Laplace's equation using a finite element scheme, a scaling η_R = f(u≡λθ^- 1), where λ≡ h_ 2 /h_ 1 and θ≡ r_ 1 /r_ 2. Given a characteristic variable u_c, we found, for u ≪ u_c, a power law η_R∼ u^κ with κ≈ 0. 55. For u ≫ u_c, η_R≈ 1 providing conditions where γ_C →γ_ 3. As a consequence of scaling invariance, it's possible to derive a simple expression for γ_C, being possible to predict conditions to produce related systems with a desirable FEF and that, at the same time, are mechanically stable by presence of substrate tip. Finally, we also discuss the validity of Schottky's conjecture (SC) for these systems showing that, while to obey SC is a indicative of scale invariance, the opposite is not necessarily satisfied. This suggest that a careful analysis must be done before attribute the SC as a origin of giant FEF in experiments...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to improve}} {{qualitative}} understanding of electrostatic influences on apex field enhancement factors (AFEFs) for small field emitter arrays/clusters. Using the “floating sphere at emitter-plate potential” (FSEPP) model, it re-examines the electrostatics and mathematics of three simple systems of identical <b>post-like</b> emitters. For the isolated emitter, various approaches are noted. An adequate approximation {{is to consider}} only the effects of sphere charges and (for significantly separated emitters) image charges. For the 2 -emitter system, formulas are found for charge-transfer (“charge-blunting”) effects and neighbor-field effects, for widely spaced and for “sufficiently closely spaced” emitters. Mutual charge-blunting is always the dominant effect, with a related (negative) fractional AFEF-change δ two. For sufficiently small emitter spacing c, |δ two| varies approximately as 1 /c; for large spacing, |δ two| decreases as 1 /c 3. In a 3 -emitter equispaced linear array, differential charge-blunting and differential neighbor-field effects occur, but differential charge-blunting effects are dominant, and cause the “exposed” outer emitters to have higher AFEF (γ 0) than the central emitter (γ 1). Formulas are found for the exposure ratio Ξ[*]=[*]γ 0 /γ 1, for large and for sufficiently small separations. The FSEPP model for an isolated emitter has accuracy around 30 %. Line-charge models (LCMs) are an alternative, but an apparent difficulty with recent LCM implementations is identified. Better descriptions of array electrostatics may involve developing good fitting equations for AFEFs derived from accurate numerical solution of Laplace's equation, perhaps with equation form(s) guided qualitatively by FSEPP-model results. In existing fitting formulas, the AFEF-reduction decreases exponentially as c increases, which {{is different from the}} FSEPP-model formulas. This discrepancy needs to be investigated, using systematic Laplace-based simulations and appropriate results analysis. FSEPP models might provide a useful provisional guide to the qualitative behaviour of small field emitter clusters larger than those investigated here...|$|E
