40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the testing is to characterize Ni-H 2 cells for successful integration into the electrical power system (EPS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A broad spectrum of Ni-H 2 design technology is encompassed by the testing configurations; tests include cells with dates of manufacture as early as 1976. The database includes cells of varied storage times, capacity, plate design, stack design, terminal configuration, pressure vessel thickness, separator material, potassium hydroxide (KOH) concentration, and thermal control. Currently, 196 Ni-H 2 cells are being tested, grouped as follows: 12 RNH- 35 - 3, 14 RNH- 30 - 1, 22 HST cells (1 battery, flight spare lot), 132 HST cells (6 batteries, test modules 1 and 2, called TM 1 and TM 2), 12 HST cells (3 four-cell packs, TM 1, TM 2, flight spare module FSM), and 4 HST cells (engineering lot). In addition to the characterization and life testing, an extensive thermal vacuum and <b>purge</b> <b>test</b> was conducted in November 1989 and February 1990 using the HST FSM (3 batteries composed of 69 HST cells from the flight spare lot) to help verify thermal design.

30|$|The San Vito- 1 {{well was}} drilled in 1980 without any major {{challenges}} up to 2000  m depth {{due to the}} experience already gained from the other three high-temperature drilling projects in the Mofete field. The first fishing job at 2330  m resulted {{in some parts of}} equipment left inside the wellbore. The well was side-tracked just below the 9 5 / 8 ″ production casing. Mud gelling and coagulation was experienced at 2488  m. An attempt of freeing the drill string with explosive materials failed due to high temperatures decomposing the explosive charges. Another attempt of side-tracking the well with coil tubing also failed and another ‘fish’ was left inside the hole. A back-off fishing procedure proved to be successful at 2013  m; however, around 400  m of drill string was left at the well bottom. Drilling was later continued to 3045  m and completed at the same depth with slotted liner pipe. At 2500  m, only the melting of zinc samples was successful in registering well temperatures of about 419  °C. Production tests were attempted; however, the well showed a rapid increase of temperature at the wellhead, which was not rated for temperatures in excess of 300  °C. The San Vito- 1 well was eventually killed (Baron and Ungemach 1980). Later analysis from <b>purge</b> <b>test</b> results proved that reservoir fluid from the San Vito- 1 well had a pH level of 3.2 (De Vito et al. 1989) proving aggressive downhole environment.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} a multilayer insulation (MLI) system mounted on a spherical liquid hydrogen propellant tank. The MLI consisted of two blankets of insulation each containing 15 double-aluminized Mylar radiation shields separated by double silk net spacers. The gaseous nitrogen initially contained within the MLI system and vacuum chamber was purged with gaseous helium introduced both underneath the MLI and into the vacuum chamber. The MLI panels were assumed to be purged primarily by means of gas diffusion. Overall, test results indicated that nitrogen concentrations well below 1 percent could be achieved everywhere within the MLI system. Typical times to achieve 1 percent nitrogen concentration within the MLI panels ranged from 69 minutes {{at the top of}} the tank to 158 minutes at the bottom of the tank. Four space-hold thermal performance tests indicated no significant thermal degradation of the MLI system had occurred due to the <b>purge</b> <b>tests</b> conducted.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic model}} is developed for a steam/methane-reforming reactor that uses concentrated solar radiation {{as the source}} of high-temperature process heat. The model incorporates a set of lumped-parameter reservoirs for mass and energy. For each reservoir, the unsteady mass and energy conservation equations are formulated, which couple conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer with the temperature dependent chemical conversion. Radiative exchange, the dominant heat transfer mode at above 800 K, is solved by a band-approximation Monte Carlo technique. The dynamic model is applied to predict the transient behavior of a 400 kW prototype solar reformer in operational modes of <b>purging,</b> thermal <b>testing,</b> startup, chemical reaction, shutdown, and cyclical operation. Time constants vary between 2 s for species transport and 1 × 105 s for thermal energy transport through ceramic insulation.

40|$|The phase {{reaction}} conversion (PRC) {{headspace gas}} chromatographic (HSGC) technique {{was employed to}} develop a method for {{the determination of the}} content of carboxyl groups in wood fibers. Acid treatment of the wood fibers using hydrochloric was applied to convert carboxyl groups to carboxyl acids. Bicarbonate solution is then used to react with carboxyl acids on the treated fibers in the headspace of a testing vial to form carbon dioxide that is analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector using gas chromatography. The conversion reaction was conducted at 60 oC for about 10 minutes to achieve near complete conversion. The contribution to GC detector signal from carbon dioxide formed by residual hydrochloric acid on wood fibers can be accounted for from the known experimental parameters. The effect of carbon dioxide in the headspace of the testing vial air was calibrated or can be eliminated by <b>purging</b> the <b>testing</b> vial using nitrogen before experiment.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of decompression treatment as a non-destructive method to control larvae of the powderpost beetle, Lyctus africanus Lesne, was evaluated {{in the laboratory}} using various combinations of two pressure levels, 1. 1 kPa and 40 kPa, and three temperature levels, 20, 25, and 40 °C. Larval mortality generally depended on weight reduction while decreases in the oxygen level had relatively little effect. The lower pressure, 1. 1 kPa, significantly affected mortality, and no larvae survived after 12 h of this pressure treatment, at 25 °C. The average body weight was reduced with treatment time and temperature, and the reduction rate at 25 °C was higher than that at the lower temperature, 20 °C. Effects on larvae of the higher pressure treatment, 40 kPa, with a CO 2 gas <b>purge,</b> were <b>tested</b> to determine the feasibility of decompression treatment in the manufacturing process. Although higher pressure resulted in low mortality, the body weight was dramatically decreased using the CO 2 purge.

In this study, the instrument was used to investigate the effects of harsh environments on the fracture energies of organosilicate glass (OSG) and silicon carbonitride (SiCN) thin films under four-point bend loading. Experiment {{results showed that the}} energy release rates of film stacks are the highest when the environment contains a very low water molecule concentration. This condition can be achieved by <b>purging</b> the <b>testing</b> chamber with pure nitrogen or reducing the chamber pressure to less than 1 Pa. In contrast, cracks propagated readily along OSG/SiCN interfaces when experiments were performed submerged in de-ionized (DI) water. The effect of low temperature (- 30 °C) on thin film fracture was also studied and the results demonstrated that there is no observed degradation of the OSG fracture properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to identify the chemical composition of the fracture surfaces.

40|$|In glaciated areas till {{can serve}} as a leaky {{aquitard}} for fractured bedrock aquifers. The characterization of a leaky till mantled fractured bedrock aquifer is presented. Multiple high resolution data sets were collected in response to unprecedented changes in the hydraulic head at a research site in eastern Massachusetts. Local scale aquifer and aquitard hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity and storativity values are determined through the analysis of <b>purge</b> recovery <b>tests</b> using Ostendorf and DeGroot (2010) and Cooper et al (1967) theories. The local scale parameters are in turn used to determine large scale aquifer transmissivity and storativity through an analysis of the drawdown due to irrigation pumping using Hantush (1960). It is confirmed that the till acts as a leaky aquitard to the fractured bedrock aquifer, with geometric mean hydraulic conductivities of 7. 2 E- 9 m/s for the till and 1. 6 E- 7 m/s for the bedrock. The storativity of the till is 2. 7 E- 4 while that of the fractured bedrock is 6. 7 E- 5. The transmissivity values determined through Cooper et al.

This method was applied to measuring THCs in a front opening universal pod (FOUP) under static and purge conditions. XCDA ® purge gas was used for this experiment. XCDA gas is clean dry air (CDA) purified with Aeronex ® purification technology to remove moisture to less than 1 part-per-billion (ppb) and hydrocarbons, sulfur, and siloxane contaminants to less than 1 ppt. The experiment reveals that a FOUP’s environment contains ppb levels of THCs under static conditions and ppt concentration levels of THCs under <b>purge</b> conditions.

Testing performed on highly volatile liquids such as cleaning solvents has proven problematic due to inconsistent test results (non-ignitions). Non-ignition results can be misinterpreted as favorable oxygen compatibility, although {{they are more likely}} associated with inadequate fuel-to-oxidizer ratios. Forced evaporation during purging and inadequate sample size were identified as two potential causes for inadequate available sample material during testing. In an effort to maintain adequate fuel-to-oxidizer ratios within the reaction vessel during test, several parameters were considered, including sample size, pretest sample chilling, pretest <b>purging,</b> and <b>test</b> pressure. Tests on a variety of solvents exhibiting a range of volatilities are presented in this paper.

Execution of the final proposed improved test protocol outlines an incremental step method of determining optimal conditions using increased sample sizes while considering test system safety limits. The proposed improved test method increases confidence in results obtained by utilizing the ASTM G 72 autogenous ignition temperature test method and can aid in the oxygen compatibility assessment of highly volatile liquids and other conditions that may lead to false non-ignition results...|$|R

40|$|Regression {{coefficients}} {{specify the}} partial {{effect of a}} regressor on the dependent variable. Sometimes the bivariate or limited multivariate relationship of that regressor variable with the dependent variable is known from population-level data. We show here that such population- level data {{can be used to}} reduce variance and bias about estimates of those regression coefficients from sample survey data. The method of constrained MLE is used to achieve these improvements. Its statistical properties are first described. The method constrains the weighted sum of all the covariate-specific associations (partial effects) of the regressors on the dependent variable to equal the overall association of one or more regressors, where the latter is known exactly from the population data. We refer to those regressors whose bivariate or limited multivariate relationships with the dependent variable are constrained by population data as being ‘‘directly constrained. ’’ Our study investigates the improvements in the estimation of directly constrained variables as well as the improvements in the estimation of other regressor variables that may be correlated with the directly constrained variables, and thus ‘‘indirectly constrained’’ by the population data. The example application is to the marital fertility of black versus white women. The difference between white and black women’s rates of marital fertility, available from population-level data, gives the overall association of race with fertility. We show that the constrained MLE technique both provides a far more powerful statistical test of the partial effect of being black and <b>purges</b> the <b>test</b> of a bias that would otherwise distort the estimated magnitude of this effect. We find only trivial reductions, however, in the standard errors of the parameters for indirectly constrained regressors...|$|R

40|$|The purging {{operations}} for cryogenic main propulsion systems of upper stage are usually carried {{out for the}} following cases: 1) Purging of the Fill/Drain line after completion of propellant loading. This operation allows the removal of residual propellant mass; and 2) Purging of the Feed/Drain line if the mission is scrubbed. The lines would be purged by connections to a ground high-pressure gas storage source.

40|$|Antiretroviral {{therapy is}} {{currently}} only capable of controlling HIV replication rather than completely eradicating virus from patients. This {{is due in}} part to the establishment of a latent virus reservoir in resting CD 4 + T cells, which persists even in the presence of HAART. It is thought that forced activation of latently infected cells could induce virus production, allowing targeting of the cell by the immune response. A variety of molecules are able to stimulate HIV from latency. However no <b>tested</b> <b>purging</b> strategy has proven capable of eliminating the infection completely or preventing viral rebound if therapy is stopped. Hence novel latency activation approaches are required. Nanoparticles can offer several advantages over more traditional drug delivery methods, including improved drug solubility, stability, and the ability to simultaneously target multiple different molecules to particular cell or tissue types. Here we describe the development of a novel lipid nanoparticle with the protein kinase C activator bryostatin- 2 incorporated (LNP-Bry). These particles can target and activate primary human CD 4 + T-cells and stimulate latent virus production from human T-cell lines in vitro and from latently infected cells in a humanized mouse model ex vivo. This activation was synergistically enhanced by the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate. Furthermore, LNP-Bry can also be loaded with the protease inhibitor nelfinavir (LNP-Bry-Nel), producing a particle capable of both activating latent virus and inhibiting viral spread.

40|$|Even after {{extended}} {{treatment with}} powerful antiretroviral drugs, HIV {{is not completely}} eliminated from infected individuals. Latently infected CD 4 + T cells constitute one reservoir of replication-competent HIV {{that needs to be}} eliminated to completely purge virus from antiretroviral drug-treated patients. However, a major limitation in the development of therapies to eliminate this latent reservoir is the lack of relevant in vivo models {{that can be used to}} <b>test</b> <b>purging</b> strategies. Here, we show that the humanized BLT (bone marrow-liver-thymus) mouse can be used as both an abundant source of primary latently infected cells for ex vivo latency analysis and also as an in vivo system for the study of latency. We demonstrate that over 2 % of human cells recovered from the spleens of HIV-infected BLT mice can be latently infected and that this virus is integrated, activation inducible, and replication competent. The non-tumor-inducing phorbol esters prostratin and 12 -deoxyphorbol- 13 -phenylacetate can each induce HIV ex vivo from these latently infected cells, indicating that this model can be used as a source of primary cells for testing latency activators. Finally, we show activation-inducible virus is still present following suppression of plasma viral loads to undetectable levels by using the antiretroviral drugs zidovudine, indinavir sulfate, and didanosine, demonstrating that this model can also be used to assess the in vivo efficacy of latency-purging strategies. Therefore, the HIV-infected BLT mouse should provide a useful model for assessment of HIV latency activators and approaches to eliminate persistent in vivo HIV reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) are {{promising}} power generating devices that use an electrochemical reaction {{to convert the}} energy from hydrogen fuel into usable electricity. One cell produces a small voltage so many cells are combined in series {{in order to produce}} a useful voltage, this configuration is referred to as a stack. Hydrogen is supplied to the anode of the stack in amounts greater than the electrochemical reaction requires to guarantee that enough hydrogen is available for every cell in the stack and to provide enough pressure throughout the cell flow channels for good mass transfer. For reasonable fuel efficiency, the anode outlet gas containing unconverted hydrogen is recycled (or recirculated) back to the anode inlet. PEMFC performance is highest when pure hydrogen fuel is supplied, however, nitrogen at the cathode will permeate through the membrane and accumulate in the anode gas with recirculation. Nitrogen buildup dilutes the hydrogen gas which adversely affects fuel cell performance at the anode. Also, in practical applications hydrogen-rich gas produced from reformed methane, called reformate, is used as the fuel. Reformate contains impurities such as, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur compounds. This thesis will focus on trace levels of carbon monoxide entering in the hydrogen fuel stream, and the impact of contaminant build-up due to anode recirculation. Carbon monoxide adsorbs readily onto the platinum catalyst sites, called poisoning, thus decreasing PEMFC performance. In efforts to minimize the buildup of impurities and crossed over nitrogen, a portion of the anode outlet gas is periodically and continuously purged to the exhaust. How often the outlet gas is purged depends on a variable called the purge fraction. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of purge fraction on PEMFC performance, measured by the average cell voltage, for a Hydrogenics 10 cell stack. The operating parameters used for testing and the experimental apparatus were designed to mimic a Hydrogenics 8 kW Hydrogen Fuel Cell Power Module. A pump connected between the anode outlet and anode inlet form the anode recirculation loop. In Phase 1 of the test program the effect of purge in the absence of carbon monoxide was studied to see if hydrogen dilution from nitrogen crossover and accumulation would cause significant cell voltage degradation. In Phase 2 the effect down to 0. 2 ppm carbon monoxide was evaluated. The results showed that nitrogen buildup, in the absence of carbon monoxide, did not significantly penalize the cell performance in the range of <b>purge</b> fractions <b>tested.</b> However, for the same purge fraction but with as little as 0. 2 ppm carbon monoxide present, the voltage loss was significant. A discussion of the effect of purge on the impurity concentration and the associated cell voltage degradation is detailed with particular emphasis on carbon monoxide poisoning...|$|R

We then applied the PCR tests to estimate the prevalence of O. viverrini and H. taichui infections from {{a random sample of}} individuals selected from a community in an area of endemicity in Khong District, Laos. PCR results were compared with those from the Kato-Katz (KK) method and the formalin-ether concentration technique (FECT). When validated with <b>purge</b> results, PCR <b>tests</b> of O. viverrini and H. taichui had sensitivities of 93. 7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 85. 8 to 97. 9 %) and 73. 3 % (95 % CI, 60. 3 to 83. 9 %) and could detect as little as 0. 75 pg DNA and 1. 32 ng DNA, respectively. The PCR-determined community prevalences of O. viverrini and H. taichui infections were 63. 9 % (95 % CI, 54. 1 to 72. 9 %) and 30. 6 % (95 % CI, 22. 1 to 40. 2 %), respectively.

40|$|The {{research}} presented {{focuses on}} the use of Carbon-dioxide (CO?), Nitrogen (N?) and Argon (Ar) as purge gases for torrefaction. Torrefaction using CO? as a purge gas may further improve the fuel characteristics of the torrefied fuel when compared to N? and Ar (which are entirely inert), making it better suited for use as a fuel for co-firing with coal or gasification. Three different biomasses were investigated: Juniper wood chips, Mesquite wood chips, and forage Sorghum. Experiments were conducted using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA Instruments Model Q- 600) to determine the effect of the purge gas over a wide range of torrefaction temperatures (200 - 300 ?C). TGA weight traces (thermograms) showed an increased mass loss when using CO 2 as a purge gas when compared to N?. The increased mass loss when CO? was used is attributed to a hypothesized reaction between the CO? and fixed Carbon contained within the biomass. Torrefaction of biomass, using Ar as the purge gas, produced results similar to torrefaction using N?. Derivative Thermo-Gravimetric analysis (DTG) was done to determine the temperature ranges over which the three main components of biomass (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) decomposed. The DTG results are in agreement with previously published research. From TGA thermograms and DTG analysis it was determined that torrefaction at higher temperatures (> 260 ?C) likely result in the breakdown of cellulose during torrefaction, an undesired outcome. Proximate, ultimate, and heat value analysis was done on all three biomasses. All three contain a relatively high Oxygen content, which serves to decrease the higher heating value (HHV) of the biomass. The HHV of Juniper, Mesquite, and Sorghum on a dry ash-free (DAF) basis were 20, 584 kJ/kg, 20, 128 kJ/kg, and 19, 389 kJ/kg respectively. The HHV of the three biomasses were relatively constant as expected for agricultural biomass. From TGA analysis (thermograms and DTG), an optimal torrefaction temperature was determined (240 ?C) based upon the amount of mass lost during torrefaction and estimates of energy retained. Batch torrefaction of all three biomasses at the optimal torrefaction temperature was completed using a laboratory oven. All three biomasses were torrefied using CO?, N?, and Ar as a purge gas. Proximate, ultimate, and heat value analysis was done for each of the torrefied fuels and compared. Results of the fuel property analysis showed torrefaction reduced the moisture content and oxygen percentage of the fuel resulting in the torrefied biomass having a larger HHV when compared to raw biomass. Due to inherent mass lost during torrefaction, the amount of energy retained in the torrefied biomass was calculated to determine the percentage of the virgin biomass energy content that remained. Torrefaction using CO 2 resulted in the lowest amount of energy retention of all three <b>purge</b> gases <b>tested</b> (78. 86 % for Juniper); conversely, Nitrogen resulted in the highest amount of energy retention (91. 81 % for Sorghum.) Torrefaction of the biomass also increased the fixed carbon (FC) content of the fuel. The grindability of the torrefied biomass was investigated via size distribution analysis of the raw and ground biomass. Initial size distribution analysis showed that torrefaction of Mesquite and Juniper resulted in smaller particle sizes; with a greater fraction of the torrefied biomass passing through smaller meshes. Analysis of the ground biomass samples showed that torrefaction improved the grindability of the fuel. The percent of torrefied biomass that passed through an 840 micrometer mesh increased by over 20 % for both Mesquite and Juniper when ground. Sorghum exhibited similar increases; however, the amount of increase is less apparent due to the smaller particle size distribution of the raw Sorghum...|$|R
40|$|In {{the long}} shadows of Norway’s post-war purge: Second generation’s {{problems}} {{in light of}} modern transition theory. The first «wave» of transitions from authoritarian rule to democracy in modern times in Southern Europe in the 1970 s and ensuing similar «waves» {{in other parts of}} the world, renewed the field of political science. Analyses of the democratization process in specific countries focused on the role of key political actors of the old regime and the democratic opposition, and on how the actors through the negotiation of pacts could bring about peaceful regime change. Political scientists also stressed the dynamic nature of modern regime transitions and how decisions made under uncertainty in that particular context often produce unintended consequences. Another perspective associated with modern transition theory is that of transitional justice (TJ). In this literature, the key question is how new democracies deal with the past, i. e. the old regime and its crimes. Should victims be compensated, and should perpetrators be prosecuted? If so, who should be compensated, who should be brought to court, and what are the short- and long-term effects of these decisions? Here, an attempt is made to study social consequences of post-transitional legal trials empirically. My PhD-dissertation essentially belongs within the TJ-tradition, but the emphasis is not on ex-perpetrators or their victims but on negative, long-term effects of a post-transitional legal process as experienced by the 2 nd generation: To what extent, and in what ways, have children of former collaborators in Norway been affected by unforeseen social consequences of the extensive legal trials in 1945, after the German occupation (rettsoppgjøret) ? Political decisions made with regard to TJ under given circumstances affect the lives of large numbers of people for a long time. In spite of this, transition theory so far largely has ignored this phenomenon. This dissertation, based on internationally unique survey data, accordingly is explorative and could be described as a pioneer study both theoretically and empirically. As a point of departure, a model is developed which combines two strands of transition theory; theories on regime change and on the effects of various forms of TJ: (table not included) From this model, the dissertation's main hypothesis is derived as follows: An elite-controlled transition (from above) brought about by use of force, such as the one in Norway in 1945 (cf. transition type number 3 in table A), typically leads to strict and wide-reaching purges and in the next stage enduring social consequences for the numerous prosecuted and their families. In the thesis I therefore hypothesize that Norway's transition and the subsequent settlement with every single member of the collaborationist party «Nasjonal Samling» (NS) has had a negative and long-lasting effect on the daily lives of many collaborator descendants. In countries where the transition to democracy takes a different form, so will post-transitional justice. Accordingly the long-term social effects caused by regime change should also be different from the Norwegian example or similar cases. The bulk of the thesis consists of six separate but closely related articles that highlight selected aspects of the post-transitional <b>purge</b> and <b>test</b> empirical hypotheses on different consequences for the approximately 100 000 NS-children, i. e. Norwegians whose fathers were once sentenced for treason. The first article (Al) looks at the power relations, key actors and main principles that formed the Norwegian purge in 1945 and argues that the legal process intensified the stigma attached to ex-collaborators and impeded society's willingness to reconciliate itself with at the individual level. Findings also indicate that negative effects, as expected, persevered for many years after 1945. Thus, the two predictions from my main hypothesis; that many NS­ children were affected and for a long time, were both supported by the data. While the 2 nd generation over the years became less exposed to stigmatization (A 5), the psychological stress of being the child of someone sentenced for treason has been more enduring, and is still felt today by NS-descendants (A 3). A series of «social mechanisms» accounted for a great deal of variation within the 2 nd generation sample. Specific characteristics of an NS-child, its parents or the local environment were associated with a greater susceptibility to some of the problems. Notably and counter-intuitively, negative effects were generally independent of whether the respondent's father had been an active collaborator or a «passive» NS-member. Another counter-intuitive result regards variation in mental health: Contrary to previous findings, men did not report significantly fewer stress symptoms than women. In the concluding article (A 6), my model is first elaborated and then tested by way of a comparison between results from my Norwegian survey and main tendencies found in international literature on the post-war experiences of German and Austrian NS-children. This dissertation contributes to the literature on TJ in two ways: First, my case study develops four new theoretical concepts: i) «Transitional injustice» refers to unfairness created by TJ­ decisions, ii) «transitional depowerment» denotes the marginalization of those who are prosecuted after the transition and iii) «transitional empowerment» is the multifaceted, positive effect of belonging to certain groups after the fall of the old regime. The fourth and last concept, iv) «transitional victimization», refers to negative consequences of democratic transitions for others than those who are charged for their own actions during the old regime. Secondly, my work also draws attention to how the essentially unpredictable nature of the transitional process is associated with a considerable risk for unintended, social consequences of different forms of TJ, consequences that transition theorists have largely failed to explore. them. In the second article (A 2), the purge and the ensuing lack of collective reconciliation in Norway is analysed in the light of modern TJ-theory and compared to recent examples of post-conflict tradition-based reconciliation in sub-Saharan Africa. The next three articles (A 3 -A 5) all use quantitative data, mainly from my own survey among children of former NS-members, to examine possible unintended consequences of Norway's post-war purge with respect to mental health (A 3), paternal relationship (A 4) and stigmatization (A 5). Results from my survey suggest that most 2 nd generation descendants, as expected, experienced problems in one or more of the three areas but also show considerable variation...|$|R
40|$|Published {{scientific}} work indicates that residential large diameter drinking water wells {{are at a}} higher risk of contamination from surface water impacts than drilled wells. The possibility of a higher incidence of contamination of large diameter wells is attributed to site selection and construction problems such as leaking joints in the well casing, ineffective annular sealant placed between the well casing and the formation, a poorly fitted cover with an access lid that promotes contaminant entry and air entry without adequate air filtration, well location down gradient of septic effluent sources, and depth limitations due to improper equipment used to advance the well which results in shallow wells often situated in topographical lows. In some situations, flaws in the well design were actually deliberate measures intended to capture surface water at sites with low groundwater yield. Historically, residential drinking water well performance studies have focussed on existing wells; however, uncertainty in the actual well construction methods and materials, well age and maintenance efforts have been problematic. A field and laboratory study was completed to assess the performance of several design changes that were thought to improve the integrity of large diameter drinking water wells, and to determine whether one design is more prone to atmospheric and/or surface water contamination than the other. Four large diameter residential wells were installed at a study site in Lindsay, Ontario. Three of these wells are constructed with enhanced construction methods (two using a cement tile casing and one using a galvanized steel casing) and annular sealants, while the fourth was constructed using conventional methods for cement cased wells. The enhanced test wells utilized a sealant between the casing sections, various annular sealants between the formation and the well casing, sanitary waterline connections, and ventilation with air filtration. The well constructed using outdated methods did not have any of these advanced features. An automated water extraction system removed about 875 L/day from each well to mimic residential usage. Routine monitoring, and laboratory and field testing were used to collect pertinent data required for this performance assessment. Routine monitoring involved the visual inspection of the wells, collection of well water elevation, collection of soil temperature profile data, collection and analysis of water samples, and collection of cumulative water volumes <b>purged</b> from the <b>test</b> wells. A biofilm cleaning study and analysis of cement-bentonite grout was conducted in the laboratory while smoke and aqueous tracer tests were conducted in the field. The biofilm cleaning study entailed growing a biofilm on different large diameter well casing materials and applying cleaning methods thought to be practical for cleaning the interior walls of large diameter wells. Different mixtures of cement-bentonite grout were subjected to volume measurements, vertical load bearing capacity analysis, and hydraulic conductivity analysis to determine their suitability as a potential annular sealant. The tracer tests were developed to determine whether pathways for either airborne contaminants or surface water to enter the test wells exist. The test wells were filled with smoke and monitored for potential atmospheric pathways. A tracer solution was infiltrated around the test wells and the interior of the tests wells were monitored for potential pathways for surface water to enter. Bacteriological indicators were detected in all test wells. The smoke tracer tests demonstrated that pathways for airborne contaminants to enter the test wells exist with more pathways observed in the winter than the summer. The aqueous tracer tests highlighted several areas where surface water could enter the test wells if ponding occurred around the well casing. As expected the enhanced test wells performed much better than the conventional test well for both of these tracer tests. The results of the biofilm cleaning study indicated that galvanized steel or fibreglass casing materials were the only materials able to be cleaned effectively. The best method in this study to remove biofilm from casing materials was pressure washing. The results from the cement-bentonite grout investigation indicated that cement-bentonite grout with 5 % bentonite would make the most suitable annular sealant as its volume changed the least during curing, it was strong enough to support the load from maintenance efforts, and was the most impervious. The results {{of this study indicate that}} large diameter wells constructed with a proper annular sealant, sealant between casing sections and a sanitary waterline connection are less prone to contamination. Monitoring of the test wells should continue as they mature to determine whether this plays a significant role in their ability to prevent contamination of large diameter wells. Smoke tracer tests should be conducted again during the winter to determine if temperature was the cause of increased atmospheric pathways. A field-scale method to remove biofilm from the interior casing wall of large diameter wells should be developed and tested. A field-scale investigation of cement-bentonite grout for use as an annular sealant should be completed. Fibreglass casings can be fabricated as a continuous piece with no seams or joints and hence another well should be constructed and studied using corrugated fibreglass (NSF ANSI 61) casing...|$|R
