40|$|Animal-based {{theories}} of Pavlovian conditioning propose that patterning discriminations are solved using unique cues or immediate configuring. Recent studies with humans, however, provided evidence that in {{positive and negative}} patterning two different rules are utilized. The present experiment was designed to provide further support for this proposal by tracking {{the time course of}} the allocation of cognitive resources. One group was trained in a positive patterning; schedule (A-, B-, AB+) and a second in a negative patterning schedule (A+, B+, AB-). Electrodermal responses and secondary task probe reaction time were measured. In negative patterning, reaction times were slower during reinforced stimuli than during non-reinforced stimuli at both probe positions while there were no differences in <b>positive</b> <b>patterning.</b> These results support the assumption that negative patterning is solved using a rule that is more complex and requires more resources than does the rule employed to solve <b>positive</b> <b>patterning.</b> (C) 2001 Elsevier Science (USA) ...|$|E

40|$|Humans and {{non-human}} {{animals are}} capable of learning complex discriminations that seemingly reflect general rules. However, this does not necessitate that they actually understand the underlying rules; their behavior may be mediated by simple associations. One way to investigate the underlying cognitive mechanisms is to investigate behavior of human and non-human animals in similar yet novel situations. Abstraction of a rule and subsequent application of that rule to a novel set of cues seems to be {{beyond the scope of}} association formation models.

We used olfactory conditioning of the honeybees ’ proboscis extension reflex (PER), a paradigm in which odors can be associated with a reinforcement of sucrose solution. Bees were asked to discriminate reinforced from nonreinforced olfactory stimuli. They were trained with two elemental odors (A and B) versus a binary olfactory mixture.

40|$|Object {{detection}} can {{be posted}} as those classification tasks where the rare <b>positive</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are to be}} distinguished from the enormous negative patterns. To avoid the danger of missing <b>positive</b> <b>patterns,</b> more attention should be payed on them. Therefore there should be different requirements for False Reject Rate (FRR) and False Accept Rate (FAR), and learning a classifier should use an asymmetric factor to balance between FRR and FAR. In this paper, a normalized asymmetric classification error is proposed for the task of rejecting negative patterns. Minimizing it not only controls the ratio of FRR and FAR, but more importantly limits the upper-bound of FRR. The latter characteristic is advantageous for those tasks {{where there is a}} requirement for low FRR. Based on this normalized asymmetric classification error, we develop an asymmetric AdaBoost algorithm with variable asymmetric factor and apply it to the learning of cascade classifiers for face detection. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves less complex classifiers and better performance than some previous AdaBoost methods. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{honeybee}} {{olfactory system}} is a well-established model for understanding functional mechanisms of learning and memory. Olfactory stimuli are first processed in the antennal lobe, and then transferred to the mushroom body and lateral horn through dual pathways termed medial and lateral antennal lobe tracts (m-ALT and l-ALT). Recent studies reported that honeybees can perform elemental learning by associating an odour with a reward signal even after lesions in m-ALT or blocking the mushroom bodies. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} lateral pathway (l-ALT) is sufficient for elemental learning, we modelled local computation within glomeruli in antennal lobes with axons of projection neurons connecting to a decision neuron (LHN) in the lateral horn. We show that inhibitory spike-timing dependent plasticity (modelling non-associative plasticity by exposure to different stimuli) in the synapses from local neurons to projection neurons decorrelates the projection neurons' outputs. The strength of the decorrelations is regulated by global inhibitory feedback within antennal lobes to the projection neurons. By additionally modelling octopaminergic modification of synaptic plasticity among local neurons in the antennal lobes and projection neurons to LHN connections, the model can discriminate and generalize olfactory stimuli. Although <b>positive</b> <b>patterning</b> can be accounted for by the l-ALT model, negative patterning requires further processing and mushroom body circuits. Thus, our model explains several-but not all-types of associative olfactory learning and generalization by a few neural layers of odour processing in the l-ALT. As an outcome of the combination between non-associative and associative learning, the modelling approach allows us to link changes in structural organization of honeybees' antennal lobes with their behavioural performances over the course of their life...|$|E

In the first experiment, rats demonstrated a rapid acquisition of the PPD with an appropriate discriminative responding. Rats submitted to posttraining hippocampal lesions (using multiple injections of ibotenic acid) were no longer able to master correctly the previously solved discrimination, demonstrating significant differences in their response rates during the 2 never-reinforced elemental stimulus presentations. In Experiment II, lesioned rats were not able to correctly learn the PPD, demonstrating the same pattern of responding as in Experiment I. These rats were also severely disrupted in a radial maze elimination task. Experiment IIIa indicated that, in a simple conditioning task (T+, L+), normal rats acquired a rapid conditioned suppression for both stimuli, with the tone being slightly more susceptible to conditioning than the light stimulus. In Experiment IIIb, conditioning to the compound tone plus light stimulus led to a clear conditioning to the tone and almost no conditioning to the light, suggesting an overshadowing from the tone to the light. Similar results were obtained in rats with hippocampal lesions. These results strongly suggest that the disruption showed by rats with hippocampal lesions in the PPD task cannot be due to an alteration of the relative salience of the stimulus. The inability of rats with hippocampal lesions to solve correctly the PPD is due to difficulties in eliminating responding to some unimportant events of the situation, reflecting a deficit in selective attention processes rather than in an ability to process configural stimuli. In the discussion, the putative role of the hippocampus in selective attentional processes is more fully discussed...|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{statistical}} patterns {{between environmental}} stimuli enables organisms to respond adaptively when cues are later observed. However, stimuli are often obscured from detection, necessitating behavior {{under conditions of}} ambiguity. Considerable evidence indicates decisions under ambiguity rely on inference processes that draw on past experiences to generate predictions under novel conditions. Despite the high demand for this process and the observation that it deteriorates disproportionately with age, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We developed a rodent model of decision-making during ambiguity to examine features of experience that contribute to inference. Rats learned either a simple (<b>positive</b> <b>patterning)</b> or complex (negative patterning) instrumental discrimination between the illumination {{of one or two}} lights. During test, only one light was lit while the other relevant light was blocked from physical detection (covered by an opaque shield, rendering its status ambiguous). We found experience with the complex negative patterning discrimination was necessary for rats to behave sensitively to the ambiguous test situation. These rats behaved as if they inferred the presence of the hidden light, responding differently than when the light was explicitly absent (uncovered and unlit). Differential expression profiles of the immediate early gene cFos indicated hippocampal involvement in the inference process while localized microinfusions of the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, into the dorsal hippocampus caused rats to behave as if only one light was present. That is, blocking cholinergic modulation prevented the rat from inferring the presence of the hidden light. Collectively, these results suggest cholinergic modulation mediates recruitment of hippocampal processes related to past experiences and transfer of these processes to make decisions during ambiguous situations. Our results correspond with correlations observed between human brain function and inference abilities, suggesting our experiments may inform interventions to alleviate or prevent cognitive dysfunction. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

Sarjana Thesis. English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Sukarsono, M. Pd Keywords: Representative Acts, Illocutionary Acts, Conversational Fragments, Speech Acts, Pragmatics. Language is {{the main}} means {{communicating}} ideas with other people, either symbolic, written or orally. In communication, people talk with different listener differently in different situations. On one account, communication not only depends on recognizing the meaning of words in every utterance, but also recognizing {{what is meant by}} the utterance. Then, the meaning of each utterance itself is not only seen from lexical meaning but also from the situation and context. Context is very important to be considered. The study about contextual meaning is called pragmatics. This study pragmatically attempts to analyze representative acts, a kind of speech act that state what the speaker believes to be the case or not. The types of representative acts include informing, asserting, claiming, assuring, arguing, complaining, concluding, describing, and predicting. This study is conducted because the language of the native speaker film is an ideal manifestation of language use. By studying the realization of representative acts of the language used in “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”, we can have good model how to realize English whenever we want to make some expressions and the teacher can take some samples to teach their students in having communication based on the situational context. Thus, this study would be of one valuable step for researched based teaching material for speaking class. The formulations of the research problem were: (1) what types of representative acts are found in conversational fragments in film ‘Harry Potter and the Philoshoper’s Stone’? (2) how are the formal patterns of those representative acts? (3) what is the frequency of each type of representative act found and its formal patterns in conversational fragments in film ‘Harry Potter and the Philoshoper’s Stone’? The purposes of this study were: (1) to know what type of representative acts found in conversational fragments in film ‘Harry Potter and the Philoshoper’s Stone’ 2) to know the formal patterns of representative acts in the conversational fragments in film “Harry Potter andthe Philoshoper’s Stone” 3) to find out the frequency of the type of representative acts and its formal pattern as found in conversational fragments in film “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”. The research design of the study is descriptive quantitative survey which employs pragmatic analysis. It is intended to investigate those three research problems in relation to representative acts. The data collecting method used is documentation. The data are the utterances in conversational fragments found in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone movie containing representative acts with population 424 utterances and 72 samples taken by purposive sampling. The data are taken from the script of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone movie along with their contexts derived from the movie scenes.

The attentional modulation of reward related learning in awake behaving animals is unclear, but there is growing {{evidence to suggest that}} dopamine may be a key regulator. Using the rat whiskers as a model system, the project aimed to determine how cortex represents attended stimuli in its coordinated activity in a simple detection task, assessing the role of natural variations in attention. Rats were trained to associate vibrotactile stimuli applied to a single vibrissa with the presentation of a liquid reward. Several deflection amplitudes of 60 Hz frequency vibrissa stimulation were investigated around previously identified detection thresholds. During the detection task, neural responses were recorded in single barrel cortex columns and in orbitofrontal cortex using chronically implanted microelectrode arrays. Results suggest that ongoing oscillatory activity before the onset of a weak stimulus has a profound effect on both neural response and behavioural detection. Two further complex conditioning tasks were employed; a paired discrimination and a <b>positive</b> <b>patterning</b> task where tones preceded a vibrotactile stimulation. Optimal psychophysical performance was achieved and serves as a basis for future work to determine the effect of attention on the behavioural and neuronal response to an upcoming tactile stimulation in more complex paradigms. Furthermore, refinements to the head fixed preparation and developments throughout the method were made in order to achieve single unit recordings in midbrain ventral tegmental area and are discussed throughout the thesis.

40|$|The {{differences}} in mental abilities between human and non-human animals have aroused human curiosity from antiquity. At {{the end of}} the 19 th century, researchers started to realize that knowledge about an animal’s learning history was of crucial importance for deriving conclusions about the mental capacities subserving its behavior. In tandem, the question was raised whether the mechanisms underlying learning would be different for humans than for non-human animals. Until now, a consensus on this issue has not been reached. The goal of {{the first part of the}} current research was to investigate in rodents the mechanisms underlying blocking, a phenomenon that can be accounted for by association-formation models as well as by inferential reasoning models of learning. The involvement of inference making in blocking is suggested by effects of (sub) additive pretraining on blocking in humans and rats. However, models have been proposed that put those observations within reach of association-formation accounts. Importantly, such accounts would have difficulties explaining subadditivity posttraining effects in rats. To investigate whether blocking is attenuated by subadditivity posttraining, we aimed to establish a blocking procedure that would yield a strong blocking effect. However, over fifteen experiments we failed to observe a robust blocking effect. We discuss the implications of our failures for the canonical status of blocking and the psychological literature in general. The second goal of this research was to explore to what extent other forms of seemingly rule-based behavior in rats rely on the operation of inferential reasoning processes. Animals are capable of learning complex discriminations that instantiate overarching rules. However, this need not imply that they actually represent those rules. We investigated the generalization of patterning rules in rats, pigeons and humans. All rat and pigeon subjects generalized on the basis of similarity, whereas about half of the human subjects generalized on the basis of rules. In follow-up experiments, we attempted to test for generalization in rats (1) after training on multiple examples and (2) after training on instances of a different rule. However, rats failed to learn the initial discrimination problems in those experiments, preventing us from testing our substantive hypotheses. The third goal of this project was to investigate the potential contribution of three cognitive factors (intelligence, systemizing and visual processing) to individual {{differences in}} learning and generalization of patterning problems observed in humans. Only intelligence seemed to influence learning and generalization, a findings that calls for a re-evaluation of previous claims regarding the cognitive processes involved in the learning of patterning discriminations in humans.

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that insects are “primitive” animals, without {{the ability to}} exhibit complex {{learning}} behaviour. Fortunately, their tiny brains quite often surprise us with their performance. This thesis investigates the plasticity mechanisms of the insect brain through the research method of neurorobotics, i. e., {{the development of a}} physical agent, equipped with a silicon brain. In order to implement such a brain, we have chosen to model it directly onto hardware. Not only does this allow us {{to take advantage of the}} inherent hardware parallelism, but the robot can also behave in a completely autonomous mode, without having to communicate with the software simulator of a remote machine. FPGAs offer both the option for such a lowlevel design approach and the flexibility required in computational studies of biological neural networks. With the use of VHDL (a hardware description language), we develop a simulator for neural networks, designed as a series of computational modules, running in parallel and solving the differential equations which describe neural processes. It has the ability to simulate networks with spiking neurons that follow a phenomenological model, proposed by Izhikevich, which requires only 13 operations per 1 ms of simulation. The synaptic plasticity mechanism can be either that of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) or a modified version of STDP which is also affected by neuromodulators. There are no constraints, as far as the connectivity pattern is concerned. The hardware simulator is then added as a peripheral to an embedded system so that it can be more easily controlled through software and connected to a robot. We show that this hardware system is able to model networks with hundreds of neurons and with a speed performance that is better than real-time. With some slight modifications, it could also scale up to thousands of neurons, starting to approach the size of the insect brain. Subsequently, we use the simulator in order to model a neural network with an architecture inspired by the insect brain, representing the connectivity of the antennal lobe, the mushroom body and the lateral horn, structures which are part of the insect’s olfactory pathway. Our silicon brain is then attached to a robot and its limits and capabilities are tested in a series of experiments. The experiments involve tasks of associative learning inside an arena which is based on a T-maze set-up usually employed in behavioural experiments with flies. The robot is trained to associate different stimuli (or combinations of stimuli) with a punishment, as indicated by the presence of a light source. We observe that the robot can solve most of the tasks, including elemental learning, discrimination learning, biconditional discrimination and negative patterning but fails to solve the problem of <b>positive</b> <b>patterning.</b> It is concluded that the architecture of the insect’s olfactory pathway has the computational efficiency to solve even non-elemental learning tasks. However, this pattern of results does not precisely match the fly, suggesting we have not fully understood the learning mechanisms involved. Moreover, embedding the learning circuit in robot behaviour reveals that the simple version of STDP is not the appropriate mechanism which can link neural plasticity to learning behaviour. Although the modified version of STDP is more suitable, it remains problematic as well as sensitive to timing issues. Therefore, we propose that STDP might function more as a “priming” process rather than as the basic learning mechanism...|$|E

The concept of uniform patterns to obtain histogram features is also applicable to LTP. For simplicity, the three-valued LTP codes are split into their positive and negative bisects which generate two sets of histogram features out of which one corresponds to the <b>positive</b> <b>patterns</b> and the other represents the negative patterns [18].|$|R
40|$|A single-pixel {{camera is}} a {{computational}} imaging device that only requires {{a single point}} detector to capture {{the image of a}} scene. It measures the inner products of the scene and some spatial light modulator patterns, which are to be processed to recover the scene. No matter the strategy used for image recovery, the spatial light modulator patterns have to be positive. In addition, the dark current measured in the absence of modulation must be rejected. So far, both experimental issues have been addressed empirically. In this paper, we solve them from a general perspective. Indeed, we propose to seek <b>positive</b> <b>patterns</b> that are linear combinations of the desired patterns (with negative values) and the linear combinations are chosen to reject the dark current. We refer to the problem of finding the <b>positive</b> <b>patterns</b> and the linear combinations as pattern generalization. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that this problem is introduced. In addition, we show that pattern generalization can be solved using a semi nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm. Results obtained from simulations demonstrate that our approach performs close or better than conventional methods while using fewer measurements...|$|R
40|$|We present {{idealized}} {{models of}} razor [...] thin, axisymmetric, Keplerian stellar discs around a massive black hole, and study non-axisymmetric secular instabilities {{in the absence}} of either counter-rotation or loss cones. These discs are prograde mono-energetic waterbags, whose phase space distribution functions are constant for orbits within a range of eccentricities (e) and zero outside this range. Waterbags which include circular orbits (polarcaps) have one stable linear edge-mode for each azimuthal wavenumber m. The m= 1 mode always has <b>positive</b> <b>pattern</b> speed and, for polarcaps consisting of orbits with e < 0. 9428, only the m= 1 mode has <b>positive</b> <b>pattern</b> speed. Waterbags excluding circular orbits (bands) have two linear edge-modes for each m, which can be stable or unstable. We derive analytical expressions for the instability condition, pattern speeds, growth rates and normal mode structure. Narrow bands are unstable to modes with a wide range in m. Numerical simulations confirm linear theory and follow the non-linear evolution of instabilities. Long-time integration suggests that instabilities of different m grow, interact non-linearly and relax collisionlessly to a coarse-grained equilibrium {{with a wide range of}} e.

40|$|The {{bioaccumulation}} mechanism expresses an increment {{of mercury}} concentration along {{the lifetime of}} each individual. It is generally investigated along the age or size range of organisms from a same population. Water chemistry and trophic position are important factors that may influence the emergence of bioaccumulation patterns. In order to detect the influence of these parameters on fish mercury bioaccumulation patterns, we explored the relations between mercury concentration, size and isotopic trophic position of fish populations of six species (three non piscivorous and three piscivorous) in three rivers of the Itenez basin (Bolivia) with different sediment load in water and anthropogenic impact. Fishes of the Itenez basin showed fairly lower mercury contamination {{in relation to the}} regional context. They presented lower total mercury concentrations in unperturbed clear water river (average of 0. 051 mu g g(- 1) for non piscivores; 0. 088 mu g g(- 1) for piscivores), intermediate values (average of 0. 05 and 0. 104 mu g g(- 1)) in unperturbed white water river, whereas the highest values (average of 0. 062 and 0. 194 mu g g(- 1)) were found in the perturbed clear water river. Piscivore and invertivore species showed significant <b>positive</b> bioaccumulation <b>patterns</b> in the perturbed river and in the unperturbed white water river. No <b>positive</b> <b>pattern</b> was detected in the unperturbed clear water river. <b>Positive</b> <b>patterns</b> could not be attributed to differences in trophic condition and mean fish mercury concentration between populations. Bioaccumulation seems not to be the main factor to explain increased mercury concentrations in fish from the perturbed river...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Static code {{analysis}} tools {{are known to}} flag {{a large number of}} false positives. A false positive is a warning message generated by a static code analysis tool for a location in the source code that does not have any known problems. This thesis presents our approach and results in identifying and documenting false positives generated by static code {{analysis tools}}. The goal of our study was to understand the different kinds of false positives generated so we can (1) automatically determine if a warning message from a static code analysis tool truly indicates an error, and (2) reduce the number of false positives developers must triage. We used two open-source tools and one commercial tool in our study. Our approach led to a hierarchy of 14 core false <b>positive</b> <b>patterns,</b> with some patterns appearing in multiple variations. We implemented checkers to identify the code structures of false <b>positive</b> <b>patterns</b> and to eliminate them from the output of the tools. Preliminary results showed {{that we were able to}} reduce the number of warnings by 14. 0 %- 99. 9 % with a precision of 94. 2 %- 100. 0 % by applying our false positive filters in different cases...|$|R
40|$|An area within {{psychology}} {{that looks}} at the strengths and positive sides of human life has emerged the last decade. It is called positive psychology and one area related to that is positive adaptation. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the natural history of females’ positive extrinsic and intrinsic adaptation from childhood to adulthood, with a focus on typical <b>positive</b> <b>patterns</b> of adaptation and how these patterns develop within the same individual. The sample consisted of about 500 Swedish girls and data were taken at age 13, 15, and 43 from the longitudinal research program Individual Development and Adaptation (IDA). Variable-oriented methods were used to study basic relationships among factors both within age and between childhood and adulthood and person-oriented methods were used to study typical patterns of adaptation and how these patterns develop, using cluster analyses and cross-tabulation of clusters. The overall results show, as expected, more distinct typical <b>positive</b> adaptation <b>patterns</b> in the intrinsic than the extrinsic area in both childhood and adulthood. Significant longitudinal developmental streams between typical <b>positive</b> adaptation <b>patterns</b> in childhood and adulthood were found and these are discussed from a dynamic system perspective suggesting the interaction between factors thru reinforcing feedback processes...|$|R

On the second level, histogram based classifiers judge the pattern using only {{the positions of}} maximization of the first level classifiers. Novel aspects of our approach are: a) using selected parts of the <b>positive</b> <b>pattern</b> as negative training for component classifiers, b) The use of pair wise correlation between facial component positions to bias classifier outputs and achieve superior component localization...|$|R

The internal sequence of nuclei may reasonably attest the presence underground of {{the foundations of the}} fourth wing, including the tower, as indicated in the drawing of Figure 2, both destroyed in the 18 th century. The outer sequence of positive nuclei may, instead, be associated to traces of structural elements connected to the castle, likely the base of the former embankment of the ancient ditch.|$|R

Technically, the attitude towards Europe acts {{as the dependent variable}} whereas the remaining concepts are used as independent variables. The empirical results show Turkish and Polish adolescents are more critical towards Europe than adolescents living in 'old' Europe. Furthermore, the data show that those who hold negative expectations about their personal futures are likely also to be Eurosceptical...|$|R
