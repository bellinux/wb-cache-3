5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a <b>pressure</b> <b>tank.</b> A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} {{hydraulic}} hybrid systems {{may be more}} cost-effective than electrical hybrid systems because no complicated or expensive materials (such as those required for batteries) are used. However, in most designs the <b>pressure</b> <b>tanks</b> of accumulators are made of carbon fiber that make the <b>pressure</b> <b>tanks</b> somewhat expensive, but the price of carbon fiber has been forecasted to drop and economies of scale can {{lower the cost of}} manufacturing the tanks.|$|R
40|$|Calculations were {{performed}} of the thermal system {{of a power}} plant with installed water <b>pressure</b> <b>tanks.</b> The maximum rise in the block electric power resulting from the shut-off of low-pressure regenerative heaters is determined. At that time, the boiler is fed with hot water from water <b>pressure</b> <b>tanks</b> acting as heat accumulators. Accumulation of hot water in water tanks is also proposed in the periods of the power unit small load. In order to lower the plant electric power in the off-peak night hours, water heated in low-pressure regenerative heaters and feed water tank to the nominal temperature is directed to water <b>pressure</b> <b>tanks.</b> The water accumulated during the night is used to feed the boiler {{during the period of}} peak demand for electricity. Drops in the power block electric power were determined for different capacities of the tanks and periods when they are charged. A financial and economic profitability analysis (of costs and benefits) is made of the use of tanks for a 200 MW power unit. Operating in the automatic system of frequency and power control, the tanks may also be used to ensure a sudden increase in the electric power of the unit. The results of the performed calculations and analyses indicate that installation of water <b>pressure</b> <b>tanks</b> is well justified. The investment is profitable. Water <b>pressure</b> <b>tanks</b> may not only be used to reduce the power unit power during the off-peak night hours and raise it in the periods of peak demand, but also to increase the power capacity fast at any time. They may also be used to fill the boiler evaporator with hot water during the power unit start-up from the cold state...|$|R

2500|$|Charmat (...) was {{developed}} and patented in 1895 by the Italian Federico Martinotti (1860–1924). The method was further developed with a new patent by the inventor Eugène Charmat in 1907. The method is now named after the latter, but is also called cuve close, metodo Italiano or the tank method. This production method is used mainly in Italian wines, especially in the Asti province, and in Prosecco wines, as well as cheap variants of Sekt. The wine is mixed in a <b>pressure</b> <b>tank</b> of stainless steel, designed to withstand the pressure, together with sugar and yeast. When the sugar is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, the yeast is filtered and removed, and the wine is bottled. The duration of fermentation affects the quality; longer fermentation preserves the wine's aromas better and gives finer and more durable bubbles.|$|E
2500|$|The first commercially {{practical}} closed-circuit scuba {{was designed}} and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected by a tube to a bag, with (estimated) 50–60% O2 supplied from a copper <b>pressure</b> <b>tank</b> and CO2 chemically absorbed by rope yarn in the bag soaked in a solution of caustic potash. The system allowed use for about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving {{to a depth of}} [...] in open water, upon which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface. The Fleuss apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, who was able to travel [...] in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings. Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure.|$|E

30|$|If the <b>pressures</b> in <b>tanks</b> A and B are P A =  0.053  atm and P B =  0.046  atm, respectively, for {{increasing}} the pressure and ammonia concentration in tank B, the compressor suction valve in this tank is opened. However, the compressor does not start working. Vaporized ammonia from tank A flows into tank B because of the concentration difference, and thus, the ammonia gas <b>pressure</b> in <b>tank</b> B increases. When the ammonia gas <b>pressure</b> in <b>tank</b> A increases, the compressor begins to work; hence, the gas <b>pressure</b> in <b>tank</b> A is ensured to decrease. During this period, the compressor is running, and the compressor suction on tank B side is closed {{in order to prevent}} the flow of ammonia gas from tank B to the compressor suction line. When the <b>pressure</b> in <b>tank</b> A decreases to 0.043  atm, the compressor is stopped, and the opening compressor suction on tank B side is opened to ensure that ammonia gas flows to tank B.|$|R

Pressure accumulators are proposed to be used for the rapid start-up of the boiler from a cold state.
