5|$|In April 2007, {{construction}} of the new $36,000,000 Half Moone Cruise Terminal was completed downtown adjacent to the Nauticus Museum, providing a state-of-the-art <b>permanent</b> <b>structure</b> for various cruise lines and passengers wishing to embark from Norfolk. Previously, makeshift structures were used to embark/disembark passengers, supplies, and crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 the Royal Society's {{project was}} concluded, and the {{observatory}} {{was set to}} be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station (see Meteorological Service of Canada) {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a <b>permanent</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw {{the festival}} become an annual fixture, barring {{periodic}} fallow years. In 1981, Michael Eavis {{took control of}} the festival, and it was organised in conjunction with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). That year a new Pyramid Stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting (repurposed from materials of the Ministry of Defence), a <b>permanent</b> <b>structure</b> which doubled as a hay-barn and cow-shed during the winter.|$|E

5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established {{by some of the}} city's wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field at a corner of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a <b>permanent</b> <b>structure</b> and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would {{have to take care of}} the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the line was limited {{by a lack of}} funds. Russell asked the LNWR to adopt the line in August 1865, to no avail. An Act of 1866 gave permission to raise a further £20,000, with loans of £6,600. After raising this capital, the line was opened to Llanerchymedd in 1866, with the temporary station at Llangefni replaced by a <b>permanent</b> <b>structure</b> half a mile further on. Captain Rich, when surveying the line, noted that the curves and gradients were severe, and recommended that the line be worked at moderate speed. He also noted the lack of turntables, and the company's intention to use Fairlie engines on the line.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the war, No.11 Group {{was formed}} on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies, using {{elements}} of Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force; this freed the latter from garrison duties following the liberation of Borneo. In recommending the Morotai garrison's establishment, Bostock explained that while it shared the static characteristic of an area command, it differed in that the area commands were part of the <b>permanent</b> <b>structure</b> of the Air Force and situated within the borders of Australia's mainland and overseas territories, whereas the new formation was a temporary wartime measure, headquartered on foreign territory.|$|E

40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon, in {{line with}} the failed Constitutional Treaty and in the {{sequence}} of several initiatives which had taken place, came to provide for the mechanism of <b>permanent</b> <b>structured</b> cooperation. The goal of this mechanism is to enable the arising of a vanguard of Member States, eventually ready to form the embryo of a future European Union's exclusive defence system. Although <b>permanent</b> <b>structured</b> cooperation represents a step towards the application of the "community method" to security and defence of the European Union, it doesn't still fit in that pattern. Only future can tell, if <b>permanent</b> <b>structured</b> cooperation is likely to provide the European Union with a security and defence policy based on the "community method"...|$|R

5|$|Sections of {{the track}} were removed and relaid at other {{athletics}} venues, and the internal ground level was lowered {{to make way for}} an additional tier of seating, on terracing already constructed then buried for the original configuration. The three temporary stands with a total capacity of 16,000 were dismantled, and replaced with a <b>permanent</b> <b>structure</b> of similar design to the existing one at the southern end. This work took nearly a year to complete and added 23,000 permanent seats, increasing the capacity of the converted stadium by 7,000 to approximately 48,000. Manchester City F.C. moved to the ground in time {{for the start of the}} 2003–04 season. The total cost of this conversion was in excess of £40 million, with the track, pitch and seating conversion being funded by the city council at a cost of £22million; and the installation of bars, restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout the stadium being funded by the football club at a cost of £20million. The Games had made a small operating surplus, and Sport England agreed that this could be reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of £3.5 million.|$|E

This emergency field was basically barren with only a few <b>permanent</b> <b>structures</b> and a 10,000-foot concrete runway. By 1965, the only <b>permanent</b> <b>structures</b> on the field were a Philippine Air Force (PAF) operations building-cum-airline terminal and the PAF BOQ.

25|$|In 1840 the Bridge Street {{terminus}} on Clyde Place was adequate; it was {{a temporary}} station, replaced by the imposing <b>permanent</b> <b>structure</b> on 6 April 1841, handling passengers and goods.
