5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a <b>potential</b> <b>test</b> of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E

25|$|After Gover {{retired from}} {{first-class}} cricket, {{he played a}} couple of matches in 1948 for Bedfordshire in the Minor Counties competition, taking 25 wickets at just over nine runs each. But after that he {{devoted his life to}} his cricket school in Wandsworth. He established this school in 1938 and had already trained a number of future Test players by the time of his last match for Surrey. However, in the following decades Gover gradually developed his school {{to such an extent that}} it became regarded as the most valuable school for the fine-tuning of cricketers' skills. His school, redeveloped from its humble origins as an industrial shed, was where many Test or <b>potential</b> <b>Test</b> players developed the necessary skill to rise to the highest levels in cricket. Frank Tyson, Viv Richards, Andy Roberts and Ian Bishop are some notable examples of players who benefitted from Gover's coaching. While covering the 1954–55 Ashes tour as a journalist he advised Tyson to shorten his run-up, which proved to be a turning point in the series. It was primarily for his work in cricket coaching, rather than his deeds for Surrey in the 1930s and 1940s, that Gover was awarded an MBE in 1998.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Visual evoked <b>potential</b> <b>testing</b> was {{performed}} on 15 Negro carriers of the gene for tyrosinase positive oculocutaneous albinism in order to detect whether {{they have the same}} visual pathway decussation anomalies as do homozygotes. No subject showed 01 - 02 asymmetry on monocular testing, indicating that decussation follows the normal pattern. It is concluded that visual evoked <b>potential</b> <b>testing</b> is probably not useful in the detection of Negroes heterozygous for the gene for tyrosinase positive oculocutaneous albinism. Oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive congenital hypomelanosis involving the skin, hair, and eyes.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: The {{objective}} was to evaluate dizziness as the first symptom of endolymphatic hydrops, which could provide valuable information on {{the initial stages of}} endolymphatic hydrops development. Study Design: The present investigation was specifically designed to establish whether a combination of the traditional glycerol test and the vestibular evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> (VEMP) glycerol <b>test</b> is capable of diagnosing endolymphatic hydrops early and to identify potential Meniere's disease. The study was limited to patients who complained of dizziness as their only vestibular symptom. Methods: Thirty-eight consecutive patients with dizziness who had received no treatment were investigated. Each patient underwent glycerol testing measured with both conventional pure-tone audiometry and vestibular evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> <b>testing.</b> For the vestibular evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> glycerol <b>test,</b> an increase of more than 20 % in both latency and amplitude after glycerol intake was considered an improvement. Results: In one patient, the reappearance of the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials was observed. In another six patients, there was an increase in the vestibular evoked myogenic potential amplitudes, unilaterally in four cases and bilaterally in two. One patient showed a bilateral improvement in amplitude and an unilateral amelioration in latency. Conclusion: The assumption of saccular dilation as a sign of early Meniere's disease was not supported by the literature, which considered saccular hydrops as the final progression of the dilation of the endolymphatic compartments into the cochlea. These data seem to indicate that in our patients a saccular dysfunction rather than an early saccular hydrops has been documented, confirming vestibular evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> <b>testing</b> as an intriguing diagnostic option for a lesion of this structure. The vestibular evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> glycerol <b>test</b> proved capable of identifying dysfunctions of the saccule that were not otherwise detectable by the routine methods. Therefore, the vestibular evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> glycerol <b>test</b> should be considered as an additional method of diagnosis in patients with vertigo or dizziness...|$|R

It was Sydney's turn to host two Tests this series, so the match was held in Melbourne as a virtual Test match, though losing the first and fourth days of play to rain dampened the game somewhat.

40|$|Purpose of review: This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on vestibular-evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> <b>testing,</b> a short latency electromyogram evoked by high acoustic stimuli and recorded via surface electrodes over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Applications and refinements of this technique are described for different pathologies and in adults and children. Recent findings: Various techniques for electrode placement have been described to elicit a vestibular-evoked myogenic potential response, which has been clinically investigated in normal individuals, under pathological conditions, and in adult and pediatric patients. As vestibular-evoked myogenic potential amplitude is linearly related {{to the level of}} background activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, maintaining steady contraction of the muscle can be challenging in some patients. Summary: Vestibular-evoked myogenic <b>potential</b> <b>testing</b> may provide additional information about the vestibular system and allow site of lesion testing (e. g. saccule and inferior vestibular nerve) in patients of all ages. Its role has yet to be defined in the diagnosis and treatment of common vestibular disorders, including Meniere’s disease, vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, and other diseases. Further research is needed to support its clinical usefulness in patients with balance disorders, to optimize patient selection, and to establish its cost effectiveness...|$|R
