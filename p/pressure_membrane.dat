5000|$|Osmolytes are {{compounds}} affecting osmosis. They are soluble in {{the solution}} within a cell, {{or in the}} surrounding fluid, e.g. as plasma osmolytes. They {{play a role in}} maintaining cell volume and fluid balance. For example, when a cell swells due to external osmotic <b>pressure,</b> <b>membrane</b> channels open and allow efflux of osmolytes which carry water with them, restoring normal cell volume. Osmolytes also contribute to protein folding. Natural osmolytes that can act as osmoprotectants include trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), dimethylsulfoniopropionate, trimethylglycine, sarcosine, betaine, glycerophosphorylcholine, myo-inositol, taurine, glycine, and others. Remarcably, TMAO has the capacity to restore glucocorticoid binding to mutant receptors. [...] Bacteria accumulate osmolytes for protection against a high osmotic environment. [...] The osmolytes will be neutral non-electrolytes, except in bacteria that can tolerate salts. [...] In humans, osmolytes are of particular importance in the renal medulla. Current understanding of osmolytes have been used to calculate the maximum depth where a fish can survive: 26,900 feet (8,200 meters).|$|E

After collecting various blood samples from Morgan County and Lawrence County, the state of Alabama was under investigation for water contamination. Although the levels of PFOA and PFOS were found in low concentrations, warnings were released indicating that prolonged exposure to these pollutants can cause serious health problems. In order to remove these pollutants from drinking water, the EPA recommends that unconventional methods such as Activated carbon filtering or high-pressure membrane filtering must be used, demonstrating the extra precautions residents must take. The investigation explained how individuals went through a similar problem with water contamination in the past, yet there were still no signs of long-term health effects regarding the contaminated water. The recommendation of installing an activated carbon filter or a high <b>pressure</b> <b>membrane</b> filter as a method {{to get rid of}} the PFOA/PFOS pollution in the water are not commonly used methods to treat water. A proposed $4 million activated carbon filtration system by the water authority would be a temporary solution until a larger reverse osmosis treatment plant could be built. In addition, citizens are also concern over the cost and the lack of access to resources and the proposed solution. Due to differing responses from government officials and water authority officials and lack of expertise regarding PFOA/PFOS pollution, there is confusion among citizens regarding what is the best course of action.|$|E

Nitrate and fluoride are also often found in concentrations higher than the recommended standard. In places where surface water sources are not available or are limited, rainfall is low and groundwater salinity is high, the only possible supply of drinking water is from desalination. Solar distillation was, until recently, the world's leading desalination technology. Its appropriateness for remote community water supply however is questionable.

Structurally, the pressure sensor, {{referred to as the}} magneto-harmonic pressure sensor, is an airtight chamber sealed with an elastic <b>pressure</b> <b>membrane.</b> A strip of magnetically-soft material is attached {{to the bottom of the}} chamber and a permanent magnet strip is embedded inside the membrane. Under the excitation of an externally applied AC magnetic field, the magnetically-soft strip produces a higher-order magnetic signature that can be remotely detected with an external receiving coil.

40|$|The {{drinking}} water industry is gaining {{more interest in}} substituting conventional separation technologies for treatment of surface waters with membranes due to their separation capabilities. Low <b>pressure</b> <b>membranes</b> are particularly suitable {{for the removal of}} suspended solids, especially bacteria, algae, and protozoa namely Giardia and Cryptosporidium. However, they are less effective in removing dissolved contaminants, such as natural organic matter (NOM), which also is claimed to be the major cause of the TMP increase experienced during filtration of surface water. The purpose of the study is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the impact of NOM on membrane fouling in low <b>pressure</b> submerged <b>membrane</b> configurations. Constructed raw water was used in a series of filtration experiments of three different types of low <b>pressure</b> <b>membranes</b> -hydrophilic cellulose esters (MF) and two hydrophobic PVDF membranes (UF). The raw water was made by mixing NOM concentrate into tap water to represent typical Norwegian surface water. The filtration unit was operated under various conditions in order to evaluate their effect on the fouling behaviour. This included the effect of flux variations and different membrane characteristics and, the effect of pre-treatment of the raw water. Samples of raw water, membrane permeate, and desorbed NOM from fouled membranes were collected and subjected to analysis. NOM fractionation was conducted to distinguish four different NOM fractions, i. e. very hydrophobic acids (VHA), transphilic acids/ slightly hydrophobic acids (SHA), hydrophilic charged (CHA) and hydrophilic neutrals (NEU). Analyses of colour, UV 254 -absorbance and zeta potential were also applied. The study revealed some interesting results: Higher flux increased the fouling rate and the fouling by NEU. This was claimed to be a consequence of a more severe concentration polarization and gel layer formation. Hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions seemed to be the dominating mechanism in NOM-membrane interaction. The main foulant were attributed the VHA in all filtration experiments except for the MF experiment operated at highest flux were the NEUs were dominating. Pre-treatment reduced the rate of fouling tremendously, indicating that the pretreatmentwere efficient in removing some of the NOM fractions responsible for the fouling. In summary, strategies to reduce fouling may include careful membrane selection and pretreatment of the raw water. Sufficient knowledge about the composition of raw water is also important. </p...|$|R

40|$|Biofiltration is a {{promising}} green drinking water treatment technology that {{can reduce the}} concentration of biodegradable organic matter (BOM) in water. Direct biofiltration or biofiltration without pretreatment (BFwp) limits the use of chemicals such as coagulants or ozone commonly employed with conventional biofiltration, making BFWP a more environmental friendly pre-treatment. BFWP was proven to be an efficient pretreatment to reduce fouling of low pressure membranes, and can also improve the biological stability of the final treated drinking water to limit bacterial regrowth in the distribution system. One major operational problem for high pressure membranes (i. e. nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes) is membrane biofouling due to biofilm growth inside the feed channel of the membrane module, resulting in higher energy requirements and more frequent membrane cleaning. BFWP can potentially be applied to reduce biofouling of nanofiltration membranes, which can reduce the energy requirements of high pressure membranes. Three pilot-scale parallel biologically active filters with different empty bed contact times, and bench-scale nanofiltration membrane fouling simulators, were designed and constructed in this study. A challenging surface water source (the Grand River in Kitchener, ON) was used as source water for the investigation. Initial work assessed the effect of biofiltration on the treated water quality and how the biofilter performance is affected by changes in water temperature. A protocol was developed to better characterize the biofilter attached biomass and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), {{in order to understand}} their possible relationship to biofilter performance. Flow cytometry was applied to measure both planktonic cell concentrations in water and also to perform assimilable organic carbon (AOC) analysis using a natural microbial inoculum. BFWP was found to be an efficient pre-treatment for the removal of large molecular weight biopolymers and AOC over a wide range of water temperatures. Lower water temperatures {{had a significant impact on}} biopolymer removal, unlike AOC which was efficiently removed at lower water temperatures, and this proved the robustness of such a pre-treatment technology. Other fractions of the natural organic matter (NOM) such as humic substances, buildings blocks and low molecular weight organics were removed to a lower extent than biopolymers or AOC. Empty bed contact time (EBCT) as a design parameter had a limited effect on the biofilter performance. Most of the observed removal for BOM and total cell count happened at the shortest EBCT of 8 minutes, and increasing the EBCT up to 24 minutes had a significant but less proportional impact on biofilter performance. Regarding biofilter attached biomass, no direct linkage was found between biofilter performance and attached biofilter biomass characteristics using any of the commonly used analytical methods such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or biofilm cell count, however, cellular ATP content was found to be indicative of biofilm activity. Biofilm EPS composition was not related to biofilter performance but it was largely affected by the water temperature. Through community level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis it was evident that the microbial community was changing due to a drop in water temperature, however, this was a minor effect and it is likely that the overall drop in biomass activity was the main reason behind the drop in biofilter performance. Finally, BFWP was tested as a potential pre-treatment technology to control high <b>pressure</b> <b>membrane</b> biofouling, which is a major operational problem. BFWP was able to reduce the amount of available nutrients measured as AOC, reduce the presence of conditioning molecules such as large molecular weight biopolymers, and modify the microbial community of the feed water. A 16 minute EBCT biofilter was able to extend the lifetime of nanofiltration membranes by more than 200 % compared to the river water without biofiltration, both at low and high water temperature conditions. The 16 minute EBCT biofilter performance was also comparable to that of a full scale conventional biofilter with prior coagulation, sedimentation and ozonation. The biofiltration pre-treatment efficiently affected the amount of biomass present in the biofouling layer and affected the biofilm microbial community as determined using CLPP analysis. The findings of this study provide the basis upon which further and larger scale testing of the BFWP as a pre-treatment for membrane applications can be done. A sound technology could include a hybrid membrane system with a high <b>pressure</b> <b>membrane</b> proceeded with a low <b>pressure</b> <b>membrane.</b> BFWP can then be used at the start of the treatment train to limit both low <b>pressure</b> <b>membrane</b> fouling at the same time limit the biofouling of the <b>pressure</b> <b>membrane.</b> This treatment train can provide a high water quality with limited footprint compared to conventional treatment trains and long service time. Monitoring of the treatment unit performance can be efficiently done using some of the proposed analytical methods presented in the study, such as AOC monitoring and flow cytometry to study microbiological water quality and biofilter biomass. Fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography can also be used to monitor large molecular weight biopolymers, which are responsible for several operational problems in water treatment in general and specifically for membrane applications...|$|E
