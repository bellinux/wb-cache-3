5000|$|Wohlforth, Little and Kaufman {{state that}} {{systemic}} hegemony is likely under two historically common conditions: First when the rising hegemon develops {{the ability to}} incorporate and effectively administer conquered territories. And second, when {{the boundaries of the}} international system remain stable, and no new major powers emerge from outside the system. When the leading power can administer conquests effectively so they add to its power and when the system’s borders are rigid, the probability of hegemony is high. The argument of universal reproduction of anarchy can be correct in the European context, [...] "whereas a systematic survey of world history reveals that multipolarity has frequently given way to unipolarity or hegemony." [...] Henry Kissinger, Historian by profession, noted that [...] "theories of the balance of power often leave the impression that it is the natural form of international relations. In fact, balance-of-power systems have existed only rarely in history." [...] Yet based on these rare occurrences, many realists [...] "elevate a fact of life … into a guiding principle of world order." [...] Earlier, political scientist Martin Wight had drawn a conclusion with unambiguous implication for the modern world: Most states systems have ended in universal empire, which has swallowed all the states of the system. The examples are so abundant that we must ask two questions: Is there any states system which has not led fairly directly to the establishment of a world empire? Does the evidence rather suggest that we should expect any states system to culminate in this way? …It might be argued that every state system can only maintain its existence on the balance of power, that the later is inherently unstable, and that sooner or later its tensions and conflicts will be resolved into a monopoly of power. Still earlier, Quincy Wright, concluded on {{the balance of power in}} world history: The predominance of the balance of power in the practice of statesmen for three centuries … should not obscure the fact that throughout world history periods dominated by the balance-of-power policies have not been the rule. The balance of power scarcely existed anywhere as a conscious principle of international politics before 1500… [...] Evoking examples of the ancient Chinese and Roman civilizations, Quincy Wright added: Balance of power systems have in the past tended, through the process of conquest of lesser states by greater states, towards reduction in the number of states involved, and towards less frequent but more devastating wars, until eventually a universal empire has been established through the conquest by one of all those remaining. The post-Cold War period represents an anomaly to the balance of power theory too. Since 2000, the founder of Neorealism, Kenneth Waltz, confessed that [...] "the present condition of international politics is unnatural." [...] “Clearly something has changed.” Wohlforth, Little and Kaufman undertook the above-mentioned historical study after they had coped with what they called the [...] "puzzle" [...] of the unipolar stability. Elsewhere, Richard Little wrote: Events since the end of the Cold War [...] "create a potential anomaly" [...] for the theory because the outcome has [...] "left the United States as the sole superpower in a unipolar world ... A major puzzle for realists ... is the fact that unipolarity has not provoked a global alarm to restore a balance of power." [...] The same anomaly stressed seventeen other experts on alliances, Stephen Walt, Randall Schweller, Xiaoyu Pu, John Ikenberry, Robert Pape, T. V. Paul, Jack S. Levy, William R. Thompson, John Lewis Gaddis, David A. Lake, Campbell Craig, Fareed Zakaria, John M., Owen, Michael Mastanduno, Thomas S. Mowle, David H. Sacko and Terry Narramore: To date, at least, there is little sign of a serious effort to forge a meaningful anti-American alliance ... From the traditional perspective of balance-of-power theory, this situation is surely an anomaly. Power in the international system is about as unbalanced as it has ever been, yet balancing tendencies are remarkably mild. It is possible to find them, but one has to squint pretty hard to do it. [...] No <b>peer</b> <b>competitor</b> has yet emerged more than a decade after the end of US-Soviet bipolarity to balance against the United States. Contrary to realist predictions, unipolarity has not provided global alarm to restore a balance of power. [...] Resistance has in fact appeared and may be growing. But it is remarkable that despite the sharp shifts in the distribution of power, the other great powers have not yet responded in a way anticipated by balance-of-power theory. [...] Historically, major powers have rarely balanced against the United States and not at all since the 1990s when it has become the sole superpower. [...] Traditional balance of power theory … fails to explain state behavior in the post-Cold War era. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has been expanding its economic and political power. More recently, it has begun to engage in increasingly unilateralist military policy… Yet despite these growing material capabilities, major powers such as China, France, Germany, India and Russia have not responded with significant increases in their defense spending. Nor have they formed military coalitions to counterveil US power, as traditional balance of power theory would predict. [...] The end of the Cold War and the emergence of the “unipolar moment” have generated considerable debate about how to explain the absence of a great-power balancing coalition against the United States… That the United States, which is generally regarded as the “greatest superpower ever,” has not provoked such a balancing coalition is widely regarded as a puzzle for balance of power theory. [...] Whether or not realists got the Cold War right, they have most certainly got the warm peace wrong. A decade after the Berlin Wall collapsed… their dark vision of the future has not come to pass. The United States remains the world’s only superpower; unipolarity was not a fleeting moment ... Most important, despite its continued predominance and political activism, and the first rumbling of international opposition in response to missteps in Kosovo, no coalition has emerged to balance against it … The United States today defies the supposedly immutable laws of realpolitik.” [...] The persistence of American unipolar predominance in the international system since the end of the Cold War has caused a rupture in the American school of Realist … theory ... Yet the ongoing failure of potential rivals to the US, such as China, Russia, or the EU to develop military capabilities that come anywhere close to those of the US seems to have defied this prediction. Despite the apparently radical imbalance of the international political system, smaller states are not trying to build up their military power to match that of the US or forming formal alliance systems to oppose it… The absence of balancing against the US constitutes a serious anomaly for neorealist theory. Fareed Zakaria asks, “Why is no one ganging up against the United States?” And John Ikenberry and John M. Owen ask the same question. Prominent Historian of the Cold War, John Lewis Gaddis, poses a more general question and replies: Do the weak always unite against the strong? “In theory, yes, but in practice and in history, not necessarily.” One of the issues the discipline of political science “has been wrestling with recently is why there is still no anti-American coalition despite the overwhelming dominance of the United States since the end of the Cold War.” French or Chinese officials publicly denounce “hyperpower” and aspire for [...] "multipolarity" [...] but refrain from forming a counterbalancing coalition. [...] "Rhetorically, leaders and publics want the United States to be balanced" [...] but [...] "we find very little balancing." [...] French academic Michel Winock said: “Before we could say we were on American side. Not Now. There is no counterbalance.” Two American Neoconservative thinkers, Robert Kagan and William Kristol, completely agree: “Today’s international system is built not around a balance of power but around American hegemony.” ...|$|E

This paper examines {{a number of}} controversial issues brought out by Gerald Segal in his provocative and critical evaluation of China's position in the world. China has become the world's second largest economy in terms of GNP and second largest recipient of Foreign Direct Investment next only to the US. China's low GNP per capital reported by the World Bank has been distorted by the successive depreciation of the Chinese currency and political pressure exerted by the Chinese government.

The Chinese people have enjoyed remarkably high life expectancy and low adult illiteracy. China's military capacities are far below the level of being a <b>peer</b> <b>competitor</b> of the US. Nonetheless, China matters more than simply "a normal medium power" because of its permanent vetobearing membership of the UN's Security Council, its possession of mass-destruction weapons, and its special political system that operates differently from those of the west.

It is argued in this article that the two approaches are complementary rather than divergent and that the current Australian government recognises this geopolitical reality. It concludes that alliances and other ‘classic ’ state-centric mechanisms for pursuing both regional and international security will continue to be applicable to Australia’s need for ‘getting the balance right ’ between its future regional and global strategies.

This lack of balancing is best explained by the regional hegemon's newly acquired status quo stance, which follows from the geographical constraints on its power projection capability. Instead of relying on offensive actions, a regional hegemon finds itself in a defensive position seeking to avert threats to its hegemonic status by preventing the rise of any <b>peer</b> <b>competitors</b> in other areas.

And how often have they sought one goal, and ended up by achieving something they neither expected nor desired?” Hans J. Morgenthau (1993 : 6) With no <b>peer</b> <b>competitor</b> in sight, the United States is more powerful than any other nation state in modern history. The U. S. has substantial interests throughout the globe and its government seems to aim at remaining the sole superpower. The last five years have spurred a debate on the nature and purpose of this power and how best to make use of it. In the debates of the 2000 Presidential campaign, the then Governor Bush made a point of second-guessing former Vice President Al Gore’s agenda of active American involvement in a number of cases of conflict resolution abroad. To underline his point, Bush used the phrase “I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders” in a derogative manner. The Republican foreign policy agenda was significantly more isolationist than that of the Democratic Clinton administration. Six years later, in George W. Bush’s second term as United States President, Republican foreign policy has taken on a large-scale war on terrorism and intervened in Afghanistan and Iraq, operations that would be seen as inconceivable a few years ago. Coercive democratization has since become the hallmark of the Bush Presidency. Which underlying mechanisms have caused this shift from the course of 2000 to new course of 2006 ? This thesis intends to examine how the theoretical bases of realism and idealism have guided the current Bush administration to choose the promotion of democracy over containment and deterrence. Most particularly, these shifts in policy lead the U. S. to attack Iraq, and to this date, express no intention of leaving in the near future...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the United States reacted {{to changes in}} its external environment in the Asia Pacific after the Cold War; in particular, this paper examines {{the creation of the}} security trilaterals in what had been a traditionally bilateral alliance system and seeks to explain this through Washington’s complex relationship with the other great power in the region, China. American policy toward China has been marked by its policy complexity, {{in the sense that the}} US has seen China both as an important trade partner and a potential <b>peer</b> <b>competitor.</b> While many scholars have covered both alliance theory and US approaches toward China, this thesis seeks to explore both together, seeking to put American strategy in the region writ-large within an overarching neoclassical realist (NCR) framework. As a result, this thesis prioritizes power and the structure of the international system, while also maintaining that external variables alone are insufficient to explain the complex behavior exhibited by the United States at this time. It therefore draws from domestic variables introduced Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA), and examines them through the NCR conceptions of ‘threat assessment’. This thesis identifies four intervening variables as crucial to understanding the evolution of US policy in the region from 1993 to 2015. These include policy-coalitions of foreign policy elites (FPEs), their perception of the structure of the international system, the domestic political conditions in which they labored, economic inter-dependency to China, and threat-assessment debates. Applying those five to the independent variable of China’s rise, this thesis argues that American foreign policy elites formed into two broad policy coalitions, who could not agree on whether to balance or to accommodate China’s rise. The quasi-nature of the trilateral, the failed attempt at a quadrilateral, and the off-and-on again nature of US-Japan-Australia alliance dynamics indicate that foreign policy elites inside all three states continue to debate China’s threat-assessmentstatus. Therefore, this thesis finds that at heart, hedging is the product of domestic variables, the inability of policy coalitions to triumph over their opposites...|$|E
40|$|The United States and NATO Allies have a {{national}} security problem that {{is the product of}} America being the home of inexpensive and plentiful modern energy. A century of cheap and plentiful domestic supplies of oil has resulted in the architecture of civilian and military systems that are premised on the continued availability of cheap, high gradient conventional energy. As the pre-eminent military power of the last century, America ensured that access to secure “rear” areas, bases and supply lines can be relied on – at least until recently. With the increasing prevalence of asymmetric warfare conducted primarily with non-state actors and the loss of America’s monopoly on precision munitions (PGMs), or in the event of conflict with <b>peer</b> <b>competitor</b> states, security of supply lines, staging and rear areas can no longer be taken for granted. For expeditionary forces, supply of conventional liquid fuels represents a sizable amount of tonnage required to transport combat units to battle and conduct operations. Supplies are primarily conveyed by inherently vulnerable platforms like tankers and stockpiled in difficult to harden warehouses or dumps. While {{there is no shortage of}} petroleum or conventional fossil energy worldwide, the sheer volume of fuel presently needed to conduct modern expeditionary military operations itself creates vulnerabilities. The DoD and individual services have in place long-term programs to reduce the energy intensity with valuable lessons for NATO allies as most military systems and doctrine are patterned after DoD architectures. Transfer of techniques for reducing energy intensity from defense to the civilian sector has spinoff benefits overall; for example, by making operations in remote locations such as the Arctic / Antarctic more affordable and practical, and enabling a more energy / resource efficient civilian economy. Benefits from reduction of energy use include the reduction of signatures from energy use that are expensive and difficult to mask or hide, potentially reducing vulnerabilities in both the military and civilian infrastructure. Despite these benefits, legacy systems architectures in both defense and civilian limit energy efficiency gains. Technological advances of the past century have enabled many functions such as HVAC and lighting to be met with low gradient, low density and intermittent energy if systems are re-architectured. New designs, if standardized and rolled out quickly, offer the potential to benefit from making use of renewables like solar, wind, micro-hydro, or to use conventional high gradient energy more efficiently in combined cycle systems that often can be locally sourced even for remote forward operating bases. Low gradient energy systems, by their nature, present a smaller emissions signature issue. US-DoD has an opportunity to drive the development of the implementation of these high efficiency technologies and institutions and accelerate their spread to the civilian economy. This thesis presents a vision of a technically, politically, economically and logistically viable pathway to a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to current dominant energy systems architecture and provides a roadmap to implementatio...|$|E

But do information operations and warfare constitute a strategic threat to U. S. society? What, indeed, would constitute “strategic information warfare ” (SIW) ?

In the future, the possibility exists that adversaries might exploit the tools and techniques of the information revolution to hold at risk (not of destruction, but of large-scale or massive disruption) key national strategic assets, such as elements of various key national infrastructure sectors (energy, telecommunications, transportation, financial, etc.). This potential danger constitutes the principal fact of the SIW environment as conceptualized here. Both regional adversaries and <b>peer</b> <b>competitors</b> may find SIW tools and techniques of use to them in challenging the United States, its allies, and/or its interests. In the near term, SIW weapons may be most useful to regional adversaries applying asymmetric strategies (See Figure 9. 1) {{as a way to}} avoid directly challenging U. S. conventional battlefield superiority. Such strategies involve using some combination of nuclear, chemical, biological, highly advanced conventional, and SIW instruments...|$|R
5000|$|Mearsheimer {{does not}} believe it is {{possible}} for a state to become a global hegemon because there is too much landmass and too many oceans which he posits have effective stopping power and act as giant moats. Instead he believes that states can only achieve regional hegemony. Furthermore, he argues that states attempt to prevent other states from becoming regional hegemons, since <b>peer</b> <b>competitors</b> could interfere in a state's affairs. States which have achieved regional hegemony, such as the U.S., will act as offshore balancers, interfering in other regions only when the great powers in those regions are not able to prevent the rise of a hegemon. In a 2004 speech, Mearsheimer praised the British historian E. H. Carr for his 1939 book The Twenty Years' Crisis and argued that Carr was correct when he claimed that international relations was a struggle of all against all with states always placing their own interests first. Mearsheimer maintained that Carr's points were still as relevant for 2004 as for 1939, and went on to deplore what he claimed was the dominance of [...] "idealist" [...] thinking about international relations among British academic life.|$|R
5000|$|Toft and Layne go a {{step further}} by asserting that Mearsheimer misjudges the United States as a {{regional}} hegemon engaged in offshore balancing. Instead of being a regional hegemon with the strategic aim of dominating the Western hemisphere while preventing the rise of <b>peer</b> <b>competitors</b> in Europe and Northeast Asia, these scholars believe that empirical data points {{to the fact that the}} United States has sought and achieved global hegemony, which in turn biases Mearsheimer's predictions regarding future U.S. strategic behavior, mainly in terms of its military involvement overseas. [...] More fundamental criticisms of offensive realism have come from Shiping Tang, [...] "Fear in International Politics: Two Positions", International Studies Review 10 (2008): 451-71; and idem, [...] "Social Evolution of International Politics: From Mearsheimer to Jervis", European Journal of International Relations 16, 1 (2010): 31-55. Tang's first article argues that Mearsheimer's logic is flawed because his five bedrock assumptions cannot lead to his conclusion. Tang's second article argues that because the international system has always been an evolutionary one, neither offensive realism nor defensive neorealism has a claim to be a theory for the whole of human history: the two realism are theories for different epochs of human history.|$|R

He was a contributor to other churches, as well, and the Anti-Saloon League. He was reputedly very generous not only with his <b>peers</b> (even <b>competitors)</b> among Rockford's business leadership but also with his companies' workers, often cosigning loans for them and giving personal checks to their widows.|$|R

Of these theorists the most influential, de Paepe, is often considered as a <b>peer</b> or <b>competitor</b> to Karl Marx's concept of the workplace as merely a cauldron and test for the proletariat.|$|R
40|$|The article compares ideas {{prevailing}} at the São Paulo Justice Court {{with that}} of the Association of Judges for Democracy and the public image of judges in printed media. It relates the distinct contents of those ideas to theories of civic professionalism and democratic professionalism. The analysis is based on the conception that there is a pluralization of identity forms of professional groups and that those identifications are a result of negotiated construction between <b>peers,</b> <b>competitors,</b> and the public. Therefore, professional groups' publications and mainstream media are relevant instruments to investigate the process of negotiation about judges' professional identity. The database includes content analysis of the texts about judges or written by them, published on the newspaper Folha de São Paulo from 1996 to 2002; of the news section and speeches published on São Paulo Justice Court's journal Revista de jurisprudência from 1968 to 1997 and articles on the newspaper Juizes para a Democrada from 1992 to 2002. Each of those collections was classified in four broad themes, focusing on professional ideas, judges' relations to other State powers, the interprofessional and intraprofessional relations and interests expressed by them. The study compares those three bases in order to form a broad picture of São Paulo judges and chief judges' collective identifications...|$|R

Partnering organizations not only reap reputational acclaim but garner valuable organizational benefits. Membership within successful partnerships would undoubtedly be considered a competitive advantage, yet several of these successful relationships have chosen to forgo this valuable position. Instead of retaining intellectual property, partnering organizations are sharing successful processes and practices with <b>peers</b> and <b>competitors.</b> This research examined three examples of best practice cross-sector partnerships to identify relationship success factors, how they involved other organizations and why they shared successful social responsibility initiatives with others...|$|R
