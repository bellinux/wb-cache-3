5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. He <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E

If Bush were 'doing the weather-vane thing' he 'would have done something differently.|$|E

25|$|England {{lost both}} Ian Bell, who {{continued}} his relatively poor Ashes series with his third successive single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan, who pulled a short Gillespie delivery to {{the hands of}} Lee, {{in the space of}} the next five overs, but still <b>pounded</b> <b>on.</b> Kevin Pietersen, in his second Test match, hit 10 fours and one six, and forged a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff, which turned the match back to England's favour. Flintoff's 68 was scored quickly, including five sixes, and again Lee got the most stick – he was taken for 26 in the 18 balls he faced.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of those who escaped unharmed were workers {{in the front of}} the building who left through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke. Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got out through a loading bay. The bay was initially blocked by a tractor-trailer, but three workers went into the rear of the truck and <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> the walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle. Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.|$|E
25|$|Rosecrans {{ordered his}} army {{to move on}} August 16. The {{difficult}} road conditions meant a full week passed before they reached the Tennessee River Valley. They encamped while engineers made preparations for crossing the river. Meanwhile, Rosecrans's deception plan was underway. Col. John T. Wilder of the XIV Corps moved his mounted infantry brigade (the Lightning Brigade, which first saw prominence at Hoover's Gap) {{to the north of}} Chattanooga. His men <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> tubs and sawed boards, sending pieces of wood downstream, to make the Confederates think that rafts were being constructed for a crossing north of the city. His artillery, commanded by Capt. Eli Lilly, bombarded the city from Stringer's Ridge for two weeks, an operation sometimes known as the Second Battle of Chattanooga. The deception worked and Bragg was convinced that the Union crossing would be above the city, in conjunction with Burnside's advancing Army of the Ohio from Knoxville.|$|E

25|$|Gwindor and {{his small}} company {{led the charge}} {{all the way from}} Eithel Sirion to Angband, to the extent of {{breaking}} through the front gates and killing the guards on the stairs; it is said that Morgoth trembled as Gwindor's company <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> his doors. Once inside, though, they were surrounded and killed, except Gwindor, who was captured and imprisoned. Fingon and the main Army of Hithlum could not come to their rescue, as Morgoth had by this time ordered his main army, many thousands strong, to emerge from a large number of hidden entrances in Thangorodrim. Fingon suffered great losses as his army was beaten back from the walls of Thangorodrim, and soon ordered a general retreat back towards Hithlum. Many Men of Brethil fell in the rearguard during the retreat, including their Chieftain Haldir. For two days and the intervening night, Fingon's army continued its retreat, until on the second night they were surrounded on the plains of Anfauglith, and they fought desperately through the night.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Hudson and {{two other}} Sisters of her congregation, Carol Gilbert, O.P., and Ardeth Platte, O.P., entered Peterson Air Force Base without {{authorization}} and sprinkled blood on a fighter plane. The trio was caught and arrested. They were then held in a federal prison until the charges were dropped {{because there was no}} lasting damage was done to the airplane. Gilbert claimed that the base was part of the [...] "Star Wars" [...] defense system and the government did not want to draw unnecessary attention to the area. In 2002, the same group of nuns gained access to a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. Wearing white hazmat suits emblazoned with [...] "Citizen Weapon Inspection Team," [...] they <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> the missile, drew a cross in their own blood and prayed for peace. At their pre-trial hearing, the Sisters, dressed in their religious habit, engaged in silent protest by only answering the judge with a nod. When their trial came about, the presiding judge, Robert E. Blackburn, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor preventing the Sisters from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. The group was sentenced to between 31 and 40 months for obstructing national defense and damaging government property. The sister's appeal was rejected in 2005 by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{articles}} published in the newsletter concerned the dangers of cigarette smoking. Seldes later explained that at the time, [...] "The tobacco stories were suppressed by every major newspaper. For ten years we <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> tobacco as {{being one of the}} only legal poisons you could buy in America." [...] At a time when tobacco companies were major advertisers, Seldes discussed the contents of a study called, [...] "Tobacco Smoking and Longevity", which he said had been suppressed since 1939. Throughout the 10-year run of In Fact, Seldes published more than 50 stories on the health effects of tobacco, and the cigarette industry's attempts and suppressing such news.|$|E

[...] He wrote that [...] "free of that nerve-racking situation with her father and the other members of Los Dinos, I started enjoying my life again." [...] Selena, however, suffered from their separation and the two tried to keep in touch while she was touring. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> his hotel-room door. She forced her way in and began to cry, saying she could not go on without him. Selena wanted to get married that day, but Chris argued it wasn't {{the right thing to do}} at the moment. Selena insisted her father would never accept their relationship, and would not attend any wedding they planned. Chris agreed and they eloped in Nueces County, Texas.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{televised}} joint interview {{prior to their}} second bout in 1974, Ali continued to insult Frazier, who took exception to Ali calling him [...] "ignorant" [...] and challenged him to a fight, {{which resulted in the}} two of them brawling on the studio floor. Ali {{went on to win the}} 12 round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, The Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier [...] "the other type of negro" [...] and [...] "ugly", [...] "dumb" [...] and a [...] "gorilla" [...] At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> a rubber gorilla doll, saying [...] "This is Joe Frazier's conscience... I keep it everywhere I go. This is the way he looks when you hit him." [...] According to the fight's promoter Don King, this enraged Frazier, who took it as a [...] "character assassination" [...] and [...] "personal invective". One night before the fight, Ali waved around a toy pistol outside Frazier's hotel room. When Frazier came to the balcony, he pointed the gun at Frazier and yelled [...] "I am going to shoot you." [...] After the fight, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis into his dressing room, and told him that he had not meant what he had said about his father. When informed of this by Marvis, Frazier responded: [...] "you ain't me, son. Why isn't he apologizing to me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and <b>pounded</b> <b>on</b> the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them." ...|$|E
