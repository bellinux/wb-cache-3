With {{the success of the}} WinFax product, the company grew rapidly. By early 1993 the number of employees had grown to 250, {{and by the end of}} the year to 350.

Delrina spent roughly $800,000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes. In December 1993 Delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate the growing number of calls to the firm for technical support.
