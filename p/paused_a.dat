500|$|Alexander retired the Yankees {{in order}} in the eighth inning. The Cardinals did nothing offensively {{in the top of}} the ninth inning, so it was up to Alexander to {{preserve}} the Cardinals' game in the bottom of the ninth. Alexander got the first two batters of the inning, Combs and Dugan, to ground out to third baseman Bell. With two outs and no runners on base, Alexander faced Ruth. Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game. Manager Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander. Alexander told Hornsby that he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him. Alexander's first pitch to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate. Alexander's next pitch fell outside of the strike zone for ball one. Ruth then fouled the next pitch, making the count one ball and two strikes. Alexander's next two pitches fell too low for balls two and three, making it a full count. The following full count pitch was noted by New York Herald Tribune sportswriter W. O. McGeehan: [...] "The count went to three and two, Ruth was swaying eagerly. The soupbone creaked again. The ball seemed a fraction of an inch from being a strike. Ruth <b>paused</b> <b>a</b> moment. Even he was uncertain. Then he trotted down to first." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1963, Thomas {{was seriously}} {{considering}} {{not running for}} a fifteenth term. Local Democrats organized an appreciation dinner on November 21, 1963 with over 3200 attendees {{to persuade him to}} run for another term. The most visible attendees were President John F. Kennedy and Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson who both spoke of Thomas's leadership. Kennedy said, [...] "Next month, when the United States of America fires the largest booster {{in the history of the}} world into space for the first time, giving us the lead, fires the largest, payroll -- payload -- into space, giving us the lead. [...] " [...] here the President <b>paused</b> <b>a</b> second and grinned. [...] "It will be the largest payroll, too," [...] he quipped. The crowd roared. [...] "And who should know that better than Houston. We put a little of it right in here." [...] The President then resumed in a more serious vein, [...] "But in any case, the United States next month will have a leadership in space which it wouldn't have without Albert Thomas. And so will this city." ...|$|E

2500|$|Publicity has {{surrounded}} {{claims of}} a global warming hiatus during the period 1998–2013. [...] The exceptionally warm El Niño year of 1998 was an outlier from the continuing temperature trend, and so subsequent annual temperatures gave {{the appearance of a}} hiatus: by January 2006, it appeared to some that global warming had stopped or <b>paused.</b> <b>A</b> 2009 study showed that decades without warming were not exceptional, and in 2011 a study showed that if allowances were made for known variability, the rising temperature trend continued unabated. There was increased public interest in 2013 in the run-up to publication of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and despite concerns that a 15-year period was too short to determine a meaningful trend, the IPCC included a section on a hiatus, which it defined as a much smaller increasing linear trend over the 15 years from 1998 to 2012, than over the 60 years from 1951 to 2012. Various studies examined possible causes of the short-term slowdown. Even though the overall climate system has continued to accumulate energy due to Earth's positive energy budget, the available temperature readings at the Earth's surface indicate slower rates of increase in surface warming than in the prior decade. [...] Since measurements {{at the top of the}} atmosphere show that Earth is receiving more energy than it is radiating back into space, the retained energy should be producing warming in the Earth's climate system.|$|E
