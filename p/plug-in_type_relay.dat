30|$|Although {{there have}} been a lot of {{research}} works about <b>type</b> I <b>relay,</b> the research works about <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> are just started and relatively not enough. <b>Type</b> II <b>relay</b> has many advantages compared with <b>type</b> I <b>relay,</b> such as low cost (layer 2 relay), easy of deployment (transparent), and good throughput enhancement (cooperative transmission with eNodeB in downlink and UEs in uplink in nature). However, in order to exploit the benefits and potentials of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay,</b> more sophisticated designs are needed than <b>type</b> I <b>relay.</b> The transparency and backward compatibility requirement bring many challenges facing the implementation of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> in LTE-Advanced systems [3, 6, 10]. Overall speaking, two issues of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> are of most importance. One is the type II relay-assisted cooperative hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) [3] and the other is link adaptation for type II relay-assisted data transmission. In this article, we focus on an enhanced type II relay-assisted uplink data retransmission scheme in order to improve block error rate (BLER) performance while maintaining backward compatibility to legacy UEs.|$|R
30|$|Relay {{is a very}} {{promising}} technique for future wireless communication systems to extend coverage and enhance throughput, and has drawn increasing interest from both academia and industry [1 – 6]. There are many <b>types</b> of <b>relays</b> {{and some of them}} have been specified for future mobile systems, such as WiMax and LTE-Advanced system [5]. Two <b>types</b> of <b>relays,</b> i.e., <b>type</b> I and type II, are mainly discussed for LTE-advanced systems in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) [3, 7 – 9]. The <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> is a kind of non-transparent relay with wireless backhaul to the donor eNodeB cell. The <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> terminates all layers 2 and 3 protocols and appears as a normal eNodeB to user equipment (UE). According to the backhaul, <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> can be classified into inband (same frequency band for backhaul link and access link) and half-duplex (backhaul transmission and access transmission at different time), inband and full-duplex (backhaul transmission and access transmission at same time), and outband (different frequency band for backhaul link and access link). The <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> has its own cell and physical cell identification (ID). It transmits synchronization signals and performs resource allocation. The typical usage scenarios of <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> include coverage extension, e.g., hotspot and deadspot, and group mobility, e.g., on a train or bus. On the other hand, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> is a kind of inband transparent relay and works in a half-duplex mode. Usually, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> only supports functions up to layer 2. <b>Type</b> II <b>relay</b> does not have a physical cell ID and is a part of a donor eNodeB cell. The eNodeB directly controls the UEs in the cell and performs resource allocation. The <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> transparently participates in data forwarding in downlink and uplink, i.e., the UE is not aware of {{whether or not it is}} communicating with the eNodeB via the relay. As a result, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> should not transmit synchronization signal, common reference signal, etc. Therefore, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> cannot be used for coverage extension and the main purpose of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> is to enhance throughput and quality-of-service of UEs, especially for cell-edge UEs, in the macro cell.|$|R

In this article, we focus on relay-assisted uplink data retransmission and propose a novel joint design of reference signal and data precoding for <b>type</b> II <b>relay.</b> The proposed method not only solves the problem of channel estimation mismatch for control information, but also achieves cooperative diversity gain for data transmission.

30|$|Simulation {{results show}} that the {{proposed}} algorithm is very close to optimal solutions found by exhaustive search, with low number of users and RB. When the number of users and RBs is growing, the proposed algorithm gives valuable performances enhancement compared to solutions without relay with the fixed relay selection strategies. With the joint relay selection strategy, power consumption is even lower. This strategy is more flexible and thus better benefits from frequency and multi-user diversity. However, its complexity is higher, and it incurs additional overhead. Comparing the average power per user <b>type</b> (<b>relay,</b> relayed source and non-relayed source) and their location in the cell allows to conclude that the sub-optimal fixed relay strategy achieves a good compromise between transmit power decrease and complexity.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} causal discrete-memoryless relay {{networks}} (DMRNs). The network consists of multiple nodes, {{each of which}} can be a source, relay, and/or destination. In the network, there are two <b>types</b> of <b>relays,</b> i. e., relays with one sample delay (strictly causal) and relays without delay (causal) whose transmit signal depends not only on the past received symbols but also on the current received symbol. For this network, we derive two new cut-set bounds, one when the causal relays have their own messages and the other when not. Using examples of a causal vector Gaussian two-way relay channel and a causal vector Gaussian relay channel, we show that the new cut-set bounds can be achieved by a simple amplify-and-forward <b>type</b> <b>relaying.</b> Our result for the causal relay channel strengthens the previously known capacity result for the same channel by El Gamal, Hassanpour, and Mammen.

30|$|One {{major problem}} in using the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> in uplink data {{retransmission}} [10, 11] {{is caused by the}} backward compatibility requirement. As specified in LTE-Advanced specifications, when a legacy UE has both control information (e.g., ACK/NACK, periodic channel quality indicator (CQI) report, etc.), and data to be transmitted in the uplink, the UE should embed the control information in the data transmission in order to retain the single carrier-frequency division multiple access characteristics and to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Such a transmission requirement, i.e., embedding control information in data, brings difficulty for type II relay-assisted cooperative retransmission, where <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> monitors initial transmission of the UE and performs cooperative transmission to assist retransmission of UE when the initial transmission is failed. We assume that the UE has control information (e.g., ACK/NACK to different downlink data packets) to be transmitted at both initial transmission and retransmission. For simplicity, we denote the control information embedded in initial transmission as “old” control information and the control information embedded in retransmission as “new” control information. The <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> can only know the old control information through monitoring and detecting the initial transmission but cannot know the new control information to be transmitted by the UE in advance before the retransmission. Therefore, <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> will have difficulty in performing the retransmission. If the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> sends exactly the same signals as the initial transmission of the UE, i.e., with the old control information, the old control information from the relay and the new control information from the UE will collide at the eNodeB. If the relay punctures the old control information in cooperative retransmission, the eNodeB receives the control information only from the UE but a superposed reference signal from both the relay and the UE. Consequently, channel estimation mismatch occurs for the control information and results in unacceptable detection performance of the control information.|$|R

In the latter scheme, a relay first decodes the received signal and re‐encodes it for forwarding regardless of the decoding result at the relay, namely, fixed DF relaying scheme [5] or determines whether to forward it or not depending on the channel condition of the SR link, namely, selective DF relaying scheme [6].
