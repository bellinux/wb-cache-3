30|$|Only 4 {{of all the}} 155 survey schools did {{not provide}} {{information}} for this part {{and this may be}} due to the reason that they did not want to broadcast their graduates’ perceived <b>proficiency</b> level <b>in</b> the three languages to others. Apart from these four schools, two more schools did not show their graduates’ <b>proficiency</b> level <b>in</b> Putonghua. In fact, it is difficult for schools to tell their graduates’ <b>proficiency</b> level <b>in</b> Putonghua before graduation since the TSA provides assessment only for speaking skills in English and Cantonese but not in Putonghua. Putonghua materials are only provided when assessing students’ listening skill in Chinese. Therefore, the schools might have to guess their graduates’ <b>proficiency</b> level <b>in</b> Putonghua and the Putonghua proficiency data we collected may not be reliable.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of family-induced {{linguistic}} input as a predictor for <b>proficiencies</b> <b>in</b> written language production of multilingual children aged 11. Our study considers their <b>proficiencies</b> <b>in</b> majority language (German) {{as well as in}} their family languages. Given that in most cases systematic educational support is warranted for majority language only, we assume marginal effects of familial linguistic input on the child's performance in majority language but substantial effects on family language proficiencies. We differentiate between quantitative and qualitative input aspects and include additional social and educational variables that are supposed to interfere with the relation between linguistic input and language proficiencies. The study is based on cross-sectional data collected in a pilot study, including Russian-German, Turkish-German and Vietnamese-German children in northern Germany. We computed nested OLS-regression models to examine the hypothesized relations. Results indicate that effects of familial quantitative input in German decrease when controlled for duration of contact with the majority language and for type of school the children attend. We discuss these factors mainly as indicators for external linguistic input. On the other hand we find support for the hypothesis that the quality of familial input in the family language has significant effect on the child's writing <b>proficiencies</b> <b>in</b> this language. We find no evidence that structural factors of the social background play an independent role in the examined relations...|$|R

5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it took off the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure <b>proficiency</b> <b>in</b> battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E
