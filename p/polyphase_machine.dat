We prove the equivalence of such a machine {{with a set of}} magnetically independent machines, which are electrically and mechanically coupled. Specific problems of <b>polyphase</b> <b>machines</b> can thus be favorably analyzed with this concept. Rules of conception and constraints on electric supply can be deduced. Moreover the vectorial approach, which generalizes the complex phasor method, {{can also be used to}} control n-leg Voltage Source Inverters.

50|$|AC {{traction}} still occasionally uses dual {{overhead wires}} instead of single phase lines. The resulting three-phase current drives induction motors, {{which do not}} have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a regenerative brake. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.Rectifier locomotives, which used AC power transmission and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of new ceramic HTC materials in 1986 / 87 with critical temperatures above 77 K inaugurates additional {{applications in the}} field of small electrical machines. Therefore the present research project deals with preparing investigations first on liquid nitrogen cooled electrical machines and machine components, that can be extrapolated to using HTC - wound motors. It is intended to investigate 77 K properties of cheap standard materials of the electrical machine construction and to calculate performance characteristics of liquid nitrogen cooled <b>polyphase</b> <b>machines.</b> With these results material demands on HTC wires will be detected. A systematic theoretical and metrological study of materials and machines results in the following summary of the present research project: High quality standard materials of the usual 300 K temperature range can be used at 77 K, on principle there are partly worse material properties (e. g. iron losses). Nevertheless small electrical machines of frame size 250 W have an increase in output coefficient of two to four times {{and at the same time}} clearly raised efficiencies compared to the 300 K type. Application advantages of small cryo or HTC machines clearly exceed principal disadvantages, so that cryo machines can be used profitably alreaedy now. After having developed a suitable HTC wire a favourably HTC machine performance will be achieved. (orig.)

40|$|High inrush {{currents}} and unbalanced supply voltages {{are two of}} the major causes for failure of <b>polyphase</b> induction <b>machines.</b> While thyristor voltage controllers, sometimes called static starters, are in widespread use to limit damaging {{inrush currents}}, little {{attention has been paid to}} use of these controllers to balance the phases voltages of the machine. This project addresses the technical feasibility of unsymmetric control to limit unbalanced currents. A general case of unbalance is modelled in the ACSL program and will also be modelled on the analog computer. The controller adjusts two objective variables: constant positive sequence voltage and balance in rms current in all phases. Preliminary results show that a substantial reduction in losses is possible for general case of unbalance. The improvement obtained will be illustrated from the fundamental components of voltage and currents using Fourier Analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractâThis paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to dynamical modeling of asymmetries in electric <b>machines</b> and <b>polyphase</b> systems (e. g., the ones caused by unbalanced supply waveforms). The proposed technique is a polyphase generalization of the dynamic phasor approach from power electronics and electric drives. The technique is applicable to nonlinear models, and offers distinct advantages in modeling, simulation and control with respect to standard timeâdomain models. In a steady-state, the dynamic phasors reduce to standard phasors from ac circuit theory. We performed experiments and simulations involving a three-phase induction motor and a three-phase synchronous permanent magnet motor, and we demonstrate that models based on dynamic phasors provide very accurate descriptions of observed transients. In a steady state, our approach yields improved equivalent circuits that contain coupling between {{the positive and negative}} sequence subcircuits.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{technique}} to detect broken rotor bars in <b>polyphase</b> induction <b>machines</b> is presented. Like most techniques, we employ the Fourier Transform of one stator current to make detection. But where the other methods use the Fourier Transform modulus, we propose an alternative approach by analyzing its phase. As shown by results, the Fourier Transform phase allows to detect one broken rotor bar when the motor operates under a low load. In order to improve the diagnosis and to permit the detection of incipient broken rotor bar, we complete the analysis with the Hilbert Transform. This transform provides good results and a partially broken rotor bar can be detected when the load torque is equal or greater than 25 %. The main advantage of these methods {{is that it does}} not require a healthy motor reference to take the final decision on the rotor cage state...|$|R

50|$|Transformation {{of three}} phase {{electrical}} quantities to two phase quantities is a usual practice to simplify analysis of three phase electrical circuits. <b>Polyphase</b> a.c <b>machines</b> {{can be represented}} by an equivalent two phase model provided the rotating polyphases winding in rotor and the stationary polyphase windings in stator can be expressed in a fictitious two axes coils. The process of replacing one set of variables to another related set of variable is called winding transformation or simply transformation or linear transformation. The term linear transformation means that the transformation from old to new set of variable and vice versa is governed by linear equations.The equations relating old variables and new variables are called transformation equation and the following general form: Variable = matrixvariable Variable = matrixvariableTransformation matrix is a matrix containing the coefficients that relates new and old variables. Note that the second transformation matrix in the above-mentioned general form is inverse of first transformation matrix.The transformation matrix should account for power invariance in the two frames of reference. In case power invariance is not maintained, then torque calculation should be from original machine variables only.|$|R
40|$|Sustainable energy {{solutions}} are aimed {{to reduce the}} consumption of fossil fuels by using renewable energy sources and energy efficiency techniques. This thesis presents two new sustainable energy applications {{in the field of}} electrical <b>machines.</b> <b>Polyphase</b> induction motors dominate the energy usage spectrum for industrial and commercial applications. The conventional winding structure used in both synchronous and induction machines has a basic unit of the winding with a 60 degree phase belt and a three phase connection either in star or delta. A new winding structure using an innovative Star-Delta Series Connection (SDSC) which has a high winding coefficient and low harmonic content is presented in this thesis. The principle of the SDSC winding is described. The Electro-Magnetic Belt and Electro-Magnetic Space diagram are two important means to be used for optimization of the new winding. Experimental results from two prototypes confirm the theoretical analysis. The efficiency of the new machine at rated load increased by about 3. 8 % as compared to the standard machine with a conventional winding structure. Wind energy {{is one of the most}} attractive renewable energy options. Wind turbines are designed to couple either synchronous or asynchronous generators with various forms of direct or indirect connection with grid or diesel generators. Permanent magnet (PM) generators using high energy Neodymium- Iron-Boron magnets offer advantages such as direct coupling without gear box, absence of excitation winding and slip rings, light weight and smaller size. This thesis presents the design and development of an outer-rotor PM generator suitable for wind energy conversion. The initial electromagnetic design followed by a Finite Element Analysis is presented in detail. A 20 kW prototype machine was built and extensively tested. It was found that the machine could maintain an ++efficiency of about 85 % for a wide operating range. Equivalent circuit models were developed. The results of the Finite Element analysis matches closely with the experimental and the designed values...|$|R
