5|$|The royal <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of PhilipII onward, although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted {{as a means to}} introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). Although there is little evidence for royal pages in the Antigonid period, it is known that some of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168BC.|$|E

The space that Gypsy had occupied was immediately available for long-term lease, with furniture included.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
60|$|The ANZEIGER is an eight-page paper; its <b>page</b> <b>is</b> {{one inch}} wider and one inch {{longer than a}} {{foolscap}} page; that is to say, the dimensions of its <b>page</b> <b>are</b> somewhere between those of a schoolboy's slate and a lady's pocket handkerchief. One-fourth of the first <b>page</b> <b>is</b> taken up with the heading of the journal; this gives it a rather top-heavy appearance; {{the rest of the}} first <b>page</b> <b>is</b> reading-matter; all of the second <b>page</b> <b>is</b> reading-matter; the other six <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> devoted to advertisements.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Winnie's adopted {{younger brother}} Perry Winkle {{and his friends}} the Rinkydinks {{became the focus of}} the Sunday pages. In Europe, only the Sunday <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> translated. In Holland and France, local artists made new comics about Perry when the number of weekly pages by Branner was no longer sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The leading Soviet musical {{periodical}} reported Prokofiev's {{death as}} a brief item on page 116. The first 115 <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> devoted {{to the death of}} Stalin.

5000|$|Shadow <b>paging</b> <b>is</b> a copy-on-write {{technique}} for avoiding in-place updates of pages. Instead, when a <b>page</b> <b>is</b> to be modified, a shadow <b>page</b> <b>is</b> allocated. Since the shadow page has no references (from other pages on disk), {{it can be}} modified liberally, without concern for consistency constraints, etc. When the <b>page</b> <b>is</b> ready to become [...] durable, all pages that referred to the original are updated {{to refer to the}} new replacement page instead.

In Austria and Germany, the yellow <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> known as Gelbe Seiten, and in Sweden as Gula Sidorna, which in both cases means the yellow pages. In Portugal and Brazil, the yellow <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> known as Páginas Amarelas. In Spain, Chile, Peru, Argentina and other {{countries}} in Latin America, the yellow <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> known as páginas amarillas. In France and in francophone Canada, they're known as Pages jaunes. In Japan, the yellow <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> known as Town Page.

5|$|The royal <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of Philip II onward, although more solid evidence for {{their presence in the}} royal court dates to the reign of Alexander the Great.

While conscripted pages would have looked forward to a lifelong career at court or even a prestigious post as a governor, they can also be regarded as hostages held by the royal court in order to ensure the loyalty and obedience of their aristocratic fathers. The abusive punishment of pages, such as flogging, carried out by the king at times, led to intrigue and conspiracy against the Crown, as did the frequent homosexual relations between the pages and the elite, sometimes with the king. Although there is little evidence for royal pages throughout the Antigonid period, it is known that a group of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC.|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu's {{old and new}} {{writings}} {{came out}} in several editions: Pagini alese ("Selected Works", 1956), Din munți și din câmpii ("From Mountains and Plains", 1957), Din copilărie ("Childhood Memories", 1957), File din cartea naturii ("Pages from the Book of Nature", 1959), Povestind copiilor ("Stories for Children", 1961) and Faraonii ("The Pharaohs", 1961). Although formally congratulated by the regime, Agârbiceanu fell out with its censorship apparatus. According to various accounts, he allowed the censors to operate multiple changes, {{as long as the}} substance of his writing was not itself altered. Portions of his work were cut out during reediting, and a novel, Prăbușirea ("The Downfall"), serialized in Gazeta Literară, was so crudely handled that seven of its <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> lost forever.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} the marshall of Jülich {{approached}} Mercator {{and asked him to}} prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the crown prince Johannes. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> filmed per day, {{six days}} a week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
5|$|I Love Bees {{was first}} advertised by a hidden {{message in a}} Halo 2 trailer; players who {{investigated}} the titular website discovered that the pages appeared to be hacked by a mysterious intelligence. As players solved puzzles, audio logs were posted to the ilovebees.com site which gradually revealed more of the fictional back-story, involving a marooned artificial intelligence stranded on Earth and its attempts to put itself back together. 250,000 people viewed the ilovebees website when it was launched in August 2004, and more than 500,000 returned to the site every time the <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> updated. More than three million visitors viewed the site {{over the course of}} three months, and thousands {{of people around the world}} participated in the game. I Love Bees won numerous awards for its innovation and helped spawn numerous other alternate reality games for video games.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Swiss {{publisher}} Urs Graf Verlag Bern {{produced the}} first facsimile of the Book of Kells. The {{majority of the}} <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> reproduced in black-and-white photographs, but the edition also featured forty-eight colour reproductions, including all the full-page decorations. Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in full colour, with photography by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.|$|E

5|$|Later, in the Central Asian campaign, {{a second}} plot against {{his life was}} revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E

5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These <b>pages</b> <b>were,</b> in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E
5|$|The script {{received}} constant {{input from}} the producers and from Shatner and Nimoy. The discussions led to repeated rewrites, {{right up to the}} day the <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> to be shot. At one point, scenes were being rewritten so often it became necessary to note on script pages the hour of the revision. Though changes were constant, the biggest push for alteration revolved around the ending. Much of the rewriting {{had to do with the}} relationships of Kirk and Spock, Decker and Ilia, and the Enterprise and Vger. A final draft of the third act was approved in late September 1978, but had it not been for a Penthouse interview where NASA director Robert Jastrow said that mechanical forms of life were likely, the ending may not have been approved at all.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the <b>pages</b> <b>were</b> carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
