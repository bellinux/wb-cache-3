40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} {{techniques for}} project scheduling such as Arrow <b>Diagramming</b> <b>Method</b> (ADM) and <b>Precedence</b> <b>Diagramming</b> <b>Method</b> (PDM) are continuously undergoing improvisation {{in order to}} replicate real-time construction scenario. Quite often, these methods are criticized for their limited information capturing ability. Relationship <b>Diagramming</b> <b>Method</b> (RDM) proposed by Plotnick in the recent past, is an improved variant of PDM, which can store additional information on relationships that would improve the scheduling process. In addition to basic data on the activities, additional information can be represented through five codes in RDM. Sequencing of activities in a construction project is primarily driven by the construction logic and/or the availability of resources. There is scope for arriving at alternate sequences with varying availability of resources to achieve the objectives of project scheduling {{as long as the}} construction logic is preserved. In order to achieve such a resource-constrained project scheduling, additional information on the restraints of the activities are necessary, which can be modelled using RDM through one of the five codes of RDM. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore and exploit the Reason/Why code of RDM. The Reason and Why codes are associated with a restraint and for recording the description respectively. An activity's dependence on a resource has been captured using Reason/Why code in this study. It has been attempted to understand the impact of varying resource availability using an empirical equation on sequencing such resource dependent activities and its effect on critical path. The proposed concept is tested with data from a repetitive high rise construction project. The preliminary results have been well received...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently {{developed}} point-to-point {{relations have}} greatly extended the modeling {{capability of the}} <b>Precedence</b> <b>Diagram</b> <b>Method.</b> These relations can connect any inner (and extreme) points of the related activities. Furthermore, the definition of multiple relations is allowed between the same two activities. These features make point-to-point relations suitable for modeling overlapping activities more easily and with greater precision than it was possible before. However, {{there is a lot}} of work ahead. Although both proper mathematical modeling, and the algorithm that handles both minimal and maximal relations are available, re-investigation of well-known definitions for float, critical path, critical path metrics, classification of critical activities etc. are still missing. This paper deals with the investigation of the critical path. It describes the ways in which an activity can be part of the critical path.

40|$|Critical path {{analysis}} {{on a project}} network having non-finish-to-start (FS) logical relationships with lags is generally referred to as <b>precedence</b> <b>diagram</b> <b>method</b> (PDM). A PDM-based scheduling analysis is facilitated by mainstream project scheduling software (such as P 3). However, PDM compounds total float determination and interpretation, potentially causing anomalous effects on critical path identification. In the present research, we generalize those particular circumstances that entail applying non-FS logical relationships on construction projects. We then propose generic transform schemes such that non-FS relationships in a PDM network can be detected and transformed- automatically-into equivalent FS. Moreover, we provide analytical proofs for the transform schemes being proposed to justify the logical equivalency between the original PDM network and the transformed activity-on-node (AON) network only having FS logical relationships. A PDM network example demonstrates that confusions would arise in interpreting P 3 's critical {{path analysis}} results, {{but not in the}} case of the transformed AON counterpart. In conclusion, the transform schemes being proposed lead to better understanding of the scheduling results when critical path analysis is performed on a PDM network. This also paves the way for conducting further sophisticated scheduling analysis (such as resource loading or Monte Carlo simulation) on a PDM network.

40|$|AbstractTheoretically proper {{modeling}} of overlapping activities with traditional precedence relationships is impossible. This {{is due to}} the fact that traditional precedence relations create logic between the endpoints of activities. In contradiction, overlapping can be defined as a ‘continuous’ relation using time or location/production units between all the points of the predecessor and all the points of the successor activities. (E. g. at least 50 m safety distance is necessary between activity B and A during execution.) Recently developed point-to-point relations give a practically better solution, as they let planners form connections among as many internal points of the related activities as seemingly necessary, and all these points can be controlled during the execution phase. However, a theoretically proper solution is only available if an infinite number of point-to-point relations are used between two overlapping activities, but this is obviously impossible. The novelty of this paper is the definition of a new type of precedence relation for the <b>Precedence</b> <b>Diagram</b> <b>Method</b> (PDM), the so-called continuous relation. One continuous relation can be used instead of infinite point-to-point relations in order to perfectly model activity overlapping. Relation lags can be defined using either time or volume units. Another main advantage of this development is that continuous relations enable the definition of non-linear activities, while original PDM assumes continuous linear activities only...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the birth}} of <b>Precedence</b> <b>Diagramming</b> <b>Method</b> (PDM) is not as radiant as of CPM or PERT, but it is {{definitely}} the prevailing scheduling technique of our times. This popularity is due to its modeling flexibility over other techniques and the easy-to-understand mathematical model behind the technique. However, even this technique has its own limitations; modeling overlapping activities in a proper way {{seems to be a}} never-ending debate. The reason of this {{can be found in the}} fundamentals of PDM technique; the four precedence relationships that form connections between the end-points of the activities, with constant production speed. These fundamentals of PDM have their own consequences to scheduling practice; it is more and more apparent among professionals that activity overlapping in PDM cannot be modeled adequately. Different solutions were proposed for solving this problem from the application of negative lag, through the combination of SS and FF relations to the fragmentation of activities. All these solutions have their shortcomings. Probably the fragmentation technique has led to the development of point-to-point type of relation that can connect any arbitrary points of the dependent activities. The objective of this paper is to analyze the pros and cons of different solutions that are used for modeling overlapped activities, then to show how newly defined point-to-point relations can be used for this purpose. Algorithms that handles point-to-point relations with minimal and maximal lags are also presented. The main finding of the paper is that newly developed point-topoint relations are better from theoretical and practical point of view than the solutions based on traditional precedence relationships, but they still cannot provide theoretically perfect solution for overlapping.

40|$|In the {{construction}} industry there is an essential requirement for efficient construction schedules that consider the availability of resources as well as constraints. It is standard practice in today’s construction process planning to use the <b>Precedence</b> <b>Diagram</b> <b>Method</b> (PDM), including well-established methods such as the Critical Path Method (CPM). A possible means of improving the mostly manually executed generation process is to apply computer-aided methods such as discrete-event simulation. By combining this method with resource-constrained scheduling methodology it becomes possible to not only verify schedules but also to generate schedules that take resources into consideration. In addition to discrete-event simulation CPM is able to analyse float times, but {{is not able to}} consider resources. Discrete-event simulation on the other hand can consider resources, but is unable to calculate float times. The calculation of float times for construction tasks is an important task. An awareness of float times makes it possible to identify whether a delayed task can be compensated for or if the entire construction project will be late. In this paper we propose using Backward Simulation methodology to develop an elaborated approach that extends discrete-event simulation by the ability to calculate float times. Here, the simulation starts at the virtual completion date of {{the construction}} project and runs backwards in time until the start date. To determine float times {{it is important that the}} task execution sequence is in the same order for forward and backward simulation. Consequently we present an extension to the simulation concept that controls the execution order of the tasks within the backward simulation. By combining the results of the forward and backward simulation, it is possible to determine float times for each task while taking into account resources. A comprehensive case study is described that illustrates the application of this new approach.

The two methods are 'participatory diagramming', where the respondent creates a diagram that assists in their communication of answers, and 'graphic elicitation', where a researcher-prepared diagram is used to stimulate data collection. <b>Methods</b> These two <b>diagramming</b> <b>methods</b> were applied in key informant interviews and their value in efficiently and effectively gathering data was assessed based on quantitative measures and qualitative observations. Results Assessment of the two <b>diagramming</b> <b>methods</b> suggests that participatory diagramming is an efficient method for collecting data in graphic form, but may not generate the depth of verbal response that many qualitative researchers seek. In contrast, graphic elicitation was more intuitive, better understood and preferred by most respondents, and often provided more contemplative verbal responses, however this was achieved {{at the expense of}} more interview time. Conclusion <b>Diagramming</b> <b>methods</b> are important for eliciting interview data that are often difficult to obtain through traditional verbal exchanges.
