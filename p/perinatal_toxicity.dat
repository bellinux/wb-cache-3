Astragaloside IV had no maternal toxicity at 0. 25 to 1. 0 mg/kg in rats. Although it has an inhibitory effect on female fertility in F 0 /F 1 rats, AS-IV was devoid of early embryonic developmental toxicity in F 0 /F 1 rats and in the survival parameters of F 1 postnatal rats. Maternal AS-IV exposure at the dose of 1. 0 mg/kg per d resulted in a significant delay in time for fur development, eye opening, and cliff parry reflex of pups compared to control group (P <. 05), whereas it {{did not affect the}} memory and learning of F 1 pups.

40|$|Senna occidentalis is a weed {{toxic to}} {{different}} animal species. Very {{little is known}} about the effects of prolonged exposure to low doses of S. occidentalis on developmental toxicology. Thus, the present study proposes an approach to evaluate the <b>perinatal</b> <b>toxicity</b> of S. occidentalis seeds in goats. Twenty-one pregnant goats were fed rations containing 0 % (control), 1 % (Sol group), 2 % (So 2 group) and 4 % (So 4 group) mature S. occidentalis seeds from pregnancy detection on day 27 after mating until parturition; weight gains and serum biochemistry were evaluated. Fetuses were evaluated using ultrasonographic measurements; neonates were evaluated by body morphometry, weight gains, and serum biochemistry. Fetal resorption occurred in 2 So 4 dams and one dam died. Only a few minor alterations in serum biochemistry occurred in dams and kids; even so one So 4 group dam had tissue lesions as vacuolations in hepatocytes and kidneys; necrosis in skeletal and cardiac muscles and for the first time lesions were observed in sciatic nerve cells. No relevant alterations in body morphometry were observed. This study suggests that 4 % S. occidentalis seeds is toxic for pregnant goats, but levels of seeds less than 4 % have little impact on fetal and post birth body development. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the physiological factors that regulate perinatal dosimetry is essential to improve the ability of physiologically based (PB) pharmacokinetic (PK) models to predict chemical risks to children. However, the impact of changing maternal/offspring physiology on PK during gestation and lactation remains poorly understood. This research determined lipid and protein changes in blood, milk and amniotic fluid of CD and Wistar dams, fetuses and neonates to improve the precision of perinatal PBPK modeling. Samples were collected from timemated CD dams, fetuses, and pups on gestation day (GD) 18 and 20 (sperm positive 5 GD 0) or lactation day 0 (day of birth), 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 (n â€¡ 5 per time point). Fewer time points were sampled in Wistar rats, which showed similar patterns to CDs. Relative to nonpregnant dams, maternal serum protein levels (albumin, total protein and globulin) each decreased by ~ 20 % during late gestation, whereas maternal serum lipids (triglycerides, low density lipoproteins, and phospholipids) increased up to fourfold. These physiological changes can impact maternal PK of both protein-bound and lipophilic chemicals. During lactation, triglycerides in milk were greater than 100 -fold higher than maternal serum, favoring the disposition of lipophilic chemicals into milk and potentially increasing neonatal rodent exposure during critical stages of postnatal development. Serum protein levels in pups were two- to threefold lower than adults at birth, which may increase the bioavailability of protein-bound compounds. These data will aid {{in the interpretation of}} <b>perinatal</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies and improve the accuracy of predictive perinatal PBPK models.

40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of prenatal and early postnatal ethanol exposure were assessed in adult (5 -month), aged (24 -month), and senescent (30 -month) rats on non-aggressive intermale social behavior, and on black-white discrimination and spatial learning behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of chronic application of the Ca 2 + channel blocker nimodipine, which reportedly improves behavioral function in aging, were studied on the ethanol-induced behavioral deficits during aging, The {{results showed that the}} perinatal alcohol treatment suppressed social behavior by reducing the frequency and duration of social interactions at all ages. Black-white discrimination behavior and appetitively motivated learning in a hole-board were also markedly disturbed, Several measures of social and spatial learning behaviors of ethanol-exposed rats revealed progressive functional decline with aging. Chronic oral treatment with nimodipine improved the social activity and normalized the cognitive behavioral capabilities of aged and senescent rats exposed to ethanol. We concluded that: (1) the behavioral disabilities caused by <b>perinatal</b> ethanol <b>toxicity</b> are persistent in the rat lifespan and become more pronounced with aging; and (2) administration of nimodipine in the aging period improves, with a long-lasting efficacy, the ethanol-induced behavioral dysfunctions in aged rats...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionChinese herbal {{medicine}} is an increasingly popular worldwide medical therapy {{which also has}} an impact in pregnancy. However, the question of its drug safety during pregnancy remains unresolved. Potential problems include teratogenicity, abortion, <b>perinatal</b> <b>toxicity,</b> pre- and postnatal developmental abnormalities, and eventually an increased risk for carcinomas in the offspring. Standard Materia Medica textbooks contain unreliable information {{when it comes to}} risks during pregnancy. Wang and co-workers conducted an experimental study (WS) on mice in which they investigated the effects of 17 Chinese medicinals regarding embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity. All these drugs seemed to exhibit multiple significant toxic effects. Another study by Li and co-workers (LS) investigated the reproductive toxicity of Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma in mice, rats and rabbits. They described an increased pre- and postnatal mortality and, at high doses, congenital malformations. In an attempt to identify the risks of the tested medicinals during pregnancy, we analysed these two experimental studies and compared their results with possible safety data for humans from two reviews of clinical studies on threatened miscarriage (AR and CR). MethodsWe re-evaluated WS and LS in relation to accordance with internationally accepted rules, equivalence to human dose, biometric accuracy, plausibility, and coherence. Eligible studies of the two reviews on threatened miscarriage were evaluated for specific pregnancy risks concerning the 17 medicinals tested in WS and LS. ResultsWe found that WS does not conform to international ICH guidelines and includes many inconsistencies, implausibilities and several severe biometrical flaws. It reported a total of 364 significant events out of which 145 false significant results are expected. The data-handling pointed to irregularities. Analysis of LS exhibited also many inconsistencies. The results regarding congenital malformations were statistically insignificant and are based on small case numbers. Insofar as the safety data of the 17 medicinals were documented by eligible studies of the two reviews, there was no indication of an increased abortion rate in humans. Fetal growth retardation was not observed in the human studies. For neonatal health and postnatal development, there were sufficient safety data only for a few medicinals in the human studies. As for teratogenicity, only small case numbers (0 to 109) were available from the human data. ConclusionWS and LS are not reliable data sources for deriving pregnancy risks in humans for the tested Chinese medicinals. In addition, the results appear to contradict the outcomes observed in the treatment of humans. Regarding teratogenicity, for most Chinese medicinals, neither the safety nor the risk during pregnancy can be definitively ascertained. Further studies on the risks of Chinese medicinals during pregnancy are urgently needed...|$|E
