This {{has resulted in}} public opposition and protests {{at some of the}} sites. In March 2012, two of the big six power companies announced they would be pulling out of developing new nuclear power plants. The decision by RWE npower and E.ON follows uncertainty over nuclear energy following the Fukushima nuclear disaster last year. The companies will not proceed with their Horizon project, which was to develop nuclear reactors at Wylfa in North Wales and at Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire. Their decision follows a similar announcement by Scottish and Southern Electricity last year.

50|$|Despite obvious US-management {{pressure}} to maximize commonality under the skin, {{the range of}} engines fitted on the Taunus TC differed from that on contemporary Cortinas in respect of the less powerful cars, and the UK company's venerable ohv Kent engine never {{found its way into}} the Belgian assembled Ford Germany version of the car. The rather lumpy V4 engine that had powered the Taunus P6 models in the 1960s (and which, in enlarged and more powerful form, would live on to power Ford Germany's Transit vans and full-size Granada model through much of the 1970s) was also passed over for the Taunus TC. The less powerful Taunus TCs were powered by a new four-cylinder OHC engine that was shared with the newly introduced American Ford Pinto and was offered, at this stage, with 1294 cc or 1593 cc: a 1993 cc version of the four-cylinder engine would be added from 1976 in the Taunus TC2. In the meantime, signalling a move away from the strategy followed with the Taunus P6, customers willing to pay for more <b>power</b> <b>could</b> <b>now</b> specify one of the compact V6 units carried over from the top range P7 models, the six-cylinder engines offering a choice between 1999 cc and 2294 cc displacements.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence of}} the disruption of a transition from fossil fuels to nuclear power, and finds the benefits forgone as a consequence are substantial. Learning rates are presented for nuclear power in seven countries, comprising 58 % of all power reactors ever built globally. Learning rates and deployment rates changed in the late- 1960 s and 1970 s from rapidly falling costs and accelerating deployment to rapidly rising costs and stalled deployment. Historical nuclear global capacity, electricity generation and overnight construction costs are compared with the counterfactual that pre-disruption learning and deployment rates had continued to 2015. Had the early rates continued, nuclear <b>power</b> <b>could</b> <b>now</b> be around 10 % of its current cost. The additional nuclear power could have substituted for 69, 000 – 186, 000 TWh of coal and gas generation, thereby avoiding up to 9. 5 million deaths and 174 Gt CO 2 emissions. In 2015 alone, nuclear power could have replaced up to 100 % of coal-generated and 76 % of gas-generated electricity, thereby avoiding up to 540, 000 deaths and 11 Gt CO 2. Rapid progress was achieved {{in the past and}} could be again, with appropriate policies. Research is needed to identify impediments to progress, and policy is needed to remove them...|$|R
