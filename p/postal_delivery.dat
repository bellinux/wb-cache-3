25|$|Postal {{codes in}} the Netherlands, known as postcodes, are alphanumeric, {{consisting}} of four digits {{followed by a}} space and two letters (NNNN AA). Adding the house number to the postcode will identify the address, making the street name and town name redundant. For example: 2597 GV 75 will direct a <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> to Theo Mann-Bouwmeesterlaan 75, 's-Gravenhage (the International School of The Hague).|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, {{following}} a Memorandum of Understanding signed with Emirates Post in April of the year, the federal Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications officially reconstituted the Somali Postal Service (Somali Post). In October 2014, the ministry also relaunched <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> from abroad. The postal system {{is slated to}} be implemented {{in each of the}} country's 18 administrative provinces via a new postal coding and numbering system.|$|E
25|$|Svalbard {{had since}} its {{settlement}} in the early 20th century been entirely isolated from the world during winter, when ice closed its ports. As a trial, the air force carried out a <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> expedition in April 1949, dropping mail at Longyearbyen, Ny-Ålesund and Sveagruva. Another flight was carried out the following year, with two more in 1951. The services continued with increasing frequency throughout the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The {{flight was}} a <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> flight {{which was to}} drop mail at six Norwegian {{settlements}} and outposts in Svalbard. The flight plan was to take a load of post from Tromsø Airport, Skattøra and fly a route to drop it at Bjørnøya Radio, Isfjord Radio, Longyearbyen, Ny-Ålesund, Hopen Radio and then fly back via Bjørnøya. The flight had an estimated duration of sixteen hours. It had been delayed for several days because of bad weather. The aircraft was prepared for the flight on 27 March.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Saint Phalle and {{her team}} began to build the first {{architectural}} sculpture in the garden. As the project progressed, Saint Phalle started taking lessons in the Italian language, to better communicate with local workers. The second crew member she hired was Ugo Celletti, a 50-year-old part-time <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> man, who discovered a love for mosaic work on the project. He would work on the project for 36 years, and recruit his nephews to join in; some family members are still involved in maintaining the site.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, {{international}} {{postal services}} for Somalia officially resumed. The UPU is now assisting the Somali Postal Service to develop its capacity, including providing technical assistance and basic mail processing equipment. In October 2014, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications also relaunched <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> from abroad. The postal system is slated to be implemented throughout the country via a new postal coding and numbering system. According to the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Mohamud Ibrihim Adan, the relaunch's next phase will enable local residents to send letters to acquaintances overseas.|$|E
50|$|The mail {{field in}} Israel treads towards competition. The Mail Authority became the Israel Postal Company. Gradually, the {{government}} owned postal company enabled additional companies {{to enter the}} market of <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries</b> of mail with a weight up to half a kilogram; this was done {{so that they could}} compete with the governmental mail company allowing the postage rates to drop.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 the Main Chicago Post Office {{came to a}} halt when a logjam of 10 million {{pieces of}} mail clogged the system for nearly a week. [...] With Chicago rated worst in <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries,</b> a new Main Post Office was {{proposed}} for right across Harrison Street. In 1997, the old building was vacated in favor of the new, modernized facility.|$|R
50|$|The 1988 United Kingdom postal workers {{strike was}} a strike in the United Kingdom in August and September 1988. It was the country's first {{national}} postal strike for 17 years, and began after postal workers at Royal Mail walked out in protest over bonuses {{being paid to}} recruit new workers in London and the South East. As a result, <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries</b> throughout the United Kingdom were disrupted for several weeks.|$|R
25|$|Before John Reed {{left for}} Russia, the Espionage Act was passed on June 15, 1917, which fined and imprisoned anyone who {{interfered}} with the recruiting of soldiers and prohibited the mailing of any newspaper or magazine that promoted such sentiments. The U. S. Postal Service was also given leave to deny any mailing that fitted these standards from further <b>postal</b> <b>delivery,</b> and then to disqualify a magazine because it had missed a mailing and hence, was no longer considered a regular publication. Because of this, The Masses was forced by the United States federal government to cease publication {{in the fall of}} 1917, after refusing to change the magazine's policy against the war. The Liberator, founded by Max Eastman under his and his sister's private control, published Reed's articles concerning the Russian Revolution instead. In an effort to ensure the magazine's survival, Eastman compromised and tempered its views accordingly.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} ancient trackways {{including}} the Pilgrims' Way and the North Downs Way (now designated as footpaths or byways) pass {{within a few}} miles of the village. Wormshill is not on any major roadways and has no rail service. No standard public transport facilities or taxicab operations exist in the village. A daily Postbus service, incorporated into the village <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> and collection timetable and which ran for 35 years, stopped on 14 November 2009. It {{was one of the last}} remaining postbus services in the United Kingdom. The service, run by the Royal Mail and subsidised by the county council, began in March 1974 and collected residents from Wormshill and other villages en route to Sittingbourne. The closure of the only means of public transport to and from the village was controversial and, following a campaign by local councillors and journalists, the postbus was replaced by a temporary minibus service, funded by the county council. Royal Mail postal deliveries continue to be made to the village. The village lies between the M2 and M20 motorways, and the nearest railway station is at Harrietsham on the Maidstone Line, [...] to the south by road.|$|E
50|$|The Curragh was {{a little}} isolated, which led to {{stringent}} regulations about taxi fares. However, the camp was well provided for, with recreational facilities (including, for the officers, hunting with the local gentry), several <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries</b> a day (last collection for England at 11 pm), and a daily Mass for Catholics at the East Church. A gun was fired every day at reveille, at 1 pm and at 9.30 pm.|$|R
50|$|Cocaine {{seems to}} arrive in Kosovo through <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries</b> or {{couriers}} from Serbia and/or South American countries, which are traditionally known for their cocaine production. It is first sent to Italy or Greece and usually in small quantities. The price for 1 gram of cocaine varied from EUR 45 to EUR 65 in 2007 and from EUR 50 to EUR 70 in 2008.

2500|$|In 1922, the Burbank Chamber of Commerce was organized. The Federal {{government}} officially recognized Burbank's {{status in}} 1923 when the United States Postal Service reclassified {{the city from}} the rural village mail delivery to city <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> service. By this time, Burbank's population had grown significantly, from less than 500 people in 1908 to over 3,000 citizens. The city's business district grew {{on the west side}} of San Fernando Blvd and stretched from Verdugo to Cypress avenues, and on the east side to Palm Avenue. From 1967–1989 a six-block stretch of San Fernando Blvd was pedestrianized as the [...] "Golden Mall".|$|E

50|$|A {{primary school}} was {{established}} in 1886 to cater for {{the increasing number of}} children in the area. Mains water was connected in 1889 and sewerage in the 1910s. The Parents and Citizens Association at the public school believed that residents were rather left out of regular <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries</b> and a petition was prepared for their member of parliament asking for a Croydon Park post office to be opened in the area. They were successful in 1914 and the surrounding neighbourhood became a separate suburb.|$|R

2500|$|The {{campaign}} found {{expression in}} the giving of conscience money to the Exchequer, as noted by The Guardian Financial Editor William Davis; {{in the middle of}} January, it was observed that every <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> to the Treasury contained letters offering gifts. If the letter specified that the money was to pay off the Government debt, the funds were paid into the Debt Redemption Fund; otherwise the Consolidated Fund was the beneficiary. Disc jockey Jimmy Savile found his own way to support the campaign by volunteering to work nine days as a hospital porter at Leeds General Infirmary over two months, stating that at his rate of pay, nine days' work would have earned him £1,600 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of postal codes reflects the increasing complexity of <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> as populations grew and {{the built environment}} became more complex. This happened first in large cities. Postal codes began with postal district numbers (or postal zone numbers) within large cities. London was first subdivided into 10 districts in 1857, and Liverpool in 1864. By World War I, such postal district or zone numbers existed in various large European cities. They existed in the United States at least {{as early as the}} 1920s, possibly implemented at the local post office level only (for example, instances of [...] "Boston 9, Mass" [...] in 1920 are attested,) although they were evidently not used throughout all major US cities (implemented USPOD-wide) until World War II.|$|E

6000|$|The {{question}} which occurred to everybody was {{suggested by the}} words which Cecilia had repeated to her father. Emily had said she had [...] "heard dreadful news"--how had that news reached her? The one <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> at Monksmoor was in the morning. Had any special messenger arrived, with a letter for Emily? The servants were absolutely certain that no such person had entered the house. The one remaining conclusion suggested that somebody must have communicated the evil tidings by word of mouth. But here again no evidence was to be obtained. No visitor had called during the day, and no new guests had arrived. Investigation was completely baffled.|$|E

"I {{have the}} {{pleasure}} of announcing" [...] (Mr. Crum wrote) [...] "that I have heard from Miss Silvester, by the next <b>postal</b> <b>delivery</b> ensuing, after I had dispatched my letter to Ham Farm. She writes, very briefly, to inform me that she has decided on establishing her next place of residence in London. The reason assigned for taking this step--which she certainly did not contemplate when I last saw her--is that she finds herself approaching {{the end of her}} pecuniary resources. Having already decided on adopting, as a means of living, the calling of a concert-singer, she has arranged to place her interests {{in the hands of an}} old friend of her late mother (who appears to have belonged also to the musical profession): a dramatic and musical agent long established in the metropolis, and well known to her as a trustworthy and respectable man. She sends me the name and address of this person--a copy of which you will find on the inclosed slip of paper--in the event of my having occasion to write to her, before she is settled in London. This is the whole substance of her letter. I have only to add, that it does not contain the slightest allusion to the nature of the errand on which she left Glasgow." ...|$|E
50|$|The postal {{services}} of many countries have long relied on bicycles. The British Royal Mail first started using bicycles in 1880; now bicycle delivery fleets include 37,000 in the UK, 25,700 in Germany, 10,500 in Hungary and 7000 in Sweden. In Australia, Australia Post has also reintroduced bicycle <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries</b> on some routes {{due to an}} inability to recruit sufficient licensed riders willing to use their uncomfortable motorbikes. The London Ambulance Service has recently introduced bicycling paramedics, who can often get {{to the scene of}} an incident in Central London more quickly than a motorized ambulance.|$|R

50|$|The use of tenders for loading {{passengers}} and their luggage was well established {{even before the}} Edwardian heyday of ocean liners as the major means of intercontinental transport. They avoided the need to wait for these large ships to enter harbour and be docked, sometimes involving the wait for suitable tides. Tenders were also used by intermediate ports, where they could stand out to sea beyond a harbour bar and exchange passengers, without the large ship needing to enter port. In the Victorian times of several <b>postal</b> <b>deliveries</b> a day, speed was of the essence in transporting mails and the slightest time advantage would be seized upon.|$|R
