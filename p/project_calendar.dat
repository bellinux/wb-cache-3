Those who must balance their time between working on multiple simultaneous projects would categorize key users. In the application, users {{will be able to}} participate in multiple projects at any one time. When a user is in a project, {{they will be able to}} create tasks, add tasks, be assigned to tasks, and add other users to the project. A key feature in this application is that each user is provided a personal project. In their personal project, any task assigned to the user from any project, will be synced to this <b>project</b> <b>calendar.</b> This will allow the user to easily view the tasks they need to complete given the start and end dates...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The rapid {{adoption}} rate {{of mobile}} phones coupled with advancements in supporting technologies suggests mobile phones {{may now be}} a viable tool for classroom use. In this paper we introduce the Mobile Subject Assistant (MSA), a proposed mobile phone based course tool. The tool is intended {{to assist in the}} delivery of university level subjects with an emphasis on student participation, collaboration and group or project work. The MSA provides an instructor with a means of easily capturing class performance using a quiz tool that provides immediate feedback and statistics. The MSA also allows an instructor to support group projects in their subject and provides each project group with their own <b>project</b> <b>calendar</b> and messaging system, as well as a subject based calendar and messaging system. In this paper we discuss the MSA tool itself, its features, its design and a number of HCI issued faced in design...|$|E

40|$|This small book {{offers a}} visual and verbal {{reflection}} {{on the process of}} artistic practice and the ephemeral traces left by these. It is part of the exhibition 'Calendar Variations', held at the woodend barn, Banchory, Scotland in April 2011. It considers the links of artistic practice with the world, experience and improvisation. This all started in the summer of 2010 with an artistic <b>project,</b> <b>Calendar</b> Variations, a dynamic visual art creation in Scotland, at Gray's School of Art, Robert Gordon University, which happened {{at the same time as}} the musical project 'Unexpected Variations' in Belgium, at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, Ghent. A deep interaction between artist-anthropologist Anne Douglas and artistphilosopher Kathleen Coessens, members of both artistic research groups, as well as the commitment and collaboration of the visual artists, shaped the artistic project into an engaged dynamic movement. Our gratitude goes to all our friends and colleagues, to the different institutions mentioned above, to the artists, philosophers and everybody without whom this endeavour would not have been possible. It is the motion and emotion emerging from this project that we hope to convey here. AHRC, the Barn, Sound festival of contemporary music, Orpheus Institute of Research into Musi...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Meetings are {{hot spots}} of {{communication}} and collaboration in software development teams. Both distributed and co-located teams need to meet for coordination, communication, and collaboration. It is difficult to assess the quality of these three crucial aspects, or the social effectiveness and impact of a meeting: Personalities, psychological and professional aspects interact. It is, therefore, challenging to identify emerging communication problems or to improve collaboration by studying a wealth of interrelated details of project meetings. However, it {{is relatively easy to}} count meetings, and to measure when and how long they took place. This is objective information, does not violate privacy of participants, and the data might even be retrieved from <b>project</b> <b>calendars</b> automatically. In an exploratory study, we observed 14 student teams working on comparable four-month projects. Among many other aspects, we counted and measured meetings. In this contribution, we compare the meeting profiles qualitatively, and derive a number of hypotheses relevant for software projects. Index Terms—team communication; meeting culture; software development I...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{describe}} the experience of applying the software development agile philosophy on a System Engineering Academic Research and Development Project and {{to reflect on the}} impact on the Project itself and on the working group. The experience tries to test how this modality not only allows a flexible Project planning but also favors, from the early stages of its execution, the development of knowledge and competence. It also puts into consideration the heterogeneous profiles of the working group: researchers, professors, graduates and students on different stages of their academic training. The reflection, which comes from observing the dynamics of knowledge and skills acquisition during {{the first quarter of the}} <b>Project's</b> <b>calendar,</b> tries to highlight the observed synergies that occur among the members of the group where everyone learns from everyone, with a common purpose, and the results on knowledge and competence development, thus generating new ways to transfer learning, new ways to acquire knowledge or to improve existing one...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Forest Service manages over 192 million acres of land, often conducting a variety of vegetation management projects such as thinning trees. Before approving projects that may significantly affect the environment, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) generally requires the Forest Service to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS). However, the Forest Service can decide not to prepare an EA or EIS if the project involves categories of activities that it previously found to have no significant environmental effect (categorical exclusions). As of 2003, the Forest Service had established one such exclusion affecting vegetation management projects and has since added four new ones. This testimony is based on GAO's report, Forest Service: Use of Categorical Exclusions for Vegetation Management <b>Projects,</b> <b>Calendar</b> Years 2003 through 2005 (GAO- 07 - 99). For vegetation management during these years, GAO determined (1) how many projects the Forest Service approved, including those approved using categorical exclusions; (2) which categorical exclusions it used to approve projects; and (3) if categorical exclusions are not being used in any field offices, why. To answer these questions, GAO surveyed Forest Service officials at all 155 national forests. ...|$|R
