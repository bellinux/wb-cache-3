40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{with high}} positive end-expiratory pressure (<b>PEEP)</b> {{has been used}} in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), but the role of <b>PEEP</b> in minimizing lung injury remains controversial. We hypothesized that in the presence of acute lung injury (ALI) with IAH: 1) higher <b>PEEP</b> levels improve pulmonary morphofunction and minimize lung injury; and 2) the biological effects of higher <b>PEEP</b> are more effective in extrapulmonary (exp) than pulmonary (p) ALI. METHODS: In 48 adult male Wistar rats, ALIp and ALIexp were induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide intratracheally and intraperitoneally, respectively. After 24 hours, animals were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated (tidal volume of 6 mL/kg). IAH (15 mmHg) was induced and rats randomly assigned to <b>PEEP</b> of 5 (<b>PEEP</b> 5), 7 (<b>PEEP</b> 7) or 10 (<b>PEEP</b> 10) cmH 2 O for 1 hour. RESULTS: In both ALIp and ALIexp, higher <b>PEEP</b> levels improved oxygenation. <b>PEEP</b> 10 increased alveolar hyperinflation and epithelial cell damage compared to <b>PEEP</b> 5, independent of ALI etiology. In ALIp, <b>PEEP</b> 7 and <b>PEEP</b> 10 increased lung elastance compared to <b>PEEP</b> 5 (4. 3 +/- 0. 7 and 4. 3 +/- 0. 9 versus 3. 1 +/- 0. 3 cmH 2 O/mL, respectively, P < 0. 01), without changes in alveolar collapse, interleukin- 6, caspase- 3, type III procollagen, receptor for advanced glycation end-products, and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 expressions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine, in a healthy lung model of OLV, whether the increase in <b>PEEP</b> improved oxygenation and whether the mechanisms involved include both inspiratory lung recruitment and an end-expiratory lung volume increase. Since inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may have a synergistic effect on oxygenation in the case of PEEP-induced recruitment, their association was also tested. Methods. Twenty pigs were studied during open-chest, left OLV. Arterial blood gases and haemodynamic variables were measured at different levels of <b>PEEP</b> (0, 5, 10 and 15 cm H 2 O) applied in random order with or without iNO 4 p. p. m.

40|$|Positive end-expiratory {{pressure}} (<b>PEEP)</b> may impair extrapulmonary organ function. However, {{the effects}} of <b>PEEP</b> on the liver are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that at a constant cardiac output (CO), <b>PEEP</b> does not induce changes in hepatic blood flow (Q̇L) and parenchymal performance. In splenectomized, close-chested canine preparations (group I, n = 6), Q̇L was derived as hepatic outflow using electromagnetic flow probes (Q̇Lemf), and hepatic performance was defined by extraction and clearance of indocyanine green (ICG). In a noninvasive model (group II, n = 7), {{the effects of}} <b>PEEP</b> on hepatic performance alone were similarly analyzed. Measurements were taken 1) during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV 1), 2) after addition of 10 cmH 2 O <b>PEEP</b> to IPPV (<b>PEEP</b> 1), 3) during continued <b>PEEP</b> but after return of CO to IPPV 1 levels by intravascular volume infusions (<b>PEEP</b> 2), and 4) after removal of both <b>PEEP</b> and excess blood volume (IPPV 2).

30|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>PEEP</b> is more complex. <b>PEEP</b> provides increased continuous tension to the extracellular matrix which accumulates energy equal to (<b>PEEP</b> × <b>PEEP</b> volume)/ 2. Further energy is added when tidal volume (dynamic cyclic energy) is superimposed on the <b>PEEP</b> {{to reach a}} given end-inspiratory volume. Therefore, if the end-inspiratory volume is the same, with or without <b>PEEP,</b> the energy is lower {{in the presence of}} <b>PEEP</b> than without it (Fig. 3), as in our group of “Within” animals. In contrast, if the same tidal volume is provided with or without <b>PEEP,</b> the energy with <b>PEEP</b> will be higher and potentially harmful, as presumably occurred in our “Above” group (Table  4). Therefore, considering the energy associated with a given ventilatory mode, {{it is clear that the}} independent variable for VILI is dynamic strain (tidal volume), while <b>PEEP</b> is “protective” as far as it is associated with a lower tidal volume, as in the “Within” group.

" Conversely, {{adverse effects of}} <b>PEEP</b> application could occur in patients with auto-PEEP when the total <b>PEEP</b> rises as a consequence. From a pathophysiological perspective, all subjects with flow limitation {{are expected to be}} "complete PEEP-absorbers," whereas <b>PEEP</b> should increase total <b>PEEP</b> in all other patients. This study aimed to empirically assess the extent to which flow limitation alone explains a "complete PEEP-absorber" behavior (i. e., absence of further hyperinflation with <b>PEEP),</b> and to identify other factors associated with it. Methods: One hundred patients with auto-PEEP of at least 5 cmH(2) O at zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) during controlled mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Total <b>PEEP</b> (i. e., end-expiratory plateau pressure) was measured both at ZEEP and after applied <b>PEEP</b> equal to 80...|$|R
