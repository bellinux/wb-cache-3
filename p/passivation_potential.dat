40|$|The {{influence}} {{of water on}} the corrosion and passivation of type 304 stainless steel has been studied in deaerated ethanolic solutions containing hydrogen chloride. The potentiostatic polarisation curves show that both, critical current density for passivation and <b>passivation</b> <b>potential,</b> strongly depend on the water content of the solution. A passivation model based on the assumption of a reversible primary <b>passivation</b> <b>potential</b> explains this {{influence of}} water and allows the determination of other kinetic parameters.

40|$|Steady state {{polarization}} {{curves and}} electrode impedances were measured during the active/passive transition of type {{304 stainless steel}} in dearated ethanolic solution containing hydrogen chloride and different amounts of water. The <b>passivation</b> <b>potential</b> and the critical current density for passivation strongly depend on the water content of the solution. The impedance measurements in the active/passive transition show the same sequence of diagrams independent of the water content of the solution. They indicate the onset of passivation before the maximum current density and show two time constants related to two different passivating species on the alloy surface. The experimental results were interpreted {{on the basis of}} a reaction model with parallel dissolution and passivation mechanism of the iron and the chromium compound of the alloy. The resulting total surface composition (related to the steady-state polarization curves) can be described with a reaction model of iron–the alloy behaviour is that of pure metal. The fundamental passivation reaction is described as a potential dependent equilibrium between adsorbed Me(II) - and passivating Me(III) -hydroxide, water molecules being directly involved in the formation of this primary passivating film. In the case of stainless steel this primary passivating film mainly consists of chromium (III) adsorbates. Finally, a general model for the passivation is proposed: The passivation of a pure metal or of an alloy can be understood as the coupling of the stepwise deprotonation of the water molecules at the interface metal/solution and the formation of a high cation charge density in this adsorbed hydroxide/oxide film to build up the passive layer.

Under anodic polarization the stainless steels in sulphuric acid solution acquired a passive state, with breakdown at the transpassive region (pitting potential), however this was greatly reduced with the addition of sodium chloride which led to a sharp increase in current at potentials significantly lower than the value that necessitates pitting in the acid media due to rapid breakdown of the passive film and development of local pits.

It was shown that the electrochemical anodic dissolution follows a common Tafel line with a slope of ca. 120 mV dec- 1, independent of the solution pH and the hydrodynamics, while the <b>passivation</b> <b>potentials</b> and <b>passivation</b> currents were independent on hydrodynamics but strongly dependent on the pH. In parallel with the electrochemical dissolution, a considerable “anomalous ” or chemical Cr dissolution process occurs, {{as evidenced by the}} spectrophotometric analyses of the electrolytes for Cr ions after prolonged potentiostating of the electrodes at different potentials, as well as by measuring the electrode weight losses. All these results indicate the existence of a potential independent reaction of Cr dissolution occurring in parallel to the anodic dissolution process.

This is despite the fact that the use of coatings provides a relatively economic method of reducing erosion-corrosion damage in such environments. There has also, as a consequence, been no attempt to define a rationale for coating selection for exposure to various erosion-corrosion environments. The object of this work has been to address the above issues by investigating the effect of increasing velocity on a range of physical vapour deposition (PVD) coated and uncoated steels, at various applied potentials, in a carbonate/bicarbonate slurry solution containing alumina particles. The performance of two coatings, Ti 2 N and CrN was evaluated. The results were compared to those for the uncoated steel (mild steel) and 304 stainless steel, The results showed that the both the corrosion and <b>passivation</b> <b>potentials</b> for the coatings occurred at different values for the individual coatings. Hence, the erosion-corrosion "regime" maps differed for the different coating systems.

30|$|Although black silicon is used widely as an {{antireflection coating}} in solar cells, the {{corresponding}} electrical properties are usually poor because the accompanied enlarged surface area {{can result in}} increased recombination. Moreover, the high aspect ratio of fragile nanostructured black silicon makes conformal passivation even more challenging. Micropillars are promising alternative candidates for efficiently collecting carriers because the diffusion distance for minority carriers to reach the p–n junction can be shortened; however, the pillar diameter is usually larger than the wavelength of light, inherently increasing the surface reflection.

To {{investigate the}} influence of the deposition conditions on the passivation quality, lifetime measurements on symmetrical samples using the QSSPC technique were performed. The symmetrical lifetime samples were fired to simulate the ‘fire through ’ process used in a standard screen printed solar cell process. Maximum effective lifetime measured on n-type substrate was 3. 7 ms at CH 4 /SiH 4 = 1. Firing of the samples led to a drop in effective lifetimes of about one decade. Maximum effective lifetime after firing was 148 µs at CH 4 /SiH 4 = 6. To avoid losses in passivation quality caused by the firing step, a buried contact solar cell process was chosen. As cell metallization is done via electroless plating in this process, no firing step is necessary. Rear contacts were realized by laser fired contacts.

The improvement of passivity was achieved by the dominant superficial Ni 3 (PO 4) 2 layer. Alloying additions Mo and Ti revealed a characteristic increase of passive current densities due to instability of these passivation components at 130 °C. Passivation based on Fe oxides and phosphates in stainless steels shows to be beneficial at RT, but less efficient at 130 °C...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS), {{a powerful}} method for investigating composition and thickness of thin {{films in the}} nanometer range, {{has been used to}} characterize the surface of two stainless steels with different bulk composition, DIN 1. 4301 (18 %Cr 8 %Ni) and DIN 1. 4529 (20 %Cr 25 %Ni 6 %Mo) after mechanical polishing and after potentiostatic passivation {{in a wide range of}} potentials in sulfate solutions at different pHs. The XPS results confirm that the passive film thickness increases with applied potential, its composition is enriched in chromium oxy-hydroxide after immersion in acidic solutions and polarization at low potentials whereas oxidized nickel is depleted. Special emphasis is given in this paper to the composition of the metal phase underneath the passive film. It is shown that the composition of the interface is strongly enriched in nickel for both stainless steels being 28 ?+/-? 2 ?wt% Ni versus a value of 8 % in the bulk and 45 ?+/-? 2 ?wt% versus 25 ?wt%Ni in the bulk, respectively. The composition of the interface for a given alloy remains unchanged in a wide range of conditions of passive film formation such as pH, applied <b>potential,</b> <b>passivation</b> time. These results are discussed with respect to the influence of the interface composition on the corrosion rate of alloys in the passive state and on their pitting resistance...|$|R
