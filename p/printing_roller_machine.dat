40|$|In 2008, a {{prototype}} machine demonstrating {{the application of}} roll-to-roll technology in micro-contact printing was developed. In this research, the prototype machine was upgraded by designing and machining a device that could fabricate a flat stamp with significantly less variance. The print roll wrapping system was reconfigured in order to capture the stamp with uniform force and good alignment. The motion control for the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> and impression roller was also improved. In addition multi-layer printing with the updated machine was tested. This thesis focuses on the general design of the updated system and the measurement of key components of the systems {{as well as the}} print quality. Results demonstrate that the flat stamp can achieve the flatness of ± 16 [micro]m with thickness of 1194 [micro]m; that the wrapping process can guarantee a <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> roundness error in the 20 [micro]m range; that the distortion of the print using the updated system is approximately 3. 8. The multi-layer printing test did not achieve acceptable results owing to a lack of proper control of the machine. However, initial trials, achieved alignment errors of 1017 [micro]m along the printing direction and 113 [micro]m across the printing direction. by Wenzhuo Yang. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} {{is based}} on the use of elastomeric stamps to transfer ink onto a substrate taking advantage of the self-assembly process. Features as small as 300 nm can be easily printed over an extended area. The accuracy and the speed of the process make it suitable for many industrial applications in areas such as the manufacture of flexible displays and electronics. In 2008, a group of MIT mechanical engineering students built a prototype machine that demonstrated the advantages of the roll-to-roll paradigm in terms of high throughput, convenient material handling and conformal contact propagation. The prototype machine, although characterized by defects such as air trapping at very high speed, was able to print at speeds as high as 400 fpm with contact times of 7 ms, over an 8 "x 8 " substrate area. This year, an improved quality printing output and multilayer printing process were set as goals. To achieve the objectives, a device that could cast a flat stamp with little variance was designed and machined. (cont.) A high precision wrapping system was designed and fabricated. Finally, a high-precision positioning system was introduced to compensate for misalignment in the multi-layer printing process. This thesis describes the design of a five-axis high-precision positioning system to control the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> along five degrees of freedom. Using flexures and micrometer heads as principal position control devices, the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> can be positioned and oriented with high repeatability, 2. 5 lim accuracy, 2. 5 pm resolution, and the calibration showed that, in the worst case, the coupling among axes is limited to the 8 %. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that the new stamp casting method can accomplish ± 16 p. m flatness with thickness of 1194 pm and that the innovative wrapping process ensures alignment of the backing plate with respect to the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> with less than ± 75 V 1 m absolute misalignment. Consequently, using the upgraded roll-to-roll machine and the newly developed wrapping and stamp fabrication processes, deformation of the printed output is limited to an average of 3. 8 %. Finally, the multi-layer printing process was tested and a ± 75 V 1 m misalignment was achieved between two layers. by Paolo Baldesi. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The paper analyzes the formation reason of folding ripple and the different characteristics between ELS and MLS. The research result shows that also there are many advantages in using ELS the synchronous capability is less than MLS when a periodic disturbance act on them under the same transmission stiffness. Therefore it is proposed that the AC motors must connect directly to the main <b>printing</b> <b>roller</b> to decrease the periodic disturbance and to increase the stiffness during the shaftless reform of printing machine...|$|R
