5000|$|Symmetric <b>Phase</b> <b>Recording</b> is a tape {{recording}} (Computer storage media) technology developed by Quantum Corporation packs data across a tape's recording surface by writing adjacent tracks in a herringbone pattern: [...] track 0 = \\\\\, track 1 = /////, track 2 = \\\\\, track 3 = /////, etc. This eliminates crosstrack interference and guard bands {{so that more}} tracks of data can be stored on a tape.|$|E
50|$|Later {{helically}} scanning recorders instead usually use {{a method}} called slant-azimuth recording, also called symmetric <b>phase</b> <b>recording.</b> The head drum usually contains two heads with the magnetic gap of one head slanted slightly leftwards and the magnetic gap {{of the other}} head slanted slightly rightwards. (The slant of a magnetic head {{is referred to as}} its azimuth adjustment). Because of the alternating slants, each head will not wrongly read the signal recorded by the other head and the stripes can be recorded immediately next to each other, alternating between left slant on one television field and right slant on the next television field. (In practice, it's not uncommon for the recorded stripes to overlap somewhat). Later machines including the JVC VHS and the Sony Betamax use slant-azimuth recording as well as all later machines and their digital derivatives.|$|E

50|$|The {{band was}} formed {{in the fall of}} 2000 when bassist Chris Miskis brought drummer Jeff Kopanic {{together}} with guitarists Andrew Grossmann and Rob Spagiare. Kopanic had never met either guitarist before the band’s first practice at the Mr. Roboto Project. Within a few months, the band had finished recording seven songs at +/- Studio in Pittsburgh with Andy Wright. One of those songs, “The Effects that Try,” appeared as the first track on Me Against the World: The Emo Diaries Chapter 7. The other six were released by One Day Savior Recordings as a self-titled EP. Miskis left the band in 2001 and was replaced by Keith Smallwood. Smallwood left before recording with the band and was replaced by Justin Campbell, who played on The Role of Smith, which was produced by J. Robbins and released by A-F Records in 2003. The album was recorded in just seven days at <b>Phase</b> <b>Recording</b> Studios in College Park, MD. Kopanic left the band in 2004 and was replaced by Brian Garbark, who left the band less than a year later. Dennis Kern played drums for the band's last few shows. Spagiare and Grossmann now play in Knot Feeder.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to {{the lengthy}} two years writing and {{recording}} sessions for Ones and Zeros, which was extended due heavy touring and changing of record producers mid-way of the sessions, the sessions for Echoes were far quicker. The {{bulk of the}} album was written {{over the course of}} an eight-week period spanning from November 2015 to January 2016. The banded started fresh with the material, choosing not to go back to any material written for Ones and Zeros or any other prior albums. Jolliffe's absence did not affect sessions much, as he hadn't previously had much of a role in the writing process. Frontman Gustav Wood and guitarists John and Fraser Taylor were the principle writers, would usually write Jolliffe's drum parts for him in the process. The writing sessions largely operated as they had in the past, with the exception of not having a drummer to do jam sessions to test out ideas in the writing <b>phase.</b> <b>Recording</b> began in February 2016 and ran for a five-week period. The band worked with rock music producer David Bendeth and recorded in the House of Loud studio in New Jersey. The band allowed Kamrada the freedom to record his drum parts as he felt best fit the music, something the band felt helped create a new dynamic between the band in general. While the band expected to be done after the five weeks of recording, upon taking a short vacation, Wood and John Taylor felt inspired to keep going, writing around five new songs. Upon presenting them {{to the rest of the}} band, they were generally impressed, choosing to flesh out and record three of the tracks for the album's final track listing. Recording sessions for the album were completed in May 2016.|$|E

40|$|The UC diagram {{technique}} {{described in}} the companion paper (Part 1), is applied to nine sets of Lg <b>phases</b> <b>recorded</b> through the CEDAR system in southern California, and two sets of Lg <b>phases</b> <b>recorded</b> along the northwestern margin of the Sierra Nevada. A clear image of the signal is obtained in time-frequency-wavenumber space, and we discuss in particular observations at 2. 5 -sec period, for events 200 to 300 km outside the profiles. From the gross features of UC diagrams we conclude that a representation of Lg as a single coherent multi-mode wave train is oversimplified {{in the case of}} southern California but is more appropriate for the Sierra block. In southern California, peaks observed at group velocities smaller than 3. 2 km/sec are not predicted by realistic crustal models of the area, and are probably due to lateral heterogeneities effects such as mode conversion and multipathing. On the other hand, for group velocities between 3. 2 and 3. 6 km/sec, peaks observed in either area can generally be interpreted in terms of overtones excited at the source and propagating through spatially averaged structures, although care must be taken to monitor the stability of the algorithm on actual short-period records...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} phase, {{introduced}} {{on the study}} of the Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs), presents slight understanding difficulties by the students. The phase DOEs are obtained by variations of the thickness or the refractive index of the recording medium, as opposition to the amplitude DOEs, which are obtained by the modulation of the absorption of the recording medium. It is presented some experiences to introduce the phase concept by means of thickness and refractive index variation, using photopolymers as the <b>phase</b> <b>recording</b> media. The photopolymers are non-expensive material, easy to fabricate and they present good optical quality. As photopolymers are a <b>phase</b> <b>recording</b> material, when they are illuminated with light of the wavelength at which they are sensitive, the refractive index and/or the thickness of the illuminated areas change. The experiments consist in a zero-spatial frequency limit analysis, based on a reflection and transmission interferometer, and the recording of low spatial frequency DOEs. With the first experiments, it is possible to observe the phase shift between the exposed and non-exposed areas. This phase shift, observable by a CCD camera in the form of moving fringes, permits the measurement of the thickness and refractive index variations of the material. The second experiment consists in the recording of different types of DOEs, such as sinusoidal gratings, binary gratings or blazed gratings, generated using a Spatial Light modulator (SLM) to modulate the recording beam. This experiment, apart from the study of the changes produced by the variations of the thickness and the refractive index, is very useful to analyse and compare the diffraction efficiencies (DEs) of different types of grating. The experiences proposed are suitable for the students of different subjects such as "Optical fundamental for Engineering", basic subject included in the second course for obtaining a Telecommunication Degree, for "Photonics and Optoelectronic devices" mandatory subject taught during the second year of Telecommunication master or the optative subject “Acquisition and Optical Treatment of Images” from the Master in robotics-automatic all taught at the University of Alicante. In all cases, the experiences are not only very useful to introduce the concepts to study, but also are useful also to introduce the students into the work of a research laboratory and some of the equipment and procedures that are used on it.

40|$|Mapping the {{horizontal}} distribution of permeability {{is a key}} problem for the coal seam gas industry. Poststack seismic data with anisotropy attributes provide estimates for fracture density and orientation which are then interpreted in terms of permeability. This approach delivers an indirect measure of permeability and can fail if other sources of anisotropy (for instance stress) come into play. Seismo-electric methods, based on recording the electric signal from pore fluid movements stimulated through a seismic wave, measure permeability directly. In this paper we use numerical simulations {{to demonstrate that the}} seismo-electric method is potentially suitable to map {{the horizontal}} distribution of permeability changes across coal seams. We propose the use of an amplitude to offset (AVO) analysis of the electrical signal in combination with poststack seismic data collected during the exploration <b>phase.</b> <b>Recording</b> of electrical signals from a simple seismic source can be closer to production planning and operations.

Additionally, we show experimentally that it is possible to holographically store more than 400 waves at the same time (in a coherent fashion) using the same storage geometry, with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 20 and an average diffraction efficiency of 15 %.

40|$|Regional 2 D {{multichannel}} seismic, borehole, dredge and outcrop data, {{together with}} burial models for strata in southwest Iberia, {{are used to}} investigate the tectono-stratigraphic signature of multiphased rifting on divergent margins. Our burial model for southwest Iberia reveals that Mesozoic extension occurred during three main phases, each comprising distinct subsidence pulses separated by short-lived periods of crustal uplift. The importance of these phases varies across discrete sectors of the margin, each one revealing similar depositional architectures and associated tectonic systems tracts: 1) the Rift Initiation phase, characterized by incipient subsidence and overall aggradation/progradation over a basal unconformity, 2) the Rift Climax phase, which marks maxima of tectonic subsidence, is characterized by retrogradation-progradation and 3) the Late Rift <b>phase,</b> <b>recording</b> the progradational infill of the basin, often showing the effects of eustasy. The Rift Initiation systems tracts comprise Sinemurian and late Callovian-early Oxfordian strata. Marine units in the Pliensbachian and Late Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian represent the Rift Climax phases, a period marked {{by the development of}} Maximum Flooding Surfaces. Late Rift deposits were identified in the Rhaetian-Hettangian, Toarcian-Bathonian and Kimmeridgian-Berriasian. The results of this work are important to the economic exploration of deep-offshore rift basins, as they reveal that sequence stratigraphy can be used to predict sedimentary facies distribution in more distal deep-offshore basins. Significantly, this work recognizes that multiple tectonic-stratigraphic cycles can occur in deep-offshore rift basins from the onset of rift-related extension until continental break-up, a character that contrast to what is known from deep-sea drilling data from the distal margin of Northwest Iberia...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{transitions}} give crucial {{insight into}} many-body systems, as crossovers between different regimes of order {{are determined by}} the underlying dynamics. These dynamics, in turn, are often constrained by dimensionality and geometry. For example, in one- and two-dimensional systems with continuous symmetry, thermal fluctuations prevent the formation of long-range order[1, 2]. Two-dimensional systems are particularly significant, as vortices can form in the plane but cannot tilt out of it. At high temperatures, random motion of these vortices destroys large-scale coherence. At low temperatures, vortices with opposite spin can pair together, cancelling their circulation and allowing quasi-long-range order to appear. This Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition[3, 4] is essentially classical, arising for example in the traditional XY model for spins, but to date experimental evidence has been obtained only in cold quantum systems. Measurements of superfluid sound speed[5] and critical velocity[6] have been consistent with scaling predictions, and vortices have been observed directly in cold atom experiments[7, 8]. However, the presence of trapping potentials restricts measurement to vortex density, rather than number, and obscures the process of vortex unbinding. Further, atom and fluid experiments suffer from parasitic heating and difficulties in <b>phase</b> <b>recording,</b> leading to results that differ from theory in many quantitative aspects. Here, we use a nonlinear optical system to directly observe the ideal BKT transition, including vortex pair dynamics and the correlation properties of the wavefunction, for both repulsive and attractiveinteractions (the photonic equivalent of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic conditions[9]). The results confirm the thermodynamics of the BKT transition and expose outstanding issues in the crossovers to superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a prosecutor’s {{development of new}} and bizarre theories, particularly in cases involving confession evidence, to explain away exculpatory DNA results. In Juan Rivera’s case, the prosecutor’s theory for why sperm found inside the 11 -year-old victim {{on the day she}} was murdered did not belong to Rivera was that she had sex with someone before Rivera came along and raped (but did not ejaculate) and murdered her. The unnamed-lover theory is used so often by prosecutors that it has a moniker: “the unindicted co-ejaculator. ” In the case of the Dixmoor Five, teenagers convicted of the rape and murder of a 14 -year-old girl were exonerated after DNA from semen found on the victim’s body was linked to a man with a lengthy record of sexual assault and armed robbery. However, the state’s attorney accepted the possibility that the convicted rapist wandered past an open field and had sex with the deceased 14 -year-old victim as a means of validating the teenagers’ confessions. The article explores strategies to prevent cases like Rivera’s, that are based on a prosecutor’s logic-defying theory of guilt, from moving forward. Although prosecutors enjoy largely unfettered discretion, they must account for their actions at different stages of the criminal proceedings before bringing cases to trial. During the investigation <b>phase,</b> <b>recording</b> interrogations provides a measure of prosecutorial accountability. During the charging phase, acknowledging confirmation bias will guard against decisions to proceed in the face of contradictory exculpatory evidence. Potential judicial solutions, such as the doctrines of judicial estoppel and judicial admission and the proposed reform of criminal summary judgment, are advanced as additional means of preventing a case based upon a logicdefying theory of guilt from proceeding to trial. This article examines the question of prosecutorial accountability through the lens of Juan Rivera’s case. Rivera spent almost twenty years in prison and underwent three trials before a court vacated his conviction, holding that the prosecutor’s theory of guilt, in the face of exculpatory DNA results, was “unreasonable” and “improbable. ...|$|E
