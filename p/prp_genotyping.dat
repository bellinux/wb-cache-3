40|$|The first {{results of}} the Hungarian sheep prion protein (<b>PrP)</b> <b>genotyping</b> {{programme}} are discussed in this paper. To obtain initial genotype frequency data 10 commercial (Hungarian Merino, German Mutton Merino, Merino Landschaf, German Blackheaded, Suffolk, Texel, Ile de France, Charollais, Lacaune, British Milksheep) and 4 indigenous (Gyimes Racka, Hortobágy Racka, Tsigaja, Cikta) breeds were sampled in 2003 and 2004, and the PrP genotypes were determined by microsequencing analysis with capillary electrophoresis. In all commercial breeds, a higher number of sheep were genotyped in 2005 (3648) and in 2006 (3834) within the breeding programme to increase scrapie resistance, and the estimated frequency data were compared to the initial figures to evaluate the efficiency of selection.

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} the biology of scrapie in sheep is irretrievably {{associated}} with the genetics of the PrP gene in sheep. Control of susceptibility and resistance is so closely linked to certain alleles of the sheep PrP gene that no review on scrapie can avoid PrP genetics. Before the importance of PrP protein was discovered and before {{the influence of the}} gene itself on disease incidence was understood, it was clear there were some sheep which were more susceptible to natural scrapie than others and that this feature was heritable. These early observations have led to the development and use of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotyping</b> in sheep in what is probably the biggest genetic selection process ever attempted. The accompanying increase in surveillance has also discovered a novel type of scrapie, the subject of much speculation about its origin...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{accuracy}} of genotype diagnosis after pre-amplification of DNA extracted from biopsies obtained by microblade cutting of ovine embryos and to evaluate the viability of biopsied embryos after vitrification/warming and transfer to recipients. Sex and PrP genotypes were determined. Sex diagnosis was done by PCR amplification of ZFX/ZFY and SRY sequences after PEP-PCR while PrP genotype determination was performed after specific pre-amplification of specific target including codons 136, 154 and 171. Embryos were collected at Day 7 after oestrus. Blastocysts and expanded blastocysts were biopsied immediately after collection whereas compacted morulae were biopsied after 24 hr of in vitro culture. Eighty-nine biopsied embryos were frozen by vitrification. Fresh and vitrified whole embryos were kept as control. DNA of biopsies was extracted and pre-amplified. Sex diagnosis was efficient for 96. 6 % of biopsies and <b>PrP</b> <b>genotyping</b> was determined in 95. 8 % of codons. After embryo transfer, no significant difference was observed in lambing rate between biopsied, vitrified control and fresh embryos (54. 5 %, 60 % and 66. 6 %, respectively). Embryo survival rate was not different between biopsied and whole vitrified embryos (P = 0. 38). At birth, 96. 7 % of diagnosed sex and 95. 4 % of predetermined codons were correct. Lamb PrP profiles were in agreement with parental genotype. PEP-PCR coupled with sex diagnosis and nested PCR coupled with PrP genotype predetermination are very accurate techniques to genotype ovine embryo before transfer.

40|$|The {{relation}} between prion protein (<b>PrP)</b> <b>genotype</b> class and litter size was analysed in Polish Merino, Black-headed, Ile de France and Berrichon du Cher sheep in Poland. Litter size was analysed with the classification tree technique and multiple logistic regression for effects of breed, age of ewe, <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype,</b> litter size of ewe at her birth, and at her rearing and year of ewe's birth. The resulting classification tree was 6 -level deep and contained 21 leaves. Age, breed and {{year of birth}} were more important determinants of litter size than <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype.</b> Importance of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> in the tree development was 0. 560 relative to age of ewe. While the logistic regression analysis showed that the overall effect of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> {{on the number of}} born lambs was not significant, the classification trees technique demonstrated that the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> differentiated ewes within some breeds and ages in terms of the litter size. Black-headed ewes homozygous for ARR gave birth to twins less often compared to heterozygous or non ARR ewes. However, in Polish Merino and Berrichon du Cher ewes aged 2 - 4 years and born after 2001, litter size was larger for homozygous ARR ewes. Consequently, a direct effect of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> itself on litter size is unlikely, since the direction of the effect differed between sheep breeds. The classification trees technique proved to be effective in detailing effects of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> on litter size and may be used as an additional approach in exploring data...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{classical}} scrapie in sheep {{is associated with}} polymorphisms in the prion protein (PrP) gene. In recent years, large-scale selective breeding programmes for sheep at lower risk of disease have been undertaken across the European Union.

40|$|Abstract In this study, the {{potential}} association of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> with health and productive traits was investigated. Data were recorded on animals of the INRA 401 breed from the Bourges-La Sapinière INRA experimental farm. The population consisted of 30 rams and 852 ewes, which produced 1310 lambs. The animals were categorized into three <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> classes: ARR homozygous, ARR heterozygous, and animals without any ARR allele. Two analyses differing {{in the approach}} considered were carried out. Firstly, {{the potential}} association of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> with disease (Salmonella resistance) and production (wool and carcass) traits was studied. The data used included 1042, 1043 and 1013 genotyped animals for the Salmonella resistance, wool and carcass traits, respectively. The different traits were analyzed using an animal model, where the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> effect was included as a fixed effect. Association analyses do not indicate any evidence of an effect of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> on traits studied in this breed. Secondly, a quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection approach using the PRNP gene as a marker was applied on ovine chromosome 13. Interval mapping was used. Evidence for one QTL affecting mean fiber diameter was found at 25 cM from the PRNP gene. However, a linkage between PRNP and this QTL does not imply unfavorable linkage disequilibrium for PRNP selection purposes. </p...|$|R

This paper presents the largest study to date on commercially-run sheep flocks naturally-infected with classical scrapie, involving 30 study flocks, more than 400 scrapie cases and over 8500 <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes.</b> We show that some of the observed variation in epidemiological characteristics between farms is related to differences in their <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> profile; although much remains unexplained and may instead be attributed to the stochastic nature of scrapie dynamics...|$|R

Iterative allelic peeling with incomplete penetrace model as implemented in the GenoProb program was used to infer genotype probabilities. There were only some additional identifications of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> and NSP (national scrapie plan) type with high probability. The main reasons for a low number of additional identifications {{can be attributed to}} the large number of alleles with moderate frequencies, incomplete penetrace model, uniform prior, and inherent pedigree and genotype data structure. In order to overcome the limits of additional genotype identifications novel statistics were derived (maximal NSP type, average NSP value its variance and reliability) to facilitate practical implementation of seection for csrapie resistance based on NSP types. Maximal NSP type can be used to infer maximal potential scrapie susceptibility of individual animals as well as for the entire flocks. the average NSP value encompasses all information contained in <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> probabilities and its the most useful dtatistic for the selection on NSP type and tehrefore <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype.</b> These novel statistics can be used as a criterion for the selection against scrapie susceptibility fot the whole population taking into the account possible errors in genotype and/or pedigree data...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prion protein (PrP) alleles {{associated}} with scrapie susceptibility persist in many sheep populations even with high frequencies despite centuries of selection against them. This suggests that scrapie susceptibility alleles have a pleiotropic effect or are {{associated with}} fitness or other traits that {{have been subject to}} selection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We genotyped all lambs in two scrapie-free Scottish Blackface sheep flocks for polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 of the PrP gene. We tested potential associations of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> with lamb viability at birth and postnatal survival using a complementary log-log link function and a Weibull proportional hazard model, respectively. Here we show there is an association between <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype,</b> as defined by polymorphisms at codons 154 ad 171, and postnatal lamb survival in the absence of scrapie. Sheep carrying the wild-type ARQ allele have higher postnatal survival rates than sheep carrying the more scrapie-resistant alleles (ARR or AHQ). CONCLUSION: The <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> associated with higher susceptibility to scrapie {{are associated with}} improved postnatal survival {{in the absence of the}} disease.

40|$|International audienceClassical scrapie {{has proved}} to be a {{notoriously}} difficult disease to control due to a poor understanding of its natural history. The recognition of disease risk linkage to <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> has offered the prospect of a disease control strategy, viz. genotyping and selective breeding, novel to veterinary medicine when first considered in the 1990 s. The UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee recommended the exploitation of this approach in a voluntary, national programme to control classical scrapie and protect the public against food-borne exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, should the national flock have been exposed via contaminated feed. The National Scrapie Plan for Great Britain was launched in 2001 and uptake has been widespread throughout the purebreeding sector of the sheep industry, with membership peaking at over 12   000 flocks in 2006. A total of 700   000 rams from 90 breeds have been genotyped. A comparison of ram lambs born in 2002 with those in 2006 shows evident changes in <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> frequencies which are predicted to be associated with a reduction in disease risk. Various concerns have been raised regarding possible unintended consequences of widespread selection on <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype,</b> including impacts on other performance traits and possible effects on inbreeding and genetic diversity. To date, these concerns appear to be unfounded, as no consistent associations have been found with performance traits, nor are there likely to be any detectable impacts on inbreeding in mainstream breeds.

40|$|AIMS: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} cases of scrapie that would occur in sheep of different prion protein (<b>PrP)</b> <b>genotypes</b> if scrapie was to become established in New Zealand, and to compare the performance of two commercially available, rapid ELISA kits using ovine retro-pharyngeal lymph nodes (RLN) from non-infected and infected sheep of different <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes.</b> METHODS: Using published data on the distribution of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> within the New Zealand sheep flock and the prevalence of cases of scrapie in these genotypes in the United Kingdom, the annual expected number of cases of scrapie per genotype was estimated, should scrapie become established in New Zealand, assuming a total population of 28 million sheep. A non-infected panel of RLN was collected from 737 sheep from New Zealand that had been culled, found in extremis or died. Brain stem samples were also collected from 131 of these sheep. A second panel of infected samples comprised 218 and 117 RLN from confirmed scrapie cases that had originated in Europe and the United States of America, respectively. All samples were screened using two commercial, rapid, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ELISA kits: Bio-Rad TeSeE ELISA (ELISA-BR), and IDEXX HerdChek BSE-Scrapie AG Test (ELISA-ID). RESULTS: If scrapie became established in New Zealand, an estimated 596 cases would occur per year; of these 234 (39 %) and 271 (46 %) would be in sheep carrying ARQ/ARQ and ARQ/VRQ <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes,</b> respectively. For the non-infected samples from New Zealand the diagnostic specificity of both ELISA kits was 100 %. When considering all infected samples, the diagnostic sensitivity was 70. 4 (95 % CI= 65. 3 - 75. 3) % for ELISA-BR and 91. 6 (95 % CI= 88. 2 - 94. 4) % for ELISA-ID. For the ARQ/ARQ genotype (n= 195), sensitivity was 66. 2 % for ELISA-BR and 90. 8 % for ELISA-ID, and for the ARQ/VRQ genotype (n= 107), sensitivity was 81. 3 % for ELISA-BR and 98. 1 % for ELISA-ID.

40|$|Scrapie {{which is}} known in Europe for the past 270 years was first {{diagnosed}} in Cyprus sheep in 1985. In spite of the intensive measures taken by the Veterinary Services of Cyprus to control the disease since 1987, {{the number of the}} scrapie-affected flocks increases every year causing some concern. Results of research abroad have shown that polymorphisms within the PrP gene, mainly located at codons 136, 154 and 171 are closely associated with scrapie susceptibility or resistance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to contribute to the reduction of the incidence of scrapie in Cyprus with the application of a selective breeding programme, which should be based on the determination of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> of the Cyprus sheep. This study is divided into three parts. In the first part the literature on scrapie and the appearance of scrapie in Cyprus is reviewed. In the second part our experimental work which refers to: (a) the investigation of the PrP gene of the sheep of the breeds Chios and Local (breed survey) and (b) the comparison of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> of clinical suspect and histopathologically positive cases with those of “healthy” control-sheep (case-control study) is presented. During our study in order to determine the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction enzyme analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing, were performed. In particular during the breed survey study we investigated the PrP gene of 145 sheep of the Chios breed and 171 of the Local breed. In total twelve different <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> were revealed, nine in each breed. The results of the above study show that the predominant genotype in the sheep of both breeds is AA 136 RR 154 QQ 171. This genotype is regarded very sensitive. The allele K 171 was fairly common in the sheep of Chios breed and the allele H 171 was found only in the sheep of Local breed. In the case-control study the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> of 106 clinical suspect and histopathologicaly positive (scrapie group) sheep and 358 healthy control sheep (control group) was investigated. In total 14 different <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> were determined during this study. In the scrapie group only three <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> were identified and in the control group 14 genotypes. The genotypes at codons 136 and 154 did not vary in the scrapie group. This result indicates that in Cyprus sheep there is strongly association between codon 171 and scrapie susceptibility. In the third part of this study there is a description how the nuclear flock with sheep with resistant genotypes was created. Overall, the data obtained from our studies suggest that the most susceptible genotype in the sheep population of Cyprus is the AA 136 RR 154 QQ 171. The decision of Veterinary Services to adopt a selective breeding programme seems to be the most appropriate choice. However, we do not know whether sheep with the resistant genotype (RR 171) can be carriers of the infectious protein PrPSc, without showing clinical signs of the disease and therefore can serve as a reservoir for infectious agent. To have the answer to the above question a further research is needed. ...|$|R

PrP selection strategies modelled included selection against the VRQ allele and in favour of the ARR allele. Assuming realistic initial PrP frequencies, selection against the VRQ allele had a minimal impact on performance and inbreeding. However, when selection was also in favour of the ARR allele {{and the frequency of}} this allele was relatively low, there was a loss of up to three to four years of genetic gain over the 15 years of selection. Most loss in gain occurred during the first five years. In general, the rate of inbreeding was reduced when applying PrP selection. Since animals were first selected on their <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> before being selected on the performance trait, the intensity of selection on performance was weaker under PrP selection (compared with no PrP selection). Eradication of the VRQ allele or fixation of the ARR allele within 15 years of selection was possible only with PrP selection targeting all breeding animals. </p...|$|R

Whole-mount investigations revealed no significant differences between the densities of total, CALB-IR and nNOS-IR neurons in scrapie-affected versus healthy sheep, irrespective of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype.</b> Our results suggest that EGCs and CALB-IR and nNOS-IR neurons are probably involved in the pathogenesis of natural and oral experimental sheep scrapie. Furthermore, the infectious agent may be less pathogenic towards ENS neurons than it is towards central nervous system neurons. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> on milk traits in the Slovenian autochthonous Bovška sheep breed. The estimated population size is 3 700 animals, half of which are included in the selection programme. Genetic resistance for scrapie, a well known prion disease, is determined by the <b>genotype</b> at the <b>PrP</b> locus. In 2003, the Slovenian National Scrapie Programme following EU Regulations was introduced to control scrapie by selecting out the less resistant genotypes and until 2008, a total of 1 875 ewes were genotyped. This study determined frequencies of PrP alleles in Bovška sheep, AHQ 17. 32 %, ARH 7. 30 %, ARQ 57. 14 %, ARR 17. 12 % and VRQ 1. 12 %, which were very similar to frequencies in other European breeds. The <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> had a significant effect on milk, protein and lactose yield produced in lactation, but the productivity of the most resistant ARR/ARR homozygotes was similar to breed average and did not statistically differ from other genotypes. Heterozygotes AHQ/ARH, AHQ/ARQ and ARH/ARQ exhibited significantly higher productivity compared to respective homozygotes but not from the most resistant ARR/ARR genotype. It is expected therefore that increased frequency of the ARR allele or even its exclusivity will not directly influence the productivity of the breed. However, a careful management programme favouring resistant <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> should be implemented to reduce potential negative effects of productivity due to reduced selection potential or inbreeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{genotype}} of {{the host}} {{plays a crucial role}} in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In this respect, the most important factor is represented by the gene of the prion protein (PrP). The present work summarizes the currently available knowledge on the genetic basis of TSEs focusing, in particular, on sheep scrapie. Interest in this disease has grown markedly following the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, both for scientific and health reasons. In Italy, specific research grants from the Ministry of Health and the National Research Council (CNR), together with cooperation between the Istituto Superiore di Sanità and the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali, have allowed us to study the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> and to investigate the genetic susceptibility to scrapie in the most important Italian sheep breeds, with special reference to Sarda, Comisana and Massese.

Aside {{from the five}} most common alleles (VRQ, ARQ, ARR, AHQ and ARH), the rare ARK allele was also found, with the highest frequency reported so far in an ovine breed (2 · 5 %). ARK/ [...] - genotypes had a total frequency of 4 · 9 %. The resistance-associated ARR allele was seen at a low frequency (8 · 3 %). Only 1 · 4 % of animals examined had a resistant ARR/ARR <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype.</b> Semi-resistant (ARR/ARQ, ARR/ARH and ARR/AHQ) <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> had a total frequency of 12 · 6 % and <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> {{that are associated with}} high scrapie susceptibility (e. g.

Statistical analysis comparing PrP allele frequencies between pure-bred and cross-bred animals showed that the ARR allele occurred at a significantly lower frequency in pure-bred rams. Furthermore, comparison of PrP allele frequencies between pure-bred rams over 18 months of age and those below 18 months of age showed a significant decrease in the ARR allele in breeding rams over 18 months of age. Based on these results, breeding for scrapie resistance in the Biellese breed will {{have to take into account}} the low frequency of the ARR allele, which also seems to be subject to negative selection by farmers.

40|$|Existing {{mathematical}} {{models for}} scrapie dynamics in sheep populations {{assume that the}} PrP gene is only associated with scrapie susceptibility and with no other fitness related traits. This assumption contrasts recent findings of PrP gene associations with post-natal lamb survival in scrapie free Scottish Blackface populations. Lambs with scrapie resistant genotypes {{were found to have}} significantly lower survival rates than those with susceptible genotypes. The present study aimed to investigate how these conflicting PrP gene associations may affect the dynamic patterns of PrP haplotype frequencies and disease prevalence. A deterministic mathematical model was developed to explore how the associations between <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> and both scrapie susceptibility and postnatal lamb mortality affect the prevalence of scrapie and the associated change in PrP gene frequencies in a closed flock of sheep. The model incorporates empirical evidence on epidemiological and biological characteristics of scrapie and on mortality rates induced by causes other than scrapie. The model results indicate that unfavorable associations of the scrapie resistant PrP haplotypes with post-natal lamb mortality, if sufficiently strong, can increase scrapie prevalence during an epidemic, and result in scrapie persisting in the population. The range of model parameters, for which such effects were observed, is realistic but relatively narrow. The results of the present model suggest that for most parameter combinations an unfavourable association between <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> and post-natal lamb mortality does not greatly alter the dynamics of scrapie and, hence, would not have an adverse impact on a breeding programme. There were, however, a range of scenarios, narrow, but realistic, in which such an unfavourable association resulted in an increased prevalence and in the persistence of infection. Consequently, associations between <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> and fitness traits should be taken into account when designing future models and breeding programmes...|$|R
40|$|Prion protein (PrP) gene polymorphisms and {{breeding}} for resistance to scrapie in Polish Merino sheep Genetic susceptibility or resistance of sheep to scrapie is associated with polymorphisms particularly in the three codons 136, 154 and 171 of the ovine prion protein (PrP) gene. The aim {{of the study was}} to reveal the <b>PrP</b> haplotype and <b>genotype</b> distribution in the Polish Merino breed and to make a forecast of the application of a scrapie resistance breeding programme for this breed. PCR-RFLP analyses were done in order to determine PrP haplotypes based on the polymorphisms in codons 136, 154 and 171. The analysis of 98 Polish Merino sheep revealed dimorphisms only at the two codons 136 (A and V) and 171 (R and Q). 35. 7 % of the individuals harboured the genotype ARQ/ARQ, and 54. 1 % carried the genotype ARR/ARQ. The frequency of the ARR/ARR genotype was low (7. 1 %). A simulation study was done in order to calculate assumed frequencies of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> in the next generations. For the first generation the observed allele frequencies, after excluding ARQ/ARQ rams, were used in the study. For further breeding only ARR/ARR rams were used and <b>PrP</b> <b>genotypes</b> of female progeny were not considered.

40|$|Abstract: The {{frequencies}} of alleles on PrP locus {{and its effect}} on growth of rams were studied in Jezersko solčavska and improved Jezersko solčavska breed. Genetic resistance against scrapie depends on <b>genotype</b> on <b>PrP</b> allele. Animals were housed in quarantine at age of approximately 120 days. They were moved to test station where stated with test at the age of 184 days. The procedure was finished at the age of 257 days. During the test the animals were genotypized on the PrP locus. The frequency of the most susceptible allele VRQ was only 3. 11 % and of the most resistant allele ARR it was 18. 56 %. Daily gains between ages of 120 and 257 days and between 184 and 257 days were not influenced by <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype.</b> The <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> influenced only daily gain between birth and age of 257 days.

40|$|The Dutch scrapie {{eradication}} programme for sheep {{is based on}} selection for the resistant ARR/ARR genotype of the ovine prion protein (PrP) gene. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the possible association of the <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> and performance traits. The data included 963 genotyped females born between 1991 and 1998 in an experimental Texel flock, in which the Booroola gene was introgressed. The associations of the PrP gene were evaluated using a single trait animal model. The allele frequency from the herd mostly corresponds with genotyped rams in the Netherlands in the same period. The results indicate no significant associations with litter size, and only 3 of 112 estimated associations with weight, growth and body measurements were significant, with a low significance level. Therefore it can be concluded that selection for ARR/ARR rams in this experimental herd seem to have no effect on the performance traits due to association. The included data from this study is compared to data from other studies estimating associations between <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> and performance traits. The comparison suggests of a possible small effect, which is only detectable in large datasets, which could be a result of linkage to the PrP genotyp...|$|R

We investigated these factors for a large outbreak of natural scrapie, which yielded sufficient data to detect temporal trends. Results Cases occurred mostly in two genotypes, VRQ/VRQ and VRQ/ARQ, with those early in the outbreak more likely to be of the VRQ/VRQ genotype. As the epidemic progressed, the age-at-onset of disease increased, which reflected changes in the genotypes of cases rather than changes in the age-at-onset within genotypes.

As the epidemic progressed VRQ/VRQ and VRQ/ARQ sheep were more likely to be reported with behavioural changes, while VRQ/VRQ sheep only were less likely to be reported with loss of condition.

40|$|Ovine scrapie is a fatal {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorder that}} may be transmitted through exposure to infected uterine and placental tissues. Susceptibility to scrapie is primarily controlled by polymorphisms in the prion protein (PrP) gene. Scrapie in the U. S. Suffolk breed and in many breeds in Europe occurs in sheep homozygous for glutamine (171 QQ), but rarely in sheep heterozygous for glutamine and arginine (171 QR) or homozygous for arginine (171 RR) at codon 171 of the PrP gene. This study demonstrated that accumulation of PrPSc in uterine-placental epithelial cells in the placentome was determined by fetal <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype</b> and the pregnancy status of scrapie-infected ewes. PrPSc was detected in 171 QQ placentomes of infected ewes, but not in placentomes of infected ewes pregnant with 171 QR conceptuses or in the non-pregnant uterus of infected ewes. The distribution of PrPSc plaques in placentomes was temporally associated with stage of gestation. There was a tendency toward increased size and number of placentomal PrPSc plaques from the endometrial stalk (maternal side) to chorionic plate (fetal side). These results indicate that accumulation of PrPSc is eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels in reproductive and placental tissues if infected ewes are not pregnant or conceive conceptuses with a resistant <b>PrP</b> <b>genotype...</b>|$|R
