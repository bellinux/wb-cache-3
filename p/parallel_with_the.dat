5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of}} the 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria is {{a unitary}} state. Since the 1880s, {{the number of}} {{territorial}} management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (oblasti, singular oblast). A new administrative structure was adopted in <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{continued}} but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly {{wind shear}} which stinted {{the strengthening of}} this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> west coast of Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85miles (137km) south of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|From the 1550s to the 1640s, as {{a result}} of {{increased}} foreign trade, Aalborg enjoyed great prosperity, second only to that of Copenhagen.

5|$|In <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} of the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from {{the city to the}} works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|In <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{emergence}} of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary also persuaded an active expansionist policy in the Balkan Peninsula {{from the end of}} the 12th century. To that end, Oltenia was put under the control of a Hungarian governor, who received the title of ban. The centre of the new province (the Banate of Severin) was Fort Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania), on the Danube, in the vicinity of the Iron Gates. Its first ban, Luke, was mentioned in 1233.|$|E
5|$|In <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> work on uranium was {{an effort}} to produce plutonium.

The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The Fat Man implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E

They constituted the beginning of the Soviet SPRN network, the equivalent of the NATO BMEWS.|$|E
5|$|The North East line {{originated}} from a suburban line to Essendon in 1860, being extended to Wodonga by 1873, connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break-of-gauge in 1883.
