5000|$|The {{registration}} <b>group</b> <b>identifier</b> is a 1- to 5-digit {{number that}} is valid {{within a single}} prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979). Registration <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element. The single-digit <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> within the 978 prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. An example 5-digit <b>group</b> <b>identifier</b> is 99936, for Bhutan. The allocated group IDs are: 0-5, 600-621, 7, 80-94, 950-989, 9926-9989, and 99901-99976.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model which {{improves}} {{the speed of}} the pipelining mechanism therefore increasing {{the speed of the}} processor. Superscalar operation is used to get maximum throughput from the processor using the pipelining concept. This proposal can be considered as the advancement of the super scalar property in pipelining which presently exists. We introduce a concept, using multiple instruction queues and a new <b>unit</b> called as <b>Identifier</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>Identifier</b> <b>unit</b> is designed as having the ability of the identifying the type of the instruction which is being fetched and separating it based on its types thus creating separate segments of execution, which in turn increases the speed of the processor. Moreover we have implemented separate decoding and the executing unit for each type of the instruction segments...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>group</b> <b>identifier,</b> often {{abbreviated}} to GID, is a numeric value {{used to represent}} a specific group. The range of values for a GID varies amongst different systems; at the very least, a GID can be between 0 and 32,767, with one restriction: the login group for the superuser must have GID 0. This numeric value is {{used to refer to}} groups in the [...] and [...] files or their equivalents. Shadow password files and Network Information Service also refer to numeric GIDs. The <b>group</b> <b>identifier</b> is a necessary component of Unix file systems and processes.|$|R
50|$|Publishers receive {{blocks of}} ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to {{publishers}} expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs {{of one or}} more digits for the registration <b>group</b> <b>identifier,</b> several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration <b>group</b> <b>identifier</b> used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.|$|R

5000|$|Unix-like {{operating}} systems identify a user within the kernel by a value called a user identifier, often abbreviated to user ID or UID. The UID, {{along with the}} <b>group</b> <b>identifier</b> (GID) and other access control criteria, is used to determine which system resources a user can access. The password file maps textual user names to UIDs, but in the kernel, only UIDs are used. UIDs are stored in the inodes of the Unix file system, running processes, tar archives, and the now-obsolete Network Information Service. In POSIX-compliant environments, the command-line command [...] gives the current user's UID, {{as well as more}} information such as the user name, primary user <b>group</b> and <b>group</b> <b>identifier</b> (GID).|$|R

40|$|Social {{networking}} site usage {{may affect}} subjective well-being. Two experiments examined how selective exposure to profiles of other users facilitated mood management via self-enhancing social comparisons. In Study 1, when given detailed impression management cues, such as photographs and status updates, users {{in a negative}} mood sought upward rather than downward social comparisons. Study 2 found that relatively low levels of group identification with the social networking site community led to upward social comparisons by users in a negative mood. High <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> spent more time viewing upward comparisons, regardless of mood. Regarding exposure effects, upward social comparisons to profiles improved subsequent mood when the comparison involved career success. High <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> experienced greater positive mood following upward social comparisons...|$|R
40|$|The Self-certifying File System (SFS) {{currently}} exports Unix filesystems. Consequently, file owners on SFS servers {{who want}} to give other users access to their files can do so only through the coarse-grained Unix access control mechanisms, {{which are based on}} locally de ned user <b>identifiers</b> and <b>group</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Therefore, despite the fact that SFS was designed to be a global filesystem, it is impossible for a file owner to grant access permissions to a remote SFS user who does not maintain a Unix account on the local machine. Moreover, creating new user <b>identifiers</b> or <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> for the purpose of access control requires the involvement of the local machine's administrator, a limitation that runs counter to the egalitarian spirit of SFS.

40|$|Structured {{peer-to-peer}} {{systems can}} be organized hierarchically as two-level overlay networks. The top-level overlay consists of groups of nodes, where each group is identified by a <b>group</b> <b>identifier.</b> In each <b>group,</b> one or more nodes are designated as supernodes and act as gateways to the nodes at the second level. A collision occurs during join operations, when two or more groups with the same <b>group</b> <b>identifier</b> are created at the top-level overlay. Collisions increase the lookup path length and the stabilization overhead, and reduce the scalability of hierarchical peer-to-peer systems. We propose a new scheme to detect and resolve collisions, and we study {{the impact of the}} collision problem on the performance of peer-to-peer systems. Our simulation results show the effectiveness of our scheme in reducing collisions and maintaining the size of the top-level overlay close to the ideal size...|$|R
