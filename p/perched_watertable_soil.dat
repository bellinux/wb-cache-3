40|$|Prescribed Wells Area (PWA) was {{established}} in the early 1960 s, in order to monitor groundwater levels and salinity (Fig. 1). The number of wells monitoring water levels, particularly in the Tertiary Aquifers (T 1 and T 2) has been increasing in response to groundwater extraction for irrigation purposes. In the last two years the observation network was upgraded with 20 new and two replacement observation wells completed into T 1 and T 2 Aquifers. The purpose of a successful network is to identify areas that may be under stress because of over-pumping of groundwater or areas that may be at risk from salinisation. The introduction of the reclaimed water through the Virginia pipeline scheme required establishment of an observation network (1999), which targeted the area in which the bulk of the recycled water is to be applied and therefore should provide sufficient early warning should there be any unacceptable accessions to the <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> and Q 1 Aquifer. During OctoberNovember 2001, this network was upgraded by thirteen shallow monitoring wells (<b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> and Q 1 Aquifer), which were installed {{as a part of a}} hydrogeological investigation in response to reports of rising shallow watertables in the area northwest of Virginia. These wells were included in the existing network and are monitored every three months. Four wells from this network are equipped with data loggers.

40|$|In sub-humid South India, {{recent studies}} have shown that black soil areas (Vertisols and vertic Intergrades), located on flat valley bottoms, have been rejuvenated through the {{incision}} of streambeds, inducing changes in the pedoclimate and soil transformation. Joint pedological, geochemical and geophysical investigations were performed in order to better understand the ongoing processes and their contribution to the chemistry of local rivers. The seasonal rainfall causes cycles of oxidation and reduction in a <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> {{at the base of the}} black soil, while the reduced solutions are exported through a loamy sand network. This framework favours a ferrolysis process, which causes low base saturation and protonation of clay, leading to the weathering of 2 : 1 then 1 : 1 clay minerals. Maximum weathering conditions occur at the very end of the wet season, just before disappearance of the <b>perched</b> <b>watertable.</b> Therefore, the by-products of soil transformation are partially drained off and calcareous nodules, then further downslope, amorphous silica precipitate upon soil dehydration. The ferrolysed area is fringing the drainage system indicating that its development has been induced by the streambed incision. The distribution of (14) C ages of CaCO(3) nodules suggests that the ferrolysis process started during the late Holocene, only about 2 kyr B. P. at the studied site and about 5 kyr B. P. at the watershed outlet. The results of this study are applied to an assessment of the physical erosion rate (4. 8 x 10 (- 3) m/kyr) since the recent reactivation of the erosion process.

40|$|Components of {{the water}} balance of an alley {{cropping}} system were measured to assess {{the extent to which}} tree rows 30 m apart with access to a fresh, <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> at 5 m depth were able to capture deep drainage from an inter-cropped cereal–legume rotation. Neutron probe data showed that the 4 -year-old trees, cut back to 0. 6 -m high {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, depleted soil water to 2, 4, and 8 m laterally from the tree rows in their first, second, and third years of coppice regrowth, respectively. Combining data from soil water depletion in summer and comparisons of deuterium: hydrogen ratios of groundwater, xylem sap of trees, and herbaceous plants, it was shown that tagasaste trees drew on soil water for 80 % of their transpiration in the first winter and 40 % in the second, while switching to near total dependence on groundwater each summer and early autumn. Tree water use on a whole plot basis was 170 mm in 1997 (68 % from groundwater) v. 167 mm in 1998 (73 % from groundwater). Recharge to the <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> was estimated to be 193 mm under sole crop in 1998 (52 % of rainfall), reducing to 32 mm when uptake of groundwater by trees was included. The degree of complementarity between tagasaste trees and crops in alley cropping used for water management is quantified for 1998 by calculating the ratio of the distance over which trees reduced drainage to zero to the distance over which they reduced crop yield to zero. It is concluded that segregated monocultures of trees and crops would be a more appropriate strategy than a closely integrated system such as alley cropping in this case...|$|R

This paper {{presents the results}} of a study into how hydrologicalpathways account for these variations in stream-water chemistry. The investigation was carried out in the LI 1 catchment; a 0 · 4 -ha subcatchment covered by stagnohumic gley soils was monitored between October 1988 and September 1989. An instrumented hill-slope was established to identify the hydrologicalpathways that control the hydrochemistry of storm runoff draining from the subcatchment. <b>Perched</b> <b>watertables</b> developed in the surface horizons of the soil during storm episodes and produced lateral flow above the impeding subsoil. This near-surface flow path was responsible for generating acid, Al-rich storm runoff. Some water drained vertically through the soil profile into the underlying slope drift; seepage from groundwater in the drift sustained baseflows. Buffering reactions in the groundwater zone reduced the acidity and Al levels of baseflows. These hydrochemical characteristics are likely to be representative of other areas of stagnohumic gley soils, which cover 19 % of the LI 1 catchment: these soils may therefore provide a substantial source of acid, Al-bearing storm runoff in LI 1 and similar afforested catchment...|$|R

Dikes were constructed after 1400. Regional extension and composition of the peat was studied. It was initiated in the Boreal Period, as Phragmites and Carex peat (topogene) and Sphagnum peat (ombrogene) with a rise in watertable, flooding and subsoil topography. Desiccation caused the 'rodoorn' clays, pillar and prismatic structures of the 'knip' clay, grit-layer formation in peaty clays and severe fissuring, especially in Carex peat. Improvement was difficult, because of {{the properties of the}} peat (permeability and irreversible drying).

40|$|A GIS based {{mass flow}} model {{was used to}} {{simulate}} debris flow triggering and evolution: a saturated/unsaturated soil water model was used to simulate the distribution of soil water and the generation of excess pore pressure leading to slope instability during a rainfall event. The model is able to detect potential instability due both {{to the development of}} a <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> at the colluvium/bedrock interface, and {{to the development of a}} saturated top layer because of the direct infiltration of rainfall during an intense event. Stability conditions are evaluated at the bottom of the saturated zones, i. e. at the wetting front and at the soil-rock contact. The safety factor, ratio of stabilizing forces or shear strength to destabilizing forces or shear stress, is calculated assuming the infinite slope model. The geotechnical parameters c' and phi can be introduced with uncertainty (mean value and variance); confidence intervals are calculated using a first order second moment (FOSM) method. This also allows to the estimate the failure probabilities. A flow routing model is then used to simulate the spreading and deposition of the mud/debris mixture on the hillslopes: once a landslide has been predicted, the location and released volume are used as inputs to a second model to simulate the spreading of the debris on the hillslope. The dynamic model has been built with PCRaster Software, based on the Bingham rheological expression. This model is applied to simulate the debris flow triggering and evolution in the Cardoso Torrent basin (Upper Versilia, NW Tuscany - Italy), where an extremely heavy rainstorm (about 500 mm within 12 hours) hit some restricted areas on June 19 th, 1996, involving a few basins of the Versilia and Garfagnana areas and inducing various effects on the slopes (soil slips and debris flows). A large number of data is available thanks to detailed surveys, which provided the characterization of the main factors (pluviometric, hydrogeological, geological, geomorphological and geotechnical) contributing to the landslide triggering. In particular, some factors were recurrent in the landslide sites: bedrock features (impermeable bedrock, discontinuity dipping downslope), slope morphology (hollow shape), geotechnical characteristics (fine, scarcely permeable cover material) ...|$|R
40|$|The Murray River {{floodplain}} {{supports a}} number of competing land uses, including significant areas of national parks and state forests alongside both irrigated and dryland agriculture, horticulture and croplands. As part of a multi-disciplinary study, associations between geomorphology, soils, regolith and vegetation wereintegrated to answer land management questions related to salt mobilisation, irrigation practices and the overall influence of salt on floodplain health. The Murray River floodplain downstream of Wakool Junction consists of three discrete floodplain meander belts (Fm 1, Fm 2 and Fm 3 units) and an alluvial terrace inset into the Murray River Gorge. The modern floodplain (Fm 1) is characterised by neutral to slightly acidic sandy soils of low salinity. Open forests of River Red Gums (Eucalyptus camadulensis) with minimal understorey dominate this unit. The olderfloodplain units (Fm 2 and Fm 3) generally support low open woodlands of salt-tolerant Black Box (E. largiflorens), with occasional River Red Gums occurring in drainage depressions. Isolated trees of Mallee eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) and Black Box with a Saltbush (Atriplex spp.) shrubland are typically found on the Fm 3 unit while the vegetation on the terrace unit is predominantly Saltbush (Atriplex sp.) shrubland. The Fm 2, Fm 3 and terrace units are characterised by heavy-textured soils which increase in pH with increasing distance from the main river channel. These clay soils are sodic, which seal on wetting and are higher in salinity than those found on the Fm 1 unit, suggesting that limited flushing of salts occurs. Fining of sediments also occurs with increasing distance from the main channel, which limits recharge on the older floodplain units. The terraces are capped by relict sand dunes, resulting in higher rates of localised recharge, forming <b>perched</b> <b>watertables</b> above the floodplain clays. Due to river regulation, {{a large number of}} channels are now abandoned and lined by cracking clays which also seal on wetting, and are therefore unlikely to beareas of high recharge. Active channels and those which receive environmental water allocations sustain communities of River Red Gums, or Black Box along the smaller and drier channels. The area outside of the Murray River Gorge, classified as the uplands unit, is characterised by well-drained loamy sands and sandy loams, with moderate amounts of carbonate in the intermediate dunes. This unit has largely been cleared for agriculture or horticulture, with significant areas subject to irrigation and are therefore potentially areas of high localised recharge. The integration of the geomorphology, vegetation and soils on the Murray River floodplain has been a key component in the estimation of recharge rates for salinity and land management...|$|R
40|$|Strontium is {{significantly}} more mobile than other hazardous radioactive metals. Its partitioning between aqueous and solid phases {{is controlled by}} reactions that occur at the interface between natural waters and minerals. At a groundwater site in Hanford (200 -BP- 5), the aerial extent of the {sup 90 }Sr plume is 100 {{times larger than the}} aerial extent of the {sup 137 }Cs and the {sup 239 }Pu plumes. Similarly, contaminated, <b>perched</b> <b>watertables</b> at INEL have much higher aqueous concentrations of {sup 90 }Sr than {sup 137 }Cs, presumably because Cs is preferentially sorbed to solids (Duncan 1995). Under high physical flow conditions, such as those in the highly fractured rock at Hanford and INEL, {sup 90 }Sr present in plumes may spread off-site and cause contamination of aquifers or other water sources. Geochemical factors that may contribute to the overall mobility of Sr in natural waters are the solubilities of phases such as strontianite (SrCO{sub 3 }) and formation of strong complexes with sulfate and nitrate. Although {sup 90 }Sr is mobilized in natural waters in these examples, significant concentrations may also be present in solid phases. Sorption experiments using a wide variety of substrates at room temperature have shown that Sr is removed from solution under certain conditions. Additionally, strontianite (SrCO{sub 3 }) may precipitate at low Sr concentrations in the pH range of waters in contact with basaltic rocks, which varies between pH 8 and 10. Waters contain variable amounts of carbonate owing to atmospheric interactions; the partial pressure of CO{sub 2 } is about 10 x 3. 5 atm in air and commonly as high as 10 x 2. 5 atm in soils. The objective of this work is to determine the fundamental data needed to predict the behavior of strontium at temperature and time scales appropriate to thermal remediation. The authors approach combines macroscopic sorption/precipitation and desorption/dissolution kinetic experiments, which track changes in solution composition, with direct molecular characterization of strontium in the solid phase using X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

40|$|On {{the large}} sand mass of Bribie Island, the {{sedimentary}} evolution related to sea level changes {{has resulted in}} marked spatial variations of aquifer properties. The main influence on groundwater behaviour is the induration of layers within the sandy sequences that comprise the island. The degree of induration controls vertical flows between the <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> and the underlying semi-confined regional aquifer. To identify heterogeneity within the indurated zone, an analysis of bore hydrographs was undertaken. The analysis shows that separate sections of the hydrological profile across the island display distinct unconfined or confined behaviour depending {{on the degree of}} hydrological discontinuity in the sandrock horizon. A two-dimensional (2 -D) hydrogeologic conceptual model of Bribie Island is developed for the numerical modelling process. The two-aquifer system separated by the indurated layer ("coffee rock") is incorporated into the groundwater model. The indurated layer is spatially variable in thickness, continuity and permeability. An evaluation of the recharge and drainage parameters is conducted for improvement of model accuracy, using MODFLOW software to solve the quasi three-dimensional (3 -D) flow model. The evapotranspiration (ET) parameter is tested due to the important role it has in the water balance of Bribie Island. The groundwater extraction and wastewater infiltration rates are evaluated separately for model input. Average hydraulic conductivities initially used in the numerical model for each aquifer do not match measured heads adequately. During initial model development, pilot point parameterisation of hydraulic conductivities was conducted providing a more complex distribution of the parameter and a better fit to observed water levels. Using spatial interpolation techniques, a gradual and realistic distribution of hydraulic properties is achieved rather than sharp changes between facies-related sedimentary sequences. The resultant visualisation of hydraulic conductivities supports the outcomes of the analysis of water level profiles. The model interprets and adjusts for the effects of the aquifer heterogeneity in respect to the hydraulic conductivity parameter. Areas of unconfined aquifer behaviour correspond to zones of higher hydraulic conductivities and are interpreted as regions of higher permeability due to a lesser degree of induration. Such zones of greater groundwater flow were found in the south of the island, the central swale and the northwest coastline, which act as connections to the basal aquifer enabling preferred recharge to it. Calibration is conducted in respect of the hydraulic conductivity, drainage and ET parameters. The calibration of simulated to observed hydraulic heads (objective function of 2. 96 and correlation of 0. 993) for the two layers achieved a close fit. The groundwater study demonstrates that both a statistical approach and numerical modelling are important in testing and refining the conceptual model. The modified conceptual model {{can be used as a}} basis for the construction of an improved and more reliable numerical model. The integration of geological information and spatial variability of aquifer parameters to produce a quasi three-dimensional model based on a two-aquifer conceptual model is a significant innovation of the modelling approach to Bribie Island. This approach contributes to a clearer understanding of the hydrogeological processes within the island. The investigation has contributed to a better understanding of the effects of broad and finer scale heterogeneities on groundwater dynamics in large sand mass...|$|R

Previous studies have reported smoldering was sensitive {{to a wide range}} of moisture contents, but studies of soil moisture dynamics and changing smoldering combustion potential in wetland communities are limited. Linking soil moisture measurements with estimates of the sustained smoldering limits of organic soils will improve our understanding of changes in ground fire potential over time. Seasonal soil moisture trends were monitored in six North Carolina coastal plain pocosin sites from January 2005 to November 2007. Measurements of the root-mat upper soil horizons were sampled at 2 -week intervals while measurements of lower horizon muck (sapric) soil moisture contents and watertable depths were made with automated data logging equipment. The <b>watertable</b> and <b>soil</b> moisture responses were influenced by seasonal and yearly differences in precipitation and hydrologic factors. The maximum estimated probabilities of sustained smoldering were highest in the fall of 2007 and lowest in 2006.

40|$|It’s {{well known}} that ozone is the most {{dangerous}} atmospheric pollutant for vegetation and reduces yield of several crops (Ferretti et al., 2007). Considering that ozone enters into plant tissues through the stomata, all the factors that reduce stomatal conductance also reduce ozone injuries to crops (Fagnano and Merola, 2007). Among these factors, in Mediterranean area increasing problems of <b>watertable</b> and <b>soil</b> salification are widespread reported. Salt stress reduced ozone sensitivity of some crop (Maggio et al., 2007), thanks to its effect on stomatal conductance and antioxidants production. The aim of this paper was to verify if irrigation with saline water can modify alfalfa responses to ozone pollution. From this experiment, it was confirmed that environmental conditions can strongly modify the response of plants to ozone pollution. Therefore, the thresholds for the protection of vegetation actually based on plant exposure to ozone tropospheric concentration are not suitable for the Mediterranean cropping systems, because these environments are characterized by multiple stresses (i. e. drought, salinity and ozone) that can modify the response of plants to the single stresses. For these reasons a ozone flux approach that takes into account other pedoclimatic stressors, therefore based on the real ozone dose absorbed by plants, will be more suitable for estimating ozone damages to crops in the different agro-environmental conditions of Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{leachate}} generation and migration from unlined {{municipal solid waste}} landfills on the Canterbury groundwater resource, was investigated at the largest site, the Paparua County Council Landfill. The 8 ha. landfill is located centrally within the western unconfined zone of the extensive 500 m thick glaciofluvial aquifer system. This unconfined area recharges deeper confined aquifers in the east, which underlie Christchurch City (pop. 300000) providing its sole drinking-water supply. Between its conversion from a gravel pit in 1973 and closure in July 1978, the site periodically operated as a wet landfill and rates a high pollution potential classification (DRASTIC Index = 187, Le Grand + 14 G). However, leachate is confined to a 200 m x 200 m area in the northeast of the site, between the depths of 6 m and 9 m, by an underlying silty sand aquitard. Landfill stratigraphy was determined from Wenner and Schlumberger soundings. Best-fit sounding models indicated leachate with a 2. 3 to 6. 7 Ωm layer, underlying unsaturated refuse (19. 6 to 30. 1 Ωm), and overlying silty sand (50 Ωm to 77 Ωm) and sandy gravels (> 300 Ωm). Resistivity profiling at a= 15 m and a= 30 m spacings, revealed a low resistivity zone restricted both laterally and vertically to the northeast comer of the site. This zone, taken to represent leachate, exhibited slight southeast migration on the deeper penetrating profile. Down-hole nuclear geophysical logging did not detect the contaminant zone, but the landfill boundary was identified on a seismic traverse {{by a lack of}} refraction of the critical ray over refuse infilled land. Beneath the 6 m deep landfill, a 1. 5 to 8 m thick silty sand was detected in 4 lithologically logged wells installed at the site. The hydraulic conductivity of this unit at 2. 9 x 10 - 9 to 3. 2 X 10 - 7 m/s is significantly less than the 2. 39 x 10 - 3 m/s of the underlying sediments. The silty sand therefore functions as an aquitard, producing a <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> in the overlying refuse and inhibiting downward leachate percolation as illustrated by resistivity pseudosections. In the deeper gravels and sandy gravels, point dilution tests showed that seepage velocities varied from 8. 3 x 10 - 7 to 2. 7 x 10 - 3 m/s and exhibited a strong relationship to uniformity coefficients of the sediments. Laterally continuous high velocity zones within deeper gravels could act as rapid dilution and transport zones for contaminants permeating through the aquitard. Resistivity profiling dictated the installation positions of 16 monitoring wells. The presence of leachate was confirmed with groundwater samples from the northeast corner of the site contaminated with up to 160 mg/l NH 4 -N, 0. 11 mg/l Cu, 270 mg/l CI, 210 mg/l Na, 2. 8 mg/l B, high levels of Ca, Mg and high chemical oxygen demands. In these samples, total dissolved solids ranged from 1238 to 1736 mg/l and total organic carbon ranged from 58. 8 to 98. 7 mg/I. Amines, ketones and terpenes which result from the anaerobic degradation of putrescible refuse were detected. Alkyl benzenes, S- and N- heterocyclic compounds, and xylenes, at 5 mg/m 3 in one sample, were the only synthetic organic compounds found. In groundwater beneath the aquitard and downgradient of the northeast zone, these substances were below detection limits. The landfill presently poses no significant threat {{to the quality of the}} underlying groundwater resource. However, leachate confinement by fortuitous hydrogeologic factors at the Paparua County Council Landfill cannot be taken as indicative of leachate behaviour at other unlined landfills in Canterbury, nor should the present site conditions be regarded as invariant. This study illustrates the importance of a site-specific investigation in gauging leachate effects, demonstrating the value of an integrated approach using techniques previously unapplied to New Zealand landfills...|$|R

The Basin is of similar size to the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia and experiences many similar issues, including returning water to the River for ecological purposes and better managing land and water salinity. Jurisdictionally, the Tarim Basin includes 5 Prefectures who have delegated responsibilities for managing their respective land, water and environmental resources under the guidance of the XUAR Regional Government. The Tarim Basin {{is an important part of}} the XAUR’s economic development. Irrigation is extensive with about 1. 5 million ha of irrigated land using 15 Bm 3 of surface water and 0. 3 Bm 3 of groundwater annually. The Basin produces one sixth of China’s cotton as well as grains and fruit. Serious eco-environmental problems have developed over the last 40 - 50 years. For example, until recently, the lower 300 km of the Tarim River had not received water for 20 years and this seriously degraded the natural ‘green corridor’. Shallow <b>watertables</b> and <b>soil</b> salinity are also endemic in the irrigation areas and surface drains are widely used to drain shallow watertables.

40|$|The Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA), the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA), and the Murray Valley (MV) {{constitute}} the major Australian rice growing areas and {{are located in}} southern east Australia. According to the Ricegrowers' Association of Australia Inc. (2002), the annual value of production of rice was 357 million in 2001 and the industry generates more than 500 million from value-added exports annually, allowing these rice growing areas to {{play a significant role}} in the Australian economy. The rice growing areas are also among the areas where the sustainability of irrigated agriculture is under threat from rising <b>watertables,</b> <b>soil</b> salinity and other environmental consequences. The depth to watertables in more than 70 per cent of the MIA (MIA L&WMP, 1998), around 35 per cent of the CIA (CICL, 2001), and around 60 per cent of the MV (Murray Irrigation, 2001) is now around two metres from the soil surface. With the current land use practices, around 20 to 30 per cent of regions such as the MIA could become moderately salinised in the next 30 years due to rising watertables (Humphreys et al., 2001). Water leaching and run-off from rice-based farms form further problems. Paddocks are flood-irrigated during rice growing period between November to March. Although irrigation water is released prior to rice harvest, much of the water is retained by the soil even after rice harvest. The soil then slowly drains this water along with the added winter rainwater into the watertable beyond the root zone. This wet soil profile has the potential to become an extra economic resource for rice-based farms whenever it can be used to grow another crop during winter straight after rice. Growing winter crops immediately after rice harvest may reduce the amount of water drainage into watertables on rice-based farms. Successful adoption of this potentially attractive option seems to depend on good weather and rootzone water conditions, good drainage and timeliness in the rice harvesting, stubble burning, and winter crop sowing operations. Among the constraints for adding crops after rice are too much rain or waterlogging for the winter crop to survive, problems with stubble burn, pests, weeds, and unsuitable machinery leading to a high risk of crop failure (Humphreys and Bhuiyan, 2001). As one of the strategies to overcome the problems of rising watertables in rice growing areas, the Rice CRC is conducting Project 1205 “Quantifying and Maximising the Benefits of Crops after Rice”, henceforward referred to as Project 1205. Project 1205 aims at determining the constraints and the success factors for rice growers to produce winter crops and pastures after rice, and at measuring the impacts of this practice on environmental and economic sustainability. In particular, the project aims to measure the effects of growing wheat after rice on the productivity and water use efficiency of the rice-wheat cropping system. 2 The objectives of this economic analysis of project 1205 are: · To identify the common crop rotations in the main Australian rice-based farming systems, both with and without crops after rice; · To estimate the potential financial benefits of growing crops after rice; · To identify the economic benefits to the community from reduced accessions to groundwater; and · To compare returns with the costs to the CRC and its partners of developing and extending this technology. To measure the likely financial and economic benefits of growing crops after rice, the study relied heavily on the results from Humphreys et al. (2001) ...|$|R
40|$|Riparian {{areas in}} Arizona have been centers for man's {{activities}} such as farming, cattle grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, water, and cities, since the early 1800 's. Representing {{less than one percent}} of Arizona's land resource base, riparian areas have received a disproportionately high amount of use and abuse. Public and private awareness of the necessity to preserve and manage riparian areas was aroused in the late 1960 's by the Arizona Fish and Game Department and United States Forest Service with a study documenting that clearing of riparian areas was detrimental to wildlife habitats. Since the early 1970 's national conferences, studies, and legislation concerning protection, preservation, and management of riparian areas have demonstrated the increasing public interest for riparian areas. Proper management of riparian areas requires land managers to have information on the environmental parameters active in these areas. Riparian areas have been studied since the 1930 's, but early studies looked mainly at how to increase water yields from riparian areas through vegetation management. It has only been since the 1970 's that studies have been aimed at protection and preservation of riparian areas. This dissertation documents an added effort to broaden the existing knowledge on riparian areas in the southwest. A riparian area bordering Paige Creek in southeastern Arizona was monitored for 24 months. Environmental data (e. g. precipitation, streamflow, <b>watertable</b> levels, <b>soils,</b> soil water status, and vegetation) were collected and analyzed with the objective, to determine if soil moisture content could be used as an indicator of a riparian area in the absence of typical riparian vegetation. Statistical tests indicated soil moisture in the upper 48 inches of soil could not be used to indicate the riparian area. The position of existing riparian vegetation was controlled by the location of the watertable. Unless the location of the free water supply is known, soil moisture readings alone could prove misleading...|$|R

The contaminated groundwater and gasoline from a fiberglass UST migrated east, towards the Athabasca River, and underneath an adjacent office building and community hall. Low-level (< 1000 mg/L air) VOC fumes were identified inside the office building. In addition, during the Phase II ESA investigation, diesel contaminant was identified in the limited area southeast of the office building. Based on subsequent interviews and air photo reviews, a former forestry operation was detected and determined {{as a source of}} diesel contamination. An aggressive soil and groundwater in-situ bioremediation program was designed to prevent further migration of the contaminants towards the Athabasca River and to control the concentration of fugitive VOC inside the office building. In the first phase, the remediation program focused on the extraction of the estimated 35 m 3 of the free gasoline on top of the shallow <b>watertable.</b> The ongoing <b>soil</b> and groundwater in-situ bioremediation program consists of two sets of horizontal air sparging (AS) and soil vapour extraction (SVE) wells installed underneath and east of the office building.

40|$|Two of Western Australia 2 ̆ 7 s most {{pressing}} land degradation problems are waterlogging and increasing soil salinity. Extensive clearing of the native. deep-rooted vegetation and its replacement with shallow-rooted crop and pasture plants {{has resulted in}} increased recharge of groundwater tables. causing them to rise. Salts stored in the soil are being brought to the soil surface with the rising watertables. Revegetation with deep-rooted native plants {{has been identified as}} the most likely strategy to achieve increased groundwater usage and a lowering of watertables. One area seriously affected by waterlogging and increasing salinity is the Western Australian central wheatbelt region. The Department for Conservation and Land Management [CALM] is conducting revegetation trials with oil producing mallee-form eucalypts. It is hoped that commercial production of cineole, a major constituent of eucalyptus oil, will prove to be an economic catalyst for large-scale revegetation of tile Western Australian wheatbelt region. Species used in the oil mallee trials include Eucalyptus horistes and E. loxaphleba subsp. lissophloia, about which very little is known. Yet site specific species selection, based on knowledge of a species 2 ̆ 7 preferred site conditions for maximum productivity, is essential in reaching revegetation objectives, such as high water use and cineole production. To gain this knowledge about E. horistes and E. loxophfeba subsp. lissophloia a study was conducted on trial sites in the central wheatbelt region of Narrogin-Wickepin. A number of plant growth, water use and cineole production parameters were examined at sites representing recharge and discharge zones, and the chemical and physical characteristics of the sites were determined. It was hypothesised that any differences in species productivity and water use can be explained in terms of the species 2 ̆ 7 suitability to the site conditions, and that any differences between species are physiological. Analysis of the data revealed that E. horistes prefers recharge sites, while E. loxophleba subsp. lissophloia appears to be a generalist species. Both species transpire large amounts of water, making them inherently suitable for revegetation projects aimed at controlling rising <b>watertables</b> and associated <b>soil</b> salinity. Cineole production by E. horistes plants was larger, and E. loxophleba subsp. Lissophloia showed great variability in leaf cineole content. The study highlighted the need for grazing and weed controls in oil mallee plantations, as well as the necessity to carry out further research with emphasis on species provenance selection and breeding trials for higher cineole yields and improved tolerance to waterlogged and saline site conditions...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation {{water of}} poor quality can have {{deleterious}} effects on soils. However, {{the effect of}} drip irrigation on seasonal and long term (e. g. over 50 years) changes in soil chemical properties is poorly understood, complicated by the two-dimensional water flow patterns beneath drippers. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted, along with computer modelling, to evaluate morphological and physio-chemical changes in a typical Barossa Valley Red Brown Earth (Palexeralf, Chromosol or Lixisol) when drip irrigated under various changing management practices. This work focused on the following two management changes : (i) switching from long-term irrigation with a saline source to less saline water and (ii) gypsum (CaSO₄) application. A literature review (Chapter 1) focuses on the distribution, features, properties and management of Red Brown Earths in the premium viticultural regions of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, South Australia. The effects of irrigation method and water quality on the rate and extent of soil deterioration are emphasised. The review also discusses the irrigation of grapes (Vitis vinifera) and summarises previous research into the effect of sodicity and salinity on grape and wine characteristics. This chapter shows the importance of Red Brown Earths to Australian viticulture, but highlights their susceptibility to chemical and physical degradation. Degradation may be prevented or remediated by increasing organic matter levels, applying gypsum, modifying cropping and through tillage practices such as deep ripping. Chapter 2 provides general information on the two study sites investigated, one in the Barossa Valley and the other at McLaren Vale. Local climate, geology, geomorphology and soils are described. Chapter 3 details laboratory, field and sampling methods used to elucidate changes in soil chemical and physical properties following irrigation. The genesis of the non-irrigated Red Brown Earth in the Barossa Valley is described in Chapter 4, and is inferred from geochemical, soil chemical, layer silicate and carbonate mineralogical data. Elemental gain and loss calculations showed 42 % of original parent material mass was lost during the formation of A and A 2 horizons, while the Bt 1 and Bt 2 horizons gained 50 % of original parent material mass. This is consistent with substrate weathering and illuviation of clay from surface to lower horizons. The depth distributions of all major elements were similar; the A horizon contained lower amounts of major elements than {{the remainder of the}} profile, indicating this region was intensely weathered. This chapter also compares the non-irrigated site to the adjacent irrigated site (separated by 10 m) to determine if the sites are pedogenically identical and geochemical changes from irrigation. Many {{of the differences between the}} non-irrigated and irrigated sites appear to be correlated with variations in quartz, clay, Fe oxide and carbonate contents, with little geological variation between the sample sites. In Chapter 5 morphological, chemical and physical properties of a non-irrigated and irrigated Red Brown Earth in the Barossa Valley are compared. Alternating applications of saline irrigation water (in summer) and non-saline rain water (in winter) have caused an increase in electrical conductivity (EC [subscript se]), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), bulk density (ρ b) and pH. This has resulted in enhanced clay dispersion and migration. Impacts on SAR and ρ b are more pronounced at points away from the dripper due to the presence of an argillic horizon, which has greatly influenced the variations in these soil properties with depth and distance from the dripper. Dispersion and migration of clay were promoted by alternating levels of EC, while SAR remained relatively constant, resulting in the formation of a less permeable layer in the Bt 1 horizon. Clay dispersion (breakdown of micro-aggregate structure) was inferred from reduced numbers of pores and voids, alterations in colouring (an indication that iron has changed oxidation state) and increased bulk density (up to 30 %). Eleven years of irrigation changed the soil from a Calcic Palexeralf (non-irrigated) to an Aquic Natrixeralf (irrigated) (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). These results, combined with data from Chapter 4, were used to develop a mechanistic model of soil changes with irrigation. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 describe field experiments conducted in the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions. This data shows seasonal and spatial variations in soil saturation extract properties (EC [subscript se], SAR [subscript se], Na [subscipt se] and Ca [subscript se]). At the Barossa Valley site (Chapter 6) non-irrigated soils had low EC [subscript se], SAR [subscript se], Na [subscript se] and Ca [subscript se] values throughout the sampling period. The irrigated treatments included eleven years of drip irrigation with saline water (2. 5 dS / m) and also gypsum application at 0, 4 or 8 tonnes/hectare in 2001 and 2002. Salts in the profile increased with gypsum application rate, with high levels occurring midwinter 2002 prior to rainfall leaching salts. SAR has declined with gypsum application, particularly in the A horizon and at 100 cm from the dripper in the Bt 1 horizon; this has the potential to reflocculate clay particles and improve soil hydraulic conductivity. Chapter 7 presents further results from the Barossa Valley site, this treatment had been irrigated for 9 years with saline water (2. 5 dS / m) prior to switching to a less saline water source (0. 5 dS / m). The soil also received gypsum at 0, 4 or 8 tonnes / hectare in 2001 and 2002. It was found that the first few years are critical when switching to a less saline water source. EC declines rapidly, but SAR requires a number of years, depending on conditions, to decline, resulting in a period during which the Bt 1 horizon may become dispersed. Gypsum application increased the EC [subscipt se] but not to the EC [subscript se] levels of soil irrigated with saline water. Chapter 8 examines soil chemical properties of a McLaren Vale vineyard, irrigated with moderately saline water (1. 2 dS / m) since 1987 and treated with gypsum every second year since establishment. This practice prevented the SAR ( 5 mmol / L). However, irrigation caused the leaching of calcium beneath the dripper in both the A and B horizons (0 to 20 cm from dripper) (< 4 mmol / L). Chapters 9 and 10 interpret and discuss results from continuous monitoring of redox potential (Eh) and soil solution composition in the Barossa Valley vineyard, irrigated with saline or non-saline water, and gypsum-treated at 0 and 4 tonnes / hectare. Soil pore water solution (Chapter 9) collected by suction cups is compared to results obtained in chapters 6 and 7. The soil has extended zones and times of high SAR and low EC. This was particularly evident in the upper B horizon, where the SAR of the soil remained stable throughout the year while the EC was more seasonally variable with EC declining during the winter months. The A horizon does not appear to be as susceptible to clay dispersion (compared to the B horizon) because during periods of low EC the SAR also declines, which may be due to the low CEC (low clay and organic matter content) of this horizon. Chapter 10 presents redox potentials (Eh) measured using platinum redox electrodes installed in the A, A 2 and Bt 1 horizons to examine whether Eh of the profile varies with irrigation water quality and gypsum application. Saline irrigation water caused the B horizon to become waterlogged in winter months, while less saline irrigation water caused a <b>perched</b> <b>watertable</b> to develop, due to a dispersed Bt 1 horizon. Application of gypsum reduced the soil Eh particularly in the A 2 horizon (+ 500 to + 50 mV) during winter. Thus redox potential can be influenced by irrigation water quality and gypsum applications. Chapter 11 incorporated site data from the Barossa Valley non-irrigated site into a predictive mathematical model, TRANSMIT, a 2 D version of LEACHM. This model was used to predict zones of gypsum accumulation during long-term irrigation (67 years). When applied over the entire soil surface, gypsum accumulated at 60 to 90 cm from the dripper in the B horizon; higher application rates caused increased accumulation. When applied immediately beneath the irrigation dripper, gypsum accumulated in a 'column' under the dripper (at 0 to 35 cm radius from the dripper), with very little movement away from the dripper. Also, the zone of accumulation of salts from high and low salinity irrigation water was investigated. These regions were found to be similar, although concentrations were significantly lower with low salinity water. In low rainfall years salts accumulated throughout the B horizon (35 - 150 cm), while in periods of high rainfall (and leaching) the A, A 2 and Bt 1 horizons (0 - 60 cm) were leached, although at greater depths (80 - 150 cm) salt concentrations remained high. Chapter 12 summarises results and provides an understanding of soil processes in drip irrigated soils to underpin improved management options for viticulture. This study combines results from redox and soil solution monitoring, mineralogy, elemental gains and losses, and seasonal soil sampling to develop a mechanistic model of soil processes, which was combined with computer modelling to predict future properties of the soil. Major conclusions and recommendations of this study include : - Application of saline irrigation water to soil then ameliorated with gypsum - The first application of gypsum was leached by the subsequent irrigation from extended regions of the soil. As Na continues to enter the system via irrigation water, gypsum needs to be regularly applied. Otherwise calcium will be leached through the soil and SAR increases. - Application of non-saline irrigation water to soil then ameliorated with gypsum - The soil was found to only require one application at 8 tons / ha as this reduced SAR sufficiently. As less salt is entering the soil, subsequent gypsum applications can be at a lower rate or less frequently than required for saline irrigation water. - Gypsum applied directly beneath the dripper systems distributes calcium to a narrow region of the soil, while large regions of the soil require amelioration (high SAR) and are not receiving calcium. Therefore, gypsum application through the drip system or only beneath the dripper should be combined with broad acre application. - A range of methods to sample vineyards is recommended for duplex soils, including the use of saturation extracts, sampling time, sampling location (distance from dripper) and depth of sampling. This work is critical for vineyard management and may be applicable to other Australian viticulture regions with Red Brown Earths. Thesis (Ph. D.)
