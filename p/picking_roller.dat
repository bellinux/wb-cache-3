On the basis the theoretical analysis of picking mechanism and structural parameters of the half-feed <b>picking</b> <b>roller,</b> and combined with the picking performance experimental, the structural parameters of the picking blades and blades quantity of <b>picking</b> <b>roller</b> were studied. The results show that: when the straight-shaped blade is picking, the picking force is strong, the broken branch and seedling phenomenon is serious, peanut broken rate and peanut with handle rate are higher; the arc-shaped blade reduced peanut damage, and effectively reduced {{the rate of the}} peanut with handle. The picking blade radian has a large impact to the peanut broken and loss rate. When the blade radian is 70 ° and the blade radius is 35 mm, total loss rate is the lowest on the picking segment of the blade. The blade quantity has significant influence to the peanut broken and loss rate. The peanut broken rate of the 8 blades is 2 to 3 times of the 4 and 6 blades; the picking net rate of the 4 blades is much lower than 6 and 8 blades. The self-design the <b>picking</b> <b>roller</b> is 6 arc-shaped blades, the blade radius is 35 mm, and the blade radian is 70 °. The study provides the design basis for the research and development of the half-feed peanut picking device...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceIn {{this paper}} the {{mechanical}} {{analysis of the}} film <b>picking</b> forks <b>roller</b> tooth in field -cleaning machine was done. A finite element analysis model was built and used by the non-linear finite element analysis method. It is obtained from the result of post-processing calculation and analysis that according to the Fourth Strength Theory, the maximum equivalent stress on the pole tooth root under the uniform load. Root strength should be strengthened to ensure the evenly stress overall the pole tooth, because pole tooth root department would be deformed easily. And the largest stress {{is at the end}} of pole tooth and decreases gradually from end to root, and deformation is also the same. Based on the analysis of strength and rigidity, the bearing forces and deformation of the film <b>picking</b> forks <b>roller</b> tooth in work were predicted and validated. It was found that the finite element analysis and the result of test were well coincided. The reliable tool was provided for the design of the film <b>picking</b> forks <b>roller</b> tooth by the finite element analysis. The Roller tooth was designed and improved according to the requirement of deformation and operation...|$|R

50|$|After World War II, {{engineers}} {{tried to}} generate random sequences using electrical devices. Noise sources (like a hot cathode {{gas discharge tube}} or a resistor) would typically be sent through filters and amplifiers to output one or several random streams. Such device is described in a 1940 patent by Newby et al.. Though most patented machines continued {{to be based on}} old mechanical designs that did not provide as much randomness as noise sources but were more practical. According to the patents filled during the 1950s and 1960s, designers created simple devices where a basic shuffling operation was repeated several times (by feeding the output deck back into the machine) instead of having one complex pass implying many tricky mechanical operations ending up with a poor shuffling and lower reliability. Some of them tried to reproduce what was manually done during a riffle shuffling with cards interleaving each others. Cards <b>picking</b> using <b>rollers</b> in contact with the top or bottom of the deck were still heavily used at that time.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, June 25 - August 1, ski {{instructor}} 'Chalky' White (b. 11 May 1947) raised approximately 25,000 British Pounds for the spinal injuries charity BackUp, by roller skiing {{between the two}} extreme-points of Great Britain, official distance of 911 miles; though 'Chalky' covered more distance than the official because of forced diversions. The journey was from John O'Groats in north east Scotland to Lands End in South West England. Although not recorded in the Guinness Book of Records 'Chalky' White's G.B Roller Ski was witnessed by several charity fundraisers. Following {{the end of each}} day's skiing, 'Chalky' was seen to <b>pick</b> up his <b>roller</b> skis at the very point that he finished skiing and to take them ten of his own walked steps, back, from where he had just travelled; that place was marked on the road to make sure that every inch or more of the official 911 miles and more was covered by 'Chalky' on his roller skis. [...] In the beginning, the skis were developed with one wheel in front and two wheels behind. The introduction of skating (free technique) in cross-country skiing changed athletes' training needs, which consequently impacted the design of roller skis. New roller skis with two wheels instead of three and much lighter materials could be used both for the classic style and skating. Paolo Miorin, who designed the Skirollo, may have been the inventor of two-wheeled roller skis.|$|R

On the perfect action of this doctor depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to get it up (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience {{to know exactly what}} qualities it should possess in any given case. In order to prevent it from wearing irregularly it is given a to-and-fro motion so that it is constantly changing its position and is never in contact with one part of the engraving for more than of brass or a similar alloy is frequently added {{on the opposite side of}} the roller to that occupied by the steel or cleaning doctor; it is known technically as the lint doctor from its purpose of cleaning off loose filaments or lint, which the <b>roller</b> <b>picks</b> off the cloth during the printing operation. The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.|$|R
