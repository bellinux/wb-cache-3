25|$|The {{weight of}} the snow caused several roof and porch collapses {{throughout}} the region, particularly around Philadelphia where the snow mixed with sleet.

40|$|Oral {{complications}} from radiation {{to the head}} and neck or chemotherapy for any malignancy can compromise patients' health and quality of life, and affect their ability to complete planned cancer treatment. For some patients, the complications can be so debilitating that they may tolerate only lower doses of therapy, <b>postpone</b> <b>scheduled</b> treatments, or discontinue treatment entirely. Oral complications can also lead to serious systemic infections. Medically necessary oral care before, during, and after cancer treatment can prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of oral complications, enhancing both patient survival and quality of life. In the present article we have tried to present an overview of oral complications and their possible management after radiation and chemotherapy in head and neck regio...|$|R

40|$|Responses on a lever by rats <b>postponed</b> <b>scheduled</b> timeouts, or periods {{during which}} the {{delivery}} of response-independent food was withheld. The effects {{of a number of}} experimental variables were examined and the conclusions drawn are that the functional relations describing free-operant avoidance of timeout from response-independent reinforcement are similar to those for avoidance of electric shock and that both phenomena are sensitive to the same parametric manipulations. Results suggest that high frequency of food delivery in timein maintains a higher rate of timeout avoidance than low frequency. The evidence argues against an interpretation in terms of adventitious food-reinforcement of the timeout avoidance response. Finally, the effects of scheduling timeouts independently of responding and of omitting timeouts confirm the view that timeouts can be aversive and may act as punishment for responding...|$|R
40|$|Squirrel monkeys were {{restrained}} in a centrifuge capsule {{and trained}} to escape and avoid increases in artificial gravity. During escape-avoidance, lever responses reduced centrifugally simulated gravity or <b>postponed</b> <b>scheduled</b> increases. The effect {{of variation in}} the interval of postponement (equal to the duration of decrease produced by escape responses) was studied under a multiple schedule of four components. Three components were gravity escape-avoidance with postponement times of 20, 40, and 60 sec. The fourth component was extinction. Each component {{was associated with a}} different auditory stimulus. Rate of responding decreased with increasing postponement time and higher mean g-levels occurred at shorter intervals of postponement. Effects of the schedule parameter on response rate and mean g-level were similar to effects of the schedule on free-operant avoidance and on titration behavior maintained by shock...|$|R
