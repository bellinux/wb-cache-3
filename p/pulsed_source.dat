50|$|A {{bolometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} power at microwave frequencies. In this application, a resistive element is exposed to microwave power. A dc bias current is applied to the resistor to raise its temperature via Joule heating, such that the resistance is matched to the waveguide characteristic impedance. After applying microwave power, the bias current is reduced to return the bolometer to its resistance in the absence of microwave power. The change in the dc power is then equal to the absorbed microwave power. To reject the effect of ambient temperature changes, the active (measuring) element is in a bridge circuit with an identical element not exposed to microwaves; variations in temperature common to both elements do not affect the accuracy of the reading. The average response time of the bolometer allows convenient measurement of the power of a <b>pulsed</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractLong pulsed neutron {{sources are}} being {{actively}} developed as small university based sources {{and are being}} considered {{for the next generation}} of high powered sources, such as the European Neutron Source (ESS) and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) second target station. New instrumentation concepts will be required to effectively utilize the full spectrum of neutrons generated by these sources. Neutron diffractometers, which utilize time-of-flight (TOF) techniques for wavelength resolution, are particularly problematic. We describe an instrument for a long <b>pulsed</b> <b>source</b> that provides resolution comparable to that obtained on short pulsed sources without the need of long incident flight paths. We accomplish this by utilizing high speed choppers to impose a time structure on the spectrum of incident neutrons. By strategically positioning these choppers the response matrix assumes a convenient form that can be deconvoluted from the measured TOF spectrum to produce the diffraction pattern of the sample. We compare the performance of this instrument to other possible diffraction instruments that could be utilized on a long <b>pulsed</b> <b>source...</b>|$|E
