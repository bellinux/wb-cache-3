Thirty-two pigs each of either 1 / 4 Duroc- 3 / 4 white composite (Duroc crossbred), purebred Meishan, or 1 / 4 Meishan- 3 / 4 white composite (Meishan crossbred) breeding were injected daily with 0 or 4 mg pST and fed a diet containing 0 or 2. 75 ppm salbutamol for approximately 34 d and subsequently slaughtered. As the percentage Meishan in the genotype increased, loin muscle area, semitendinosus weight, average daily gain (ADG), and carcass gain decreased. There was an interaction between salbutamol and genotype for ADG, daily protein gain, and total carcass gain, resulting in Meishan crossbred pigs having similar rates to non-treated Duroc crossbred pigs. When Duroc crossbred pigs were treated with salbutamol, both daily protein gain and total carcass gain were greatest, whereas ADG was nonsignificantly greater than that of untreated Duroc crossbred and salbutamol-treated Meishan crossbred pigs. Meishan pigs did not respond to salbutamol treatment for the criteria mentioned. Both pST and salbutamol increased loin muscle area and semitendinosus weight across genotypes. Leaf fat was reduced more by pST treatment in purebred Meishan pigs than in the other two genotypes, and salbutamol treatment resulted in small reductions in leaf fat across genotypes.

These threonine values ranged from 112 to 212 % of the dietary threonine estimate for finishing pigs (NRC 1988). All pigs within each pST dosage treatment received each diet for an 8 -d period in a Latin square design. Diets were fed for a 4 -d adaptation period followed by a 4 -d total collection of feces and urine. Pigs were also weighed and bled at the end of each 8 -d period. Increasing threonine level increased average daily gain (ADG), reduced feed intake (ADFI), and improved feed efficiency (F/G). <b>Porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> had no effect on ADG; however, pigs injected with 4 or 8 mg/d had numerical increases in ADG as threonine level increased. Feed efficiency improved as pST dosage increased. Daily threonine intake increased as dietary threonine level increased. However efficiency of threonine utilization for gain became poorer for control pigs as threonine intake increased, but pST-treated pigs had little change in efficiency of threonine utilization up to the. 75 and. 85 % threonine levels for 4 and 8 mg/d pST dosages, respectively. There was a threonine x pST interaction for plasma urea concentrations, with control pigs having little change in urea concentrations whereas pigs injected with 4 mg/d pST had a decrease then an increase in urea concentrations and pigs injected with 8 mg/d had continual decrease in urea concentrations.

40|$|Newly {{developed}} hydrogels, {{produced by}} cross linking purified poly (γ-glutamic acid) (γPGA) with dihaloalkane compounds were utilized for slow-release of <b>porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (pST). The polymer {{was produced by}} fermentation of Bacillus licheniformis. It {{was found that the}} rate of the crosslinking reaction and hydrogel yield were affected by several parameters, such as temperature, initial polymer and base concentrations as well as the type of crosslinkers. Reaction occurred rapidly at a polymer concentration of 40 - 80 mg/ml and temperature of 60 - 80 ∘C without hydrolysis of newly formed networks and polymer backbone. The optimal concentration for the base (NaHCO 3) was 1 - 2 mole per mole of carboxylic residues. ^ Analysis of the hydrolysis of the hydrogels as a function of pH indicated that the hydrolysis occurred very slowly at neutral pH, but rapidly in both acidic and alkaline solution. The ester bonds were more sensitive to hydrolysis than the peptide bonds. The biodegradability of the hydrogels and polymer was further examined through enzymatic degradation by three enzymes (Cathepsin B, Pronase E and Trypsin), which were able to gradually cleave both ester and peptide bonds. Swelling of the hydrogel showed dramatic changes when experimental conditions such as the molecular weight of γ-PGA, nature of the crosslinkers and solutions used for swelling (ionic strength, organic solvent) were varied. The swelling degree was positively correlated with initial molecular weight of γ-PGA, but inversely correlated with the chain length of the crosslinkers and the crosslinking degree. Increasing the organic solvent or ionic concentration in solutions decreased the gel swelling, which was in agreement with general reports in literature. ^ <b>Porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (pST) is a very unstable hormone in aqueous environment. It was found in this research that the peptide underwent aggregation and decomposition at extreme pH, but was relatively stable in neutral pH. Aggregation was positively correlated with pST and ionic concentrations. The hormone monomer was stabilized to a certain degree in glucose solutions and at low concentration of urea. A quantitative ELISA method was established using anti-pST monoclonal and multiclonal antibodies. The method was simple and specific. ^ The release profiles of γ-PGA based hydrogels for p-nitroaniline and BSA were studied in vitro. Hydrogels formed with longer chain crosslinkers released materials much slower than shorter chain dihaloalkanes, but unevenly release was observed for macromolecules. The hydrogels formed by dihalopentane was applied for slow-release of pST in vitro and in vivo.

Pigs received one of three levels of dietary lysine (1. 0, 1. 5, or 2. 0 %) and were injected daily with either 3 mg <b>porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (pST) or placebo. During the first 2 wk of the trial, there was no effect from either pST injection or increasing level of dietary lysine on average daily gain (ADG) or average daily feed intake (ADFI). Also, there was no effect of pST injections on feed conversion (F/G), but those pigs fed diets containing higher levels of lysine showed improved F/G. During the entire 5 -wk period, pigs administered pST gained faster than placebo-injected pigs. During the 5 -wk trial, there was a nonsignificant reduction in ADFI for pigs injected with pST compared with those receiving placebo injections. Increasing the level of dietary lysine also resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in ADFI. Pigs injected daily with pST showed a 10 % improvement in (F/G) when compared with placebo-injected pigs. Increasing the dietary lysine level from 1. 0 to 2. 0 % resulted in a 10 % improvement in F/G for both pST- and placebo-injected pigs. Tenth rib fat depth and average backfat thickness were both reduced in pST-treated pigs compared with placebo-injected pigs...|$|E
40|$|The swine {{industry}} is {{at a crossroads}} that either mayor may not {{change the way we}} produce pork in the future. As we head into the 90 's, we are entering a new era in terms of growth promotion and carcass modification,which will produce overnight what would have taken generations to select for. Of the compounds tested, <b>porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (pST) has the most potential to alter the structure of the swine industry. Many fear the application of this technology because of potential increases in pork production displacing and leading to fewer producers. Because pork quality will be improved tremendously (50 % reduction in fat and 5 to 25 % increase in protein), this will offset the increase in production by increasing demand for lean pork (initial estimates of 4 to 5 %). However, it still {{remains to be seen if}} adoption of this technology will be economically feasible. I believe that the adoption of pST technology will have a beneficial impact on pork production and, as a result, increase the profit potential by approximately $ 8. 00 to $ 16. 00 per head, whether you are finishing five or five thousand pigs per year. Although many questions still remain to be answered, in this paper I will attempt to put together as complete a picture as possible to determine the economic impact of pST on the swine industry...|$|E
40|$|The femur, a rib, {{and third}} phalanx {{of the second}} digit from the front foot were {{collected}} from 108 barrows (initial wt = 125 lb) and analyzed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (pST) and dietary lysine on bone mineralization and mechanical properties. In Exp. 1, pigs were injected daily with 4 mg pST and fed diets containing. 6,. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, or 1. 4 % lysine; 1. 0 % Ca; and. 8 % P. Control pigs (placebo injection) received the. 6 % lysine diet. Bone wall thickness (BWT) of the femur increased but ash content decreased as dietary lysine level increased. Stress values and ash content of the rib also decreased with increasing dietary lysine level. In Exp. 2, pigs were injected with either 4 or 8 mg/d pST and fed diets containing. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, or 1. 4 % lysine; 1. 1 % Ca; and 1. 0 % P. Control pigs received the. 8 % lysine diet. Increasing pST dosage increased BWT of the femur, but decreased ash content. In the rib, increasing pST dosage reduced stress values, modulus of elasticity, and ash content. Increasing lysine level resulted in increased BWT of the femur and decreased ash content of rib, femur and phalanx. These data indicate that pST administration in conjunction with increasing lysine levels decreases bone mineralization but increases BWT of finishing pigs...|$|E
40|$|Eighty {{crossbred}} barrows initially weighing 70. 5 lb {{were used}} in a 5 wk trial to determine the optimum dosage of <b>porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (PST) required to promote maximum growth response in growing pigs fed diets containing either 1. 0 or 2. 0 % lysine. Pigs received a daily injection of placebo or 2, 4, or 8 mg pST in combination with one of two experimental diets containing either 1. 0 or 2. 0 % dietary lysine. Increasing the dosage of pST of pigs fed both diets resulted {{in an increase in}} average daily gain (ADG), a reduction in average daily feed intake (ADFI), and an improvement in feed conversion (F/G). Average backfat, calculated from ultrasonic measurements at the first rib, last rib, and last lumbar vertebra, was reduced in pigs fed both diets as pST dosage increased. Serum pST increased and urea nitrogen decreased for pigs fed both diets as pST dosage increased. The improvement in ADG and F/G of pigs fed both diets was quadratic, indicating that a plateau was achieved between 4 and 8 mg/d pST administration. The serum urea nitrogen response appeared to plateau near 8 mg/d. The combination of these response criteria indicates that the dosage required for maximum response is about 7 mg/d pST, whereas the more optimum level of pST administration may be about 5 mg/d for growing pigs fed diets containing 1. 0 or 2. 0 % lysine...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the effect of recombinant <b>porcine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> (PST) and genetic selection on performance, carcase and meat quality traits of entire male and female pigs grown from 50 kg to 90 kg liveweight and fed ad libitum. Pigs of each sex were drawn from a selected and an unselected control line of common genetic origin and subjected to daily intramuscular injections of either 90 g PST or saline per kg body weight. The selected line had undergone a period of selection for low backfat (P 2) depth and high growth rate. The effects of PST and selection were additive for all traits. For performance traits, growth rate was increased 17 % by PST and 22 % by selection, food conversion ratio was reduced 20 % by PST and 14 % by selection. For carcase traits P 2 fat depth was reduced 15 % by PST and 14 % by selection. Both PST and selection caused a 1. 3 % reduction in killing out. For chemical composition of soft tissue, fat was reduced 9. 1 % by PST and 2. 4 % by selection, water was increased 6. 9 % by PST and 2. 2 % by selection, and protein was increased 2. 1 % by PST. For lean quality traits, PST had the slightly adverse effect of increasing paleness, cooking loss and firmness of certain muscles, particularly in males, but selection had no adverse effect. The changes brought about by PST could be accounted for by the repartitioning of metabolisable energy away from fat and toward protein whereas both repartitioning and increased appetite accounted for the effects of selection...|$|E
