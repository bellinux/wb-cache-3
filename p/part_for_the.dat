5|$|The United States trade dollar was {{a dollar}} coin minted by the United States Mint {{to compete with}} other large silver trade coins that were already popular in East Asia.

5|$|A {{system of}} hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records {{dating back to}} 1837. This program {{consisted}} of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares. Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England. Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same. In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American stud book was published in 1882. In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded {{to compete with the}} Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were responsible in large <b>part</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale.|$|E
