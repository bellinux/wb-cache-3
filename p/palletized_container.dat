5000|$|In 1968, Braniff {{was flying}} Boeing 727-100QC ("Quick Change") jetliners in a {{configuration}} that facilitated the transportation of <b>palletized</b> freight <b>containers</b> {{as well as}} 51 passengers in an all economy class cabin in scheduled airline operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{mines in}} SPMB {{are stored in}} <b>palletized</b> <b>containers</b> housed inside the vehicle. A burying {{mechanism}} is installed at {{the stern of the}} vehicle. The commander can select the type of mine from a panel and it moves on a conveyor belt. An arming device arms the mines before it is buried in the ground. The system carry around 480 mines and can bury 240 mines in an hour.The SPMB can lay four types of anti-tank mines such as ND MK-1, Indian magnetic influence mine Adrushy mine MK-I, Adrushy mine-II and French electrically fuzed HPD F2. The prototype of the system has been developed and as of 2009 it was in trials.|$|R

The packing plant has an annual capacity of 700 Metric Tons and includes container tilting platform, FFS bagging equipment to fully automate bagging and <b>palletizing</b> services. The <b>container</b> terminal also has 2.5 million square foot of storage space for petrochemicals, polymer and other commodities.|$|R
50|$|Seatrain Puerto Rico was {{the first}} of the heavy sea-lift ships {{completed}} in 1966, followed by Seatrain Carolina, Seatrain Florida, Seatrain Maryland, Seatrain Maine, Seatrain Washington and Seatrain Ohio in 1967. The ships were equipped with two cranes for self-loading and unloading and could carry general bulk and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal <b>containers,</b> and vehicles. The lower and main decks also had embedded rails to allow for carrying railcars, although there is no evidence that any of the ships were ever employed as railcar carriers per se, except for transporting some narrow-gauge rolling stock to Vietnam, in which case the standard-gauge rails could not be used. Elevated spar decks provided additional carrying space for vehicles, aircraft and containers.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Hudson Waterways Corporation on 3 May 1966 and renamed Seatrain Florida. She was {{subsequently}} lengthened using part of the mid section of another T2 tanker, the Fruitvale Hills, and rebuilt by Newport News Shipbuilding into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general bulk and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal <b>containers,</b> vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in March 1967 Seatrain Florida, IMO 6119807, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship {{was transferred to the}} National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) in October 1974 and on August 8, 1978 her name was changed to just Florida. The ship was retired and broken up in 1986.|$|R

Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in January 1967 Seatrain Puerto Rico, IMO 6700468, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship {{was transferred to the}} National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) on December 19, 1974 and on May 27, 1977 her name was changed to just Puerto Rico.

50|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Hudson Waterways Corporation on 26 March 1966 and was renamed Seatrain Carolina on 7 April 1966. She was {{subsequently}} lengthened using part of the midsection of another T2 tanker, the Fruitvale Hills, and rebuilt by Newport News Shipbuilding into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general bulk and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal <b>containers,</b> vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in February 1967 Seatrain Carolina, IMO 6700456, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship {{was transferred to the}} National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) in 1974 and on August 8, 1978 her name was changed to just Carolina. The ship was retired and broken up in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Hudson Waterways Corporation on November 10, 1966 and renamed Seatrain Washington. She was {{subsequently}} lengthened using sections of two other T2 tankers, the Tomahawk and Mission San Jose, and rebuilt by Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general bulk and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal <b>containers,</b> vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in 1967 Seatrain Washington, IMO 6704488, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship {{was transferred to the}} National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) in August 1975 and on May 27, 1977 her name was changed to just Washington. The ship was retired and broken up in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} sold to Transwestern Associates on 16 May 1966 for {{conversion}} to a bulk carrier, but was instead resold that September to the Hudson Waterways Corporation and renamed Seatrain Maryland. She was subsequently lengthened using the forward and midsection of another T2 tanker, the San Jacinto, and rebuilt by Newport News Shipbuilding into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general bulk and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal <b>containers,</b> vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in April 1967 Seatrain Maryland, IMO 6709153, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship {{was transferred to the}} National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) in December 1974 and on August 8, 1978 her name was changed to just Maryland.

50|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Hudson Waterways Corporation on July 16, 1966 and renamed Seatrain Maine. She was {{subsequently}} lengthened using sections of two other T2 tankers, the Mission San Jose and Mission San Diego, and rebuilt by Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general bulk and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal <b>containers,</b> vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in 1967 Seatrain Maine, IMO 6709804, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam.

Still at Beaumont as of 2010, her ultimate disposition is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{transparency}} {{of material and}} product flows in warehouses will necessitate real-time determination of the properties of logistical units (e. g. small bins, parcels, <b>palletized</b> goods, intermodal <b>containers).</b> The key properties of logistical units are their unique identifiers and locations at a given time. Other properties such as dimensions, weight or temperature may also be relevant, depending on the use case. This paper presents a pallet monitoring system that determines the characteristics of pallets, namely storage location, storage time, dimensions and appearance. Technically, this is done by combining the MarLO vehicle positioning system that employs passive planar markers, an RFID identification system, a dimensioning system that employs depth sensors and a load change detection system mounted on vehicles. The proposed approach was developed and evaluated in a real world test bed. This enabled us to transfer the subsystems' accuracy to our new pallet monitoring system, i. e. we achieved a pallet positioning accuracy of up to 10 cm, a pallet dimensioning accuracy of up to 5 cm in each dimension and highly accurate pallet identification. By fusing the data from these subsystems, {{we were able to}} generate the aforementioned pallet information for subsequent monitoring and control of warehouse operations in real-time...|$|R
