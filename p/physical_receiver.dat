40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{the process}} of injecting high-pressure fluids into a reservoir to induce fractures and thus improve reservoir productivity. Microseismic event localization is used to locate created fractures. Traditionally, events are localized individually. Available information about events already localized is not used to help estimate other source locations. Traditional localization methods yield an uncertainty that is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of receivers. However, in applications where multiple fractures are created, multiple sources in a reference fracture may provide redundant information about unknown events in subsequent fractures that can boost the signal-to-noise ratio, improving estimates of the event positions. We propose to use sources in fractures closer to the monitoring well to help localize events further away. It is known through seismic interferometry that with a 2 D array of receivers, the travel time between two sources may be recovered from a cross-correlogram of two common source gathers. This allows an event in the second fracture to be localized relative to an event in the reference fracture. A difficulty arises when receivers are located in a single monitoring well. When the receiver array is 1 D, classical interferometry cannot be directly employed because the problem becomes underdetermined. In our approach, interferometry is used to partially redatum microseismic events from the second fracture onto the reference fracture {{so that they can be}} used as virtual receivers, providing additional information complementary to that provided by the <b>physical</b> <b>receivers.</b> Our error analysis shows that, in addition to the gain obtained by having multiple <b>physical</b> <b>receivers,</b> the location uncertainty is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of sources in the reference fracture. Since the number of microseism sources is usually high, the proposed method will usually result in more accurate location estimates as compared to the traditional methods.

40|$|A virtual {{acoustic}} source inside a medium {{can be created}} by emitting a time-reversed point-source response from the enclosing boundary into the medium. However, in many practical situations, like in non-destructive testing, near-field acoustic holography or geophysical holography, the medium can be accessed from one side only.

30|$|The {{history of}} {{synthetic}} aperture radar dates back to 1951 when Carl Wiley of Goodyear postulated the Doppler beam-sharpening concept [6], but unclassified SAR papers only appeared in the literature a decade later [7]. The effects of moving targets in a SAR image were first discussed and published by Raney [8] in 1971, twenty years after the conception of SAR. Before the launches of German TerraSAR-X [9], Canadian RADARSAT- 2 [10], and Italian COSMO-SkyMed [11] in 2007 - 2008, spaceborne SARs were only single-aperture systems. Such systems have a very limited GMTI capability due to dominant radar clutter, which prevents slowly moving targets from being detected. The three SAR satellites mentioned above are the first (in the unclassified world) to be equipped with a phased array, programmable antenna, and two <b>physical</b> <b>receiver</b> channels, permitting multiple independent phase centers (or virtual channels) to be synthesized. Although first advertised in [11] as GMTI capable SAR satellites with a few proposed modifications, COSMO Sky-Med have yet to produce their first GMTI results. TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT- 2, on the other hand, have collected numerous GMTI data and {{the results have been}} published in several papers, for example, [12 – 19].|$|E
30|$|The FGAN-FHR {{has adopted}} {{primarily}} the STAP approach to SAR-GMTI for their airborne PAMIR system. A post-Doppler STAP clutter cancellation scheme was implemented, which permits the asymptotic decoupling {{of the different}} Doppler frequency contributions given that the time base is sufficiently long for {{the case of a}} SAR acquisition [20, 26]. A two-stage detection scheme was applied: the predetection and the postdetection. Since the PAMIR is a multifunction, multifrequency X-band (i.e., five sub-bands) radar, the predetection is performed on each sub-band as part of an elaborate CFAR detector [30, 31]. The target radial speed is estimated from the analysis of the Doppler frequency of the received pulses induced by both the target motion and the known platform velocity. The target localization is accomplished via the estimation of the target azimuth direction in the antenna coordinate system using the maximum-likelihood method [31]. For the existing spaceborne SAR-GMTI systems like TerraSAR-X and RADARSAST- 2, equipped with only two <b>physical</b> <b>receiver</b> channels, a similar approach is not very effective, unless a sub-aperture switching (or toggling) scheme is used in order to generate multiple virtual channels. The performance of Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA) approach using such a sub-aperture antenna switching was presented in [32, 33]. We note that similar limitations exist for the ATI method for radial speed estimation and for the DOA-based estimator of the radial speed described in [13] as the Azimuth Displacement Indicator (ADI).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Marchenko {{equation}} {{has since}} long {{been used by}} mathematical physicists {{as a basis for}} 1 -D inverse scattering theory. Recently, Broggini and Snieder (2012) discussed an interesting link between the Marchenko equation and seismic interferometry. They showed that, by using the Marchenko equation, the Green's function between an arbitrary virtual-source position inside the medium and a receiver at the surface can be retrieved from the reflection response measured at the surface of that medium. This constitutes an important step beyond seismic interferometry, because no longer a receiver is needed at the position of the virtual source. We have recently extended this 1 -D approach to three dimensions (Wapenaar et al., 2013). With this method we can retrieve the 3 -D Green’s function between a virtual source inside the medium and receivers at the surface from the reflection response at the surface. The thus recovered Green's function properly contains the internal multiples of the 3 -D inhomogeneous medium. As in the 1 -D case, no <b>physical</b> <b>receiver</b> is required at the position of the virtual source. Apart from the reflection response at the surface, the method requires an estimate of the direct arrivals (including triplications in case of multipathing) between the virtual-source position and the receivers at the surface.

With the development of the itera-tive Marchenko method, one can now use surface data alone to create a virtual source in the subsurface, but an estimate of the direct wavefield from those virtual source positions to the surface is needed, which means an adequately accurate smooth velocity model is nevertherless necessary. We show that when borehole data from a horizontal well is available, one can com-bine the principles of SI and the Marchenko method to formu-late several inversion-based redatuming schemes, such that no prior smooth velocity model is needed at all and that the ex-act forms of retrieving the reflection responses from above and from below can also be obtained. Furthermore, the internal multiples are accounted for using these exact forms. No sur-rounding acquisition geometry is required or multi-component well data is needed. We demonstrate the proposed schemes us-ing a synthetic gas cloud example. We then show the retrieved responses and the migrated images using only a local velocity model. The results show that given the same velocity uncer-tainty, these responses that are redatumed by data produce a better positioned image near the well than a surface seismic image.

40|$|In several articles, Friedrich Kittler {{addresses}} {{the question of}} music and sound {{in the age of}} media. Operating on the intersection between media, art, philology and philosophy, Kittler writes about an "other" music, which was already described by Nietzsche. This music is not concerned with interpretation or subjectivity; instead it is pure data or (media) noise. Whereas Europe’s traditional written music had been based on a form and a code to keep the ‘ever-present surrounding noise’ at a distance, recording media are purely physical: medium instead of art, data instead of meaning, sound instead of music. They offer a ‘language’ for music directly expressed in terms of sound. On the one hand, the traditional listening subject is completely sidetracked in this post-human epoch. He {{is nothing more than a}} <b>physical</b> <b>receiver,</b> or ‘nerve switch board,’ of information, or sound. On the other hand, Kittler suggests, from Wagner (staging a ‘total world of hearing’) up to today’s digital music, the "other music" of the media age restores the connection between language, music and bodies that had been lost since Pythagoras, thus creating a ‘single positive feedback between sounds and the ears of listeners. ’ The article offers a critical close reading of this important, but overlooked aspect of Kittlers work. It constructs a Kittlerian view of music in the age of media, based on the conceptual importance of noise as the technical backdrop of media. It thereby provides the outset of an alternative theoretical trajectory for understanding contemporary, media driven concepts of sound and noise, their relation to the listening subject and the formation of musical - or rather aural - meaning. ...|$|E

Our derivation of the Marchenko equation for the Green’s function retrieval takes into account the free-surface reflections present in the reflection response (previous work considered a response without free-surface multiples). We decompose the Marchenko equation into up- and downgoing fields and solve for these fields iteratively.
