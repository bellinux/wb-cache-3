Besides of functional properties, the environmental and safety requirements have a strong influence on the fluid components selection.

30|$|Lubricant is a {{substance}} (often a liquid) reduces the friction and wear when introduced between two moving surfaces. A lubricant provides a protective film {{which allows for}} two touching surfaces to be separated and thus lessening the friction between them. Hence, in internal combustion engines lubricant is very essential for longer life of the engine. Lubricants are generally composed {{of a majority of}} base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. The types of the lubricant depend upon the types of base oils. The base oils may be mineral (petroleum originated), synthetic (polyalphaolefins, <b>polyalkylene</b> <b>glycols,</b> synthetic esters, silicones etc.) or vegetable (sunflower oil, soybean oil, palm oil etc.). When the base oil is a vegetable oil, then the lubricant is known as biolubricant, in case of synthetic oil it is called synthetic lubricant and when the base oil is mineral or petroleum based then the lubricant is known as mineral lubricant. Most of the lubricants used today are mineral or petroleum based and are a mixture of paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Nowadays, with increasing environmental pollution although it is essential to use vegetable oils as base fluid rather than mineral oil or synthetic ester based oils, but due to the poor oxidative and hydrolytic stability, high temperature sensitivity of tribological behavior, poor cold flow properties and high cost vegetable oils are very limitedly used as base oils for industrial lubricants [1, 2]. So, the petroleum-based fluids are still now dominated in the lubricant market due to its ease availability and lower cost.|$|R
40|$|The internationally {{accepted}} Wolfson Heat Treatment Centre Engineering Group {{test was}} used to evaluate the cooling characteristics of the most popular commercial polymer quenchants: <b>polyalkylene</b> <b>glycols,</b> polyvinylpyrrolidones and polyacrylates. Prototype solutions containing poly(ethyloxazoline) were also examined. Each class of polymer was capable of providing a wide range of cooling rates depending on the product formulation, concentration, temperature, agitation, ageing and contamination. Cooling rates for synthetic quenchants were generally intermediate between those of water and oil. Control techniques, drag-out losses and response to quenching in terms of hardness and residual stress for a plain carbon steel, were also considered. A laboratory scale method for providing a controllable level of forced convection was developed. Test reproducibility was improved by positioning the preheated Wolfson probe 25 mm above the geometric centre of a 25 mm diameter orifice through which the quenchant was pumped at a velocity of 0. 5 m/s. On examination, all polymer quenchants were found to operate by the same fundamental mechanism associated with their viscosity and ability to form an insulating polymer-rich-film. The nature of this film, which formed at the vapour/liquid interface during boiling, was dependent on the polymer's solubility characteristics. High molecular weight polymers and high concentration solutions produced thicker, more stable insulating films. Agitation produced thinner more uniform films. Higher molecular weight polymers were more susceptible to degradation, and increased cooling rates, with usage. Polyvinylpyrrolidones can be cross-linked resulting in erratic performance, whilst the anionic character of polyacrylates can lead to control problems. Volatile contaminants tend to decrease the rate of cooling and salts to increase it. Drag-out increases upon raising the molecular weight of the polymer and its solution viscosity. Kinematic viscosity measurements are more effective than refractometer readings for concentration control, although a quench test is the most satisfactory process control method...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} surface modification of porosified silicon (pSi) structures with <b>poly(alkylene)</b> <b>glycols</b> {{for the purpose}} of controlled degradation of the silicon matrix and tailored release of encapsulated substances for biomedical applications. The pSi structures are currently used in diverse biomedical applications including bio-molecular screening, optical bio-sensoring, and drug delivery by means of injectable/orally administered carriers and implantable devices. The size of the pores and the surface chemistry of the pSi structure can be controlled during the microfabrication process and thereafter. A fine regulation of the degradation kinetics of mesoporous silicon structures is of fundamental importance. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) represent the major category of surface modifying agents used in classical drug delivery systems and in pharmaceutical dosage forms. PEGylation enables avoidance of RES uptake, thus prolonging circulation time of intravenously injectable nanovectors. PEG molecules demonstrate little toxicity and immunogenicity, and are cleared from the body through the urine (molecular weight, MW less than 30 kDa) or in the feces (MW greater than 30 kDa). The invention focuses on the possibility of finely tuning the degradation kinetics of the pSi nanovectors and other structures through surface conjugation of PEGs with various backbone lengths/MWs. To prove the concept, pSi nanovectors were covalently conjugated to seven PEGs with MW from 245 to 5, 000 Da and their degradation kinetics in physiologically relevant media (phosphate buffer saline, PBS pH 7. 4, and fetal bovine serum) was assessed by the elemental analysis of the Si using inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The conjugation of the PEG with lowest MW to the nanovectors surface did not induce any change in the degradation kinetics in serum, but inhibited degradation and consequently the release of orthosilicic acid into buffer. When PEGs with the longer chains were evaluated, Si mass loss from the nanovectors was slowed down, and the PEGylated structures were almost fully degraded within 18 24 hours in serum and within 48 hours in PBS. The most dramatic effect was observed for high MW PEGs 3, 400 and 5, 000 Da, which prominently inhibited the degradation of the systems, with complete degradation achieved only after four days. For these PEGs, during {{the early stages of the}} degradation, there was a lag period of little or no Si mass loss from the nanovector. The obtained profiles were in agreement with the erosion of the nanovector surface as observed by scanning electron microscopy...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{dissolved}} in <b>polyalkylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and polyolester oils on the tribological behavior of two material contact pairs in three test environments is evaluated. The material contact pairs are M 2 tool steel against 390 aluminum and M 2 tool steel against gray cast iron. The three oils are a <b>polyalkylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (PAG) and two polyolester (PEl and PE 2) oils. The test environments are R 134 a, air and argon. The tests are {{conducted in a}} specially designed high pressure tribometer which provides an accurate control of the test variables. The {{results indicate that the}} P AG oil performed better than the esters for both material contact pairs. The wear on the aluminum plates for the tests conducted with the P AG oil in all three environments is greatest at the lowest moisture content levels. From the stand point of friction and wear, it is beneficial to have a water content level of 5000 ppm or greater in the PAG oil when the plate material is 390 aluminum. The wear on the cast iron plates, when using a PAG oil as the lubricant showed a slight increase with water content in a R 134 a environment. This trend is opposite when air is the test environment. Both ester oils lubricated aluminum much better than the cast iron. The difference in the amount of wear can be as high as two orders of magnitude. This is probably due to the ability of the esters to form bidentate bonds with aluminum. Esters do not form such bonds with iron. The plate wear is greater for the PEl tests than for the PE 2 tests for both material contact pairs. This is most likely due to the difference in the viscosity of the oils. In PE 2 oil, water does not seem to affect the friction and wear of both aluminum/steel and cast iron/steel contacts when R 134 a is the test environment. On the contrary, for the aluminum/steel contacts, the water content significantly influences wear when argon or air is the test environment. For the cast iron/steel contacts, the wear is strongly influenced by the water content when the test is conducted in argon, but it is not influenced by the water content when the test is conducted in air.

40|$|Particulate matter emitted to the {{atmosphere}} due to motor vehicles arises from several sources in addition to tailpipe exhaust. In this study, the organic constituents present in fine particulate (d_p ≤ 2. 0 µm) road dust, brake lining wear particles, and tire tread debris (not size segregated) are analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The objective is to characterize such traffic-related sources on an organic compound basis and to search for molecular markers that will assist the identification of traffic-associated dusts in the urban atmosphere. More than 100 organic compounds are quantified in these samples, including n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenoic acids, n-alkanals, n-alkanols, benzoic acids, benzaldehydes, <b>polyalkylene</b> <b>glycol</b> ethers, PAH, oxy-PAH, steranes, hopanes, natural resins and other compound classes. Paved road dust acts as a repository for vehicle-related particles, which can then be resuspended by the passing traffic. To evaluate the contributions from major urban sources to the road dust complex, source profiles representing different types of vehicle exhaust, brake dust, tire debris, and vegetative detritus are compared, and their fractional contributions are estimated using several groups of organic tracer compounds. Likewise, the close relationship between airborne fine particulate organic constituents and road dust organic matter is discussed...|$|E
40|$|New {{types of}} hydrogels were {{prepared}} by the radical copolymerization of 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, itaconic acid and four different <b>poly(alkylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> (meth) acrylate components (Bisomers) in a water/ethanol mixture as solvent. The polymers swell in water at 25 °C to yield homogeneous transparent hydrogels. All the hydrogels displayed pH sensitive behavior in buffers of the pH range from 2. 20 to 7. 40, under conditions {{similar to those of}} biological fluids. The presence of these two comonomers, which were added to HEMA, increased the swelling degree of the hydrogels and gave gels with better elasticity. The hydrogels were thermally stable {{in the vicinity of the}} physiological temperature (37 °C). The copolymer containing pure poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate units generally had the best properties. The tests performed on the hydrogels confirmed that they were neither hemolytic nor cytotoxic. The copolymer samples showed better cell viability and less hemolytic activity than the PHEMA sample, confirming the assumption that poly(alkylene glycols) improve the biocompatibility of hydrogels. Due to their swelling and mechanical characteristics, as well as the very good biocompatibility and bioadhesive properties, poly(Bisomer/HEMA/IA) hydrogels are promising for utilization in the field of biomedicals, especially for the controlled release of drugs...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{numerical}} solution of Hill's variational principles is presented for {{the estimation of}} {{upper and lower bounds}} to the drag coefficient correction function necessary for the determination of terminal velocity of spherical particles falling in purely viscous fluids obeying the four-parameter Allen-Uhlherr viscosity model. The calculated data of the drag coeficient correction functions are compared with the available experimental data. In the experiments, terminal falling velocities of spheres in aqueous solutions of <b>polyalkylene</b> <b>glycol</b> Emkarox HV 45 with small addition (0. 06. and 0. 08 % wt) of polyacrylamide Praestol 2935 were measured. At the same time, viscosity function measurements and oscillation dynamic tests of liquids were performed using rheometer RS 150 (Haake). It was found that due to the liquid elasticity the experimental values Xexp of the drag coefficient correction function are beyond the calculated interval of upper and lower bounds and are higher than the upper bounds Xu However, terminal velocities of spheres falling in fluids of the similar type as the test ones can be roughly estimated using the upper bound Xufor determination of a sphere drag coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose {{equations}} for the diffusion of drugs for investigated drug/hydrogel systems using the parameters affecting the transport of drug through poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate/itaconic acid) (P(HEMA/IA)), poly(2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate/itaconic acid) (P(HEA/IA)), and poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate/poly(alkylene glycol) (meth) acrylates) (P(HEMA/BIS)) copolymeric hydrogels. Different monomer types, as well as the variable content of some components in hydrogel composition (the amount of ionizable comonomer (IA) and different type of nonionic <b>poly(alkylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> (meth) acrylates), ultimately defined the pore size available for drug diffusion. The hydrogels synthesized ranged from nonporous to microporous, based on the classification in accordance to the pore size, and could be classified as hydrogels that contain ionic groups and hydrogels without ionic groups. The drugs selected for this study are bronchodilators-theophylline (TPH), fenethylline hydrochloride (FE), and antibiotic-cephalexin (CEX). Results of in vitro drug release tests defined the release systems based on the drug type, as well as the type of hydrogel used. The diffusion coefficient of drugs and the restriction coefficient,, defined as the ratio of solute to ‘pore’ radius (rs/rζ) that describes the ease of drug release from the gels, were used as factors that govern the release process...|$|E
