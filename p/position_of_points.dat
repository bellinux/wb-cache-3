The base of the object meets the plane where the object stands, while the tip of the object is [...] "projected" [...] to a more distant point on the plane. Two projections, one for each eye, are made to produce a pair of images suitable for any dual-image form of stereoscopy (usually anaglyph imaging viewed through colored filter glasses).
