25|$|Because of {{the strong}} {{empirical}} support for special relativity, any modifications to it must necessarily be quite subtle and difficult to measure. The best-known attempt is doubly special relativity, which posits that the <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> is also the same in all reference frames, and {{is associated with the}} work of Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and João Magueijo.|$|E
25|$|Quantum gravity {{effects are}} {{notoriously}} {{difficult to measure}} because the <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> is so incredibly small. However recently physicists have started {{to consider the possibility}} of measuring quantum gravity effects mostly from astrophysical observations and gravitational wave detectors.The energy of those fluctuations at scales this small cause space-perturbations which are visible at higher scales.|$|E
2500|$|Later in his career, Persinger and {{his lifelong}} {{colleague}} Stanley Koren quantitatively, through calculations, explored the non-traditional {{relationships between the}} smallest and largest increments of space and time. [...] For example, the time required for the Universe to expand one <b>Planck’s</b> <b>length</b> was <b>Planck’s</b> time and the time for <b>Planck’s</b> <b>length</b> to expand one <b>Planck’s</b> <b>length</b> was {{the age of the}} Universe. [...] This duration for a proton was about 3 ms which considered the optimal point duration for interactive magnetic fields. Dark matter and energy were considered matter and energy yet to occur before the final epoch. Persinger has authored several publications in physical cosmology relating gravity and light to universal constants. Three different approaches solved for a velocity associated with entanglement of 1023 meters per second which predicted that excess correlation could show a discrete latency. Because the product of this velocity, the speed of light, and upper-boundary for the rest mass of a photon resulted in 10−20 J, Persinger has hypothesized that photons could have both local and non-local effects.|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebral}} {{processes of}} observation and measurement {{are associated with}} the action potential whose energy of about 10 - 20 J matches the magnitude associated with electric forces between ions on the neuronal membrane's surface. Both intrinsic gravitational forces and the density of force within the domain of <b>Planck's</b> <b>length</b> indicate the width of a membrane is resonant with all space within the universe. The required disparities near the velocity of light to explain the discrepancy between the Compton (wavelength) width and the classical width of the electron is about 10 - 20 J. The calculations and their resultant hypotheses in this paper suggest that human thought, as the wave form associated with action potentials, might affect matter and that the act of observation might dissociate fundamental forces anywhere and anytime within the universe due to entanglement because of the paradoxical time of expansion of <b>Planck's</b> <b>length</b> from the smallest to largest increments of space...|$|R

25|$|Whether objects {{heavier than}} the Planck mass (about {{the weight of a}} large bacterium) have a de Broglie {{wavelength}} is theoretically unclear and experimentally unreachable; above the Planck mass a particle's Compton wavelength would be smaller than the <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> and its own Schwarzschild radius, a scale at which current theories of physics may break down or need to be replaced by more general ones.|$|E
25|$|The quantum {{fluctuations}} at {{that tiny}} point, in Hawking's original calculation, contain all the outgoing radiation. The modes that eventually contain the outgoing radiation at long times are redshifted {{by such a}} huge amount by their long sojourn next to the event horizon, that they start off as modes with a wavelength much shorter than the <b>Planck</b> <b>length.</b> Since {{the laws of physics}} at such short distances are unknown, some find Hawking's original calculation unconvincing.|$|E
25|$|LQG is {{formally}} background independent. The equations of LQG are not embedded in, or dependent on, {{space and}} time (except for its invariant topology). Instead, {{they are expected to}} give rise to {{space and time}} at distances which are large compared to the <b>Planck</b> <b>length.</b> The issue of background independence in LQG still has some unresolved subtleties. For example, some derivations require a fixed choice of the topology, while any consistent quantum theory of gravity should include topology change as a dynamical process.|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the total mass of a spacetime in which an observer-independent scale of length exist is possible {{through the use of}} Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle. In the following paragraphs we show that such a spacetime has a total mass equal to the mass of our Universe observed by the WMAP Nasa spacecraft if the cited observer-independent scale of length is determined by the <b>Planck’s</b> <b>length</b> lp. This result gives new strength to fundamental theories that make use of lp as a length with a “special role”, like the various string theories...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the quantum {{universe}} emerging from a nonperturbative, Lorentzian sum-over-geometries can be described with high accuracy by a four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. By a scaling analysis involving Newton's constant, we establish that the linear size of the quantum universes under study is in between 17 and 28 <b>Planck</b> <b>lengths.</b> Somewhat surprisingly, the measured quantum fluctuations around the de Sitter universe in this regime are to good approximation still describable semiclassically.

The conformal symmetry is maintained in the L-BLG by considering general space-time varying solutions to the constraint equations.

25|$|Penrose {{determined}} {{wave function}} collapse {{was the only}} possible physical basis for a non-computable process. Dissatisfied with its randomness, Penrose proposed {{a new form of}} wave function collapse that occurred in isolation and called it objective reduction. He suggested each quantum superposition has its own piece of spacetime curvature and that when these become separated by more than one <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> they become unstable and collapse. Penrose suggested that objective reduction represented neither randomness nor algorithmic processing but instead a non-computable influence in spacetime geometry from which mathematical understanding and, by later extension, consciousness derived.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} after the {{discovery}} of general relativity, it was realized that general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics. It is possible to describe gravity {{in the framework of}} quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces, such that the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, {{in the same way as}} the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons. This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit. However, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the <b>Planck</b> <b>length,</b> where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is required.|$|E
25|$|Several {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of general relativity it was realized that it cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. Later it was understood {{that it is possible}} to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces. In this framework the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons. This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit, but only at the linearized level and postulating that the conditions for the applicability of Ehrenfest theorem holds, which is not always the case. Besides, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the <b>Planck</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Whereas {{the event}} horizon of a classic black hole {{is thought to be}} very well defined and distinct, Mathur and Lunin further {{calculated}} that {{the event horizon}} of a fuzzball would, at an extremely small scale (likely on the order of a few <b>Planck</b> <b>lengths),</b> be very much like a mist: fuzzy, hence the name “fuzzball.” They also found that the physical surface of the fuzzball would have a radius equal to that of the event horizon of a classic black hole; for both, the Schwarzschild radius for a median-size stellar-mass black hole of 6.8 solar masses (...) is 20 kilometers.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generalized}} Einstein-Planck relation for photons which is invariant under the change l/alP to alP/l, l being the photon wavelength, lP <b>Planck’s</b> <b>length,</b> and a a numerical constant. This yields a wavelength-dependent {{speed of light}} v(l) = c/(1 +a^ 2 (lP/l) ^ 2), with c the usual speed of light in vacuo, indicating that {{the speed of light}} should decrease for sufficiently short wavelengths. We discuss the conceptual differences with the previous proposals related to a possible decrease of the speed of light for very short wavelengths based on quantum fluctuations of the space-time, as well as its consequences on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle up to second order in lP...|$|R
40|$|We {{will apply}} the quantum {{inequality}} type restrictions to Alcubierre’s warp drive metric {{on a scale}} in which a local region of spacetime can be considered “flat”. These are inequalities that restrict the magnitude and extent of the negative energy which is needed to form the warp drive metric. From this {{we are able to}} place limits on the parameters of the “Warp Bubble”. It will be shown that the bubble wall thickness is on the order of only a few hundred <b>Planck</b> <b>lengths.</b> Then we will show that the total integrated energy density needed to maintain the warp metric with such thin walls is physically unattainable...|$|R
25|$|The {{speed of}} light is a {{dimensional}} quantity and so, as has been emphasized in this context by João Magueijo, it cannot be measured. Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when {{the height of a}} mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional SI system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely distance, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. These units are defined to be independent and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as Newton's constant, the {{speed of light}} and Planck's constant; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another. By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the Planck time, <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> and Planck energy which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as Planck units.|$|E
500|$|Another {{reason for}} {{the speed of light}} to vary with its {{frequency}} would be the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as predicted by some proposed theories of quantum gravity. In 2009, the observation of the spectrum of gamma-ray burst GRB090510 did not find any difference in the speeds of photons of different energies, confirming that Lorentz invariance is verified at least down to the scale of the <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> (lP=≈ [...] ) divided by 1.2.|$|E

It should be noted however that these are only mathematical constructs since {{there must be some}} practical limit to how small a length can get. If the Stoney length is the minimum length then either a body's electromagnetic radius or its half gravitational radius is a physical impossibility, since one of these must be smaller than the Stoney length. If <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> is the minimum then either a body's reduced Compton wavelength or its half gravitational radius is a physical impossibility since one of these must be smaller than the <b>Planck</b> <b>length.</b> Moreover, the Stoney length and <b>Planck</b> <b>length</b> cannot both be the minimum length.|$|E

We translate this break into the lowest limit on the mass of a classical black hole. In D= 4, using the electron's mass, this requires the black hole to be heavier than 10 ^{ 14 } kg.
