50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (<b>plug)</b> <b>tap</b> to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a blind hole, the intermediate (<b>plug)</b> <b>tap</b> will be used to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a blind hole, the taper tap will be followed by an intermediate (<b>plug)</b> <b>tap</b> and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of power driven tap is the [...] "spiral point" [...] <b>plug</b> <b>tap,</b> whose cutting edges are {{angularly}} displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the spiral point <b>plug</b> <b>tap</b> is the spiral flute tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. Spiral flute taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in blind holes.|$|E
50|$|Taper tap: The small tap {{illustrated}} at {{the bottom}} of the image is similar to an intermediate tap but has a more pronounced taper to the cutting edges. This feature gives the taper tap a very gradual cutting action that is less aggressive than that of the <b>plug</b> <b>tap.</b> The number of tapered threads typically ranges from 8 to 10. A taper tap is most often used when the material to be tapped is difficult to work (e.g., alloy steel) or the tap is of a very small diameter and thus prone to breakage.|$|E
5000|$|Intermediate tap, second <b>tap,</b> or <b>plug</b> tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the middle of}} the image has tapered cutting edges, which assist in aligning and starting the tap into an untapped hole. The number of tapered threads typically ranges from 3 to 5. <b>Plug</b> <b>taps</b> are the most commonly used type of tap. In the US, they are commonly known as <b>plug</b> <b>taps,</b> whereas in Australia and Britain they are commonly known as second taps.|$|R
5000|$|Bottoming <b>tap</b> or <b>plug</b> tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the top of}} the image has a continuous cutting edge with almost no taper — between 1 and 1.5 threads of taper is typical. [...] This feature enables a bottoming tap to cut threads to the bottom of a blind hole. A bottoming tap is usually used to cut threads in a hole that has already been partially threaded using one of the more tapered types of tap; the tapered end ("tap chamfer") of a bottoming tap is too short to successfully start into an unthreaded hole. In the US, they are commonly known as bottoming taps, but in Australia and Britain they are also known as <b>plug</b> <b>taps.</b>|$|R

30|$|AVFs {{following}} gestational choriocarcinoma, {{treated with}} embolization (Alturkistani et al., 2016) or conservatively (Kim et al., 2013), were previously described. In the present case, {{a young woman}} symptomatic for metrorrhagia but without chest pain or dyspnea was admitted to our institute. Contrast-enhanced MDCT showed a metastatic choriocarcinoma (confined to the lung) and a giant AVF conditioning not only metrorrhagia but also pulmonary embolism, with diagnostic angiographic evidence of multiple thrombi within the right gonadal vein. Hence the choice to perform a simultaneous transarterial and transvenous embolization. Different embolic agents were used to embolize distal branches of hypogastric arteries obtaining a progressive reduction of AVF in-flow: PVA particles were mainly used for the nidus (Sheth et al., 2017), while coils (Edward Garrett Jr & Mack, 2017) and Squid (Akmangit et al., 2014) for the AVF feeding branches. As Onyx, Squid is an EVOH-based liquid embolic agent well known in cerebral field until now less used in abdominal district. Differently from Onyx, Squid is also available in the new formulation Squid- 12, used in our case and characterized by lower density and viscosity, able to improve vascular penetration and distal distribution compared to formulation Onyx- and Squid- 18. Then using a right transjugular approach, an Amplatzer <b>plug</b> (<b>Tapping</b> et al., 2011) was placed at {{the confluence of the}} right gonadal vein in the vena cava not only to reduce AVF out-flow but also to definitively occlude the right gonadal vein to avoid further episodes of pulmonary embolism. The choice to prefer a jugular approach instead of transfemoral to place the plug was due to the more favourable angle. The decision for a venous plug to prevent embolization and ensure a stable protection was made during the procedure considering the detection at phlebography of multiple thrombi in the right gonadal vein. As alternative to plug, the placement of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in supra-renal position was not considered for the following reasons: small thrombus could pass through the filter legs, retrievable inferior vena cava filters, particularly in supra-renal position, can give complications (Venturini et al., 2015) and finally plug occluding the vein was able not only to avoid further episodes of pulmonary embolism but also to stop AVF out-flow. Despite the simultaneous transarterial and transvenous approach combined with the multiple embolic agents used, the large size of the AVF doesn’t allow its occlusion in a single procedure. However a significant shrinkage sufficient to ensure metrorrhagia resolution was obtained. Definitive AVF occlusion was achieved 6  months later due to a second transarterial embolization procedure combined with the progressive efficient action of systemic chemotherapy.|$|R
40|$|Unexpected {{discharge}} of blast {{gas in the}} early stages of casting from a blast furnace has a significant impact on the furnace operations, resulting in premature <b>plugging</b> of the <b>tap</b> hole and consequently poorer stability, productivity and overall efficiency of the furnace. A physical modelling study has been carried out to understand the mechanism of the gas/slag interface instability during hearth drainage using a Hele-Shaw viscous flow model. Mineral oil and ZnCl₂ aqueous solution were used to simulate molten slag and iron, respectively. The research is aimed at exploring the possibility of viscous fingering being the cause of the premature emission of blast gas from the taphole. The experimental evidence showed that viscous fingering could take place, resulting in the premature release of the blast gas, if the gas/slag interface descending velocity in the region near the taphole is greater than the critical value for viscous finger formation. Viscous fingering is likely to cause the unexpected early blast gas discharge under certain hearth conditions during casting...|$|R
40|$|PVC is {{the most}} common {{insulation}} material used for wiring in low-voltage (LV) service. “Low-voltage, ” {{in the context of this}} paper, is taken to be 120 – 240 VAC. “Wiring ” is taken to include not only insulated wires, cables, or cords, but also the appurtenant termination devices, e. g., male <b>plugs</b> or female <b>taps.</b> Well-known factors leading to the ignition of PVC wiring include: (a) manufacturing defects; (b) grossly excessive current; (c) over-insulation, sometimes augmented by overcurrent; (d) localized heating due to strand breakage; (e) localized heating due to mechani-cal strand severing by staples or nails; and (f) localized heating due to failed terminations. Other failure modes are known but have received only limited study. These include (i) excessive force and creep; (ii) chemical interaction effects; and (iii) breakdown under voltage surge conditions. Additional research is needed in these areas. The proximate cause of ignition involved with many of the above mechanisms is arc tracking (arcing across a carbonized path). In turn, it is shown that PVC is especially susceptible to becoming charred, it requiring only approximately 160 ºC for the material to become semiconducting during short-term exposure (around 10 h), while longer-term exposure (around 1 month) may cause failures at temperatures as low as 110 ºC. Some limited data exist which suggest that standard UL and IEC temperature classifications are unduly optimistic, as applied to PVC. Mains-connected electrical appliances need to be designed to resist 6000 V surge voltages, even though this is not mandated in most of the current UL standards. Data are presented showing that the IEC 60112 wet-tracking test gives especially misleading results for PVC and should be improved or abrogated...|$|R

Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark <b>plugs,</b> <b>tap</b> washers, pump seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.
