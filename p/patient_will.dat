5|$|No {{preparation}} is normally necessary for this examination, {{but if a}} complementary study of abdominal veins is also required, the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> be asked to fast for 12 hours beforehand. The sensitivity and specificity measurements are around 90%.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} on renal biopsy correlate with {{the severity of}} symptoms: those with asymptomatic hematuria may only have focal mesangial proliferation while those with proteinuria may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation. The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important prognostic factor in determining whether the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> develop chronic renal disease.|$|E
5|$|Counselor: Counselors are {{required}} {{as part of}} the core team by Medicare regulations. Typically, the role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve. While not every <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> see a Chaplain on hospice, all hospices {{have to be able to}} provide regular and consistent Chaplain services. The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> {{maintain}} {{a diagnosis of}} undifferentiated connective tissue disease. However, about one third of UCTD <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> differentiate to a specific autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis. About 12 percent of <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> go into remission.|$|R
30|$|Some <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> be {{scheduled}} for PSMA-based radionuclide therapy subsequent to ADT. It remains a central question if these <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> profit from ADT intermission.|$|R
50|$|For partial nerve palsy, {{more than}} 80% of <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> recover {{complete}}ly.For complete nerve palsy, less than 40% of <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> have complete recovery.Peroneal nerve in continuity arises from defined cause will be recovered {{better than those}} arise from unknown causes.|$|R
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E
40|$|FAIRY: a {{randomized}} controlled patient-blind phase III study {{to compare the}} efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose saline (placebo group). <b>Patients</b> <b>will</b> be blinded to the intervention. <b>Patients</b> <b>will</b> undergo evaluation for hemoglobin level, hematology {{and quality of life}} assessment 3 and 12 weeks after randomization...|$|R

25|$|The {{incidence}} of anesthesia awareness is higher {{and has more}} serious sequelae when muscle relaxants or neuromuscular-blocking drugs are used. This is because without relaxant the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> move and the anesthesiologist will deepen the anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The virus {{laboratories}} across Tashkent, and the country's regions have diagnostic {{means to}} timely identify the swine flu. In case of swine flu symptoms the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> be {{isolated in the}} specially reserved rooms of infection clinics.|$|E
25|$|If a {{lymph node}} is positive, {{depending}} {{on the extent of}} lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> be considered for adjuvant therapy.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{recognised}} {{gap between}} treatment guidelines and current practice for chronic care. [...] Individualised treatment plans are critical in treating chronic conditions because <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> place varying important on health outcomes. For example, some <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> fore-go complex, inconvenient medication regimes {{at the expense}} of quality of life.|$|R

50|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the {{prostate}} contains an increased likelihood that <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> experience erectile dysfunction. Nerve-sparing surgery reduces the risk that <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> experience erectile dysfunction. However, the experience and the skill of the nerve-sparing surgeon, {{as well as any}} surgeon are critical determinants of the likelihood of positive erectile function of the patient.|$|R
25|$|The {{contraindications}} for biceps-to-triceps transfer {{relate to}} the muscle balance surrounding the elbow. The m. supinator and m. brachialis function {{is a prerequisite for}} this surgery. If one of these muscles is nonfunctional the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> lose forearm supination and elbow flexion if the tendon is transferred.|$|E
25|$|Class {{prediction}} {{is more difficult}} than class discovery, but it allows one to answer questions of direct clinical significance such as, given this profile, what is the probability that this <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> respond to this drug? This requires many examples of profiles that responded and did not respond, as well as cross-validation techniques to discriminate between them.|$|E
25|$|If the lesions are mild, the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> {{be subject}} to a good deal of pain. If the lesions are severe, the overall quality of life is devastating. The {{impaired}} skin barrier function commonly leads to localized infection, which sepsis and death may follow. The pain from the oral and pharyngeal ulcers interfere with eating, which can compromise nutritional health.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} symptom of esophageal {{dysphagia}} is {{the inability to}} swallow solid food, which the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> describe as 'becoming stuck' or 'held up' before it either passes into the stomach or is regurgitated. Pain on swallowing or odynophagia is a distinctive symptom that can be highly indicative of carcinoma, although it also has numerous other causes that {{are not related to}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{correction}} strategies used while determining the most beneficial patient position and beam structure: on-line and off-line correction. Both serve their purposes in the clinical setting, and have their own merits. Generally, {{a combination of the}} both strategies is employed. Often, a <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> receive corrections to their treatment via on-line strategies during their first radiation session, and physicians make subsequent adjustments off-line during check film rounds.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the quality of}} success {{at the level of}} the {{individual}} may remain open to question. While now more often usefully restored to society, it appears all too common that the individual may be less than faithfully restored to the earlier self. This issue is axiomatically problematic, as a <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> seldom have been psychiatrically profiled prior to contact with medical services, and before-after comparison by the professional is therefore rare.|$|E

25|$|While the {{surgical}} details {{will depend on}} the type of transplant, many steps are common to all these procedures. Before operating on the recipient, the transplant surgeon inspects the donor lung(s) for signs of damage or disease. If the lung or lungs are approved, then the recipient is connected to an IV line and various monitoring equipment, including pulse oximetry. The <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> be given general anesthesia, and a machine will breathe for him or her.|$|E
25|$|During the transplant, a {{radiologist}} uses ultrasound and radiography {{to guide}} placement of a catheter through the upper abdomen {{and into the}} portal vein of the liver. The islets are then infused through the catheter into the liver. The <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> receive a local anesthetic. If a patient cannot tolerate local anesthesia, the surgeon may use general anesthesia and do the transplant through a small incision. Possible risks of the procedure include bleeding or blood clots.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} neglect {{may also be}} very mild—for example, in a {{condition}} called extinction where competition from the ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception of the contralesional stimulus. These patients, when asked to fixate on the examiner's nose, can detect fingers being wiggled on the affected side. If the examiner were to wiggle his or her fingers on both the affected and unaffected sides of the patient, the <b>patient</b> <b>will</b> report seeing movement only on the ipsilesional side.|$|E

30|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>will</b> be {{recruited}} at ICU discharge. After a first screening {{with regard to}} the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and are willing to participate will be included in the study after providing written informed consent. <b>Patients</b> <b>will</b> {{be recruited}} from 17 ICU (15 in the Greater Paris area, 1 in Clermont-Ferrand and 1 in Amiens) and monitored in 10 nephrology centers.|$|R
30|$|A new {{format for}} <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> {{be used to}} deliver both {{treatment}} approaches. Over 4  months, 4 full-day workshop-style group treatments with 4 – 7 <b>patients</b> <b>will</b> be offered by 1 – 2 specially trained therapists under expert supervision. In the past, this format has proven popular among patients, especially when conducted at weekends, since it is more compatible with occupational or educational schedules.|$|R
