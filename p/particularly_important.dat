5|$|A <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> early {{development}} {{was the beginning}} of mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among the Babylonians, who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations. The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These reactions are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> in the oceans. The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce nitrite, which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E

5|$|ATP {{is also a}} {{substrate}} of adenylate cyclase, {{most commonly}} in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> in brain function, although it {{is involved in the}} regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are <b>particularly</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} <b>particularly</b> <b>important.</b> Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> crop in arid, {{semi-desert}} regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
5|$|Djawadi {{said that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the main title music by an early version of the series's computer-animated title sequence. The title music is reprised as a global theme {{in the rest of the}} soundtrack, initially infrequently and as part of the theme of individual characters, then in full towards the end of season 1 during <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> scenes.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands. Ligases are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join {{together}} the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete {{copy of the}} DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.|$|E
25|$|Null congruences {{are also}} <b>important,</b> <b>particularly</b> null {{geodesic}} congruences, {{which can be}} interpreted as a family of freely propagating light rays.|$|R

5|$|Fat-rich plant {{products}} such as nuts and conifer seeds are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> as winter food {{in the north of}} the woodpecker's range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird's energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, berries and tree sap, the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.|$|E
5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. <b>Particularly</b> <b>important</b> was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Listed {{building}} {{status is}} given to buildings (including locks) in the United Kingdom which are designated by English Heritage {{on behalf of the}} government, as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. There are three types of listed status (in descending order of importance and difficulty to obtain planning permission; Grade I: buildings of exceptional interest, Grade II*: <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> buildings of special interest, Grade II: buildings of special interest.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the crucial}} events of the American Revolution {{occurred}} in or near Boston, including the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's midnight ride, the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston, and many others. After the Revolution, Boston's long seafaring tradition helped make {{it one of the}} world's wealthiest international ports, with the slave trade, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being <b>particularly</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|Monitoring of {{the volcano}} and {{predictions}} of large eruptions are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> because of its location in a densely populated area, {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from the volcano. The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where people can take refuge from falling volcanic debris.|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of phase ambiguity and asynchronous data transmission can degrade the system performance severely and {{even make it}} worse than a non-CoMP model [28 – 30]. <b>Particularly,</b> an <b>important</b> phase ambiguity source, not considered by [28 – 30], is phase-noise and frequency offset [31, 32] which makes the synchronization very difficult.|$|R
50|$|Eddie and Sol Zakay {{started their}} {{property}} business in Britain during the 1980s property boom. They later expanded into the U.S. and Middle Eastern markets.

5|$|Natural ice {{typically}} had to {{be moved}} several times between being harvested and used by the end customer. A wide range of methods were used, including wagons, railroads, ships and barges. Ships were <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> to the ice trade, particularly in the early phase of the trade, when {{the focus of the}} trade was on international exports from the U.S. and railroad networks across the country were non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. In brown adipose tissue, regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> {{as a way}} of maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, it was {{announced}} that the pro-Western Boris Tadić won the 2008 Serbian presidential election. The 2008 elections were <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> to Serbia's relations with the United States, as the main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (a reversal from SRS's eurosceptic position), he was being advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates.|$|E
