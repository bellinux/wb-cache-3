40|$|Infiltration of saline {{solutions}} and pure water into homogeneous packs of <b>prewetted</b> and air-dry silica sands was investigated using a light transmission system. Four sand grades and five solutions were considered. Narrow fingers with a sharp, almost sat-urated, wetting front {{were observed in}} the air-dry sands. The water content left behind the fingertip of saline solutions was higher than for pure water, resulting in a greater lateral expansion of the saline fingers over time. The rate of lateral expansion scaled with the square root of time, likely due to classic liquid sorption with the possible addition of water vapor diffusion. At early time, the salty fingers moved faster, but were ultimately overtaken by the pure water fingers. In <b>prewetted</b> sand, the wetting fronts were diffuse and never exceeded 26 % saturation, less than third that seen in the initially air-dry media. The plumes in the <b>prewetted</b> sand were also much wider and their shape varied. In the <b>prewetted</b> sand the elevated surface tension of the saline solutions was the major cause for the observed differences in finger width and velocity, yet appeared to be insignificant in air-dry sand.

40|$|Abstract. In Part II of {{this study}} we {{consider}} two cases of three-phase coexistence. First, the capped capillary may allow for vapour, drop-like, and slab-like phases to coexist at the same values of temperature and chemical potential. Second, the slit pore forming {{the bulk of the}} capped capillary may allow for the coexistence between vapour, planar <b>prewetting</b> film and capillary-liquid. While the consideration of the former case allows us to summarise the phenomenology presented in Part I and to show that the transition line of wedge <b>prewetting</b> is shifted in capillary-like geometries by a constant value, depending on the capillary width, the careful examination of the latter case allows us to uncover a new phase transition in confined fluids, a continuous planar <b>prewetting</b> transition. A planar <b>prewetting</b> transition is known to be a distinctly first-order phenomenon, and typically taking place on the scale of several atomic diameters. A continuous <b>prewetting</b> transition, on the other hand, is scale invariant. Thus, apart from being of fundamental significance, this finding has potential for facilitating experimental detection as well as measurements of planar <b>prewetting.</b> Further, we provide proof for the existence of a tri-critical point of the three-phase coexistence line of the capped capillary while by considering a dynamic model of wetting we show how the relaxation of the system can be pinned by a metastable state.

30|$|Research {{suggests}} that lightweight concrete, {{even if not}} intentionally internally cured using a suitable quantity of <b>prewetted</b> fine lightweight aggregate, can provide substantial advantages over normalweight concrete {{in a number of}} applications, including bridge decks (Vaysburd 1996; Harmon 2005). It has been suggested that these advantages extend beyond reduced self-weight, and include enhanced durability performance associated with reduced permeability and reduced cracking tendency (Delatte et al. 2007 b). Many of these benefits could be linked to the fact that often coarse lightweight aggregates are introduced to the concrete mixture in a <b>prewetted</b> state. The improved contact zone between aggregate and cement paste, internal curing effects, and the reduced modulus of elasticity are touted as possible contributors to the enhanced durability performance of lightweight concrete (Vaysburd 1996; Ramirez et al. 2000; Wolfe 2008 and others). Some research has shown that lightweight concrete can have lower levels of microcracking as well as higher resistance to weathering and corrosion (Reinhardt 2008). Use of lightweight concrete in bridge decks has, however, caused some durability concerns for practitioners. These concerns include reduced resistance to salt scaling and lower abrasion resistance (Ozyildirim 2008).|$|R
40|$|We report several novel {{phenomena}} In contact-line and fingering {{dynamics of}} macroscopic spinning drops and gravity-driven films with dimensions {{larger than the}} capillary length. It is shown through experimental and theoretical analysis that such macroscopic films can exhibit various interfacial shapes, including multi valued ones, near the contact line due to {{a balance between the}} external body forces with capillarity. This rich variety of front shapes couples with the usual capillary, viscous, and intermolecular forces at the contact line to produce a rich and unexpected spectrum of contact-line dynamics. A single finger develops when part of the front becomes multivalued on a partially wetting macroscopic spinning drop in contrast to a different mechanism for microscopic drops of completely wetting fluids. Contrary to general expectation, we observe that, at high viscosity and low frequencies of rotation, the speed of a glycerine finger increases with increasing viscosity.

40|$|Durable {{and long}} lasting {{concrete}} is important, especially for bridge decks, which {{are susceptible to}} premature cracking and corrosion of the reinforcing steel. To increase the durability of the concrete and its service life, many transportation agencies use high-strength concretes. However, high-strength concretes often have problems with early age cracking due to shrinkage. These cracks can then open a path for chloride ions (found in road salts) to reach the reinforcing steel. The results of this research, which compared bridge installations on two structures in Monroe County, Indiana, confirm that internally cured concrete presents a better alternative to traditional plain concrete for durable bridge decks. With internally cured concrete, {{a portion of the}} fine aggregate in the concrete is replaced with the same volume of <b>prewetted</b> lightweight aggregate. As the concrete cures, water from the <b>prewetted</b> aggregate provides the hydration necessary for curing, and also enables curing from the inside.

Damage due to corrosion causes reduction in strength, serviceability, and aesthetics of the structure (Chini et al. 2003), and surface scaling and spalling due to freeze–thaw action is also worsened by presence of cracks (Reinhardt 2008). Therefore, controlling and reducing cracks in concrete bridge decks is paramount to durability performance. The enhanced durability of concrete internally cured using <b>prewetted</b> lightweight fine aggregate has been documented {{by a number of}} research studies (Bentur et al. 2001; Geiker et al. 2004; Hammer et al. 2004; Delatte et al. 2007 b; Bentz and Weiss 2011), {{and a growing number of}} highway agencies are moving towards field implementation of internally cured bridge decks using <b>prewetted</b> lightweight fine aggregates (Streeter 2012; Guthrie and Yaede 2013; [...] Barrett et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2014). However, many existing bridge decks have been constructed utilizing conventional lightweight concrete containing lightweight coarse aggregates, mixtures not specifically designed for internal curing. Therefore, the relative durability performance of these decks, compared to normalweight decks of similar ages and in similar service conditions, is of interest to many highway agencies to aid in prediction of performance over the remaining service life and in budgeting and forecasting for future repair, rehabilitation, and ultimately replacement.|$|R

In light {{of the purpose of}} this study, it is noted that the use of lightweight aggregate will impact each of these five factors, particularly due to the decreased modulus of elasticity, additional curing water from <b>prewetted</b> lightweight aggregates, and potentially higher cement contents utilized to meet strength requirements (Neville 1995).|$|R

The average hydraulic conductivity {{at the end of the}} leaching with the 0. 5 M solution ((K) over bar(0. 5)) Of the two vertisols increased with a decrease in <b>prewetting</b> rate. The effect of <b>prewetting</b> rate was more pronounced in Yizreel, where the high clay content (70. 3 % clay) resulted in a more stable structure. Upon leaching with the 0. 01 M solution, (K) over bar(r 0. 01) first decreased and then increased. This increase in (K) over bar(r 0. 01) was explained by cohesive bond formation, which increased with an increase in soil clay content and,vith increased proximity between the clay particles. High hydraulic gradient enhanced clay to clay contacts, and a steep increase in (K) over bar(r 0. 01).

Results were quantified as apparent contact angles between the sand and three solutions (pure water, 5 molal NaNO₃, and n-hexane). Contact angles determined using a static method in initially air dried sand ranged from 23 ° to 31 °, with the same values found for both water and the NaNO 3 solution.
