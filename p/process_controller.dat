40|$|Abstract Semiconductor {{fabrication}} is {{a manufacturing}} sequence {{with hundreds of}} sophisticated unit operations and it is always challenged by strategy development for ensuring the yield of defect-free products. In this paper, an advanced control strategy through integrating product and process control is established. The proposed multiscale scheme contains three layers for coordinated equipment control, process control and product quality control. In the upper layer, online control performance assessment is applied to reduce the quality variation and maximize the overall product performance (OPP). It serves as supervisory control to update the recipe of the <b>process</b> <b>controller</b> in the middle layer. The <b>process</b> <b>controller</b> is designed as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) run-to-run controller to reject disturbances, such as process shift, drift and tool worn out, that are exerted to the op-eration. The equipment in the process is individually controlled to maintain its optimal operational status and maximize the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), based on the set point given by the <b>process</b> <b>controller.</b> The ef-ficacy of the proposed integrated control scheme is demonstrated through case studies, where both the OPP (for product) and the OEE (for equipment) are enhanced.

40|$|Technological {{innovations}} in soft computing techniques have brought automation capabilities to new levels of applications. Conventional control theory {{is based on}} mathematical models that describe the dynamic behavior of process control systems. Fuzzy logic is a flexible approach to conventional controllers. Conventionally, the plants in an industry are controlled by proportional integral derivative (PID) controller with Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N) method. Fuzzy logic controllers, based on human knowledge, are more flexible than conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers. Very large scale integration techniques can implement fuzzy logic controllers on a very little surface of silicon chips, which are directly interfaced with the sensors and actuators. Due to non-linearities in complex <b>process</b> <b>controllers,</b> the knowledge is difficult to be tuned. The incorporation of intelligent techniques for extracting {{the knowledge of the}} fuzzy controller, through search algorithms provides better optimization of error parameters in <b>process</b> <b>controllers.</b> This paper explores an applicability of fuzzy logic to tackle <b>process</b> <b>controllers.</b> The performance of different <b>process</b> <b>controllers</b> have been analyzed using fuzzy logic approach.

40|$|The {{control of}} material-flow using an {{adjustable}} blank holder force (BHF) enhances part quality and consistency in stamping. Using the punch force as an in-process variable, a <b>process</b> <b>controller</b> can adjust BHF based on tracking a reference punch force. The {{goal of this}} research is to investigate the design and implementation of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) adaptive stamping <b>process</b> <b>controller</b> to improve tracking performance and to improve part quality in the presence of plant variations during the manufacture of stamped parts. All procedures to develop a process model, to parameterize the model using system identification, and to validate experimentally the MIMO process controllers designed through simulation are presented. A MIMO fixed-gain PI <b>process</b> <b>controller</b> can be used to adjust BHF based on tracking of a reference punch force to improve part quality. However, experimental tests with a fixed-gain PI controller required manual controller fine-tuning, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Auto-tuning and model reference adaptive control (MRAC) are investigated not only to eliminate the manual tuning but also to improve part quality, in the presence of process variations. The direct MRAC, whose controller gains are adjusted to accommodate changes in process variations, is presented, including simulation-based robustness analysis of the adaptation law with constrained estimation. In experimental validation with the MRAC <b>process</b> <b>controller,</b> good tracking performance and significant part quality improvement are achieved in the presence of disturbances. However, the direct MRAC filter uses nominal process parameters, and so requires some knowledge of the process. Consequently, an indirect adaptive control (AC), which does not need the nominal process parameters, is also considered. However, due to the simple PI controller selected, the computation of the controller gains from the estimated parameters requires an optimization, which is not amenable to real-time implementation. Hence, the indirect AC is implemented using a look-up table, with controller gains that are pre-computed off-line via optimization. The indirect AC, with a sufficiently high level of discretization in the look-up table, performs well in simulations. However, due to extensive memory requirements, a smaller look-up table is used in the experiments, where it is outperformed by the direct AC...|$|E
