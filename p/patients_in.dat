5|$|In Singapore, {{attempted}} suicide, abetment of suicide, and abetment {{of attempted}} suicide are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> ending their lives.

However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E

5|$|While health {{insurance}} premium costs have moderated, {{some of this}} is because of insurance policies that have a higher deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to <b>patients.</b> <b>In</b> addition, many employees are choosing to combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making the impact of the ACA difficult to determine precisely.|$|E
