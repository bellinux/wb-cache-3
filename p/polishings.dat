Nothing but the action of ice could produce what may be seen in any of our mountains- -whole sheets of rock ground down into rounded flats, irrespective of the lie of the beds, not in valleys, but on the brows and summits of mountains, often ending abruptly at the edge of some sudden cliff, where the true work of water, in the shape of rain and frost, is actually destroying the previous work of ice, and fulfilling the rule laid down (I think by Professor Geikie in his delightful book on Scotch scenery as influenced by its geology), that ice planes down into flats, while water saws out into crags and gullies; and that the rain and frost are even now restoring Scotch scenery to something of that ruggedness and picturesqueness which it must have lost when it lay, like Greenland, under the indiscriminating grinding of a heavy sheet of ice.|$|E

5000|$|He then {{served in}} the Philippines, where he saw and studied {{tropical}} diseases (especially beriberi and scurvy). U.S. Army medical officers were conducting much research into the possible causes of beriberi, initially using animal subjects. Vedder became convinced {{by the work of}} Christiaan Eijkman and Gerrit Grijns and others that beri-beri was indeed caused by a nutritional deficiency. He enlisted the help of Robert R. Williams of the Bureau of Science in Manila in isolating the [...] "anti-beri-beri factor". In 1911, Vedder and Maj. Weston P. Chamberlain, who had become members of the Tropical Disease Board in 1910, began experimenting with the treatment of infantile beriberi with an extract of rice <b>polishings</b> (or partially milled rice, an alcohol-based extract of rice hulls). Williams set out to isolate the ingredient responsible, but his work was deferred with a career change to chemistry for Bell Telephone Company. Other physicians had already tried feeding the <b>polishings</b> to nursing mothers. Believing the problem to be a poison in the mother's milk, they required that each baby be exclusively bottle-fed until the mother's treatment had been completed. Vedder and Chamberlain cured 15 infants whose mothers had symptoms of beriberi by supplementing each mother's milk with an extract of rice <b>polishings</b> and allowing nursing to continue. In every case, regardless of the seriousness of the baby's condition, the cure was rapid and complete. The experiment demonstrated conclusively that beriberi was a deficiency disease rather than the result of a toxin in the mother's milk. In 1913 Vedder published a seminal book on the subject. (As an aside, work slowdown during the Great Depression allowed Williams to return to beri-beri research, and it was not until 1933 when he successfully isolated its vitamin preventative in quantity. In 1936 he first synthesized it and named it thiamine [...] - [...] vitamin B1 having been its original designation.) ...|$|E
50|$|Pre-historic weaponmakers would rub {{the end of}} a {{selected}} wood pole against a smooth rock surface until a point was achieved. Then the point was heated in a fire, making sure to thrust the point into the coals. This put a light coating of carbon on the surface, which was then polished with a special stone, which ground fine particles of stone into the pitch which had been brought {{to the surface of the}} wood by the fire. Subsequent firings and <b>polishings</b> of the wooden tip of the spear would eventually form a hardened glaze consisting of pitch, wood particles and carbon on the tip which could eventually be even harder than a copper tip.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the electrochemical dissolution of titanium in TMHA-Tf 2 N ionic liquid {{in order to}} develop a new polishing method for titanium. No dissolution of titanium was observed during the anodic potential sweep up to + 6. 0 V vs. I 3 −⁄I− because of the formation of titanium oxide layer during the potential sweep. But when a certain anodic potential was applied instead of the potential sweep, titanium was successfully dissolved to the extent of detectable weight loss. Moreover, TMHA-Tf 2 N ionic liquid indicated fluorescence X-ray of titanium and the titanium surface showed a shiny metallic silver appearance after experiment. We found that the immersed potential of titanium in the ionic liquid became gradually more negative by increasing the number of mechanical <b>polishings</b> before electrochemical experiments. Using the titanium with an immersed potential of more negative than − 0. 95 V, the titanium was dissolved anodically at + 1. 6 V. The potential is within the electrochemical window of TMHA-Tf 2 N ionic liquid. We believe this technique represents a promising new surface treatment for titanium...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} ileal digestibility {{coefficients of}} amino acids in 107 samples representing 22 food ingredients were determined using 6 -week-old broiler chickens. The ingredients assayed included five cereals (barley, maize, sorghum, triticale and wheat), two cereal by-products (rice <b>polishings</b> and wheat middlings), four oilseed meals (canola, cottonseed, soyabean and sunflower meals), full-fat canola, maize gluten meal, four grain legumes (chickpeas, faba beans,field peas and lupins) and five animal protein sources (blood, feather,fish, meat and meat and bone meals). The mean ileal digestibility coefficients of amino acids in wheat and maize {{were higher than}} those in sorghum, triticale and barley. However, variations observed in individual amino acid digestibilities among samples within cereal type were greater than those determined between cereals. Threonine and lysine were the least digestible indispensable amino acids in the five cereals evaluated. The most digestible indispensable amino acid was phenylalanine in wheat and, leucine in maize and sorghum. In {{the case of the}} wheat middlings and rice <b>polishings,</b> threonine was the least digestible indispensable amino acid and arginine was the best digested. In the oilseed meals assayed, amino acid digestibility was highest for soya-bean and sunflower meals, intermediate for canola meal and lowest for cottonseed meal. Ileal digestibility coefficients of amino acids in lupins were found to be slightly lower than those in soya-bean meal. The amino acid digestibilities of field peas, faba beans and chickpeas were considerably lower than those of lupins. Digestibility of arginine was the highest and that of threonine was the lowest of the indispensable amino acids in oilseed meals and grain legumes, except in cottonseed meal. Lysine was the least digestible amino acid in cottonseed meal. In the animal protein sources assayed, digestibility coefficients of amino acids in blood meal were high, intermediate in fish meal, and low in meat meal, meat and bone meal and feather meal. Variation in amino acid digestibility coefficients determined for blood meal samples was small. However, wide variations in amino acid digestibilities were observed for other animal protein sources, highlighting significant batch-to-batch differences. In particular, marked variations were determined for meat meal and meat and bone meal samples. Cystine was the least digested amino acid in animal protein meals, with the exception of blood meal in which isoleucine had the lowest digestibility. The limitations of using apparent digestibility values in diet formulations and the concept of the standardized digestibility system to overcome these limitations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a database on in situ ruminal crude protein (CP) degradability characteristics of by-products from cereal grains, oilseeds and animal origin commonly fed to ruminants in Pakistan and South Asian Countries. The oilseed by-products were soybean meal, sunflower meal, mustard seed meal, cottonseed meal, decorticated and un-decorticated cottonseed cake, maize oil cake and mustard seed cake. The cereal grain by-products were corn gluten meal, corn gluten feed, guar meal, toria meal, rice meal, rice <b>polishings,</b> rice bran and wheat bran. The animal by-products were fish meal, feather meal, blood meal, and meat and bone meal. Four samples per feed were collected from different dairy farms (n= 1), local markets (n= 1), and agro-food industries (n= 2). Ruminal protein degradation characteristics of the feeds were determined using the in situ nylon bag technique where each feed was incubated in the rumen of 3 mature steers for 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h. There were large differences in instantly soluble (W) fraction, potentially rumen degradable (D) fraction, rate of degradation (kd) and effective degradability of crude protein (EDCP) among the by-product feeds. Among the oilseed by-products, mustard seed cake had the highest (...|$|E
40|$|The 304 L {{stainless}} steel {{is a major}} component of residual heat removal circuits of pressurized water reactors (PWR). The main {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the risk of thermal fatigue damage resulting from the machining of the 304 L steel pipes inner surface (pre-hardening gradient, residual stresses and scratches), at the scale of the microstructure. This work is based on previous results obtained for pipe specimens thanks to a macroscopic elasto-visco-plastic model. Applied to the pipe specimens, this modelling showed that a thermal loading with temperature gradient, induced a cyclic non linear biaxial loading at the inner surface of the pipe. In this paper, a polycrystal plasticity model, implemented in a Finite Element (FE) code, is adapted to cyclic loading. An elementary volume (3 D aggregate), representing the inner surface and sub-surface of the 304 L steel tube, is built from successive <b>polishings</b> and orientation mappings thanks to an Electron Back Scattering Diffraction method. At the grain scale, the polycrystal model is used as a “numerical microscope ” to compute the local mechanical fields. Different fatigue criteria are tested to determine their sensitivity to surface properties (roughness, residual stress and pre-hardening) and to th...|$|E

Rice <b>polishings</b> as an {{alternative}} to sugar cane molasses as a supplement with urea to low-quality forage diets for ruminants. Animal Production, 56 (1), 85 - 92. The effect of including 14 g urea with either 75 g dry matter (DM) from sugar cane molasses (UM) or Colombian rice <b>polishings</b> (RP) at three levels, 68 (RP 1), 137 (RP 2) or 203 (RP 3) g DM on grass hay DM intake and on rumen fermentation was investigated. An incomplete Latin-square design was used and each experimental period was divided into 12 days for adaptation to each diet followed by 9 days in metabolism cages when all measurements were made using five adult sheep. Pooled mean values for rumen metabolites (five samples per day) were calculated. Rumen pH was not affected {{by the nature of the}} supplements. Concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) (UM 92. 8, RP 1 84. 2, RP 2 86. 4, and RP 3 84. 0 (s. e. d. 3. 4) mmol/l) and lactate (UM 2. 0, RP 1 1. 6, RP 2 1. 7, RP 3 1. 8 (s. e. d. 0. 014) mmol/l) (UM v. RP, P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 10 respectively) were lower when RP were given, while concentration of branched and longer chain VFA (26. 5, 34. 0, 31. 1 and 33. 5 (s. e. d. 1. 6) mmol/mol total VFA, UM v. RP, P < 0. 01) and ammonia (98, 131, 141, 137 (s. e. d. 16. 1) mg/l, UM v. RP, P < 0. 05) were increased. Numbers of rumen protozoa (1. 6, 3. 2, 2. 7, 3. 3 (s. e. d. 0. 75) X 10 (5) per ml, UM v. RP, P < 0. 10) tended to be higher 2 h after feeding when RP rather than UM were given. However, hay DM intake (1050, 960, 960, 880 (s. e. d. 45. 3) g/day, UM v. RP, P < 0. 05), and microbial protein supply (11. 7, 9. 3, 11. 1, 10. 8 (s. e. d. 0. 59) g N per day, UM v. RP, P < 0. 05), estimated from urinary purine excretion were reduced by feeding RP instead of UM. At the levels of inclusion tested RP did not increase the efficiency of rumen fermentation and were not as effective a supplement with urea as was molasses for a low-quality forage diet.

40|$|Forty {{crossbred}} calves (Holstein and Brawn Swiss xZebu) {{of approximately}} {{three to four}} months of age {{at the start of the}} trial were used. A]: 1 received molasses/urea plus residual milk after each milking and grazed from eight in the morning to three in the afternoon. The two treatments were 600 g/day of rice <b>polishings</b> or 2. 5 % liveweight of leucaena forage. No significant differences in the liveweight gains between the two treatments were observed nor were symptoms of toxicity. Therefore it is concluded chat leucaena at 2 % of liveweight could provide a good supplement for calves reared in restricted suckling systems after grazing. Key words: Restricted suckling, calf rearing, leucaena In milk production systems in the tropical regions of Mexico, Zebu and Zebu crosses using larger breeds such as Brown Swiss and Holstein are generally used in dual-purpose systems. Thus the incomes from the sale of milk and of calves for fattening are equally important. One of the principal problems found in such systems is related to the growth of calves, since poor gains and high mortality rates up to weaning are obtained with these animals. Under these management systems the amount of milk taken by the calf from the mother is restricted as cow and calf ar...|$|E
40|$|Thiamin(e), {{also known}} as vitamin B 1, is now known to play a {{fundamental}} role in energy metabolism. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the ‘anti-beriberi factor ’ found in rice <b>polishings.</b> After its synthesis in 1936, it led to many years of research to find its action in treating beriberi, a lethal scourge known for thousands of years, particularly in cultures dependent on rice as a staple. This paper refers to the previously described symptomatology of beriberi, emphasizing that it differs from that in pure, experimentally induced thiamine deficiency in human subjects. Emphasis is placed on some of the more unusual manifestations of thiamine deficiency and its potential role in modern nutrition. Its biochemistry and pathophysiology are discussed and some of the less common conditions associated with thiamine deficiency are reviewed. An understanding of the role of thiamine in modern nutrition is crucial in the rapidly advancing knowledge applicable to Complementary Alternative Medicine. References are given that provide insight into the use of this vitamin in clinical conditions that are not usually associated with nutritional deficiency. The role of allithiamine and its synthetic derivatives is discussed. Thiamine plays a vital role in metabolism of glucose. Thus, emphasis is placed on the fact that ingestion of excessive simple carbohydrates automatically increases the need for this vitamin. This is referred to as high calorie malnutrition...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritive value}} of rice by {{products}} in Costa Rica, Chemical composition, availability and use. By-products from the milling of rice, as obtained in Costa Rica, were examined for chemical composition and availability in the country. Data {{were taken from}} the CINA feed data base and from the literature. In Costa Rica, rice bran is a mixture of rice <b>polishings</b> and rice bran, without the broken rice and contain all the layers of the rice obtained in the milling operation of brushing the grain to polish the kernel. It may contain small quantity of hulls and germ of the rice. It must contain no less than 9 % of crude protein and no more than 13 % of crude fiber. The data show an availability of rice bran of 16. 800 tons with an average protein content of 13. 6 % and 8. 5 % of crude fiber. The digestible energy swine was 3924 Kcal/kg of dry matter and 3340 Kcal/kg of dry matter of metabolizable energy for poultry.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} few years were {{developed}} some manufacturing processes involving resin impregnation in dry preforms prior to cure, and more specically resin infusion across the fabric thickness in the so-called Resin Infusion Processes. Therefore, in these growingly used processes the transverse permeability of the fabrics will control both manufacturing cycles and dimensions, and consequently the mechanical properties of the nal composites. A big eort has been realized to obtain reliable experimental techniques for measuring the transverse permeability. Since the dierentiation between saturated and eective permeabilities is still discussed, and the flow front is hardly dened in such small dimensions (order of 1 mm), our measurements on some so-called Non-Crimped New Concept (NC 2) are carried out for saturated flow, i. e. the ber network is completely impregnated from the onset of the experiment. In our case [1], these measures rely on the measurements of the pressure drop induced by the flow of a controlled liqui across the fabrics, easily converted into transverse permeability through the Darcy's law. One of the main results of these measurements is that the low NC 2 transverse permeability depends {{on the face of the}} fabric receiving the liquid. This original behaviour may, in turn, be translated into manufacturing guidelines to achieve optimal processing conguration. An attempt to relate this dierential to the stitching hole surface is proposed which turns to explain minor phenomena. On the contrary, the 3 D shape of the stitching hole reconstruction from <b>polishings</b> could yield some proper explanations...|$|E

In Experiment 1, 2 groups of 4 steers were given either a basal diet of {{molasses}} containing 4 % (w/w) urea (Diet A) or the basal diet supplemented with 82 fish meal (Diet B). In Experiment 2, the steers were reallocated {{into three groups}} and given either Diet A (2 animals), Diet B (2 animals) or Diet C (4 animals; the basal diet supplemented with 12 % fish meal). All diets included a mineral and vitamin supplement and each animal was given 1. 5 kg cereal hay per day. Dry matter intake and liveweight change were recorded for each group {{for a period of}} 93 d and 51 d for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 respectively. Glucose entry rates were estimated in both experiments from a single injection of [2 - H] glucose. The parameters of glucose metabolism did not vary significantly when 3 estimated at 6 hr intervals over a 24 hr period. Glucose entry rates varied between 7. 4 to 14. 5 g/kg / /d and g growth rates varied between 300 and 700 g/d. Over the range of growth rates measured, there were significant linear relationships between glucose entry rate and growth rate, and between try ratter intake and glucose entry rate.
