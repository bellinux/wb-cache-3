5|$|Along its path, Goni killed 74people {{and left}} $831.7million (USD) in damage. On Guam, {{one of the}} first landmasses affected, heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding and power outages. Across northern Luzon in the Philippines, Goni also dropped intense precipitation. This resulted in deadly landslides, flooded fields, and the destruction of thousands of houses. The typhoon also brought heavy rainfall and rough seas to Taiwan and the east coast of China. In the southern Ryukyu Islands and Kyushu, high wind overturned vehicles, damaged buildings, and left over 490,000homes without <b>power.</b> <b>Off</b> the coast of Kyushu, a man drowned amid high waves. Flooding killed 40people in North Korea. The extratropical remnants of Goni damaged crops and flooded a zoo in eastern Russia.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{six feet}} tall, O'Neill was {{compared}} to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because {{of his ability to}} score at a high pace, in particular with his <b>power</b> <b>off</b> the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.|$|E
25|$|In May 1909, Velox {{was passing}} Lands End when her port engines failed and heavy rolling caused {{a loss of}} {{feedwater}} supply to her condensers. This almost caused a complete loss of <b>power</b> <b>off</b> a dangerous lee shore. After this incident, Velox was transferred from normal flotilla duty to be attached to HMS Vernon, the Royal Navy's torpedo establishment as a training vessel. As such, Velox would not need to operate in poor weather which could cause a similar failure.|$|E

2500|$|Flying the Bell Airacuda {{was a new}} {{experience}} for me, since {{it was the first}} pusher aircraft I'd ever flown. Its handling characteristics were foreign to anything I had ever had my hands on. Under power it was unstable in pitch, but stable with <b>power</b> <b>off.</b> While flying straight and level, if a correction in pitch was required, a forward push on the control resulted in the airplane wanting to pitch over even more. Pitch control became a matter of continually jockeying the controls, however slightly, even when the aircraft was in proper trim. The same applied if pulling back on the control. It would tend to continue pitching up, requiring an immediate corrective response. The same happened in a turn with <b>power</b> <b>off,</b> the Bell became stable in pitch. This was fortunate because during approach and landing, it was very stable, and a nice flying airplane." ...|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{the second}} reason, {{it must be}} {{emphasized}} that with the presented visualization we confirm that even during the time period having the highest percentage (24.5 %) of <b>powered</b> <b>off</b> BSSs, each of the analyzed networks preserved full SA coverage. Table 10 gives detailed information about the number and percentage of the <b>powered</b> <b>off</b> CSs for Instance 10 during 1 day. Even if we take into consideration time periods with the lowest number of active users (e.g. t = 5, 6 in Table 5), the percentage of <b>powered</b> <b>off</b> CSs according to Table 10 remains unchanged (24.2 %). Therefore, full coverage of the SA with radio signal will not be lost in any moment during a day.

2500|$|While the {{airframe}} of {{the prototype}} was completed during {{the autumn of}} 1916, the promised engine never appeared. When this became apparent, {{it became clear that}} possible alternatives such as the Hispano-Suiza 8 or Rolls-Royce Falcon could not be installed in the P.V.4, and eventually a 110hp (82kW) Clerget rotary engine was fitted, allowing the P.V.4 to undergo testing in June 1917. [...] The Clerget was longer than the Smith Static, however, which meant that the aircraft could not be rigged to be stable both at full power and with <b>power</b> <b>off,</b> with longitudinal control being lost at below 63mph (101km/h). As pusher aircraft were now considered obsolete, no further development took place.|$|E

2500|$|The S.XIII was {{of similar}} layout to the S.VII, i.e. a single engined biplane [...] of mainly wooden {{construction}} with fabric covering, but was generally larger and heavier.

It was faster than its main contemporaries, the British Sopwith Camel and the German Fokker D.VII, and its relatively higher power-to-weight ratio gave it a good rate of climb.
