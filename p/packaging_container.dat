The primary component of the EBS is a multi-barrier waste <b>package</b> <b>container.</b> Simplifying the geometry of the cylindrical waste <b>package</b> <b>container</b> and the underlying invert into the equivalent spherical configuration, mathematical models are developed for steady-state and transient diffusive releases from the failed waste container with multiple perforations (or pit penetrations) at the boundary of the invert. Using the models the steady-state and transient diffusive release behaviors form the failed waste container are studied. The analyses show {{that the number of}} perforations, the size of perforation, the container wall thickness, the geometry of the waste container and invert, and the adsorption of radionuclide in the invert are the important parameters that control the diffusive release rate. It is emphasized that the failed (or perforated) waste <b>package</b> <b>container</b> can still perform as a potentially important barrier (or diffusion barrier) to radionuclide release...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if any potential safety problems exist in the residue drum backlog at the Rocky Flats Plant. Plutonium residues stored in 55 -gallon drums were packaged for short-term storage until the residues could be processed for plutonium recovery. These residues have now been determined by the Department of Energy to be waste materials, and the residues will remain in storage until plans for disposal of the material can be developed. The packaging configurations which were safe for short-term storage may not be safe for long-term storage. Interviews with Rocky Flats personnel involved with packaging the residues reveal that more than one packaging configuration was used for some of the residues. A tabulation of packaging configurations was developed based on the information obtained from the interviews. A number of potential safety problems were identified during this study, including hydrogen generation from some residues and residue packaging materials, contamination containment loss, metal residue <b>packaging</b> <b>container</b> corrosion, and pyrophoric plutonium compound formation.

40|$|Plastics are manmade long chain {{polymeric}} molecules {{which are}} resistant against microbial attack and {{become part of}} parcel of today life. It {{turns out to be}} imperative component in agriculture as different plastics are used for various purposes namely plasticulture, polyhouses, mulches, <b>packaging</b> <b>container,</b> shrink film wrappers, etc. Plastics have replaced paper and cellulose-based products for packaging because of their strength, lightness, resistance to water and most water borne microorganism. Nowadays a wide variety of synthetic polymers are produced worldwide to the extent of ~ 140 million tonnes every year. Remarkable of these polymers are introduced in the ecosystem as industrial waste products every year. The dramatic increase in production and lack of biodegradability of commercial polymers, particularly commodity plastics used in packaging, industry and agriculture, focused public attention on a potentially huge environmental accumulation and pollution problem that could persist for centuries. Because of their persistence in our environment, several communities are now more sensitive to the impact of discarded plastic on the environment, including deleterious effects on wildlife and on the aesthetic qualities of cities and forests. In addition, the burning of polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics produces persistent organic pollutants (POPs) known as furans and dioxins. In order to find alternatives, a new material has been developed known as bioplastic. Bioplastics are long chain of monomers joined with each other by ester bonds. These plastics are thus considered as polyesters. Bioplastics are classified into variou...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Young's modulus {{denotes the}} {{inherent}} rigidity or stiffness, and resistance of a fruit to elastic deformation, and expresses the fruit’s {{tendency to be}} deformed elastically under applied force. This study related the deformations encountered in packaged Roma tomatoes to Young’s modulus as a strength parameter that characterizes mechanical behavior of the packaged tomatoes under compression. A 2 2 x 3 factorial experimental design was applied in conducting compression tests to investigate the effects of ripeness stage, vibration level and container type on Young’s modulus of the packaged tomatoes. Tomatoes of three ripeness stages: unripe (5. 6 Brix%), half-ripe (3. 9 Brix%) and full-ripe (3. 2 Brix%), were packed in plastic crate and raffia basket. They were subjected to three levels of vibration: non-vibrated, low vibration (frequency 3. 7 Hz) and high vibration (frequency 6. 7 Hz), using a laboratory vibrator. The fruits were compressed in a Universal Testing Machine at a speed of 2. 50 mm/min; Young's Modulus was measured and force-deformation curves were obtained. Young's Modulus decreased significantly (P= 0. 05) with advancing ripeness stage of tomatoes and with vibration level (P= 0. 001) but was independent of <b>packaging</b> <b>container.</b> Average Young's Modulus ranged from 1. 140 Nmm to 1. 875 Nmm at bioyield, 13. 597 Nmm to 27. 221 Nmm at break and 15. 629 Nmm to 23. 618 Nmm at peak. These findings will be useful in predicting and controlling the deformation or complete failure that occurs in packaged tomatoes caused by compression stress during road transportation. Containers can be adequately designed with due consideration for physical characteristics of tomatoes such as shape, size, and firmness in relation to externally applied compression stresses...|$|E

The {{qualification}} of packaging dimensions {{was obtained}} by reverse analyzing the logistics chain, and on this basis, the model design of <b>packaging</b> <b>container</b> was going on by using behavioral modeling theory. This design process synthetically using software as Pro / ENGINEER and TOPS Pro, reflects typical features of digital design in packaging. By this way, the design efficiency can be improved effectively and the actual logistics costs can be reduced. Modern Logistics and Digital Packaging Modern logistics is the process that the production goods ′ time, location, inventory, inventory location, storage, transport time, transport sites and transportation is planned, organized, coordinated and controlled scientifically and rationally {{in order to achieve}} the goal, that the correct cargo was handed over to the cargo owner at the exact time, accurately price, accurate delivery conditions and exact location, to achieve customer satisfaction at the lowest cost [1]. With the modern logistics becoming an important industry of economic development among the new century gradually, the traditional packaging design approach has been difficult to meet current survival and development of business. Package, as a starting point of logistics, the important prerequisite to achieve logistics is that the appropriate packaging materials should be selected optimized, the reasonable structure of packaging should be designed, and the right technology of package should be made. Digital packaging design is the design process, the reasonable, effective and efficient design for product packaging, using advanced computer technology. At present, digital products is still in the exploratory stage in virtual design and manufacturing applications of forming packaging ′ model [2].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of various types of wax-coatings, and container liners on the physicochemical characters of Pakistani mandarins (Feutrellt's Early-and Kinnows) during postharvest storage at ordinary room conditions. Changes in citrus volatiles and free amino acids were studied to test their suitability as chemical quality/senescence indices and correlations between physico chemical and organoleptic characters of mandarins were also computed. Literature pertaining to fresh citrus fruits external (rots, physiological disorders, blemishes) and internal (total soluble solids (TSS), acid, TSS/acid, juice content, volatiles, free amino acids) quality characters was surveyed. Preharvest and harvest factors (rootstock, tree condition, soil, climate, weather, production area, harvesting season, garden treatments (water management, fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, growth regulators, colour enhancer, internal quality modifier),picking methods and postharvest treatments(washing, grading, degreening, precooling, curing, conditioning, decay control techniques (fungicides, fumigation, growth regulators, heat treatment, irradiation, citrus volatiles), controlled atmosphere storage, waxing, <b>packaging,</b> <b>container</b> lining, packing, containerization) affecting the postharvest quality and storage behaviour of citrus fruits have been reviewed. Effect of various postharvest treatments was studied in five citrus crops (1976 - 77, 1977 - 78, 1979 - 80, 1982 - 83, 1983 - 84) in early, mid and late season harvests.
