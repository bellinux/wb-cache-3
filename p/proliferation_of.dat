40|$|Reactive <b>proliferations</b> <b>of</b> the gingiva {{comprise}} lesions such as {{pyogenic granuloma}} (PG), inflammatory fibroepithelial hyperplasia (IFH), peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF), and peripheral giant cell lesion. Osteopontin (OPN) has a dual role, it promotes mineralization {{when it is}} bound to solid substrate, {{and on the other}} hand, it inhibits mineralization when it is seen in association with solution. Objectives The study aimed to evaluate the expression of osteopontin in normal gingival tissue and different types <b>of</b> focal reactive <b>proliferations</b> <b>of</b> gingival tissue, and its {{role in the development of}} calcification within it. Material and Methods The presence and distribution of osteopontin was assessed using immunohistochemistry in five cases of normal gingival tissue and 30 cases <b>of</b> focal reactive <b>proliferations</b> <b>of</b> gingiva. Results There was no expression of osteopontin in normal subjects. Few cases of pyogenic granuloma, inflammatory fibroepithelial hyperplasia, and all the cases of peripheral ossifying fibroma showed positivity for osteopontin in the inflammatory cells, stromal cells, extracellular matrix, and in the calcifications. Conclusion The expression of osteopontin in all the cases of peripheral ossifying fibroma speculates that the majority of the cases of peripheral ossifying fibroma originate from the periodontal ligament cells. The treatment modalities for peripheral ossifying fibroma should differ from other focal reactive <b>proliferations</b> <b>of</b> gingiva...|$|R

Phyllodes tumor of the prostate is a rare neoplasm in this group with cellular, sarcomatoid stroma and benign hyperplastic glands. It is a locally expansile tumor with clinical course varying from benign to aggressive. We report {{a case of a}} 45 -year-old man presented with retention of urine and abdominal lump. On laparotomy it was a huge tumor of 4 kg and was histologicaly characterized by cellular pleomorphic stroma and hyperplastic epithelium. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated prostate specific antigen in the glands. It was diagnosed as cystosarcoma phyllodes tumor of prostate.

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} cetuximab on inhibition <b>of</b> <b>proliferation</b> and apoptosis <b>of</b> A 549 cells with K-ras mutation. Methods　The inhibition <b>of</b> <b>proliferation</b> and apoptosis rate of A 549 cells induced by cetuximab were analyzed by CCK- 8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The disparity on gene expression of A 549 cells was compared between cetuximab group and control group by microarray. Results　Treatment with cetuximab resulted in inhibition <b>of</b> <b>proliferation</b> and apoptosis <b>of</b> A 549 cells with K-ras mutation. There were 10 genes upregulated and 9 genes downregulated after cetuximab treatment. Realtime PCR confirmed that the gene expressions of STAT 1 and IGFBP 3 of A 549 cells were upregulated obviously after cetuximab treatment. Conclusions　Cetuximab may have an inducing effect on inhibition <b>of</b> <b>proliferation</b> and apoptosis on {{non-small cell lung cancer}} cell line A 549 which has undergone K-ras mutation.
