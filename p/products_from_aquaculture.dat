40|$|Aquaculture {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing food {{production}} sectors to every household in Nigeria. <b>Products</b> <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture</b> such as fish food supply protein to household protein. However, bio-safety of food <b>products</b> <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture</b> is now considered as public health concern in Nigeria. This is due to the nature and component of materials used as rearing facilities on the fish farm. Elimination of unwanted fishes and other predators is a common practice among fish farmers in Nigeria prior to stocking of desirable fish fingerlings. The use of synthetic pesticides to eliminate unwanted fishes and other predators in pond is persistent and could get into the food chain. Thus, the use of environmentally safe natural pesticides as an alternative is being embraced in aquaculture because they have a short time of toxicity disappearance and biodegradable. This will enhance the principles of sustainable aquaculture production and its management in Nigeria. In Southwestern Nigeria, there is little or no information on commercial production of Moringa oleifera for aquaculture purpose. There is the need for future development on Moringa production on commercial scale in Southwestern Nigeria and elsewhere in the tropics for sustainable aquaculture development. The paper therefore reviewed possible guide to Moringa oleifera production, methodology for its potential application in sustainable aquaculture development in Southwestern Nigeria. Possible prospects and challenges to encounter during commercial production were discussed...|$|E

The missions of aquaculture {{development in}}clude the development of fishery <b>products</b> <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture</b> to achieve international quality standards, enhanced sustainability of fishery <b>products</b> <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> stock enhancement of aquatic resources, and development of research and technology for aquaculture. The national directive aims at increasing production by 5 % per year to provide at least 30 kg per person per year of food fish consumption. In recent years, Thailand aquaculture technology developments have increased not only in productivity but also in terms of quality and safety of products throughout the production line. Its development has become more harmonious with the natural environment and more consistent with socioeconomic development. With regard to supply of quality seeds on consistent and sustainable basis, the Department of Fisheries (DoF) supports both the government and private sector hatcheries to produce quality seeds. The Good aquaculture practices (GAPs) and Code of conduct (CoC) which comply with the environmental theme are also applied. Research for broodstock development is aimed at enhancing reproduction by nutritional manipulation and closed recycling water system for broodstock. Promotion of domestication and research in genetic manipulation for broodstock are practiced. Moreover, the regulations of feed quality control have been performed according to the Feed quality act (1982). The Good manufacture practices (GMPs) and HACCP for aqua-feed manufacturing are promoted as voluntary. Currently, the use of ingredients for bio-energy production is emerging in aqua-feed industry. Research to develop suitable alternative protein sources to reduce the use of fish meal is on-going and is being supported by DoF. The expanded scientific information and technology development designed for aquaculture offer significant benefits to both producers and consumers by enhancing the production efficiency and quality of cultivated aquatic species with appropriate culture practices...|$|E

40|$|Fish {{are one of}} {{the main}} food sources {{throughout}} the planet and, {{in some parts of the}} world, especially in developing countries they are the only source of animal protein of local residents. Since the beginning of human civilization, fish have been caught in fresh and salt waters. Despite the fact that global fish consumption has been constantly increasing and it currently accounts for almost 20 kg of fish per person per year, the situation in the Czech Republic has been changing only slowly. The Czech Republic is known for traditional fish production in pond aquaculture with long historical roots and is currently ranked 6 th within the European Union. However, fish consumption is generally one of the lowest in Europe. The annual consumption is only 5. 5 kg of fish per person per year, of which fish <b>from</b> domestic <b>aquaculture</b> amount to only 1 - 1. 5 kg. Despite the fact that fish consumption in the Czech Republic has been low in the long run, the interest of consumers has been shifting to more expensive and better quality food. They are commodities such as Atlantic salmon, tuna and crustaceans which lack typical characteristics of <b>products</b> <b>from</b> the Czech <b>aquaculture,</b> i. e. the characteristic taste, aroma and presence of muscle bones. These changes in consumer´s behaviour were recorded on the basis of a study focusing on the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the Czech Republic. One of the goals of this doctoral thesis were the applied results in the form of newly developed products using fish meat, less valuable parts of fish (tailpiece) and wastes from fish processing (skin, head). Due to the nature of these applied results, their registration was done in the form of utility models with the Industrial Property Office of the Czech Republic. One of the newly developed and successfully offered products on the market is carp pâté. It is made of machine-separated carp meat and contains 90 % of the meat in the product. In addition to the basic pâté, there are currently other four variants (with pepper, smoked fish, almonds and cranberries). From the above, it is clear that there are many possibilities and opportunities how to increase the consumption and use of fish <b>from</b> domestic <b>aquaculture.</b> When introducing new <b>products</b> <b>from</b> fish, which are bred in ponds, the marketing must also be used to promote their indisputable benefits. And this is mainly the fact that it is a healthy and quality domestic raw material from the Czech agriculture. The very high quality and minimal occurrence of foreign substances in <b>products</b> <b>from</b> the Czech <b>aquaculture</b> were confirmed by our study. In the framework of this thesis, the screening of various fishery and aquaculture products, commercially available within the Czech Republic, was carried out with regard to the occurrence of heavy metals. The results of this study showed a very good quality of these products with a low content of heavy metals. Measured values of these elements in <b>products</b> <b>from</b> the Czech <b>aquaculture</b> were well below the allowed limit and their consumption does not pose any health risks. Due to the nature of the obtained data, it is possible to process and publish this study in a popular-scientific form to the general public. The right form of communication and contact with the public will be a key factor in the future in introducing new aquaculture products and increasing fish consumption in the Czech Republic...|$|R

40|$|Asia {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to world aquaculture production. Most Asian countries have maintained their rank in the ten top aquatic food producing nations after developing refined techniques for major commercially important aquaculture species and promoting an increased awareness on the merits of using quality seeds (genetically enhanced or otherwise) as supplied in sufficient quantities. Quality seedstock simply means fit, clean, uniformly-sized seeds which could be eggs, fry, fingerling, juveniles and/or plantlets (for seaweeds) that subsequently express good performance attributes during culture. Beneficial traits refer to good color, shape, growth, efficient feed conversion, high reproduction, tolerance and survival when exposed to stressors (e. g. diseases, poor and/or extreme environmental conditions). Such traits are mostly heritable, hence, quality seeds are usually assumed as produced only by mating stocks perceived or proven to be genetically superior. Some bloodstocks may be genetically mediocre but if bred and manage properly through efficient farm protocols (suitable hatchery, nursery feeding and water management methods), may also produce good quality seeds. Success in the sustainable production of aquatic species for human consumption depends primarily on the availability of seedstock and adoption of optimal husbandry techniques among others. With the intensification of aquaculture systems and the environmental challenges such as those resulting from climate change, it is wise to continue considering both factors [...] genetic quality and culture management as equally important in ensuring a steady production of good quality seeds and later, marketable <b>products</b> <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> Views on what, how and why better quality aquaculture seeds should be produced evolve as times change. To understand these concerns, this paper will cover: (a) the present state of fish seed production in Asia, (b) recent and current seedstock production issues that require attention, and (c) recommendations on how to further enhance aquaculture production in the region in the next decade through better quality seedstock...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} possible cross-cultural consumer segments in the EU aquaculture market and provide direction and focus for marketing strategies for farmed fish products. Design/methodology/approach: Selected psychographic constructs (i. e. category involvement, domain-specific innovativeness, subjective knowledge, suspicion of novelties and optimistic bias) are tested as segmentation basis with the objective of defining a number of cross-border consumer segments with distinctive and clear-cut profiles in terms of consumer perceptions towards farmed fish. Findings: Based on the consumer psychographic profiles, three distinct segments are found: involved traditional, involved innovators and ambiguous indifferent, of which the first two constitute especially interesting targets for market positioning strategies for aquaculture products. Practical implications: The results of the segmentation analysis opens new horizons in terms of positioning and differentiation of fish <b>products</b> <b>from</b> the <b>aquaculture</b> industry according to the most important potential market segments. Originality/value: The current research brings insights into different pan-European consumer segments and their characteristics that allow for a corresponding differentiation strategy within the aquaculture industry. The fact that the segments tend to be uniform across all countries suggests a relatively homogeneous or converging European fish-related culture. </p...|$|R

From the shrimp pond farmer to the retailer, there is a growing desire to meet or exceed these consumer expectations, and to be seen to be applying responsible management techniques in the development of truly sustainable shrimp production systems. These demands {{led to the development of}} codes for better aquaculture practices for the shrimp industry to ensure a sustainable, environmentally friendly and socially equitable way to produce shrimp and for the consumer to be assured healthy food. Shrimp certification was introduced to respond to public perceptions and market requirements and increase public and consumer confidence in the production practices and the product. Currently there are a growing number of standards, "Codes of Practice," and certification schemes. Proliferation of Codes of Practice and certification schemes used by governments and the private sector industry for sustainable shrimp farming poses a number of challenges. Shrimp producers and exporters in the developing world of ten struggle to adapt to new and changing rules as they try to bring their farm-raised shrimp to different overseas markets. Additionally, there is the risk that Codes of Practice and certification schemes could affect the competitive position of resource-poor shrimp farmers and prevent benefits from the price premium at tained through certification. There is an urgent need for more globally accepted standards and certification guidelines, especially for the small-scale shrimp farmers, to provide guidance, serve as a basis for improved harmonization, and facilitate mutual recognition and equivalence of certification schemes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. With a human {{population}} of 230 {{million and a}} huge potential for marine and fisheries resources development, Indonesia promotes aquaculture as a major sector to accelerate economic growth for rural communities. There are recent initiatives to improve the country's legal framework to mitigate the adverse impacts of aquaculture and make the aquaculture more sustainable. The Directorate General of Aquaculture under the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) has the mandate to develop the aquaculture sector of Indonesia. Aquaculture has {{an important role in}} the development of its national economy and play a key role in rural development. As aquaculture production expands, there is also a growing concern over the impacts on sustainability of aquaculture and resource enhancement as well as food quality and safety requirements of fish products. For this reason, there is a need to improve aquaculture technology and its management system in Indonesia to address the need for eco-friendly production process and food safety concerns while maintaining the sustainability of the country's aquaculture sector. The Indonesian Fisheries Act No. 31 (2004) Amendment No. 45 (2009) mentioned that, among others, the Indonesian fisheries management strategies should include the creation job opportunities, improvement of the welfare of fishers and their communities, and ensuring the sustainability of the country's fishery resources and aquatic environment. The most critical factors to achieve sustainable aquaculture in Indonesia are the availability of good quality seed, good practice in grow-out systems, healthy aquaculture environment, fish health management, good-quality products, strategic marketing, and improving marketing and stock enhancement. In addition, it is also a concern that the <b>products</b> <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture</b> should meet the quality standard and product safety. This paper presents a review of Indonesian aquaculture in relation to sustainable practices and management schemes to preserve the aquaculture environment, food safety requirements for aquaculture products, food security and to enhance the biodiversity of fishery resources.

With data collected from a field survey interviewing 120 fish farmers in southern Vietnam, this study uses a cumulative logistic model to extend the satisfaction approach to an analysis of the farmers' satisfaction with their fish farming. Regression results show that relative income, not absolute income <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> has enhanced job satisfaction of the farmers with their fish production. Farmer satisfaction with fish culture is also estimated to increase with their age, their involvement in extension services, larger relative pond surface, and a higher expectation of earnings <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> Job satisfaction Fish culture Small scale farmer Sustainable development Logistic model...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of balanced, nonpersuasive information related to safety, healthiness, and sustainability of aquaculture on the image of farmed fish among European consumers. It was demonstrated that there is neither positive nor negative influence {{of this type of}} information on the predominantly positive image of fish <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> Consumers who were exposed to information related to the EU origin and aquaculture related guarantee reported a more positive image of farmed fish. These results provide valuable input for transparent communication about fish farming practices which might increase consumer trust and will not harm the image of fish <b>from</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> Increasing consumers' knowledge about aquaculture and its positive effects on the image of farmed fish is also discussed as a pathway for maintaining and improving aquaculture's positive image in the futur...|$|R
