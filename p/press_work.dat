2500|$|In 1932, Edna Beilenson {{joined in}} the {{business}} of <b>press</b> <b>work</b> at the Peter Pauper Press, learning bookkeeping and typesetting. She is credited with bringing a strong sense of graphic design and color to the press's productions, which became the hallmarks of Peter Pauper publications. The Press aimed [...] "to print books as beautifully as a craftsman might, and sell them as cheaply as only a pauper could". Beilenson developed a keen business sense, introducing the concept of pocket-sized gift books, and edited a series of small cookbooks that sold extremely well.|$|E
60|$|These two {{printers}} I found {{poorly qualified}} for their business. Bradford {{had not been}} bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer, though something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of <b>press</b> <b>work.</b> He {{had been one of}} the French prophets,[49] and could act their enthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess any particular religion, but something of all on occasion, was very ignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of the knave in his composition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford's while I worked with him. He had a house, indeed, but without furniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chest and clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first happened to see me eating my roll in the street.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present work is to clarify the effect of the tool shape in finish {{blanking}} on galling behavior. A high-tensile-strength-steel plate with a thickness of 6 mm is used in the present paper. The edge shape of punch is changed while the clearance is kept to 12 %t. Galling is observed at the first shearing operation except for the <b>Press</b> <b>Working</b> punch with the edge angle of 30 degrees. In the case of the <b>Press</b> <b>Working</b> punch with the edge angle of 30 degrees, galling can’t be found clearly even when the shearing number reaches 20. The burnish depth has a glossy part with the clean metal for the punches except for the <b>Press</b> <b>Working</b> punch with the edge angle of 30 degree. It is found that the glossy part is generated after fracture occurs at the punch edge and galling occurs in the generation process of the glossy part...|$|R
