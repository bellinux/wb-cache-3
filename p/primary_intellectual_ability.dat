40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Primary</b> <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> (PIA) are a {{confounder}} in {{epidemiological studies}} on neurotoxicity. A good measure of this confounder should {{be independent of}} age as PIA is an intrinsic ability. Furthermore, as PIA is related to health endpoints, any measure of PIA should reveal this association. This study is aimed at comparing vocabulary test, diploma and age at end of schooling properties as measures of PIA in a non-exposed population of workers. METHODS: The design was a cross-sectional study of 413 non-exposed workers (203 women and 210 men) selected from a health check-up center. The effect of age on the vocabulary score was assessed using an analysis of covariance adjusted for diploma. Relationships between neuropsychological performances and vocabulary score, diploma and end of schooling age were, respectively, assessed using multiple linear regressions adjusted for age and gender. RESULTS: Vocabulary score increased significantly with age, both for men and women. The increase was 0. 14 word per year for women, and 0. 18 word per year for men. The explained variance of the models evaluating the relationships between age at end of schooling, diploma, vocabulary test, and neuropsychological performances was quite similar for the three measures of PIA. CONCLUSIONS: Vocabulary score {{was found to be}} age-related, even after adjustment for diploma. No difference was found between these three variables in terms of their relationship to neuropsychological endpoints. Moreover, the literature shows that vocabulary test performances are influenced by exposure to neurotoxic agents. These results suggest that vocabulary score could be of interest for participants of similar ages and similar diplomas. Otherwise, the other two variables would be better PIA measures in neurotoxicology studies...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that over the last 60 years there has been a gradual increase in the <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> of the population as a whole which has included people with low <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability.</b> It has been suggested that this increase in ability is due to world become more intellectually demanding in part due to the increased amount of modern technology we have to deal with. The present study examined if this trend was still continuing in the UK by comparing the scaled sores given for individual raw scores on three common subtests (Symbol Search, Coding, and Digit Span) of the UK versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) the WISC-III and WISC-IV. It was found that over the 12. 5 years between the two assessments being standardised there was an overall increase in <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability.</b> However, this increase was greater for those with high <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability.</b> For those with low <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> there was a decline in their <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability.</b> One possible reason for this decline is that people with low <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> are no longer able {{to keep up with the}} pace of intellectual demand of modern technology and are increasingly avoiding intellectually demanding activities...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: low {{cognitive}} ability {{is associated with}} subsequent functional disability. Whether this association extends across adult life has been little studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the association between <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> in young adulthood and physical functioning during a 10 -year follow-up in older age. Methods: three hundred and sixty persons of the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (HBCS) male members, born between 1934 and 1944 and residing in Finland in 1971, took part in The Finnish Defence Forces Basic <b>Intellectual</b> <b>Ability</b> Test during the first 2 weeks of their military service training between 1952 and 1972. Their physical functioning was assessed twice using the Short Form 36 (SF- 36) questionnaire at average ages of 61 and 71 years. A longitudinal path model linking <b>Intellectual</b> <b>Ability</b> Test score to the physical functioning assessments was used to explore the effect of <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> in young adulthood on physical functioning in older age. Results: after adjustments for age at measurement, childhood socioeconomic status and adult BMI (kg/m 2), better <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> total and arithmetic and verbal reasoning subtest scores in young adulthood predicted better physical functioning at age 61 years (P values < 0. 021). <b>Intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> total and arithmetic and verbal reasoning subtest scores in young adulthood had indirect effects on physical functioning at age 71 years (P values < 0. 022) through better physical functioning at age 61 years.

40|$|Introduction. Although {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits may be trait markers of schizophrenia it is not clear yet if ToM deficits are primary deficits, that is, to be independent of deficits in general <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> and executive function. The aim was to examine if ToM deficits may be trait markers of the illness and the effect of cognitive inhibition, general <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> and depression on ToM abilities of patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected parents. Methods. We assessed ToM abilities (first-order and second-order ToM stories, The Revised Eyes Test), cognitive inhibition (Stroop Task), general <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> (Standard Progressive Matrices Test Plus) in patients with schizophrenia (N= 21) and their unaffected fathers (N= 21) and mothers (N= 21) in comparison with healthy control families (healthy control males, N= 21, healthy control fathers, N= 21, healthy control mothers, N= 21) Results. Patients showed deficits in first-order ToM tasks but some of these deficits were mediated by general <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities.</b> Impairments in cognitive inhibition mediated only patients performance in The Revised Eyes Test. Patients showed deficits in second-order ToM stories independently of deficits in general <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> and cognitive inhibition. Unaffected parents did not show deficits in first-order ToM tasks, whereas they showed deficits in second-order ToM stories. However, the deficits that unaffected parents showed in second-order ToM stories were mediated by their deficits in general <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities,</b> and there was an effect of remitted depression on the unaffected mothers performance. Conclusions. The results suggest that intact neurocognitive and general <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> are necessary in order patients and their unaffected parents to pass successfully ToM tasks. Patients and their unaffected parents show ToM deficits but these deficits are not similar. Patients show ToM deficits but these deficits seem to be a component of the pathophysiology of the illness (e. g., deficits in executive function, general <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities).</b> © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research that}} {{was conducted to}} explore the genetic and environmental factors contributing to associations between human brain structure and behavioral phenotypes, i. e., <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> and schizophrenia liability. To achieve this, structural equation twin modeling methods were applied to neuroimaging and behavioral data obtained from adult monozygotic and dizygotic healthy twins and twins discordant for schizophrenia. In chapter 2 and chapter 3 of this thesis, we have investigated the shared genetic component between regional grey matter volume and <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability.</b> The importance of subcortical structures in <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability,</b> especially implicating the thalamus, was highlighted. Also, it was shown that grey matter regions implicated in intelligence form a densely connected network and that the volume of these areas is influenced by a genetic factor that influences <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> independently of genes acting on total brain volume. These results indicate that researching specific brain regions implicated in <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> may yield novel genetic variants for this trait. Chapter 4 shows that topological aspects of the structural brain network are considerably genetically determined. The heritability of these topological aspects could not be explained by global characteristics of white matter structure such as volume and microstructural directionality, suggesting that graph theoretical measures of brain structure may provide new insight in the genetic mechanisms that promote the development of brain connectivity. In chapter 5 and chapter 6, results are presented showing that white matter integrity and schizophrenia liability are partly influenced by shared genes. Our findings further indicate that the genetic overlap between separate structural brain phenotypes (white matter integrity and cortical thickness) and schizophrenia liability is influenced by independent genetic factors. Also, variation in <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability</b> is found to predict {{a substantial part of}} schizophrenia liability through shared genes. The overlap between brain structure and schizophrenia was estimated to be through a direct association, independent of variation in <b>intellectual</b> <b>ability.</b> This suggests that studying different heritable aspects of brain structure in relation to schizophrenia liability may provide important and independent clues about the development of this etiologically heterogeneous disorder...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aims of {{this study}} were to examine the extent to which higher <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> protect higher {{socio-economic}} groups from functional decline and to examine whether the contribution of <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> is independent of childhood deprivation and low birth weight and other socio-economic and developmental factors in early life. Methods The Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS) is a prospective cohort study based upon participants in a registration network of general practices in The Netherlands. Information was available on 1211 men and women, 24 – 81 years old, who were without cognitive impairment at baseline (1993 – 1995), who ever had a paid job, and who participated in the six-year follow-up. Main outcomes were longitudinal decline in important components of quality of life and successful aging, i. e., self-reported physical, affective, and cognitive functioning. Results Persons with a low occupational level at baseline showed more functional decline than persons with a high occupational level. Socio-economic and developmental factors from early life hardly contributed to the adult socio-economic differences in functional decline. <b>Intellectual</b> <b>abilities,</b> however, took into account more than one third of the association between adult socio-economic status and functional decline. The contribution of the <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> was independent of the early life factors. Conclusion Rather than developmental and socio-economic characteristics of early life, the findings substantiate the importance of <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> for functional decline and their contribution – as potential, but neglected confounders – to socio-economic differences in functioning, successful aging, and quality of life. The higher <b>intellectual</b> <b>abilities</b> in the higher socio-economic status groups may also underlie the higher prevalences of mastery, self-efficacy and efficient coping styles in these groups. </p...|$|R
