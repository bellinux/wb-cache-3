Meta-analytical summaries reveal that deep acting (summoning up the appropriate feelings one wants to display) generally has positive outcomes. Unlike surface acting (faking emotions), deep acting does not harm employee well-being, and deep acting is positively related with job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job performance, and customer satisfaction. Emerging research also suggests that a third form of emotional labor, natural and genuine emotional labor, is a frequently used emotional labor strategy that has positive effects for both employees and customers. We examine how identity processes shape how employees experience emotional labor, and we maintain that when employees identify with their roles, emotional labor augments and affirms their identity. Person-job fit is an important moderator that influences whether emotional labor enhances or hinders employee well-being. Emotional labor may also have positive outcomes when organizations grant more autonomy and adopt <b>positive</b> <b>display</b> rules that call {{for the expression of}} positive emotions.

The SRA-like domains and the base-flipping mechanism for 5 (h) mC recognition are also shared by the recently discovered prokaryotic modification-dependent endonucleases of the MspJI and PvuRts 1 I families. Since the mechanism of modified cytosine recognition by many potential eukaryotic and prokaryotic 5 (h) mC "readers" is still unknown, a fast solution based method for the detection of extrahelical 5 (h) mC would be very useful. In the present study we tested base-flipping by MspJI- and PvuRts 1 I-like restriction enzymes using several solution-based methods, including fluorescence measurements of the cytosine analog pyrrolocytosine and chemical modification of extrahelical pyrimidines with chloroacetaldehyde and KMnO 4.

40|$|Backgrounds: Depression {{has been}} linked to social skills deficits in adults and children, yet {{empirical}} studies in clinically depressed adolescents are rare. The present study focuses on the possible relationship between gender specific nonverbal behaviours and depression in adolescence. For this purpose clinical depressed adolescent and non-depressed adolescents were compared, with attention for possible gender specific effects. Within the depressed group also the correlation between the number of depressive symptoms and nonverbal behaviour was examined. Finally it is examined whether female adult conversation partners responded differently towards clinical depressed adolescents as compared to non-depressed adolescents. Methods: This study consisted of 10 minutes of observations of 29 13 - 20 year old female and male depressed adolescents, 29 non-depressed adolescents (matched on age, gender and educational level) and their female adult conversation partners. Several non-verbal negative en positive (other oriented) behaviours were examined. Negative behaviour consisted of behaviours that violate display rules and the <b>positive</b> <b>display</b> of other oriented behaviour was measured by means of the amount of gazing, smiling, backchanneling, emotional involvement and mirroring. Results: Clinically depressed adolescents showed less emotional involvement and mirroring the position of the upper body and more negative behaviours than non-depressed adolescent do. Some of these effects showed an interaction with sex. Depressed girls showed less other-oriented behaviours (smiling, backchanneling), whereas depressed boys showed more other-oriented behaviours as compared to their non-depressed counterparts. Both depressed girls and boys showed more negative behaviours than controls, but this effect was stronger for boys. A negative correlation was found between the degree of depression and mirroring the position of the lower body and emotional involvement. Surprisingly the reversed was found for backchanneling. Finally, as expected, the conversation partner gazed longer and showed more emotional involvement towards a non-depressed adolescent than a depressed adolescent. Conclusions: The clinically depressed adolescents showed more negative behaviour and less other oriented behaviour than non-depressed adolescent, and received less positive behaviour from the adult partner in conversation, as predicted by the social skills deficit model. Also a correlation was found between the severity of depression and some of these behaviours. It should be further examined if similar patterns exist in peer communication in order to find out the possible consequences for developing relationships...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Human Resource {{personnel}} as part {{of their}} daily jobs provide a service to other employees within a mining industry. These service workers may experience dissonance between their actual feelings and the feelings they are expected to display. For these service workers to be more engaged at work, emotional intelligence and social support is vital. If these factors are not in place, their well-being may be in jeopardy. The objective of this research was to determine the relationship between Emotion Work, Emotional Intelligence, Well-being and Social Support of service workers in a human resource field within a mining industry. A cross-sectional survey design was used. The study population (n = 229) consisted of human resource personnel in the Limpopo and North West Province. The Greek Emotional Intelligence Scale (GEIS), Frankfurt Emotion Work Scales, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, Oldenburg Burnout Inventory and Social Support Scale, as well as a biographical questionnaire, were used as measuring instruments. Cronbach alpha coefficients, factor analysis, inter-item correlation coefficients, Pearson product moment correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression analysis were used to analyse the data. An analysis of the data indicated that correlations between the following constructs are statistically and practically significant. The results show that <b>Positive</b> <b>Display</b> is statistically and positively practically significantly related (medium effect) to Interaction Control. Caring/Empathy is positively practically significantly related to <b>Positive</b> <b>Display</b> (medium effect). Furthermore the Control of Emotions (medium effect) and Emotion Management (large effect) are both positively practically significantly related to Caring/Empathy. Emotional Resilience however is negatively practically significantly related to Caring and Empathy (medium effect). Emotion Expression Recognition is positively practically significantly related to Control of Emotion (medium effect). However, both Exhaustion (medium effect) and Emotional Resilience (medium effect) are negatively practically significantly related to Control of Emotions. Engagement is positively practically significant (medium effect) to Emotion Management. Emotion Resilience (medium effect) positively correlates with Exhaustion while Engagement (medium effect) negatively correlates with Exhaustion. Engagement positively practically correlates with Resilience (medium effect). Social Support of both supervisor and co-workers positively relates to engagement to a medium effect. Principal component analysis performed on the GEIS resulted in a four-factor solution. The first factor was Caring and Empathy, which includes the willingness of an individual to help other people and understand others' feelings. The second factor was Control of Emotion, which is the ability of the individual to control and regulate emotions within themselves and others. Emotion Expression/Recognition, which is the ability of the individual to express and recognise his or her own emotional reactions, was the third factor, and the fourth was Emotion Management, which is the ability of an individual to process emotional information with regard to perception, assimilation, understanding and management of emotions. All four factors correlate with that of the GEIS originally developed by Tsaousis (2007) and accounted for 31 % of the total variance in emotional intelligence. A Multiple Regression Analysis with Exhaustion as dependent variable was carried out. The results show that Emotion Work factors accounted for 2 % of the total variance and Emotional Intelligence factors for 12 % of the total variance. More specifically it seems that the lack of Caring and Empathy and Emotion Management predicted Exhaustion in this regard. However, when Emotional Intelligence factors were entered into the model, an increase of 10 % variance was shown of the variance explained in Exhaustion. Emotion Work, Emotional Intelligence and Social Support predicted 14 % of the variance explained in the level of Exhaustion by participants. A Multiple Regression analysis with Emotional Resilience as dependent variable was carried out. The results show that Emotion Work factors accounted for 6 % of the total variance. More specifically; it seems that Dissonance predicted the level of Emotional Resilience. When Emotional Intelligence factors were entered into the model, an increase of 15 % was shown. Caring and Empathy and Control of Emotions predicted Emotional Intelligence the best. Lastly, when Social Support factors were entered into the regression analysis, the variance explained showed an increase of 5 %. Support of Family and Others predicted Emotional Resilience the best. In total, Emotion Work, Emotional Intelligence and Social Support factors explained 20 % of the variance in Emotional Resilience. A Multiple Regression Analysis with Engagement as dependent variable with Emotion Work factors, Emotional Intelligence factors and Social Support as predictors of Engagement was done. Entry of Emotion Work factors at the first step of the regression analysis did not produce a statistically significant model and only accounted for 1 % of the variance. However, when Emotional Intelligence factors were entered in the second step of the analysis, it accounted for approximately 7 % of the variance. More specifically, it seems that Caring and Empathy predicted Engagement. When Social Support factors were entered into the third step of the analysis, an increase of 27 % was found. All the Social Support factors (Social Support of Family and Others, Supervisors and Co-workers) accounted for 27 % of the variance explained in Engagement. Emotion Work, Emotional Intelligence and Social Support predicted 33 % of the total variance explained in the level of Engagement. Limitations within the study were identified, and recommendations were made for human resource personnel in a mining industry, as well as for future research. Master...|$|E
