5|$|MRO's main {{computer}} is a 133MHz, 10.4million transistor, 32-bit, RAD750 processor. This processor is a radiation-hardened {{version of a}} PowerPC 750 or G3 <b>processor</b> <b>with</b> a specially built motherboard. The RAD750 is a successor to the RAD6000. This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor, but it is extremely reliable, resilient, and can function in solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|The HTC First is a {{mid-range}} smartphone {{which uses}} a dual-core, 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 <b>processor</b> <b>with</b> support for LTE, a 2000 mAh battery, 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of non-expandable storage. The First uses a 4.3-inch 720p Super LCD display, and includes a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 1.6-megapixel front-facing camera. The HTC First's exterior uses a rounded, minimal design with three capacitive buttons below its screen, and was available in black, light blue, red, and white color finishes.|$|E

5|$|The {{system is}} workload-optimized, {{integrating}} massively parallel POWER7 processors and built on IBM's DeepQA technology, which it uses to generate hypotheses, gather massive evidence, and analyze data. Watson employs {{a cluster of}} ninety IBM Power 750 servers, each of which uses a 3.5GHz POWER7 eight-core <b>processor,</b> <b>with</b> four threads per core. In total, the system has 2,880 POWER7 processor threads and 16 terabytes of RAM.|$|E
5|$|The two initial, primary {{computers}} on the HST {{were the}} 1.25MHz DF-224 system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three redundant CPUs, and two redundant NSSC-1 (NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer, Model 1) systems, developed by Westinghouse and GSFC using diode-transistor logic (DTL). A co-processor for the DF-224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, {{which consisted of}} two redundant strings of an Intel-based 80386 <b>processor</b> <b>with</b> an 80387 math co-processor. The DF-224 and its 386 co-processor were replaced by a 25MHz Intel-based 80486 processor system during Servicing Mission 3A in 1999.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X <b>processor</b> <b>with</b> a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E
