50|$|Established in 1961 as Kongo Bearing Company, NTN Kongo Corporation {{manufactures}} {{and develops}} not only radial ball <b>bearings,</b> <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> <b>bearings,</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> and clutch release bearings, but also develops and produces bearing production equipment used by NTN Corporation.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pillow</b> <b>block,</b> {{also known}} as a plummer <b>block</b> or housed <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> is a {{pedestal}} used to provide support for a rotating shaft with the help of compatible bearings & various accessories. Housing material for a <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is typically made of cast iron or cast steel.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the Simplicity Bearing {{was only}} offered in closed, {{imperial}} sizes. PBC quickly developed an open {{version of the}} bearing {{to be used with}} supported shafts. Open and closed <b>Pillow</b> <b>Blocks,</b> Flanged <b>bearings,</b> die set bearings and bushings followed. The company then developed ISO Metric and finally JIS Metric bearings.|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} {{style of a}} babbitt metal bearing, a cast iron <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is assembled as a loose fit around the shaft, with the shaft in approximately its final position. The inner face of the cast iron <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is often drilled to form a key to locate the bearing metal as it is cast into place. The shaft is coated with soot as a release agent, {{the ends of the}} bearing are packed with clay, and molten metal poured into the cavity around the shaft, initially half filling the <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> The <b>bearing</b> is stripped, and the metal trimmed back to the top surface of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> Hardened babbitt metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife or sharp chisel.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{incredible}} growth that Toyo underwent, the organization decentralized by creating subsidiaries to oversee new products. In 1961, Toyo {{set up a}} joint venture with INA Wälzlager Schaeffler called NTN Wälzlager Europa in order to manufacture needle bearings. Toyo utilized design data from INA Wälzlager Schaeffler to make these products. They also established Kongo Bearing Company to manage the creation of <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> <b>bearings.</b> One year later, Toyo founded Senyo Kosakuki Kenkyujo, a maker of ball bearing equipment. In 1963, Toyo entered into business with Hardy Spicer to produce Birfield-type constant-velocity universal joints. They also pursued business overseas by establishing NTN Bearing Corporation of America. The following year, working with GKN Transmission, the company fabricated constant-velocity joints in their home country and formed NTN Bearing-GKN while also opening a facility in Europe called NTN France. The year after that, Toyo started manufacturing oil-impregnated sintered bearings and pipe fittings. Four years later in 1968, the company set up yet another facility in North America called NTN Bearing Corporation of Canada.|$|R

40|$|DNA is {{remarkable}} {{because of its}} highly selective molecular recognition properties and self-assembly behavior. Recent attempts in generating biomimetic synthetic polymers have been flawed {{by a lack of}} structural control. To overcome this shortcoming, we generated molecular recognition polymers and copolymers containing a regioselective arrangement of thymine/uracil analogs via Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP). The ROMP of exo- 7 -oxabicyclo[2. 2. 1]hept- 5 -ene- 2, 3 -dicarboximide was found to fulfill the criteria for a living polymerization. This gave access to polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution and well-controlled architecture. Furthermore, the living character of the reaction allowed for the facile synthesis of diblock copolymers. We have synthesized diblock copolymers containing a small hydrophilic <b>block</b> <b>bearing</b> molecular recognition <b>units</b> and a longer hydrophobic block consisting of long pendant alkyl chains. These copolymers undergo self-assembly into nanoscale aggregates with surface localized multi-point hydrogen bonding sites. Finally, molecular recognition properties of monomers and polymers containing the thymine/uracil analogs were characterized by 1 H NMR and HPLC...|$|R
50|$|A steel shim is {{inserted}} {{to protect the}} face of the lower bearing and to space the cap of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> away from the shaft. After resealing the ends with clay, more metal is then poured to fill the cap of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> {{through the hole in the}} top of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> cap which will eventually be a lubrication hole.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> usually {{refers to}} a housing with an {{included}} anti-friction <b>bearing.</b> A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> {{refers to a}}ny mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of mussel-inspired acetonide-protected dopamine (meth) acrylamide monomers (ADA and ADMA) and its implementation to {{the synthesis of}} innovative ambivalent block copolymers. They consist of a hydro- phobic poly((meth) acrylamide) block functionalized by catechols and a hydrophilic segment of a poly- ((meth) acrylate) bearing pendent PEG chains. For the first time, a series of well-defined P(PEGAm-b-ADAn) and P(ADMAn-b-PEGMAm) diblock copolymers {{across a range of}} molar masses (13 – 42 kg mol− 1) with low molar mass dispersities (Đ = 1. 12 − 1. 25) were reported. Post polymerization, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) treatment yields <b>block</b> copolymers <b>bearing</b> free-catechol <b>units</b> in quantitative yields (> 95 %) with a slight noticeable hydrolysis of pendent-PEG units (2 %– 4 %). The self-assembly of the amphiphilic block copoly- mers into spherical micelles was demonstrated by 1 H NMR, DLS and TEM imaging techniques. Real-time quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) studies revealed that free-catechol groups were necessary for a strong anchoring onto gold and stainless steel surfaces because acetonide- protected and catechol-oxidized block copolymers completely desorbed from the surface in the rinsing step. The ambivalent nature of catechol functionalized block copolymers was studied by bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption on polymer modified surfaces, which displayed improved resistance against BSA adsorption, when compared to an unmodified surface.

40|$|Abstract. Reliability of {{rotating}} machinery {{is determined to}} a considerable degree by the <b>bearing</b> <b>units.</b> For several applications the requirements in rotation speed, bearing load and maximal vibration level are so extreme that neither rolling-element bearings nor fluid-film bearings could provide necessary performance characteristics during all regimes of operation. Hybrid bearings, which are a combination of rolling-element and fluid-film bearings, can improve performance characteristics and reliability of the rotor-bearing systems. The aim of this work is to analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the hybrid bearings. Known real applications of hybrid bearings are discussed. Analysis shows that depending on the application different hybrid bearing types could improve dynamic characteristics and life time of the <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> increase load capacity and DN limit of the rolling-element bearing. 1...|$|R
