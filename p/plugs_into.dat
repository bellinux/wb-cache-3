25|$|At the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Nintendo {{introduced}} the Classic Controller, which <b>plugs</b> <b>into</b> the Wii Remote via a cord {{in a similar}} fashion to the Nunchuk. Unlike most accessories, the Classic Controller largely usurps the Remote's functionality, with the Remote's buttons duplicated on the Controller. The Remote is used primarily as a wireless transmitter for the Controller and where applicable retains its pointing-device functionality.|$|E
25|$|Lexar is {{attempting}} to introduce a USB FlashCard, {{which would be a}} compact USB flash drive intended to replace various kinds of flash memory cards. Pretec introduced a similar card, which also <b>plugs</b> <b>into</b> any USB port, but is just one quarter the thickness of the Lexar model. Until 2008, SanDisk manufactured a product called SD Plus, which was a SecureDigital card with a USB connector.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Nintendo {{released}} the Famicom Disk System (FDS) in Japan, {{a type of}} floppy drive that uses a single-sided, proprietary 5cm (2") disk and <b>plugs</b> <b>into</b> the cartridge port. It contains RAM for the game to load into and an extra single-cycle wavetable-lookup sound chip. The disks were originally obtained from kiosks in malls and other public places where buyers could select a title and have it written to the disk. This process would cost less than cartridges and users could take the disk back to a vending booth and have it rewritten with a new game. The disks were used both for storing the game and saving progress and total capacity was 128k (64k per side).|$|E

50|$|To say the {{connector}} is ADB (Apple desktop Bus) is incorrect; any ADB device <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> this port {{would not}} operate and likewise if the DSS80 were <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> an Apple ADB port {{it would not}} function.

500|$|In general, USB cables {{have only}} plugs on their ends, while hosts and devices have only receptacles. Hosts almost universally have Type-A receptacles, while devices {{have one or}} another Type-B variety. Type-A plugs mate only with Type-A receptacles, and {{the same applies to}} their Type-B counterparts; they are {{deliberately}} physically incompatible. However, an extension to the USB standard specification called USB On-The-Go (OTG) allows a single port to act as either a host or a device, which is selectable {{by the end of the}} cable that <b>plugs</b> <b>into</b> the receptacle on the OTG-enabled unit. Even after the cable is hooked up and the units are communicating, the two units may [...] "swap" [...] ends under program control. This capability is meant for units such as PDAs in which the USB link might connect to a PC's host port as a device in one instance, yet connect as a host itself to a keyboard and mouse device in another instance.|$|E

If the called party's line is on a different switchboard in the same office, or in a different central office, the operator <b>plugs</b> <b>into</b> the trunk for the destination switchboard or office and asks the operator answering (known as the [...] "B" [...] operator) to connect the call.|$|E

6000|$|This eighth {{circle of}} hell is called Evil-Budget,[24] and {{consists}} of ten compartments, or gulfs of torment, crossed and connected with one another by bridges of flint. In the first were beheld Pimps and Seducers, scourged like children by horned devils; in the second, Flatterers, begrimed with ordure; in the third, Simonists, who were stuck like <b>plugs</b> <b>into</b> circular apertures, with their heads downwards, and their legs only discernible, the soles of their feet glowing with a fire which made them incessantly quiver. Dante, going {{down the side of}} the gulf with Virgil, was allowed to address one of them who seemed in greater agony than the rest; and, doing so, the sufferer cried out in a malignant rapture, [...] "Aha, is it thou that standest there, Boniface?[25] Thou hast come sooner than it was prophesied." [...] It was the soul of Pope Nicholas the Third that spoke. Dante undeceived and then sternly rebuked him for his avarice and depravity, telling him that nothing but reverence for the keys of St. Peter hindered him from using harsher words, and that it was such as he that the Evangelist beheld in the vision, when he saw the woman with seven heads and ten horns, who committed whoredom with the kings of the earth.|$|E
