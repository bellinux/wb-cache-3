40|$|Equine <b>piroplasmosis</b> is a tick-borne protozoal {{infection}} of horses. <b>Piroplasmosis</b> {{may be difficult}} to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs.

Etiology Equine <b>piroplasmosis</b> results from infection by the protozoa Babesia caballi or Theileria equi (formerly Babesia equi). Both organisms belong to the phylum Apicomplexa and order Piroplasmida. They can infect an animal concurrently. Other related protozoa such as Babesia bovis (the organism that causes bovine babesiosis) have been reported rarely in horses. Species Affected Equine <b>piroplasmosis</b> affects horses, mules, donkeys and zebras. Zebras are an important reservoir for infection in Africa. Geographic Distribution The parasites that cause equine <b>piroplasmosis</b> are endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions including parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Europe.

The present study was planned to confirm the presence of <b>piroplasmosis</b> in camels from the Eastern region of the Sudan (Gedarif State) using microscopical (blood film) and molecular technique (PCR). A total of 55 camels of different sexes (34 females and 21 males) were sampled from four localities of the state between January 2011 and January 2012.

A total of 1990 sera were col-lected from clinically healthy horses in various districts located in ten different provinces of China and examined by using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with recombinant Theileria equi (T. equi) merozoite antigen 2 (rEMA- 2) and Babesia caballi (B. caballi) 48 -kDa rhoptry protein (rBc 48), respectively. The results showed that 1, 018 (51. 16 %) and 229 (11. 51 %) samples were positive for B. caballi and T. equi infection, respectively. The number of samples with mixed infection was 152 (7. 64 %).

Sci. 76 (4) : 549 – 552, 2014 Equine <b>piroplasmosis</b> is a tick-borne disease of horses, donkeys, mules and zebra. This disease is caused by two kinds of hemoprotozoan parasites, named as Babesia caballi (B. caballi) and Theileria equi (T. equi), both of which are transmitted by species of Ixodid ticks [5]. Clinically, the acute phase of the disease is characterized by fever, anorex-ia, weight loss, tachypnea and congestion of mucous mem...|$|E
40|$|The intra-erythrocytic {{parasite}} Theileria equi {{is one of}} two tick-transmitted causative {{agents of}} equine <b>piroplasmosis.</b> Piroplasms of T. equi can be transmitted across the equine placenta and once a horse is infected, it appears to remain a lifelong carrier, since anti-theilerial drugs suppress but do not eliminate the parasite. Carrier mares may transmit the organism to their offspring and this may result in abortion or neonatal <b>piroplasmosis,</b> but observations by some researchers suggest that foals may be born as carriers yet remain apparently healthy. Using a T. equi-specific oligonucleotide probe, we have determined that transplacental transmission occurs early in equine foetal development and that carrier mares may give birth to healthy carrier foals. Investigation of parasite levels and the effect of maternal colostrum on the newborn suggests that colostral T. equi antibody may act to suppress parasitaemia in the newborn, reducing the incidence of clinical neonatal <b>piroplasmosis.</b> B.
