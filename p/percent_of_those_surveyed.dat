It included the results of a survey of 115,000 active-duty and reserve service members. Across all service branches, 30 percent thought that integrating gays into the military would have negative consequences. In the Marine Corps and combat specialties, the percentage with that negative assessment ranged from 40 to 60 percent.

40|$|Background Intrahepatic {{cholestasis}} {{of pregnancy}} (ICP) is an uncommon obstetric condition characterised by intense maternal pruritis and biochemical abnormality. There is {{a degree of}} contention regarding the diagnosis and management of ICP, and currently, there are no nationally accepted guidelines. Aims To conduct a survey of Fellows and Members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) regarding their diagnosis and management ICP. Methods An online survey of currently practising RANZCOG Fellows and Members, utilising Survey Monkey. Results Thirty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> sent the <b>survey</b> responded, comprising approximately 40 % of practising obstetricians. Fasting bile acid and serum transaminase elevation {{in association with the}} characteristic itch define the disease process for the majority of respondents and also inform management decisions. There was no critical level of bile acid elevation that mandated treatment for the majority of respondents. Nearly 90 % of respondents induce women with ICP at 37 - 38 completed weeks of pregnancy, due to concerns regarding possible fetal demise. About one-third of respondents refer to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guideline to advise their decision-making process, and a similar proportion use local or hospital-based guidelines. Conclusions Elevated fasting bile acids and abnormal liver function tests define the diagnosis and inform management of ICP by Australian obstetricians. Routine induction of labour for patients with ICP at 37 - 38 completed weeks of pregnancy is widely practised in Australia. An evidence-based guideline would assist clinicians who manage such cases in Australia...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} colleges and {{universities}} are faced with the problem of retaining students in their residence halls. On campus after campus students demand to move out of residence halls into newly built apartment complexes. (8, 65) Most institutions of higher education have not responded to these demands and have maintained their policies of requiring undergraduates to live in approved housing, i. e. off-campus housing which has met certain requirements prescribed by the college or university. (8, 65) Some colleges, due to financial obligations, instituted policies which require students to live on-campus until they reach the age of twenty-one. Little research, however, has been done in relation to the student's feelings and opinions towards residence hall living or as to the reasons or factors influencing the student's decision to move off-campus. A number of speculations exist as to why students move out of the residence halls of Ball State University and seek housing elsewhere. Speculations are not realities and need research to verify them. It is the primary purpose of this study to determine-the reasons why students move from the residence halls of Ball State University into off-campus housing. Off-campus housing was defined as housing other than residence halls, married student housing, or campus housing associated with a particular academic area. It was also a purpose to obtain some of the students' ideas as to what could have been done to more adequately meet their own particular needs during their time spent in the residence hall. The study also intends to research and summarize current literature in the area. The study did have limitations. First, thirty-seven <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> students <b>surveyed</b> did not respond to the questionnaire. Also, it was not anticipated that students would leave the halls {{before the end of the}} quarter. Many did this and had to be contacted by mail, after having spent one month in off-campus housing. Before a college or university can provide for the changing needs of the students, their needs and feelings must be known. Residence halls can only be of maximum support to the total educational relationship among student groups within a living arrangement if their needs are well understood and accounted for in the design and the administration of the hall.

40|$|Objectives: Pediatric {{emergency}} department (PED) patients often present with non-urgent complaints. We attempted {{to estimate the}} perceived degree of urgency of the visit and to identify reasons for seeking non-urgent care in the PED by patients and parents. Methods: A prospective survey was completed by parents (for children 17 and younger) and patients (18 - 21) presenting to a suburban academic PED that sees approximately 15, 000 patients per year. A convenience sample of participants was enrolled. Results: Three hundred and five of 334 surveys were completed (91 % response rate) over a 3 -month period. Twenty-four <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the chief complaints were perceived by <b>those</b> <b>surveyed</b> as emergent or possibly life-threatening, 23 % were felt to be very urgent, and 52 % were deemed somewhat urgent or minor. Twentyfive <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with minor or somewhat urgent complaints arrived by ambulance. Weekend visits and minority race correlated with a lower degree of perceived urgency. Overall, 79 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>surveyed</b> identified a primary care provider (PCP) for themselves or their child. <b>Of</b> <b>those,</b> 54 % had attempted to contact the PCP prior to coming to the PED.
