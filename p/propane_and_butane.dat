25|$|Separated from a gas stream, NGLs are an {{undifferentiated}} {{batch of}} light hydrocarbons — ethane, <b>propane,</b> <b>butane</b> <b>and</b> condensate. To separate them into more valuable individual products requires fractionation facilities.

25|$|<b>Propane</b> <b>and</b> <b>butane</b> are gases at {{atmospheric}} pressure {{that can be}} liquefied at fairly low pressures and {{are commonly known as}} liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles, butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays.|$|E
25|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gases (or LPGs, {{another name}} for <b>propane</b> <b>and</b> <b>butane)</b> have to be contained well above atmospheric pressure to remain in liquid form. The partners therefore had to build special “breakout” facilities in Superior, Wisconsin, to enable this operation to work. They also had to construct batch receipt facilities, storage, and a fractionation plant at Sarnia. That plant went on stream in 1970.|$|E
25|$|SOFC {{systems can}} run on fuels other than pure {{hydrogen}} gas. However, since hydrogen {{is necessary for}} the reactions listed above, the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms. For the fuel cell to operate, the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas. SOFCs are capable of internally reforming light hydrocarbons such as methane (natural gas), <b>propane</b> <b>and</b> <b>butane.</b> These fuel cells are at an early stage of development.|$|E

25|$|In its strictest sense, {{petroleum}} includes only crude oil, but {{in common}} usage it includes all liquid, gaseous and solid hydrocarbons.

Although they do not participate directly in the reactions, and adversely impact product quality, they provide an avenue for organic fluorides to leave the unit. The propane stream is removed (typically in a tower called the HF stripper) and are then processed in the defluorinating section to remove combined fluorides and any trace acid that may be present due to mis-operation. Many units also remove Butane, which typically gets treated in a separate defluorinating section.|$|E
