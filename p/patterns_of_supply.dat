50|$|In {{the context}} of mineral supply chains, due {{diligence}} represents a holistic concept that aims at providing a chain of custody tracking from mine to export at country level, regional tracking of mineral flows {{through the creation of}} a database on their purchases, independent audits on all actors in the supply chain, and a monitoring of the whole mineral chain by a mineral chain auditor. In this sense, due diligence transcends conventional risk management approaches that usually focus on the prevention of direct impacts on the core business activities of companies. Moreover, due diligence focuses on a maximum of transparency as an end itself while risk management is always directed towards the end of averting direct damages. However, besides the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the OECD Guidance, there is still a gap in due diligence practices as international norms are just emerging. Studies found that the motivation for supply chain due diligence as well as expected outcomes of these processes vary among firms. Furthermore, different barriers, drivers, and implementation <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain due diligence have been identified in scholarly research.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{examine the}} {{relative}} roles {{of physical and}} biological processes involved in the recruitment of reef fishes, temporal and spatial <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and recruitment were measured for two fishes, Stegastes partitus (Poey) (Pomacentridae) and Acanthurus bahianus Castelnau (Acanthuridae), recruiting to Barbados, West Indies. Nightly light-trap collections of late-stage larvae were compared with patterns of juvenile recruitment. Otolith records provided estimates of larval duration and postsettlement age. Temporal patterns of larval supply were similar for both species: abundances peaked during the third-quarter moon. However, spatial patterns of larval supply varied between species: during large recruitment events, S. partitus larvae were more abundant in the south, A. bahianus in the north, suggesting that larval supply was not simply the result of passive transport. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> were subsequently maintained (S. partitus) or modified (A. bahianus) by juveniles. In general, densities of juvenile S. partitus were evenly distributed along the coast; however, during major events, spatial patterns of recruitment reflected patterns of larval supply. In contrast, densities of juvenile A. bahianus were directly opposite patterns of larval supply, suggesting that for some species, postsettlement processes such as habitat selection may be more influential in creating spatial patterns of recruitment...|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{demonstrate}} that yield of individual plants, and their allocation of biomass between roots and shoots, can be profoundly {{affected by the}} <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> soil-based resources. Patchy provision of soil-based resources can affect the location of root biomass, as roots often proliferate in nutrient-rich patches. Root system size is important in determining whether plants access nutrient-rich patches, {{and the proportion of}} root systems located within such patches. This proportion will alter as growth proceeds. Species with small root systems have a limited ability to place roots in nutrient-rich patches even when they are very close. Of four species with different root system sizes, the growth of the species with the smallest root system was significantly limited by being located in nutrient-poor substrate even when nutrient-rich substrate was only 3. 5 cm away, whereas three species with larger root systems were not disadvantaged. Both in the laboratory and in the field, root density is higher in nutrient-rich patches, and such patches can contain roots of many plants. Recent work showing that plants can respond to non-self roots sharing the same nutrient supply suggests that competition will be more severe in nutritionally patchy substrates than in homogeneous environments with the same overall nutrient supply. Taken together, these facts lead to the prediction that inter- and intraspecific plant interactions will be influenced by <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> nutrient <b>supply.</b> We present evidence supporting this prediction, and indicating that population and community structure are also affected by <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> nutrient <b>supply.</b> Significant differences in population yield, plant size distribution, and mortality have been recorded between populations growing under patchy and uniform conditions. Plant communities grown from identical seed inocula, with the same overall nutrient supply, provided in different spatial and temporal patterns, differed by up to 44 % in total biomass, up to 70 % in root biomass, and differed in species composition.

Neither the demography of the physician population in terms of age, gender composition, and geographic dispersion, nor the epidemiology of the Greek population, can explain the relatively high number of physicians in Greece. Despite the physician surplus, Greece faces serious geographical inequities regarding the distribution of physicians. There are also imbalances within the specialist category, with certain specialists (e. g., cardiologists) being in oversupply compared to other European countries, while others (e. g., general practitioners) remain weakly represented. Inadequate planning of human resources for health, inadequate health financing policy regarding primary care, gatekeeping mechanisms, and medical power constitute the primary themes explaining the trends of physicians' population in Greece...|$|E

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} por el sistema de compendio de publicaciones. Tesis con mención internacionalEcosystem services (ES) can {{be defined}} as the goods and services that ecosystems provide to the society for its well-being. The importance of ES in different fields of environmental sciences, ecology and land planning has been highlighted in recent years. The relevance of spatial aspects of the data describing ecosystems has driven the use of several spatial analysis techniques and methods for ES assessment. However, the extended use of Land Use/Land Cover maps may lead to uncertainty and bias due to oversimplification and generalization of the study area and associated elements. Ecosystem services and the ecological processes that generate them are strongly related. These processes are not constant at all spatial scales and display high levels of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Thus, appropriate selection of the data sources and analytical methods used to characterize the ecosystems is essential for development of accurate models and minimization of potential bias in the assessments. The general objective of this research was to carry out a multi-scale analysis <b>of</b> the spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> ES <b>supply</b> and the distribution of some ecosystems that provide the ES. Different data sources were used to characterize agricultural and forest landscapes in the NW Iberian Peninsula. Forests are major components of the landscape in the area, and several authors have highlighted the wide range of ES that these ecosystems provide. We first characterized the ecosystems in order to identify the areas where the main forest tree species in the area are growing. Quercus robur L. and Castanea sativa Mill. forests are mainly located in zones below 500 m where low temperatures do not usually occur. By contrast, Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Fagus sylvatica L. forests are associated with lower temperature zones at higher elevations. We then used digital soil cover data to analyze the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> six ES (provision of food, materials and energy, regulation of climate and erosion, and cultural services) by spatial statistical methods. We used the lacunarity metric to analyze the regularity <b>of</b> the no <b>supply</b> areas at multiple spatial scales. We found some divergence in the thresholds of spatial clustering of the ES and obtained higher values for food and materials provision. We also identified the spatial scales (extensions) at which the probability <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> each ES is maximized. In addition, we used a functional approach to analyze the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> a similar set of ES. We developed spatial models of these ES on the basis of Net Primary Production, calculated for a phenological year from Landsat 5 -TM data and using the ¿NDVI index. The index was then combined with some socio-environmental variables. We used two multi-scale metrics (lacunarity and four term local quadrat variance) to analyze the observed patterns. The analysis revealed clustered patterns for provisioning services and a more extended distribution for regulating services, with different characteristic spatial scales for each type. Finally, we used a high resolution forest thematic map to assess the potential <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> some ES from forest ecosystems. We thus explored the spatial relationships between these ES and found some differences between the ES associated with native forests and those supplied by forest plantations of exotic species. We also determined the zones with a high density of elements involved in ES supply at different spatial scales. This enabled us to identify the locations of the most important areas for some ecosystems in relation to the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> different ES in the NW Iberian Peninsula. Finally, we also analyzed the most characteristic spatial scales and the effect of different types of data sources on ES assessment...|$|R
