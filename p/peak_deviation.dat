With MRS, for example, spectroscopic information, such as the concentrations of chemical substances, can be determined non-invasively.

40|$|<b>Peak</b> <b>deviation</b> {{analysis}} is a quantitative technique for characterizing interresponse-time distributions {{that result from}} training on differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedules of reinforcement. It compares each rat's obtained interresponse-time distribution to the corresponding negative exponential distribution that would have occurred if the rat had emitted {{the same number of}} responses randomly in time, at the same rate. The comparison of the obtained distributions with corresponding negative exponential distributions provides the basis for computing three standardized metrics (burst ratio, peak location, and peak area) that quantitatively characterize the profile of the obtained interresponse-time distributions.

40|$|A {{computer}} program is developed {{to calculate the}} FM threshold impulse rates {{as a function of}} the carrier-to-noise ratio for a specified FM system. The system parameters and a vector of 1024 integers, representing the probability density of the modulating voltage, are required as input parameters.

As a result of the analysis several conclusions are drawn: (1) The use of preemphasis in an FM television system improves the threshold by reducing the impulse rate. (2) Sinusoidal modulation produces a total impulse rate which is a practical upper bound for the impulse rates of TV signals providing the same <b>peak</b> <b>deviations.</b> (3) As the moment of the FM spectrum about the center frequency of the predetection filter increases, the impulse rate tends to increase.

A {{time series}} of GONG Dopplergrams {{for the period}} 10 - 14 May 1997 from Udaipur and Big Bear sites {{has been used to}} measure the {{velocity}} fluctuations in the sunspot (NOAA active region 8038) and quiet photosphere simultaneously.

We also observe a relative <b>peak</b> frequency <b>deviation</b> of p-modes in the sunspot, of the order of 80 - 310 µHz, which shows a linear dependence on the magnetic field gradient in the active region. The maximum frequency deviation of 310 µHz on 12 May appears to be an influence of a long duration solar flare that occurred in this active region. We interpret this relative <b>peak</b> frequency <b>deviation</b> as either due to power re-distribution of p-modes in the sunspot or a consequence of frequency modulation of these modes along the magnetic flux tubes due to rapidly varying magnetic field structure...|$|R
30|$|Considering (4), it is {{observed}} that the moment of J has a reverse relation to dω/dt, and the D has a reverse relation to ∆ω. For example, when frequency starts to deviate from steady state, a larger inertia would present a stronger opposition to the RoCoF, limiting its <b>peak</b> <b>deviation.</b> However, a larger inertia would no longer be required when frequency starts to return to steady state. On the other hand, the damping power is typically calculated from the ∆ω. Any deviation from steady state produces a power that attempts to bring the frequency back to steady state. Moreover, more damping would help to restore the system frequency faster.|$|E

BACKGROUND: This device is designed for patients with mixed hearing loss subsequent to chronic middle ear infection, surgery, or trauma. This Bell-Vibroplasty is built from a VIBRANT MED-EL Vibrant Soundbridge and a Kurz Bell titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis. METHODS: In three fresh TBs, healthy and reconstructed middle ears were analyzed by means of laser Doppler interferometry. The sound transmission properties of a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis and a passive and an active Bell-Vibroplasty were compared with healthy middle ear function. RESULTS: The measurements provided reliable results with small standard deviations and good signal-to-noise ratios. The performance levels of the partial ossicular replacement prosthesis and of the passive Bell-Vibroplasty were comparable with that of healthy middle ear function. The activated Bell-Vibroplasty provided linear function and a flat frequency response within the measured frequency range (500 Hz- 8 kHz), with <b>peak</b> <b>deviations</b> of less than 10 dB. The maximum output of the Bell-Vibroplasty was equivalent to 125 -dB sound pressure level. CONCLUSION: Bell-Vibroplasty is feasible in TBs.

The UPFC offers an effective means to enhance improvement in the power transfer capability of the tie-line. The main application of UPFC is to stabilize the frequency oscillations of the inter-area mode in the interconnected power system by the dynamic control of tie-line power flow. The Redox flow batteries, which are not aged to the frequent charging and discharging, have a quick response and outstanding function during overload conditions. In addition to leveling load, the battery is advantageous for secondary control in the power system and maintenance of power quality of distributed power resources. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of UPFC and the cost function of the two area power system along with the integral controller.

However, relatively {{little is known about}} the direction, magnitude and distribution of induced fields and current flow in tissue, and optimal setup characteristics remain largely undetermined. Further, the profound influence of brain size and shape as well as of brain tissue irregularity on actual stimulation patterns is unclear. We model the conductive phenomena induced in brain tissue by TMS by solving the quasistatic problem over a realistic head model of 1 mm resolution derived from anatomical MRI scans using a finite difference successive overrelaxation procedure. The magnetic field is calculated from digitized coil geometry and realistic stimulator parameters. Stimulation with a symmetrical primary electric field results in electric field and current density distributions which are highly asymmetrical both in magnitude and in direction (i. e. distributed, non-contiguous stimulation <b>peaks,</b> <b>deviation</b> of stimulated area from coil "hot spot", sudden jumps in stimulation intensity and non-zero current flow across tissue interfaces). Knowledge of coil and stimulator specifications alone is hence not sufficient to control stimulation conditions, and a stereotaxic setup coupled with an individually adjusted field solver appears essential in performing reliable TMS studies. Our results bear direct relevance to any application of TMS, both investigative and therapeutic. © 2008...|$|R
