The first weekday service departs at 05:20 from Tweedbank with the last service leaving Edinburgh at 23:54.

25|$|The new {{timetable}} {{concentrated on}} key points at Oxted, East Grinstead and the Ashurst-Groombridge-Birchden triangle. It also introduced {{the concept of}} a regular hourly service. Off-peak services now departed Victoria for East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells West at 8 minutes <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> and from Tunbridge Wells West for Victoria at 47 minutes <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> A push-and-pull service worked the section from Tunbridge Wells West via Edenbridge Town, connecting at Oxted with London trains. A push-pull service was also introduced between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, also providing connections on the main line in both directions. London trains were scheduled to cross in the High Level for a few minutes each hour, ensuring that at a certain time each hour all three trains were together in the station. At Groombridge connections were made with Brighton and Eastbourne services.|$|E

The first 50 {{minutes of the}} program were initially broadcast from Asia and Europe, with the United States leg of the show starting at 50 minutes <b>past</b> <b>the</b> first <b>hour.</b> <b>The</b> three anchors were together for just 20 minutes, from :50 <b>past</b> <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> to :10 <b>past</b> <b>the</b> second <b>hour.</b> Also, <b>the</b> Asian leg of Worldwide Exchange was no longer featured after :10 <b>past</b> <b>the</b> second <b>hour,</b> to which <b>the</b> show was broadcast only from Europe and the United States from that point forward.|$|R

25|$|England {{had lost}} four wickets for six runs, and were 31 for 4 with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen survived {{what looked like}} an edge on the first ball he faced, {{and went on to}} make 20 before he was given out in a similar {{situation}} from Shane Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell took England's lead past 150, and with Bell having batted <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, he needed 29 more for his half-century when he gave a tiny edge to Gilchrist.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 2000s, several American {{networks}} {{have begun to}} start certain shows shortly before or after :00 or :30 <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> to avert audience loss. Global does not necessarily follow this practice, meaning {{the last few minutes}} of the preceding show may be lost to those watching the U.S. network. For instance, if NBC schedules The Apprentice to start at 9:02, but Global schedules its start for exactly 9:00, the last two minutes of NBC's 8:00 program may be blocked by the Global signal. This is not unique to Global and may vary by service provider, since cable/satellite providers, not the networks, are responsible for scheduling and initiating simsubs.|$|E

25|$|Before BBC News {{moved to}} Broadcasting House, an hourly {{business}} update was included during the weekday schedule from the BBC Business Unit. There were two shifts, from 08:30–14:00 and 14:00–23:00, presented by Penny Haslam, Maryam Moshiri, Ben Thompson, Adam Parsons, Susannah Streeter, Joe Lynam, Sara Coburn or Sally Eden. News Channel updates were usually broadcast at 40 minutes <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> between 08:00 and 23:00. The 21:40 round-up was often earlier and the 22:40 bulletin is an extended round-up of the day's business news. Until May 2009, the business updates on the BBC News Channel were broadcast {{from one of}} the London Stock Exchange's studios in central London. From then until March 2013 the bulletins were provided from the channel's studio at BBC Television Centre. The business updates were axed in March 2013 as part of the BBC's Delivering Quality First plan. But after complaints returned in November 2013. Stock market updates now only appear during the quarter-to-the-hour headlines, but it was changed after complaints in November with Ben Thompson and Victoria Friz are the main presenters sharing 08:00–14:00 or 14:00–18:00 between them. With Alice Baxter, Jamie Robertson, Aaron Heslehurst and Sally Bundock offer relief. There is normally an extended bulletin at 16:45 when the main business stories of the day are discussed on Afternoon Live.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May, Arsenal {{announced}} the line-up for the 2014 Emirates Cup, an annual tournament {{held at the}} Emirates Stadium. The tournament will consist of Arsenal (the hosts), Spanish side Valencia (who last participated in inaugural Emirates Cup), Portuguese side Benfica and Ligue 1 outfit Monaco. Arsenal will play Benfica on 2 August 2014, followed by Monaco a day later. The winners are crowned based on points accumulated and goals scored (with shots taken being taken into account if standings remain level). The last friendly to be announced for Arsenal {{turned out to be}} the opening fixture of the pre-season schedule, with the non-World Cup participating squad members involved against Conference South side Boreham Wood. The match finished 2–0 to the Gunners following second half strikes from Kristoffer Olsson in the 68th minute and a penalty from striker Benik Afobe in the 86th minute in what proved to be a stern test for Arsène Wenger's side. Arsenal began their Emirates Cup campaign opening to Benfica on 2 August. Starting the match with a high tempo, Arsenal found the breakthrough in the 26th minute following a goal by Yaya Sanogo, who scored his first goal in his Arsenal career, despite having 14 first team appearances last term. Arsenal continued the high tempo, and five minutes before time, Héctor Bellerín picked out Joel Campbell, who struck a volley past goalkeeper Artur to give Arsenal a two-goal advantage. Sanogo soon completed his hat-trick by netting twice in the space of as many minutes, as he first rolled into an empty net and then prodded past Artur after being picked out from the left by Kieran Gibbs. Arsenal entered half time with a 4–0 lead, and looked sure to progress further into the competition. Four minutes after the restart and Sanogo had his fourth, with Artur spilling a low drive from Ramsey into his path before calmly slotting home. However, Benfica pulled one back just <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, with a long throw from Maxi Pereira touched on for Nicolás Gaitán to nod in from close range, but Arsenal managed to progress after a busy afternoon in North London, with the match showcasing the debuts of Chilean Alexis Sánchez from the bench, along with Wenger opting to start £16million signing Calum Chambers.|$|E

The next day, a wrong-side failure occurred involving three signals between Tonbridge and Hastings. Contractors had made errors in the wiring of the signal heads. With the inauguration of electric services, a half-hourly service was operated, with trains departing from Charing Cross at 15 and 45 minutes <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> Those departing at xx:15 called at , Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, High Brooms, Tunbridge Wells, Wadhurst, Battle, St Leonards Warrior Square and Hastings, taking 84 minutes.

The Royal Train visited the line on 6 May, conveying Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. It was stabled at Wadhurst whilst she ate lunch. The train was hauled by a Class 73 diesel-electric locomotive. Upon electrification, services were operated by 4CEP, 4CIG and 4VEP electric multiple units. Class 508 electric multiple units also operated services on the line. When these units were withdrawn in the mid-2000s, they were replaced by Class 375 Electrostar, Class 465 Networker and Class 466 Networker units.|$|E
