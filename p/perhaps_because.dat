5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of the internal troubles in Bundu at that time, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of {{the great}} and {{definitive}} works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return. In Casale Monferrato, Bartolomeo died two years later. Matteo, who started alongside his father, continued and ended his career in Piedmont, near Turin, where he left many of his better known works.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{honored the}} American {{alligator}} in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911. In that year, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment decision to print an alligator emblem on {{a shipment of}} the schools football pennants; the mascot stuck, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> the team captain's nickname was Gator.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> of {{the modest}} {{commercial}} {{success of this}} album, and <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> of the habit of distancing themselves musically from their most recent work, Tennant and Lowe have since returned to their dance roots. One year {{after the release of}} Release, Pet Shop Boys released Disco 3 which included remixes of some of the songs from Release along with new material that they were working on at the time of writing/producing material for Release.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} in the south-western corner of Merton College is also called Grove. The name <b>perhaps</b> derives <b>because</b> this area {{used to be an}} orchard.|$|R
50|$|Speakers of {{auxiliary}} languages {{have also}} struggled for their recognition, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> {{they are used}} primarily as second languages and have few native speakers.|$|R
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle {{has demonstrated}} compassion and empathy {{for victims of}} domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of her mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
5|$|The Synod of Whitby, which {{debated whether}} the Northumbrian church should follow the Roman or the Celtic method of dating Easter, {{was held in}} 664. Deusdedit {{does not appear to}} have been present, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of an {{outbreak}} of the plague prevalent in England at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{anonymous}} fourth-century compilation Medicina Plinii {{contains more}} than 1,100 pharmacological recipes, {{the vast majority of}} them from the Historia naturalis; <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> Pliny's name was attached to it, it enjoyed huge popularity in the Middle Ages.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{understand}} that," [...] said Polychrome, with a puzzled look; [...] "but <b>perhaps</b> it's <b>because</b> I'm accustomed {{only to the}} music of the spheres." ...|$|R
50|$|The Commission {{considered}} {{the establishment of}} new waterfowl refuges. While <b>perhaps</b> unimportant <b>because</b> of the Great Depression, the act was an important step for the conservation movement.|$|R
60|$|And this note, {{which was}} just what she would have sent to a lover, took that form, <b>perhaps</b> unconsciously, <b>because</b> she {{had never had a}} lover thus to write to.|$|R
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> {{there was no one to}} replace him and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 {{identified the}} site as a chambered long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have {{been defined as}} having long earthen mounds with wooden internal structures, whereas chambered tombs, while also being covered by a long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows with wooden internal structures {{have been identified in}} southeast Wales, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> long barrows were usually built where there was no suitable stone.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E
50|$|In American English, {{the term}} has evolved to {{describe}} the final event of a sporting season, e.g. in soccer or motocross, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> of the popularity of these with television viewers.|$|R
60|$|SCHUTZMACHER. Well, {{of course}} I shant {{if you feel}} that way about it. But I dont think you {{understand}} Dubedat. However, <b>perhaps</b> thats <b>because</b> I'm a Jew. Good-night, Dr Blenkinsop [shaking hands].|$|R
6000|$|<b>Perhaps</b> it was <b>because</b> Johnny, {{even at that}} moment, {{hated the}} man; <b>perhaps</b> it was <b>because</b> at that moment he loved and {{believed}} in Florry, {{or perhaps it was}} only that because at that moment he was nearer the greater Truth than his questioner, but he said, in a husky voice, [...] "You lie!" ...|$|R
5|$|Despite this, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and {{he received a}} command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, {{he was an old}} man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the canons of Dunblane with the {{responsibility}} of selecting a successor. Bishop Nicholas had died sometime between 1306 (after his last attestation on 26 January) and late 1307. The election was done by compromissarii (a short-list of canons delegated to perform election), with John, Abbot of Arbroath excluded from the vote, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of his known pro-English tendencies.|$|E
5|$|In 1254 or 1255, Henry III {{received}} an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his ‘Chronica Majora’. A wooden structure {{was built to}} house the elephant, 12.2m (40ft) long by 6.1m (20ft) wide. The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, but also <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of the cold climate of England.|$|E
6000|$|... “An unmannerly, Arcadian {{state of}} affairs. I am glad you like it. <b>Perhaps</b> it’s <b>because</b> you were {{intelligent}} enough to perceive that I {{was not in}} love with you in any sort of style.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not too large, a house," [...] she pleaded. [...] "I {{know you}} think I'm silly, but this extravagance we see {{everywhere}} does make me uneasy. <b>Perhaps</b> it's <b>because</b> I'm provincial, and always shall be." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} (or <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> of) {{the fact the}} two men did not get along, the {{combined}} influence of King and General Douglas MacArthur increased the allocation of resources to the Pacific War.|$|R
5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} for the nomination, {{refused to be}} the Democratic candidate, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> he had already {{decided to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|In spite or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of {{his role}} in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
6000|$|Probably {{most young}} men who find {{themselves}} with riches at large {{in the world have}} some such perplexity as this mixed in with the gift. Such men as the Cecils <b>perhaps</b> not, <b>because</b> they are in the order of things, the rich young Jews <b>perhaps</b> not, <b>because</b> acquisition is their principle, but for most other intelligent inheritors there must be this twinge of conscientious doubt. [...] "Why particularly am I picked out for so tremendous an advantage?" [...] If the riddle is not Nolan, then it is rent, or it is the social mischief of the business, or the particular speculative COUP that established their fortune.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{nine years}} since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. <b>Perhaps</b> it's <b>because</b> of the girl who sang them. Somehow, I felt sorry for her. She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Israelis {{have not}} gushed over {{the book as}} some Americans have. <b>Perhaps</b> that is <b>because</b> they know {{the reality of the}} Palestinians' existence, as great Zionists of the past knew. <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>because</b> most {{understand}} the danger of trying to deny a people identity. As Professor Porath says, 'Neither historiography nor the Zionist cause itself gains anything from mythologizing history.' ...|$|R
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of {{the large}} income the Abbot was sustaining, Bishop Alnwick appears to have not taken strong {{measures}} against the Abbot's indiscretions. He ordered {{that the number of}} canons should be increased to 30 and the number of boys in the almonry increased to 16. The Bishop also ordered proper accounts to be kept and forbade the abbot from granting favours without the permission of both the Bishop and the Canons.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types began to blur, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
50|$|During the Crusades, Samaritans, {{like the}} non-Latin Christian {{inhabitants}} of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, were second-class citizens, but they were tolerated and <b>perhaps</b> favored <b>because</b> they were docile and had been mentioned positively in the Christian New Testament.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000 Weldon {{became a}} member of the Church of England and was {{confirmed}} in St Paul's Cathedral, which was <b>perhaps</b> appropriate <b>because</b> she states that she likes to think that she was [...] "converted by St Paul".|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it <b>perhaps</b> then <b>because</b> it's so bad--because your {{industry}} {{as you call}} it, IS so vulgar--that Mr. Chad won't come back? Does he feel the taint? Is he staying away not to be mixed up in it?" ...|$|R
