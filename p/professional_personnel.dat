25|$|Prior to May 1941, the Queensland Government had {{established}} {{only a small}} number of Air Raid Precaution (ARP) posts. These posts were scattered across Brisbane and were staffed by <b>professional</b> <b>personnel</b> drawn from the various emergency services. The ARP post established at the St Johns Wood Recreation Hall in Laird Street on 17 May 1941 was different. It was organised through the local community and it was staffed and largely equipped by civilian volunteers. To encourage the formation of more community-run ARP posts, a procession involving civil defence organisations from different Brisbane suburbs assembled at the Jubilee Tce police station and marched to the new ARP post for its official opening. The St John's Wood ARP post was a new concept as community-based volunteers who provided both their expertise and some of the equipment required to run it. Mr. W.R. Johnstone, a resident of Piddington Street, established this new ARP post. He paid to equip the first-aid centre and Mr. E.A. Hawkins of Clayfield arranged premises in a room of the St Johns Wood Hall. Local registered nurse G. Weight offered to staff the centre, while her husband R.J. Weight offered his car as a temporary ambulance. Other local residents also volunteered their own cars and trucks and Mr. C.W. Bellingham lectured on first-aid.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} educators' preferences for learning technology integration skills {{in order to}} provide the education community with justifiable data concerning the need for educator training alternatives. A survey was distributed to compare preservice educators, inservice educators, and <b>professional</b> development <b>personnel's</b> perceived effectiveness of eight training methods (N= 759). The four research questions examined were: Do differences exist among preservice educators, inservice educators, and <b>professional</b> development <b>personnel</b> in the perceived effectiveness of different methods for learning technology integration skills? (2) Do differences exist among preservice educators, inservice educators, and <b>professional</b> development <b>personnel</b> in the perceived effectiveness of different methods for learning technology integration skills when categorized by age? (3) Do differences exist among preservice educators, inservice educators, and <b>professional</b> development <b>personnel</b> in the perceived effectiveness of different methods for learning technology integration skills when categorized by total hours of instruction? (4) Do differences exist among preservice educators, inservice educators, and <b>professional</b> development <b>personnel</b> in the perceived effectiveness of different methods for learning technology integration skills when categorized by locus of control? All groups were measured for similarities and differences in preferences on credit classes, workshops, open computer labs, technology personnel support, peer support, online help, printed documentation, and trial and error. In addition, those training preferences were cross-referenced with age, training hours, and the locus of control personality factor. MANOVAs and post-hoc analyses were performed for each major research question as well as trends in the data were examined. This study indicated that the most effective training methods were technical support, peer support, and credit courses. The least effective training methods were online help, printed documentation, workshops, and computer labs. Age, amount of training hours, and locus of control score did not provide as much information as did educator type when predicting training preference. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that educator training programs be revamped to include the methods that the educators themselves have affirmed as effective for learning technology integration skills. This assures that teachers are prepared to integrate technology into the curriculum and students are prepared for a technological society...|$|R
