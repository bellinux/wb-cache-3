5|$|During her narrative, Penelope expresses {{opinions}} on several people, addresses historical misconceptions, and comments on life in Hades. She is most critical of Helen whom Penelope blames for ruining her life. Penelope identifies Odysseus' specialty as making <b>people</b> <b>look</b> like fools and wonders why his stories have survived so long, despite being an admitted liar. She dispels the rumour that she slept with Amphinomus and the rumour that she slept {{with all the}} suitors and consequently gave birth to Pan.|$|E
5|$|West Germans {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did <b>people</b> <b>look</b> forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E

25|$|Professional photographers {{prefer to}} use ambient light or {{indirect}} flash, as the red-eye reduction system does not always prevent red eyes— for example, if <b>people</b> <b>look</b> away during the pre-flash. In addition, people do not look natural with small pupils, and direct lighting from close to the camera lens is considered to produce unflattering photographs.|$|E
25|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{an important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how people remember traumatic things. An increase in blood flow to this area has been shown when <b>people</b> <b>look</b> at scary faces, or remember traumatic events. Research has also shown that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is a crucial site of neural changes that occur during fear conditioning.|$|E

Everyone does {{homage to the}} new Venus and Candaules, drunk with pride, {{declares}} his consort to be the true Venus. Nisia declines these compliments, but Candaules orders the statue of Venus {{to be removed from}} its pedestal and Nisia lifted in its place. Candaules and his courtiers acclaim her as a goddess. The warriors present arms and the women strew flowers at her feet. All at once, the sky grows dark and the priests and <b>people</b> <b>look</b> away in fear, while Candaules, in his arrogance, seems to defy the powers of Heaven.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the Ephemeris {{attributed}} to Dictys of Crete, {{who claims to}} have been present at the Trojan War, was probably written in the 1st century CE or perhaps a little earlier. It falls into a tradition of anti-Homeric literature, based on the supposition that Homer got most things about the Trojan War wrong by making virtuous <b>people</b> <b>look</b> like villains, and vice versa. It is important because later historians took Dictys as a historical record, including Sisyphus of Cos, John Malalas, George Cedrenus, John of Antioch, and others. Many Western mediaeval writers also accepted Dictys (in the Latin summary by Lucius Septimius) as the definitive account of the Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|When two <b>people</b> <b>look</b> at two {{different}} detectors that scan entangled particles, both observers will enter an indefinite state, as with one observer. These results need not agree – the second observer's mind {{does not have}} to have results that correlate with the first's. When one observer tells the results to the second observer, their two minds cannot communicate and thus will only interact with the other's body, which is still indefinite. When the second observer responds, its body will respond with whatever result agrees with the first observer's mind. This means that both observer's minds will be in a state of the wavefunction that always get the expected results, but individually their results could be different.|$|E

Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having {{been a member of}} message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as feeling like a real forum experience, saying that while <b>people</b> <b>look</b> at pixels at their screen, a real person is on the other side, and that both parties get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them.|$|E

If <b>people</b> <b>look</b> at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E
25|$|East Germans were {{subjected}} to far more stringent restrictions. The East German constitution of 1949 granted citizens a theoretical right to leave the country, though it was hardly respected in practice. Even this limited right was removed in the constitution of 1968 which confined citizens' freedom of movement to the area within the state borders. It was not until November 1964 that {{they were allowed to}} visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did <b>people</b> <b>look</b> forward to old age. East German pensioners were able to visit the West for up to four weeks in a year, but were not permitted to take more than a token 10East German marks with them, requiring them to depend on the support of relatives, churches and the West German government. As they were retired, they were seen by the East German government as economically unimportant and no great loss if they defected. The vast majority, though, chose to return {{home at the end of}} their stay.|$|E

25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young <b>people</b> <b>look</b> forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her wonder at the change in her life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if she is really in love – with a complete stranger. Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This will also help him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds and he looks forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E
