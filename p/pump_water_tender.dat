50|$|The {{service is}} also {{reviewing}} requirements for a breathing apparatus tender. The standard appliances (Rescue <b>Pumps</b> and <b>Water</b> <b>Tenders)</b> are crewed {{by at least}} four {{and as many as}} six firefighters, while specialist units such as the Aerial Ladder Platforms are crewed by a minimum of two.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} front line {{appliance}} deployed to all emergency calls goes {{by a variety}} of names, including Rescue Ladder, <b>Pump</b> Ladder, <b>Water</b> Rescue <b>Tender,</b> or slight variations on those names.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, the Service {{announced}} {{they would be}} purchasing brand new fire appliances to replace existing appliances in Essex. Under a money-saving purchasing agreement with Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, 42 new Angloco Scania appliances will, and are, currently being rolled out to fire stations across Essex over the span of 4 years. They will replace: Heavy Rescue Pumps (HRP), Rescue <b>Pumps</b> (RP) and <b>Water</b> Rescue <b>Tenders</b> (WrT). The Heavy Rescue Pumps have already been rolled out to fire stations and are in-service. The Rescue <b>Pumps</b> and <b>Water</b> <b>Tenders</b> are currently being prepared and soon to be rolled out to the remaining fire stations.|$|R
50|$|Typically <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> support engines and/or trucks like aerials in fires. <b>Water</b> <b>tenders</b> {{can be used}} also in {{chemical}} accidents, to clean highways after collisions, or <b>pump</b> <b>water</b> in floods. Some <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> carry fire fighting equipment and crew much like an engine. These <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> are able to operate relatively independently. Some <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> actually combine a fire engine and <b>water</b> <b>tender.</b> This kind of unit may have seats {{for up to six}} firefighters, a water tank of more than 3000 gallons (approx. 11 000 litres), and basic equipment for firefighting and rescue. This configuration may be found, for example, in rural areas, where a fire engine (with rescue equipment) and <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> are supported by a combined fire engine/water tender unit in overlapping fires or accidents. Numerous wildland <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> have remotely controlled nozzles mounted on the front bumper to allow them to drive alongside a fire or smoldering area and efficiently wet it down without the crew leaving the rig. Very light <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> are sometimes used in wildfires. For example, a small tank of 265 gallons (1000 litres) can be carried by a cross-country vehicle to extinguish smoldering stubs on rough terrain.|$|R

50|$|A <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> ladder's major {{capabilities}} include {{pumping up}} to 3,000 litres (660 gallons) per minute between two locations. It has a storage capacity of 1,800 litres (396 gallons). The pump carries {{a range of}} ladders up to 13.5 m. Inside the cab are four sets of compressed air breathing apparatus. Each pump has several lockers on the external of the pump. Inside there {{is a set of}} powered hydraulic rescue equipment, a thermal imaging camera, water rescue equipment, a positive pressure ventilation fan and safety at height equipment. There are occasions when a <b>Water</b> <b>Tender,</b> and not the <b>Water</b> <b>Tender</b> Ladder, would be mobilised first.

50|$|Three Garratt {{locomotive}} {{classes were}} designed as tank-and-tender Garratts and rarely worked without auxiliary <b>water</b> <b>tenders.</b> The Type X-17 <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> were originally numbered for these engines {{in the number}} ranges as shown.|$|R
50|$|Type X-17 <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> {{first entered}} service in 1938, as {{auxiliary}} <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> to the Class GM 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain type Garratt steam locomotives which entered {{service on the}} South African Railways in that year.|$|R
50|$|A <b>water</b> <b>tender,</b> {{also known}} as a tanker in some regions, is a {{specialized}} firefighting apparatus designed for transporting water from a water source to a fire scene. <b>Water</b> <b>tenders</b> are capable of drafting water from a stream, lake or hydrant.|$|R
50|$|Photographs {{from the}} 1940s show the {{original}} <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> {{with a traditional}} high turret. The <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> of 1938 had a water capacity of 6750 imp gal and rode on diamond-frame bogies (similar to North American Archbar trucks) with elliptical springs.|$|R
50|$|The 1600 imp gal {{on-board}} {{water tank}} {{on the front}} engine unit was only used when the <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> was temporarily disconnected from the engine at running sheds, where the locomotives had to detach and run around their <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> to change direction. While the locomotives were still shedded at Braamfontein before the new depot at Millsite in Krugersdorp was opened, their <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> were usually only re-attached when the engines left the depot to save space.|$|R
50|$|A <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> {{typically}} carries some {{fire fighting}} equipment. There are various national standards and recommendations on equipment {{to be carried}} on <b>water</b> <b>tenders.</b> Some <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> may carry various kinds of hoses and spray nozzles for use in forest, building, or industrial fires, {{as well as a}} portable water tank. In addition, tools like axes, flashlights, chemical portable fire extinguishers, a water extinguisher, an SCBA (Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus), a first aid kit, adapters, and a hydrant wrench can be required.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} Class GM, the Class GMA's water supply was {{augmented}} by semi-permanently coupling a purpose-built auxiliary <b>water</b> <b>tender.</b> The first batch of 25 locomotives were tended {{by the same}} Type X-17 <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> which was used with the Class GM, with a capacity of between 6750 and 6815 imp gal. The rest of the locomotives were tended by Type X-20 <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> with a capacity of 6790 imp gal. The tenders were numbered for their engines and were painted black with red buffer beams.|$|R

In 1974 and 1975, experiments were conducted near Buckeye, Arizona to study the influence of municipal waste water on the growth and yield of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Two sources of irrigation water were used: (i) <b>pump</b> <b>water</b> from local wells (control treatment) and (ii) municipal waste <b>water</b> and <b>pump</b> <b>water</b> in a 50 : 50 mixture. Cotton irrigated with the waste <b>water</b> and <b>pump</b> <b>water</b> mixture grew taller with more vegetative growth than did cotton that was irrigated with <b>pump</b> <b>water</b> alone. When cotton was irrigated with the waste <b>water</b> and <b>pump</b> <b>water</b> mixture, the yields of seed cotton and lint cotton were higher than the yields from cotton irrigated with <b>pump</b> <b>water.</b> Cotton irrigated with waste <b>water</b> and <b>pump</b> <b>water</b> produced lint of the same quality as did cotton irrigated with only <b>pump</b> <b>water.</b> Municipal waste water can be used effectively {{as a source of}} irrigation water and plant nutrients in the commercial production of cotton in Arizona and, possibly, in similar environments throughout the world.
