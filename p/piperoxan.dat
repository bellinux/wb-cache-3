50|$|Allegedly, {{the first}} {{antihistamine}} to be discovered: <b>Piperoxan.</b> See also for Spiroxatrine, coupled with Spirodecanone.|$|E
50|$|The first H1-antihistamine {{discovered}} was <b>piperoxan,</b> by Ernest Fourneau and Daniel Bovet (1933) {{in their}} efforts to develop a guinea pig animal model for anaphylaxis at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Bovet {{went on to win the}} 1957 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contribution. Following their discovery, the first-generation H1-antihistamines were developed in the following decades. They can be classified on the basis of chemical structure, and agents within these groups have similar properties.|$|E
50|$|Regarding {{curative}} medicine, {{it was in}} 1911 that it {{took off}} at the Pasteur Institute, when Ernest Fourneau created the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, which he directed until 1944, and from which emerged numerous drugs, among which one can mention the first pentavalent arsenical treatment (Stovarsol), the first synthetic alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Prosympal), the first antihistamine (<b>Piperoxan),</b> the first active drug on heart rate (Dacorene) or the first synthetic no-depolarising muscle relaxant (Flaxedil). The discovery of the therapeutic properties of sulfanilamide by Tréfouël, Nitti and Bovet, in the laboratory of Fourneau, {{paved the way for}} the sulfamidotherapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piperoxan,</b> {{also known}} as benodaine, is a drug which was the very first {{antihistamine}} to be discovered. This compound, derived from benzodioxan, was prepared in the early 1930s by Daniel Bovet and Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute in France. Formerly investigated by Fourneau as an α-adrenergic-blocking agent, they demonstrated that it also antagonized histamine-induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs, and published their findings in 1933. Bovet {{went on to win}} the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contribution, and one of their students, Anne-Marie Staub, published the first structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of antihistamines in 1939.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{recognition of}} pheochromocytoma {{as a cause}} of hypertension is still a difficult problem for which the many tests that have been devised are at times inadequate. In this article an anti-diuretic response to <b>piperoxan</b> in patients with pheochromocytoma is described. In view of the diuretic response of patients without pheochromocytoma, measurement of urinary flow after in-jection of <b>piperoxan</b> is suggested as a possible simple, confirmatory guide in diagnosis. IN NORMAL man infusions of epinephrine or norepinephrine tend to promote excre-tion of dilute urine at normal or increased rates of flow; the urine flow decreases sharply when the infusions are withdrawn. ' The present report describes an analogous antidiuresis ob-served in patients with functioning pheo-chromocytoma in whom sudden partial with-drawal of adrenal medullary hormone was simulated by giving <b>piperoxan</b> (benzodioxane, 933 F). Concurrent changes in other renal func-tions are also described. The responses to the drug are compared with those found in patients without functioning pheochromocytoma, from 2 of whom such tumors had been removed, and 6 of whom showed arterial hypertension {{at the time of the}} study. In comparison with the many careful ob-servations of the effect of this drug on arterial pressure 2 ' 3 its effects on renal function have received scant attention. Further, the observa-tions indicate that the response of urine flow to administration of <b>piperoxan</b> may be a useful confirmatory observation in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. METHODS The study is based on measurements of plasma clearances of para-aminohippurate at low plasma concentrations (CPAH) and mannitol (CM), urine flow (V), and arterial pressure by brachial ausculta-tion (B. P.). The patients were not especially pre...|$|E
40|$|Three <b>piperoxan</b> analogues, {{derived from}} {{the opening of the}} benzodioxane ring and/or {{replacement}} of the oxygen atom with the less polar sulfur, were synthesized. The decrease of the -blocking activity found for these compounds showed that the binding site of benzodioxane-like compounds does not accept the substitution with less polar groups...|$|E
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{was used}} to optimize the buffer pH, ionic strength and sulfated cyclodextrin concentrations for enantiomeric separation of <b>piperoxan.</b> These enantioseparation conditions were then applied to a classical gel electrophoresis system. Binding constants of the sulfated beta-cyclodextrin–piperoxan couple were approximated using CE {{and the effects of}} organic solvents on the system were also investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{adrenergic}} receptors in {{the isolated}} feline middle cerebral artery were characterized pharmacologically using a sensitive system for recording circular contractions in vitro. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol. and phenylephrine contracted the vessel in the mentioned order of potency. Together with the inhibitory patterns obtained with graded doses of <b>piperoxan</b> (reversible competitive inhibition) and dibenamine or phenoxybenzamine (irreversible competitive inhibition), these {{results showed that}} the contraction was mediated by alpha receptors. With <b>piperoxan</b> and norepinephrine, the mean value for pA, was 7. 06 and for K H 1. 24 > 10 7 M. The mean value for K A calculated for norepinephrine before and after partial irreversible blockade of the alpha receptors with phenoxybenzamine was 1. 73 x 10 "M. The norepinephrine response was not directly proportional to the amount of receptors occupied; ED 60 was reached when only about 11 * 7 of the receptors were occupied and the EAm response was obtained when 75 r 7 of the receptors were occupied. Dilation was achieved only after an active tonic contraction ha...|$|E
40|$|The contractions of the {{isolated}} guinea-pig vas deferens {{in response to}} stimulation of the sympathetic hypogastric nerve were potentiated by low concentrations and inhibited by high concentrations of the antiadrenaline agents tolazoline, yohimbine, ergotamine, phenoxybenzamine and <b>piperoxan.</b> Eserine potentiated the contractions of the vas deferens produced by hypogastric nerve stimulation. The cholinesterase activity of an extract of vas deferens was decreased by the antiadrenaline agents. The potentiation of responses to sympathetic stimulation by antiadrenaline drugs, which also possess anticholinesterase activity, can be explained {{on the basis of}} a cholinergic sympathetic mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was done to {{evaluate}} the hypotensive properties and the mechanisms action of the leaf aqueous extract in anaesthetized normotensive rats through a direct blood pressure measurement. The {{results showed that the}} extract caused a dose dependent fall in mean arterial pressure. Bilateral vagotomy did not abolished the hypotension induced by S. birrea. Pretreatment of rats with atropine, <b>piperoxan</b> and practolol did not abolished hypotension and suggests that muscarinic, α 2 and β 2 receptors are not involved in the induction of hypotension. These results suggest that the hypotensive effect of the extract is likely to be mediated through other factors like nitric oxide release or intracellular calcium decrease...|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} {{autonomic}} receptors were studied in isolated, 2 X 10 mm-size strips from the protruding {{part of human}} Graafian follicles obtained shortly before ovulation. The strip was mounted in an organ bath for recording of mechanical activity {{in the presence of}} different agonists and specific antagonists. The potency rank for sympathomimetics in their contractile effect (nor-epinephrine> epinephrine> penylephrine> isoproterenol) and the inhibition produced by pheno-xybenzamine and <b>piperoxan</b> suggested the presence of a-receptors. The dissociation constant for their complex with norepinephrine (KA) was 1. 68 X 10 ’M, and with <b>piperoxan</b> (KB) 7. 90 X iii M. A relaxation could be recorded from a state of active tonic contraction (achieved by carba-mycholine) when the n-receptors were blocked. The potency for isoproterenol, norepinephrine, terbutaline, and epinephrine was in the order indicated, and the relaxation could be blocked in a competitive manner by propranolol (but not by the selective (l -antagonist practolol). This shows the existence of $ 3 -receptors, and the dissociation constant in their relation with propranolol was found to be 5. 42 X 1 (T 7 M. These relaxing receptors mainly conform with the $ 3 subtype of recep-tors. Both acetylcholine and carbamylcholine produced contraction (but were without relaxing effects as tested on strips tonically contracted by prostaglandin F 20), which was competitively inhibited by atropine but not by hexamethonium. Thus, a contraction in the follicle wall is also mediated by muscarinic type of cholinergic receptors, and the dissociation constant (KB) for the receptor complex with atropine was found to be 1. 17 X 10 #{ 176 }M. It is suggested that local auto-nomic mechanisms in the follicle of the human ovary may be involved in follicular development and/or ovulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{adrenergic}} blocking agents tolazoline, phentolamine, <b>piperoxan,</b> yohimbine, phenoxybenzamine, bretylium and guanethidine {{block the}} excitatory actions both of cholinergic nerves and of added acetylcholine {{on a variety}} of vertebrate smooth muscle preparations. These cholinergic blocking actions often occurred with concentrations lower than those required to block the response of the guinea-pig vas deferens to stimulation of the adrenergic hypogastric nerve. The anti-acetylcholine activities of these drugs have been studied in detail, using the guinea-pig rectum and the toad bladder as test organs. In preparations sensitive to eserine, the anticholinesterase actions of the drugs competed with their anti-acetylcholine actions, so that either potentiation or block of responses to acetylcholine and to cholinergic nerve stimulation occurred with different concentrations. The responses of the toad bladder to acetylcholine were not potentiated by eserine. This enabled the antagonism of acetylcholine by the anti-adrenergic drugs to be estimated without interference from their anticholinesterase activity. When blocking activity was assessed on guinea-pig rectum previously treated with dyflos, the results were qualitatively similar to those on the toad bladder. Phenoxybenzamine often completely blocks responses both to added acetylcholine and to cholinergic nerve stimulation in concentrations less than those required to block adrenergic nerves. Guanethidine and <b>piperoxan</b> also show strong cholinergic blocking activity. Bretylium, yohimbine, tolazoline and phentolamine were less potent. However, in concentrations required to block the effect on the vas deferens of hypogastric nerve stimulation, these drugs at least halved the effects of acetylcholine and often of cholinergic nerve stimulation. It is concluded that these adrenergic blocking agents cannot be used to distinguish conclusively between adrenergic and cholinergic nerves. For reliable analysis of autonomic innervation, the substances released upon nerve stimulation must be identified by specific biochemical techniques or bioassay...|$|E
40|$|Seven alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists {{with diverse}} {{chemical}} structures {{have been examined}} for their effects at alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the vas deferens and central nervous system of the rat. Antagonist potency assessed against the presynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist action of clonidine in the isolated vas deferens (RX 781094 greater than Wy 26703 greater than yohimbine greater than rauwolscine greater than <b>piperoxan</b> greater than mianserin greater than RS 21361) was highly correlated with the ability of these drugs to displace saturable [3 H]-RX 781094 binding from cerebral cortex membranes. Similarly, antagonist potency in the vas deferens was highly correlated with antagonist activity in reversing the centrally-mediated mydriasis induced by the selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, guanoxabenz, in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats. The {{results indicate that the}} presynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the vas deferens are pharmacologically similar to characterized these alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the central nervous system of the rat...|$|E
