40|$|Area-based {{matching}} is {{an useful}} procedure in some photogrammetric processes and its results are of crucial importance in {{applications such as}} relative orientation, <b>phototriangulation</b> and Digital Terrain Model generation.

40|$|Under certain {{conditions}} the positioning and orientation sensors such as INS and GPS of a land-based mobile mapping system may fail {{for a certain}} time interval. The consequence is that the images captured during this time interval may not be oriented properly or even may have no orientation. This article presents a solution to orient the images based only on image processing and a photogrammetric technique without any external sensors in order to overcome the lack of external orientation. A land-based mobile mapping system with a pair of video cameras and a GPS receiver was used to test the proposed methodology on an urban flat road. The video cameras were mounted {{on the roof of the}} vehicle with both optical axes parallel to the main road axis (Y). The methodology is based on the velocity estimation of the vehicle, which is done in two steps. Initially, the dense optical flow is computed then the velocity estimation is obtained through a filtering strategy that consists of using radial vectors in the low parts of the images. These radial vectors are detected by the Canny algorithm. The vehicle velocity is re-estimated after eliminating the optical flow outliers. With the re-estimated velocity and with the video sampling time the spatial displacement of each image (with respect to the previous one of the sequence) is determined. The displacement is used as an approximation to the image position. Homologous points are manually selected in the first stereo pair. Assuming an arbitrary orientation for the first pair, the corresponding object point coordinates are computed by photogrammetric intersection. The orientation is computed by <b>phototriangulation</b> with additional parameters. Following, new bases are included, one by one, and the <b>phototriangulation</b> is computed for every additional basis. The photocoordinates are determined by forward area correlation.

Well-known for their structural and surface complexity they constitute a great challenge to any attempt towards precise and detailed 3 D measurements and modeling. This paper reports about a pilot project using modern techniques of analytical and digital photogrammetry to derive a photorealistic 3 D model {{of one of the}} very complex towers of the famous Bayon temple of the ancient city of Angkor Thom. This high quality model will then be subject to visualization and animation. On occasion of a balloon photogrammetry mission over the Bayon temple of Angkor, the first author took a number of tourist-type terrestrial images with a Minolta Dynax 500 si analogue SRL camera of one of the many Buddha-faced towers of Bayon. We aim at deriving automatically, after scanning of the images, a texture mapped 3 D model of the very complex object. In a first step we have generated already such a model with a mixture of manual (<b>phototriangulation)</b> and automated procedures (image matching for surface reconstruction, editing for blunder removal, texture mapping, visualization and animation). This result has been presented in Visnovcova et al., 2001 and includes already some novel methods for point cloud blunder editing and view-dependent texture mapping. Now we will include more images than before, intend to automate the <b>phototriangulation</b> procedure, develop a matching approach based on MPGC (Multiphoto Geometrically Constrained) Matching and also improve the procedure of color texture mapping. With these combined new approaches we expect a higher level of completion of the object, an improvement of the modeling quality and a shortening of the processing time to generate the 3 D model. We streamline our new method of point cloud editing and improve our new technique of view-dependent texture mapping. Finally we show how different forms of high quality visualization techniques can be used on low-cost platforms. The ultimate goal of this activity and investigation is to develop a system that is capable of producing high quality photorealistic 3 D models in fully automated mode. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{camera is}} one of the most {{fundamental}} device in Photogrammetry field. Considering the geometry, the cameras can be divided in metric and non-metric. The metric cameras are composed by high quality lenses and are used only for mapping purposes. The digital non-metric camera has been more frequently used in photogrammetric projects, providing advantages like: low cost, if compared with the metric cameras; small size, lighter and easy handling. In this context, this paper presents an updating process of FCT/Unesp base map, using images collected by different sensors. It was adopted aerial images collected by the analogical metric camera Wild RC 10 in 2003 and by the digital non-metric camera Hasselblad H 1 D in 2007.

40|$|The {{development}} of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and continuous price reduction of unmanned systems attracted {{us to this}} research. Professional measuring systems are dozens of times more expensive and often heavier than "amateur", non-metric UAVs. For this reason, we tested the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus UAV. Phantom’s smaller mass and velocity can develop less kinetic energy {{in relation to the}} professional measurement platforms, which makes it potentially less dangerous for use in populated areas. In this research, we wanted to investigate the ability of such non-metric UAV and find the procedures under which this kind of UAV may be used for the photogrammetric survey. It is important to emphasize that UAV is equipped with an ultra wide-angle camera with 14 MP sensor. Calibration of such cameras is a complex process. In the research, a new two-step process is presented and developed, and the results are compared with standard one-step camera calibration procedure. Two-step process involves initially removed distortion on all images, and then uses these images in the <b>phototriangulation</b> with self-calibration. The paper presents statistical indicators which proved that the proposed two-step process is better and more accurate procedure for calibrating those types of cameras than standard one-step calibration.

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Photogrammetry, {{according}} to Andrade (2003), many methods and devices were developed aiming at attaining the highest accuracy, coupled with the lowest cost in the determination of coordinates. Indeed, mechanical equipment, the analog solution, were developed to the fullest. The optical and mechanical systems allow high precision and were robust enough to last many years, but extremely expensive. The evolution of electronics allowed more precise solutions, fast and economical. All measurements or observations, are affected by errors of different classes. So {{it is impossible to}} determine the true magnitude of a distance or an angle measured. The exact value is only in our imagination. You can not get over the likely value. For Brito (2007), the bundle block adjustment represents a major advance in photogrammetric techniques, for allowing the coordinates of various points on the ground from the interpolation of only a few points in the field, streamlining production costs photogrammetric. Because it is an interpolation process is not error free. However, if complied with adequate details for each scale to obtain the basic points of support, we arrive at acceptable results for the topographic mapping (scales of 1 : 250, 000 and less), or even for the cadastral mapping (scale of 1 : 2000 and higher).

40|$|The photogrammetric {{bridging}} or traverse is {{a special}} bundle block adjustment (BBA) for connecting a sequence of stereo-pairs and of determining the exterior orientation parameters (EOP). An object point must be imaged {{in more than one}} stereo-pair. In each stereo-pair the distance ratio between an object and its corresponding image point varies significantly. We propose to automate the photogrammetric bridging based on a fully automatic extraction of homologous points in stereo-pairs and on an arbitrary Cartesian datum to refer the EOP and tie points. The technique uses SIFT algorithm and the keypoint matching is given by similarity descriptors of each keypoint based on the smallest distance. All the matched points are used as tie points. The technique was applied initially to two pairs. The block formed by four images was treated by BBA. The process follows up {{to the end of the}} sequence and it is semiautomatic because each block is processed independently and the transition from one block to the next depends on the operator. Besides four image blocks (two pairs), we experimented other arrangements with block sizes of six, eight, and up to twenty images (respectively, three, four, five and up to ten bases). After the whole image pairs sequence had sequentially been adjusted in each experiment, a simultaneous BBA was run so to estimate the EOP set of each image. The results for classical ("normal case") pairs were analyzed based on standard statistics regularly applied to <b>phototriangulation,</b> and they show figures to validate the process...|$|E
