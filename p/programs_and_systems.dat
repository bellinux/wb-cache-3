The study aimed to illuminate such associations by examining the relationship between a set of program- and system-level variables and fidelity to the wraparound model for children and families. Methods: A measure of fidelity to the wraparound process for children and families (the Wraparound Fidelity Index) was administered to families receiving services in eight mental health agencies across the United States. Program administrators at each agency also completed by telephone a standardized interview for assessing <b>program</b> <b>and</b> <b>system</b> conditions hypothesized to influence quality of implementation (Program Administrator version of the Wraparound Fidelity Index). Regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between <b>program</b> <b>and</b> <b>system</b> variables <b>and</b> fidelity. Results: Results of interviews with program administrators revealed substantial variation across programs in the number <b>and</b> type of <b>program</b> <b>and</b> <b>system</b> supports for wraparound implementation.
