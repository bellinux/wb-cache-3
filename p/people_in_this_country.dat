In the National Review, Ann Noonan of the Laogai Research Foundation suggested that it was [...] "hardly a far-fetched hypothesis" [...] that the government staged the incident or allowed it to proceed to discredit Falun Gong, as the government vowed to crush the practice before the eightieth anniversary celebrations of the Communist Party in July. Clive Ansley, a Vancouver-based rights lawyer who lived in China during the self-immolation, suggested that a dramatic response by Falun Gong would have been understandable, but ultimately concluded that the event was staged: [...] "You've got Falun Gong <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> they've been oppressed over and over again, they are not allowed to speak, they are not allowed to assert any of their rights as citizens, the level of frustration must be terribly, terribly high..

The investigation of the role and impacts of residential schools on Aboriginal traditional knowledge and mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being must be studied within the context of colonization and genocide. Residential schools were funded by the federal government, but were operated by various religious institutions. The goal of residential schools was institutionalized assimilation by stripping Aboriginal peoples of their language, culture and connection with family. Although the assaults on the first peoples of this land have been devastating and intergenerational, as discussed within this article, it is with pride that we celebrate the resilience and tenacity of the holistic well-being of Aboriginal peoples.

Specifically, it demonstrates that the experiential exercise of maintaining place is a fundamentally personal one dependent on its individual actors to interact with it and in the process fulfill their obligation to enliven its history, stories and lessons anew. Finally, it illustrates how the unique historical experience emanating from Arapa has no bounds in time or meaning, proving that events of the past [...] namely the Camp Grant massacre, which precipitated the Apaches' forced exodus from that place [...] affect Apache culture and society <b>in</b> the present. <b>This</b> study enlists as its primary analytical lens the "peoplehood" matrix [...] the notion that indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> (and elsewhere) possess a unique, place-bound sense of group and community identity shaped by lived experiences that sets them apart, both individually and collectively, from dominant society...|$|R
