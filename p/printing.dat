5|$|The {{movable type}} invented by Bi Sheng was {{ultimately}} trumped {{by the use}} of woodblock <b>printing</b> due to the limitations of the enormous Chinese character writing system, yet movable type <b>printing</b> continued to be used and was improved in later periods. The Yuan dynasty scholar-official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) implemented a faster typesetting process, improved Bi's baked-clay movable type character set with a wooden one, and experimented with tin-metal movable type. The wealthy <b>printing</b> patron Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming dynasty established China's first metal movable type (using bronze) in 1490. In 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched their <b>printing</b> process from woodblock to movable type <b>printing.</b> Yet it was during the Qing dynasty that massive <b>printing</b> projects began to employ movable type <b>printing.</b> This includes the <b>printing</b> of sixty-six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725, the Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times), which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 movable type characters cast in bronze. By the 19th century the European style <b>printing</b> press replaced the old Chinese methods of movable type, while traditional woodblock <b>printing</b> in modern East Asia is used sparsely and for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on <b>Printing</b> during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} <b>printing</b> costs by <b>printing</b> in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on <b>Printing,</b> distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government <b>Printing</b> Office. It would also have centralized government <b>printing</b> services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the <b>printing</b> office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the <b>printing</b> office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on <b>Printing</b> in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, metal {{movable type}} <b>printing</b> was {{developed}} in Ming Dynasty China (and earlier in Joseon Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century. In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type <b>printing</b> (mostly using bronze). This included the <b>printing</b> works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable <b>printing</b> in the year 1490. In 1718, during the mid Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of earthenware. There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.|$|E
5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} <b>printing</b> never gained {{the amount of}} {{widespread}} use in East Asia that woodblock <b>printing</b> had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European <b>printing</b> press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock <b>printing</b> remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E

5|$|<b>Printing</b> {{had been}} known in Japan from at least the 8th century, when {{a large number of}} dharani known as Hyakumantō Darani were printed from 764 to 770 and placed in {{miniature}} wooden pagodas.
