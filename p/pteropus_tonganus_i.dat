40|$|The {{identification}} of the peka, or fruit bat, of the genus Pteropus from Niue (= Savage) Island (190 S, 1690 W, 480 km east of Tonga, 500 km southeast of Samoa and about 1, 040 km west of the Southern Cook Islands), South Pacific, by Gunther (1874) as <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> Quoy & Gaimard, 1830, is confirmed. Upon comparing the peka, the only fruit bat on Niue, with the other Pteropus species present on the nearest islands of Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and Uvea, we concluded that the differences between Pteropus samoensis and P. nawaiensis are insignificant and that {{the latter is a}} subspecies of P. samoensis. The present distribution, numbers, roosting and feeding habits, and present status of <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> on Niue Island are described...|$|R
5000|$|The {{two species}} of flying foxes (bats) {{protected}} in the park are: Pteropus samoensis (known locally as pe'a voa) meaning [...] "fruit bat of the forests" [...] and <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> locally called pe'afaunua, which means [...] "fruit bat of settled lands"; The roosting place of Pteropus samoensis (with prominent light colored face with brown body) is the canopy of ridge top trees, which roost alone or in small groups and are active during day time with two feeding peaks, the <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> (with black colored face with seal brown body) species roost in large groups (100 or more in numbers in each group) in thick forest habitat, also sometimes seen close to villages. Both species have a wing span of 1 m at adulthood, and weigh about 500 grams.|$|R
50|$|The insular {{flying fox}} or Pacific flying fox (<b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus)</b> is {{a species of}} flying fox in the family Pteropodidae. It is {{geographically}} widespread, the most widespread flying fox in the Pacific: it is found in American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa (where it is called pe'a fanua, pe'a fai and taulaga), the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.|$|R
5000|$|Five bones, {{representing}} {{one adult}} of the Pacific Flying Fox, <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus,</b> were recovered from an archaeological site on Rurutu (151degrees 210 W, 22degrees 270'S), Austral Islands, French Polynesia, making this the most eastern {{extension of the}} species. For the first time, flying fox bones from cultural deposits were directly dated by accelerator mass spectrometry, yielding an age of death between A.D. 1064 and 1155. Their stratigraphic position in an Archaic period archaeological site {{and the absence of}} bones in the late prehistoric to historic layers point to extirpation of the species. No flying fox bones were found in prehuman deposits and human transport of the species cannot be ruled out.|$|R
40|$|Prehistoric {{bones from}} caves {{on the island}} of 'Eua, Kingdom of Tonga, {{document}} the former presence of the megachiropterans Pteropus ton-ganus, Pteropus samoensis, and Notopteris mac-donaldi and the microchiropterans Emballonura semicaudata and Chaerephon jobensis. Of these five species of bats, only <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> and Emballonura semicaudata still occur on 'Eua or anywhere else in Tonga. Bones of all five species occur in sediments that predate the arrival of hu-mans on 'Eua (i. e., those more than 3500 - 3000 years old) as well as in younger deposits. The ex-tinction of bat species on 'Eua, as with the two species of lizards and 23 species of land birds, is probably related to human impact...|$|R
5|$|According {{to damage}} surveys, 13 of the country's islands {{sustained}} damage; 470 homes and 6 schools were destroyed and hundreds more damaged. Damage throughout Tonga amounted to 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD). In addition to infrastructural and public damage, the environment sustained catastrophic losses on Tonga. The Insular Flying Fox (<b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus),</b> a native species of bat, suffered great losses from Waka. Compared to pre-cyclone population levels, 79.8% (±9.9%) {{of the species}} was killed across six islands. This was due to widespread destruction of their natural food source, which decreased by 85% (±11.8%) following Waka. Trees across Vava'u were completely defoliated, although only 6.6% were killed, leaving no food for the bats. The greatest decline in bats was on Utula'aina Island at 95.7%; A'a Island sustained a complete loss of food-bearing plants. Six months after the storm, the bat population in Vava'u was still only 20% of the pre-storm level.|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial {{birds and}} large pteropodid fruit bats are hunted year-round for {{subsistence}} in American Samoa. To determine harvest levels, 13 - 18 % of the hunters {{on the main}} island of Tutuila were interviewed at 3 -month intervals in 1990 - 1991. A high opportunistic harvest occurred after extensive habitat damage caused by a hurricane in February 1990. Adjusting for this factor, we estimated an annual take of 2100 - 4200 Pacific pigeons (Ducula pacifica Gmelin), 500 - 1000 purple-capped fruit doves (Ptilinopus porphyraceus Temminck), 500 - 1600 fruit bats (<b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> Quoy & Gaimard and P. samoensis Peale, species combined), and small numbers of other species. Even this adjusted harvest rate is extremely high compared with current population sizes of game animals, which are at low levels due to adverse impacts from three hurricanes in the past 5 yr and subsequent opportunistic hunting. For example, after the hurricane in 1990, more bats were harvested than remain alive today. Consequently, a 3 -yr ban on all hunting was enacted, but the situation remains critical because hunting restrictions are neither well known nor enforced...|$|R
40|$|The poorly studied bat fauna of the Fiji Islands is of notable {{conservation}} importance {{because it}} includes one endemic species, several near endemics, {{and the best}} global populations of several threatened species. In addition, some of the species play a keystone role as pollinators and seed dispersers in valuable forest ecosystems. We visited 30 islands of the archipelago to survey bats and assess their conservation status and the potential threats to their continued existence. The Vulnerable Notopteris macdonaldi occurs on the three main islands but may only have nurseries on one of them. The Critically Endangered, endemicMirimiri acrodonta appears to be restricted to a small montane area on a single island. <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> is consumed throughout rural Fiji but remains common and is not currently threatened by the harvest. The Near Threatened Pteropus samoensis is locally common on the largest islands but threatened on some smaller islands. The Endangered Chaerephon bregullae exists only on two islands and appears to concentrate in a single large colony to nurse young. The EndangeredEmballonura semicaudata has declined dramatically in Fiji, as across most of its range, although a few substantial populations remain on some small islands. Factors threatening these species are variable but include small ranges, concentration in a reduced number of colonies, deforestation, over-harvesting, and introduced predators. We propose conservation measures and indicate a number of priority sites...|$|R
40|$|Many {{tropical}} herbivores {{alter their}} diets {{throughout the year}} in response to different levels of food availability. Fruit bats, including Pteropus samoensis Peale and <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> Quoy & Gaimard, are phytophagous species that may increase their consumption of foods such as unripe fruit and leaves in periods of low fruit diversity and volume. These periods include the tropical dry season or following the frequent hurricanes that batter the Samoan Archipelago. We examined the nutritional composition of leaves and immature fruits and compared the levels of organic and mineral nutrients with those of ripe fruit. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to examine patterns of variation in nutrient components of leaves, unripe fruit, and ripe fruit, {{as well as to}} compare the mean levels of nutrients. Overall, unripe fruit provided levels of nutrients comparable with those of ripe fruit of the same species for many organic and mineral components. Unripe fruit were only half as rich in iron as ripe fruit, but unripe fruit had high levels of calcium compared with ripe fruit of the same species. Leaves are often cited as a rich source of protein for fruit bats, and our results were consistent with this suggestion. Leaves were also found to be rich in zinc, manganese, and calcium. Therefore, flying foxes and other herbivores probably do not avoid unripe fruits and leaves because of their low nutrient levels. It may be that these famine foods are not normally consumed {{because of the presence of}} secondary compounds, low concentrations of palatable sugars, or a distasteful and hard pericarp on unripe fruits...|$|R
40|$|Six {{archaeological sites}} up to 1000 years old on Aitutaki, Cook Islands, have yielded bones of 15 species of birds, five of which no longer {{occur on the}} island: Pterodroma rostrata (Tahiti Petrel); Sula sula (Red-footed Booby); Dendrocygna, undescribed sp. (a large, extinct {{whistling}} duck); Porzana tabuensis (Sooty Crake); and Vini kuhlii (Rimatara Lorikeet). Of these, only S. sula and P. tabuensis survive anywhere in the Cook Islands today. The nearest record of any speciesofDendrocygna is in Fiji. Aside from the aquatic species Egretta sacra (Pacific Reef-Heron) and Anas superciliosa (Gray Duck), the only native, resident land bird on Aitutaki today is the Society Islands Lorikeet (Vini peruviana), {{which may have been}} introduced from Tahiti. Residents of Aitutaki note that Ducula pacifica (Pacific Pigeon) and Ptilinopus rarotongensis (Cook Islands Fruit-Dove) also occurred there until the 1940 sor 1950 s. There is no indigenous forest on Aitutaki today. The bones from Aitutaki also include the island's first record of the fruit bat <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus.</b> Limestone caves on the island of Atiu yielded the undated bones of six species of birds, three of which no longer exist there {{or anywhere else in the}} Cook Islands: Gallicolumba erythroptera (Society Islands Ground-Dove), Ducula aurorae (Society Islands Pigeon), and Vini kuhlii. Each of these species has been recovered from prehistoric sites on Mangaia as well. The limestone terrain of Atiu is mostly covered with native forest that supports populations of Ducula pacifica, Ptilinopus rarotongensis, Collocalia sawtelli (Atiu Swiftlet), and Halcyon tuta (Chattering Kingfisher). The survival of these land birds depends upon protection of Atiu's forests...|$|R
50|$|The McConkey and Drake (2006) {{study is}} unique {{because it was}} one of the first {{attempts}} to model a density-dependent threshold relationship that described ecological extinction. They studied a seed dispersal interaction between flying foxes and trees with large seeds on the tropical Pacific Islands. Insular flying foxes (<b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus),</b> are considered to be keystone species because they are the only seed dispersers that can carry large seeds long distances. The host-pathogen model by Janzen and Connell suggests that survivorship of seeds in the tropics greatly increases the further away from the parent tree it lands, and that trees require this dispersal in order to avoid extinction. In the pathogen latent environment of the tropics, seed dispersal only becomes more paramount to species survival. As hypothesized, McConkey and Drake found a threshold relationship between the Flying Fox Index (FFI) and the median proportion of seeds carried over five meters. Below the threshold of abundance seed dispersal was insignificant and independent of flying fox abundance; however, above the threshold, dispersal positively correlated with increased flying fox abundance (as measured by the FFI). Although they did not directly prove the cause for this relationship, McConkey and Drake proposed a behavioral mechanism. Flying foxes are known to be territorial, and in the absence of competition a flying fox will eat within one tree, effectively dropping the seeds right below it. Alternatively, if there is a high density of flying foxes feeding at one time (abundance above the threshold density) then aggressive behavior, such as stealing fruit from another individual’s territory, will lead to longer average seed dispersal. In this way the seed dispersing flying fox has a disproportional effect on the overall community structure in comparison to their relative biomass. Modeling the effect of ecological extinction on communities is the first step to applying this framework into conservation work.|$|R
40|$|Viruses with {{circular}} single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes are {{the smallest}} pathogens known to infect various organisms. Due to advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, {{the diversity of}} circular replication associated protein encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses is beginning to unravel. Viral metagenomic {{studies have demonstrated that}} animal faecal matter harbours a high viral diversity and therefore can potentially be used to explore viruses within ecosystems. Faecal matter may contain viruses shed by the infected animal or those that are associated with its diet and the environment. Besides capturing the viral diversity, faecal sampling is a non-invasive to the animal hence can be used easily for viral surveillance in ecosystems. A limited amount of work has been done on CRESS DNA viruses circulating in the Pacific Islands of Tonga. Prior to this study, only six species of CRESS DNA viruses had been identified. As part of a continuing effort to determine the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses, <b>I</b> sampled <b>Pteropus</b> <b>tonganus</b> faeces. P. tonganus, also known as the Pacific flying fox, is the most widespread bat species in the Pacific and is the only bat species found in the Tongan archipelago. Pacific flying foxes roost in trees and are frugivores. This thesis research was carried out to identify CRESS DNA viruses that are associated with Pacific flying fox faeces in Tonga. Faecal samples were collected from four P. tonganus roosting sites (Ha’ateiho (‘Atele), Lapaha (Takuilau), Ha’avakatolo and Kolovai) located in Tongatapu the main island of Tonga in 2014 and 2015. A next-generation sequencing informed approach was used to recover complete CRESS DNA viral genomes. In total, five novel cycloviruses (three species), 25 novel gemycircularviruses (13 species), 17 unclassified novel CRESS DNA viruses (15 species), a putative multicomponent virus (three cognate molecules) and two circular DNA molecules, were recovered. A number of viruses were identified in more than one sampling site in Tonga, suggesting these viruses have a broad distribution across the island amongst the Pacific flying fox colonies. Several species were identified in both 2014 and 2015 suggesting these viruses are persistently associated with faecal matter of Pacific flying foxes. The data obtained from this study has significantly expanded the knowledge of CRESS DNA viruses that are circulating in Tonga...|$|R
