Objective: The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the risks and benefits associated with routine intraoperative insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD) catheters in patients with PFT presenting with hydrocephalus. Methods: Forty two patients with PFT with secondary hydrocephalus had intraoperative insertion of an external ventricular drainage catheter, it was kept closed, unless intraoperative lowering of the intracranial tension was needed, or opened postoperatively in cases of persistent hydrocephalus, CSF leak, in certain cases throughout and after the procedure. Results: Eight cases (19 %) needed opening of the drainage system during surgery to lower the intracranial tension. In the postoperative period, twelve cases (28. 5 %) needed opening of the EVD for the persistence of hydrocephalus, occurrence of CSF leak or bloody CSF. Only eight cases (19 %) needed <b>permanent</b> <b>CSF</b> <b>shunting,</b> seven of which were ependymomas and medulloblastomas. None of the cases in this series acquired any EVD related infection, nor did those who required subsequent <b>permanent</b> <b>CSF</b> diversion. Conclusion: Intra-operative insertion of EVD catheter during surgery of posterior fossa tumors, as it allows better control of the ICT during surgery if needed, provides a life saving emergency CSF drainage outlet if tumor resection fails to resolve HC or for the occurrence of de novo HC, and finally it provides adequate control of CSF leak in cases with supratentorial ventriculomegaly, where the use of lumbar drains may be hazardous.

Study designWe used the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network registry to assemble a large prospective 6 -center cohort of 1036 children undergoing initial <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> placement between April 2008 and January 2012. The primary outcome of interest was first <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> infection. Data for initial <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> placement and all subsequent <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> revisions prior to first <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> infection, where applicable, were obtained. The risk of first infection was estimated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model accounting for patient characteristics and <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> revisions, and is reported using hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % CI. ResultsOf the 102 children who developed first infection within 12 months of placement, 33 (32 %) followed one or more <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> revisions. Baseline factors independently associated with risk of first infection included: gastrostomy tube (HR 2. 0, 95 % CI, 1. 1, 3. 3), age 6 - 12 months (HR 0. 3, 95 % CI, 0. 1, 0. 8), and prior neurosurgery (HR 0. 4, 95 % CI, 0. 2, 0. 9).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transverse sinus venous stent {{placement}} {{has been}} shown to lower intracranial pressure in patients with venogenic pseudotumor cerebri and to reverse, or at least stabilize, its symptoms and signs. There have been no studies comparing the cost of venous stenting with the time-honored treatment for pseudotumor cerebri–CSF shunting. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the cost of trasverse sinus stenting versus <b>CSF</b> <b>shunting</b> for the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work was a retrospective cost analysis of individual resource use in 86 adults who were stented for pseudotumor cerebri during a 12 -year period compared with resource use in 110 children who were shunted for hydrocephalus during a 3 -year period. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the cost of inserting an initial venous stent ($ 13, 863 4890) versus inserting an initial <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> ($ 15, 797 5442) (P. 6337) or between inserting an additional venous stent ($ 9421 69) versus revising a <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> ($ 10, 470 1245) (P. 4996). There were far fewer additional venous stent insertions per patient than there were subsequent <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> revisions; 87 % of stents placed required just 1 stent procedure, whereas only 45 % of shunts required 1 shunt procedure. The main cause of the cost difference was the need for repeated revisions of the shunts, especially when they became infected— 24 instances of a total 143 shunt procedures (16. 8 %) at an average cost of $ 84, 729, approximately 5 times the cost of an initial shunt insertion.

Primate models have demonstrated the onset normal tension glaucoma (NTG) from experimentally induced chronic intrathecal hypotension; an approach not possible in human subjects. Case Presentation A 27 -year-old man presented with a central scotoma in his left eye. He had undergone 8 <b>CSF</b> <b>shunt</b> revision procedures over a 25 -year period secondary to recurrent low CSFP following surgical excision of a pinealoblastoma, aged 2. A focal nerve fiber layer defect was detected in the left eye associated with reduced retinal sensitivity on microperimetry. Three adjacent optic disc hemorrhages had been documented {{in the same position}} over an 18 -month period. A diagnosis of left-sided NTG was made; the patient was started on Latanoprost 0. 005 %. A new generation <b>CSF</b> <b>shunting</b> device (ProGAV) —which neutralizes CSFP fluctuations analogously to trabeculectomy surgery for intraocular pressure— was considered necessary in this patient to alleviate persistent headaches and reduce the risk of progressive glaucomatous visual loss. Conclusions This exceptional case illustrates how premature onset NTG may occur as a result of chronic, recurrent intrathecal hypotension—a “pure” human model.

AIM: To determine survival, health and lifestyle at the mean age of 30 years in a complete cohort of adults born with open spina bifida. DESIGN OF STUDY: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Well-documented cohort of 117 consecutive cases of open spina bifida whose backs were closed non-selectively at birth between 1963 and 1971. METHOD: Survivors (age range = 26 to 33 years) were surveyed by postal questionnaire and telephone interview. The main outcome measures were the health, independence and lifestyle of the survivors in terms of living in the community, driving a car and working in open employment. RESULTS: Ascertainment was 100 %. Sixty (51 %) had died, mainly the most disabled.

40|$|Hydrocephalus is a {{condition}} commonly encountered in paediatric and adult neurosurgery and cerebrospinal fluid (<b>CSF)</b> <b>shunting</b> remains the treatment of choice for many cases. Despite improvements in shunt technology and technique, morbidity and mortality remain. The incidence of early shunt obstruction is high with later failures seen less frequently. This review aims to examine mortality associated with mechanical failure of <b>CSF</b> <b>shunts</b> within Queensland. Neurosurgical and Intensive Care databases were reviewed for cases of mortality associated with shunt failure. Eight cases were identified between the years of 1992 and 2002 with the average age at death 7. 7 years. Deaths occurred on average 2 years after last shunt revision. Seven of the eight patients lived outside the metropolitan area. Shunting remains an imperfect means of treating hydrocephalus. Mortality may be encountered at any time post surgery and delays to surgical intervention influence this. Alternative measures such as third ventriculostomy or the placement of a separate access device should be considered. In the event of emergency, a spinal needle {{could be used to}} access the ventricle along the course of the ventricular catheter. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the role of early acetazolamide administration in {{reducing the risk of}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in patients with a high risk of <b>permanent</b> <b>CSF</b> leakage. In a randomised clinical trial, 57 patients with a high risk of <b>permanent</b> <b>CSF</b> leakage (rhinorrhea, otorrhea, pneumatocele or imaging-based evidence of severe skull-base fracture) were analysed. In the experimental group, acetazolamide, at 25 mg/kg/day, was started in the first 48 hours after admission. In the control group, acetazolamide was administered after the first 48 hours at the same dose administered to the patients in the experimental group. The following factors were compared between the two groups: duration of CSF leakage, duration of hospital stay, incidence of meningitis, need for surgical intervention and need for lumbar puncture (LP) and lumbar drainage (LD). All of the patients in the experimental group stopped having CSF leakage less than 14 days after the first day of admission, but 6 out of 21 patients (22 %) in the control group continued having CSF leakage after 14 days of admission, which was a significant difference (P= 0. 01). This study showed that early acetazolamide administration can prevent CSF leakage in patients with a high risk of <b>permanent</b> <b>CSF</b> leak...|$|R
40|$|Background: Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{has been increasing}} in prevalence in the past decade, following the obesity epidemic. When medical treatment fails, surgical treatment options must be considered. However, controversy remains as to which surgical procedure is the preferred surgical option - optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) or cerebrospinal fluid (<b>CSF)</b> <b>shunting</b> - for the long-term treatment of this syndrome. Purpose: To provide a clinical update of {{the pros and cons}} of ONSF versus shunt placement for the treatment of IIH. Design: This was a retrospective review of the current literature in the English language indexed in PubMed. Methods: The authors conducted a PubMed search using the following terms: Idiopathic IIH, pseudotumor cerebri, ONSF, <b>CSF</b> <b>shunts,</b> vetriculo-peritoneal shunting, and lumbo-peritoneal shunting. The authors included pertinent and significant original articles, review articles, and case reports, which revealed the new aspects and updates in these topics. Results: The treatment of IIH remains controversial and lacks randomized controlled clinical trial data. Treatment of IIH rests with the determination of the severity of IIH-related visual loss and headache. Conclusion: The decision for ONSF versus shunting is somewhat institution and surgeon dependent. ONSF is preferred for patients with visual symptoms whereas shunting is reserved for patients with headache. There are positive and negative aspects of both procedures, and a prospective, randomized, controlled trial is needed (currently underway). This article will hopefully be helpful in allowing the reader to make a more informed decision until that time...|$|R
