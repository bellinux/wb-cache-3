5000|$|In arthropods, the integument, the {{external}} [...] "skin", or [...] "shell", {{is the product}} of a single layer of ectodermal epithelium.

The layer of epithelium on the basement membrane produces the cuticle, which begins as a tough, flexible layer of chitin. Such thin, flexible chitin is the major structural part of the integument where flexibility is necessary, such as in bodily parts that must stretch to contain accumulated liquids, or that form joints between rigid parts of the exoskeleton. In other parts of the cuticle the function of the integument demands more rigid materials, such as armoured regions or the biting parts of the jaws, or where the exoskeleton forms the tubular limbs of most Arthropoda. To achieve such rigidity the outer chitin layer of the cuticle is impregnated, thickened, and reinforced with harder, more brittle materials such as sclerotinised proteins or calcite.

The factors that help the new exoskeleton withstand the deleterious effects of chitinolytic enzymes remain poorly understood. In the current study a mechanistic role for two proteins, Knickkopf (Knk) and Retroactive (Rtv), was explored in organization and protection of the newly synthesized procuticular chitin. Our study demonstrated colocalization of molting fluid chitinases (chitinase- 5) with chitin in T. castaneum pharate adult elytral cuticle. Presence of chitinases in the new cuticle, disproved the old theory of the envelope being a protective barrier against chitinases. Confocal and transmission electron microscopic imaging of T. castaneum pharate adult elytral cuticle suggested that Knk protein selectively colocalizes with chitin in the new <b>procuticle,</b> organizes chitin into laminae and protects it from the activity of molting fluid chitinases.

The basic structural unit of the <b>procuticle</b> is a microfibril made up of a core of chitin criystallite surrounded by a protein sheath. Microfibrils arise at the surface of plasmamembrane plaques which are concerned with their deposition and orientation. According to the degree of mineralization, microfibrils are either homogeneously distributed (membranous layer) or secondarily associated into reticulate structures (pigmented layer) or into macrofibres (principal layer). In the newly secreted procuticular sheets the chitin-proteic fibres are disposed around long vertical microvilli originating from the epidermis. The plasmamembrane of the microvilli appears to be closely concerned with the deposition of fibrous components running vertically. Progressively the microvilli degenerate and leave hollow twisted tubes, the cuticular canals (pore canals), delimited by a helical fibre sheath. These canals may project lateral connections and constitute routes through which material involved in cuticle hardening can gain access to the external laminae. The membranous layer, deposited a long time after ecdysis, is not mineralized and exhibits a peculiar chemical composition as well as hygroscopic properties. It keeps hydrolytic enzymes in store during the preecdysial period and plays the role of lubrificating agent at the critical moment of ecdydis.

Depletion of TcCPR 27 by RNA interference (RNAi) causes both unorganized laminae and pore canals, resulting in malformation and weakening of the elytron. In this study, we investigated the function(s) of another CP, TcCPR 4, which contains the RR- 1 motif and is easily extractable from elytra after RNAi to deplete the level of TcCPR 27.

Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for TcCPR 27 and TcCPR 18 resulted in insects with shorter, wrinkled, warped and less rigid elytra than those from control insects. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of CPs in cuticle assembly, we analyzed for the precise localization of TcCPR 27 and the ultrastructural architecture of cuticle in TcCPR 27 - and TcCPR 18 -deficient elytra. Transmission electron microscopic analysis combined with immunodetection using goldlabeled secondary antibody revealed that TcCPR 27 is present in dorsal elytral <b>procuticle</b> both in the horizontal laminae and in vertical pore canals. dsRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) of TcCPR 27 resulted in abnormal electron-lucent laminae and pore canals in elytra except for the boundary between these two structures in which electron-dense molecule(s) apparently accumulated.

40|$|Molting, or the {{replacement}} of the old exoskeleton with a new cuticle, is a complex developmental process that all insects must undergo to allow unhindered growth and development.

40|$|Synopsis The exoskeletons of pan{{crustaceans}}, as {{typified by}} decapod crustaceans and insects, demonstrate {{a high degree}} of similarity with respect to histology, ultrastructure, function, and composition. The cuticular envelope in insects and the outer epicuticle in crustaceans both serve as the primary barrier to permeability of the exoskeleton, preventing loss of water and ions to the external medium. Prior to and following ecdysis, there is a sequence of expression and synthesis of different proteins by the cuticular epithelium for incorporation into the pre-exuvial and post-exuvial <b>procuticle</b> of insects and the exocuticle and endocuticle of crustaceans. Both exhibit regional differences in cuticular composition, e. g., the articular (intersegmental) membranes of insects and the arthrodial (joint) membranes of crustaceans. The primary difference between these cuticles is the ability to mineralize. Crustaceans ’ cuticles express a unique suite of proteins that provide for the nucleation and deposition of calcium carbonate. Orthologs of genes discussed in the present review were mined from a recently completed cuticular transcriptome of the crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, providing new insights into the nature of these proteins...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTracheal {{and nervous}} system {{development}} are two model {{systems for the}} study of organogenesis in Drosophila. In two independent screens, we identified three alleles of a gene involved in tracheal, cuticle and CNS development. Here, we show that these alleles, and the previously identified cystic and mummy, all belong to the same complementation group. These are mutants of a gene encoding the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase, an enzyme responsible for the production of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, an important intermediate in chitin and glycan biosynthesis. cyst was originally singled out as a gene required for the regulation of tracheal tube diameter. We characterized the cyst/mmy tracheal phenotype and upon histological examination concluded that mmy mutant embryos lack chitin-containing structures, such as the <b>procuticle</b> at the epidermis and the taenidial folds in the tracheal lumen. While most of their tracheal morphogenesis defects {{can be attributed to the}} lack of chitin, when compared to krotzkopf verkehrt (kkv) chitin-synthase mutants, mmy mutants showed a stronger phenotype, suggesting that some of the mmy phenotypes, like the axon guidance defects, are chitin-independent. We discuss the implications of these new data in the mechanism of size control in the Drosophila trachea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{arthropod}} cuticle is a multilayered extracel-lular matrix {{produced by}} the epidermis during embryogen-esis and moulting. Molecularly and histologically, cuticle differentiation has been extensively investigated in the embryo of the insect Drosophila melanogaster. To learn about the evolution of cuticle differentiation, we have studied the histology of cuticle differentiation during embryogenesis of the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, which had a common ancestor with Drosophila about 510 million years ago. The establishment of the layers of the Parhyale juvenile cuticle is largely governed by mechanisms observed in Drosophila, e. g. as in Drosophila, the synthesis and arrangement of chitin in the inner <b>procuticle</b> are separate processes. A major difference between the cuticle of Parhyale and Drosophila concerns the restructuring of the Parhyale dorsal epicuticle after deposition. In contrast to the uniform cuticle of the Drosophila larva, the Parhyale cuticle is subdivided into two regions, the ventral and the dorsal cuticles. Remarkably, {{the boundary between the}} ventral and dorsal cuticles is sharp suggesting active extracellular regionalisation. The present analysis of Parhyale cuticle differentiation should allow the characterisation of the cuticle-producing and-organising factors of Parhyale (by comparison with the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia pulex) in order to contribute to the elucidation of fundamental questions relevant to extracellular matrix organisation and differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Frontal {{weapon is}} the term used to {{designate}} the apparatus consisting of frontal gland and associated structures that participate in the chemical defense of termite soldiers. The ultra structure of the frontal gland and the scanning microscopy of the soldier head was investigated in the termite Amiitermes euamignathus Silvestri, 1901. Campaniform sensilla was not observed but there were 80 to 100 sensory bristles around the frontal pore. The glandular epithelium shows only class 1 cells according 10 the classification of NOIROT & QUENNEDEY (1974, 1991). The glandular cells are characterized by apical microvilli, a basal labyrinth and a large quantity of smooth endoplasmic reticulum which forms dense zones throughout the cytoplasm. The secretion is concentrated mainly in the basal pole of the cell and consists of large lipid droplets. The secretory epithelium is covered by a thick apical cuticle composed of a thin outer epicuticle, a layer of epicuticular filaments and a dense <b>procuticle.</b> The cytological results concerning the frontal pore showed a reduced cuticle {{and the presence of}} a subcuticular space where the lipid droplets are accumulated. The lack of class 3 cells and the presence of an intrinsic musculature are two anatomical features of the A. euamignathus frontal gland that will be important in the phylogenetic relationships of the Nasutitermitinae...|$|E

40|$|The cuticle of tardigrades is {{characterized}} by three main layers: epicuticle, intracuticle and <b>procuticle.</b> Pillars {{are present in the}} epicuticle of almost all heterotardigrades, but these structures are also known in a few species of eutardigrades. The apparent heterogeneity of the cuticular ultrastructure in several species of the Macrobiotidae (Eutardigrada) prompted us to analyse the structure of the cuticle in this family. Eleven species in several genera were investigated with light and/or electron microscopy. All the species of the genera Murrayon and Dactylobiotus showed pillars in the epicuticle, whereas the examined species of Macrobiotus, Richtersius and Xerobiotus completely lacked pillars. Therefore, in the Macrobiotidae, in contrast to what appears with light microscopy, the cuticle is homogeneous within each genus examined at the electron microscopic level. Considering the absence of pillars in the Macrobiotidae a synapomorphy, we propose the erection of two new subfamilies. Macrobiotinae subfam. n. {{is characterized}} by the absence of pillars in the epicuticular layer and includes, in addition to the genera Macrobiotus, Xerobiotus and Richtersius, the genera Pseudohexapodibius, Adorybiotus, and probably also Minibiotus, Calcarobiotus and Pseudodiphascon. Murrayinae subfam. n. {{is characterized by}} the presence of pillars in the epicuticular layer and includes the genera n Murrayon, Dactylobiotus and, probably, Macroversum...|$|E
