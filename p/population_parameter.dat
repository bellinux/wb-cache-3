40|$|We aim at discerning the {{distribution}} of stellar <b>population</b> <b>parameters</b> (extinction, age, metallicity, and sSFR) of quiescent galaxies within the rest-frame stellar mass- and UVJ colour-colour diagrams up to z∼ 1 and down to I= 23 AB, {{as well as the}} development of new diagrams to reduce the contamination from dust-reddened galaxies in samples of quiescent galaxies. By use of the photometric data from ALHAMBRA, we determine stellar <b>population</b> <b>parameters</b> of quiescent galaxies using the SED-fitting code MUFFIT and different SSP models. Through the extinctions retrieved by MUFFIT, we remove dusty star forming galaxies from the sample. The distribution of all the stellar <b>populations</b> <b>parameters</b> is also fitted by a bidimensional and locally weighted regression method (LOESS) across the rest-frame diagrams to reduce the impact of uncertainties and provide {{the distribution}} of stellar <b>population</b> <b>parameters.</b> Quiescent galaxies selected via UVJ diagrams are typically contaminated by a 20...|$|R
50|$|The {{multiple}} comparisons problem {{also applies}} to confidence intervals. A single confidence interval with a 95% coverage probability level will contain the <b>population</b> <b>parameter</b> in 95% of experiments. However, if one considers 100 confidence intervals simultaneously, each with 95% coverage probability, the expected number of non-covering intervals is 5. If the intervals are statistically independent from each other, the probability {{that at least one}} interval does not contain the <b>population</b> <b>parameter</b> is 99.4%.|$|E

50|$|The {{tolerance}} interval differs from a confidence interval {{in that the}} confidence interval bounds a single-valued <b>population</b> <b>parameter</b> (the mean or the variance, for example) with some confidence, while the {{tolerance interval}} bounds the range of data values that includes a specific proportion of the population. Whereas a confidence interval's size is entirely due to sampling error, and will approach a zero-width interval at the true <b>population</b> <b>parameter</b> as sample size increases, a tolerance interval's size is due partly to sampling error and partly to actual variance in the population, and will approach the population's probability interval as sample size increases.|$|E
50|$|A {{statistic}} {{is biased}} {{if it is}} calculated {{in such a way}} that it is systematically different from the <b>population</b> <b>parameter</b> being estimated. The following lists some types of biases, which can overlap.|$|E
50|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the width of}} the confidence interval include the size of the sample, the confidence level, and the variability in the sample. A larger sample size normally will lead to a better estimate of the <b>population</b> <b>parameter.</b>|$|E
40|$|Individual {{heterogeneity}} in capture probabilities {{and time}} dependence are fundamentally important for estimating the closed animal <b>population</b> <b>parameters</b> in capture-recapture studies. A generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach accounts for linear correlation among capture-recapture occasions, and individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities {{in a closed}} population capture-recapture individual heterogeneity and time variation model. The estimated capture probabilities are used to estimate animal <b>population</b> <b>parameters.</b> Two real data sets are used for illustrative purposes. A simulation study is carried out to assess {{the performance of the}} GEE estimator. A Quasi-Likelihood Information Criterion (QIC) is applied for the selection of the best fitting model.

40|$|Motivation: Gene genealogies offer a {{powerful}} context for inferences about the evolutionary process based on presently segregating DNA variation. In many cases, {{it is the}} distribution of <b>population</b> <b>parameters,</b> marginalized over the effectively infinite-dimensional tree space, that is of interest. Our evolutionary forest (EF) algorithm uses Monte Carlo methods to generate posterior distributions of <b>population</b> <b>parameters.</b> A novel feature is the updating of parameter values based on a probability measure defined on an ensemble of histories (a forest of genealogies), rather than a single tree. Results: The EF algorithm generates samples from the correct marginal distribution of <b>population</b> <b>parameters.</b> Applied to actual data from closely related fruit fly species, it rapidly converged to posterior distributions that closely approximated the exact posteriors generated through massive computational effort. Applied to simulated data, it generated credible intervals that covered the actual parameter values {{in accordance with the}} nominal probabilities.

50|$|A {{consistent}} {{sequence of}} estimators is {{a sequence of}} estimators that converge in probability to the quantity being estimated as the index (usually the sample size) grows without bound.

40|$|The <b>population</b> <b>parameters</b> {{of sweet}} potato white fly, Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) (Hom. : Aleyrodidae), {{which is an}} {{important}} pest of cotton fields, were studied during 2001. The infected leaves containing nymphs and pupae were collected from Darab, Qom, Saveh, Gonbad, Gorgan, Varamin, Garmsar, Orsoiieh (Kerman), and Shooshtar cotton fields. Experiments were conducted in a growth chamber under 24 ±. 2 ºC, 55 %± 3 RH and 16 : 8 (L:D) photoperiod on cotton, a Gossypium hirsutum L. (Varamin 76 variety). The newly emerged populations of each locality were released into a large cage set on cotton plants separately. <b>Population</b> <b>parameters</b> of 40 mated females were calculated for each local population. Intrinsic rates of increase (r) for Darab, Qom, Saveh, Gonbad, Gorgan, Varamin, Garmsar, Orsoiieh and Shooshtar were 0. 0401, 0. 0719, 0. 0750, 0. 0602,. 0682, 0. 0774, 0. 0876, 0. 0751 and 0. 0988, respectively. Doubling times (DT) were 17. 26, 9. 63, 9. 24, 11. 51, 10. 16, 8. 94, 7. 91, 9. 22 and 7. 083 days, respectively, and mean generation times (Tc) were calculated to be 28. 72, 28. 9, 28. 74, 28. 3, 28. 68, 27. 53, 29. 12, 28. 21 and 26. 84 days, respectively.

30|$|Beside above {{mentioned}} approaches, another novel approach using heterozygotes of one genome {{is applied to}} obtain information of the <b>population</b> <b>parameters</b> (McVean and Cardin, 2005). Such a method, named as the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) model, was used to infer human population history (Li and Durbin, 2011). The PSMC model considered the local density of heterozygous sites along chromosomes which reflects how the constant Most Recent Common Ancestors (MRCA, or TMRCA abbreviated by Li and Durbin (2011)) were separated by historical recombination events. Therefore the <b>population</b> <b>parameters,</b> such as the past effective population size and the recombination rate could be inferred.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{class of}} estimators for {{the mean of}} a finite {{population}} proposed by Srivastava (1971) is shown to nearly include a class of Srivastava and Jhajj (1981). Minimum-mean-squared-error members of the former’s class are not computable if certain <b>population</b> <b>parameters</b> are unknown. With sample-based parameter estimators substituted, and certain modifications intro-duced, several such members are shown to achieve, to a first order of approximation, the mean-squared-error of the linear regression estimator that assumes knowledge of population regression coefficients, and the order of magnitude of the remainder term is derived, under assumptions on <b>population</b> <b>parameters.</b> Practical implications of the results are discussed. 1...|$|R
