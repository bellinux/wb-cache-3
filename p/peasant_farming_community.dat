5000|$|While {{the first}} known mention of Zalishchyky is traced back to 1340, the village had already existed for some time, and given its {{proximity}} {{to a number of}} other prehistoric settlements, probably dates back to the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture of late Paleolithic antiquity. In 1469, the village was a <b>peasant</b> <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> under the name Zalissia (Залісся) or Zalishche (Залісще), as was the nearby community of Dobrivlyany, which was absorbed as a subdivision of the modern city in 1981. In 1569, Zalishchyky was assigned to the Podolian Voivodship, an administrative unit of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, to which the town became a seat for their county in 1774. In 1578, the village adopted the name [...] "Zalishchyky". In 1594, Stanisław Żółkiewski raised an army in Zalishchyky and defended the locale from a Tartar invasion. In 1672, the village was completely destroyed by Turk invaders during the Second Polish-Ottoman War. In 1750, at the invitation of Prince Stanisław Poniatowski, Saxon weavers of Silesian cloth settled on part of an historically older portion of Zalishchyky, and named it Hinterwälden. The establishment marked Zalishchyky's transition from a village to a true town. Hinterwälden still survives today, and is now known as [...] "Old Zalishchyky". In 1766, Zalishchyky received the right to self-governance under the Magdeburg Law. The 1772 census lists 159 Jewish families of varying professions dwelling in Zalishchyky. Between 1772 and 1918 Zalishchyky was ruled by the Austrian states of the Habsburg Monarchy, Austrian Empire, and finally Austria-Hungary, though between 1809-1816 it was under control of the Russian Empire.|$|E

In {{landscape}} studies, {{indices are}} important for revealing underperforming dimensions of a landscape and for helping landscape managers to direct effort and resources accordingly. Indices also enable comparison across different landscapes. The present {{study was conducted in}} a <b>peasant</b> <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> within a transfrontier conservation area and which is recognised as a biodiversity hotspot. This is an area designated for balancing farming, natural resource utilisation and biodiversity conservation. This study demonstrates a method of constructing an index for estimating the feasibility of planning and implementing agriculture-biodiversity integration for livelihood improvement (known as ecoagriculture) within specified socio-economic and environmental conditions. Often, complex mathematical computations are employed in constructing feasibility indices. In this study an ecoagriculture feasibility index for a particular landscape is calculated based on evaluation of the landscape. The resultant ecoagriculture feasibility index is 5. 90 (or 74 %) implying a relatively high feasibility for systematic ecoagriculture implementation in the area. The criterion for quantifying ecoagriculture feasibility suggested here is intended to be as user-friendly as possible to enhance its adoption by peasant farmers and other end-users.

40|$|This article {{examines}} why peasant communities in South West Cameroon have contested a U. S. -based company’s intentions {{to establish an}} agro-industrial palm oil plantation in their region. Land investments {{in the form of}} agro plantations, if not properly conceived, negotiated, and implemented, pose a series of threats to the ecological, cultural, and economic stability among <b>peasant</b> <b>farming</b> <b>communities,</b> who depend on land and forest resources for their livelihood. Using Nguti as a case study, this article argues that local communities do not oppose investment in land but they contest projects that attempt to alienate them from their sources of livelihood without providing alternatives. The study also demonstrates how local communities, despite being critical of the project, struggle with the company through their relations with government, to demand new social contracts and/or memoranda that could offer them greater opportunities as economic partners. The article concludes that for palm oil plantations to be economically equitable, local communities’ incorporation is necessary to safeguard rural livelihoods and to ensure that provisions are made for adequate compensation and alternative sources of livelihood...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} on synergies {{due to the}} sequencing and packaging of water reforms based on a review of case studies from the Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS) in the Yangtze River basin in China. Faced with strategic challenges of economic growth, food security, population growth, and climate change, China has implemented numerous hardware and software interventions in the water sector to increase the availability of water. These interventions ranging from the provincial and system level to farm and field level allow reallocation of water from agriculture to higher value uses, without significant reduction in crop production. This review of selected hardware and software interventions suggests that water sector reforms generate significant benefits for <b>peasant</b> <b>farming</b> <b>communities</b> and local governments. The review indicates that all agents respond to {{the same set of}} incentives simultaneously, by changing production and resource use decisions such that cumulative benefits from hardware and software interventions reinforce synergies. Synergies from reforms are evident, yet scaling up local collective actions for optimal impact is problematic. Heterogeneity in socioeconomic factors, as well as spatial differences, are the main stumbling blocks. Rewarding reformers seems to work, yet the benefits are neither immediate nor straight forward. Local implementation of national policies requires a systematic and coherent framework suited to the level of economic development of each region in order to achieve synergies from water reforms. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the use of}} natural resources in the Berau District of East Kalimantan (Indonesia), where environmental conditions are considered at risk. Policy change, rapid economic development and the inflow of various population groups {{have important implications for}} the access to and control by local populations, forest products, land, marine products, and other natural resources. The above processes have both positive and negative impacts at the district level. On the other hand, the communities and their households are facing the full force of externally induced changes in their livelihood conditions and perspectives, without being able to exert control over these changes. The communities react in different ways, as revealed by our research in four types of communities, namely tribal, <b>peasant</b> and pioneer <b>farming</b> <b>communities</b> in the interior, and fishing communities on the coast. No <b>farming</b> or fishing <b>community</b> has been left unaffected by the changes that have occurred in the area, as each of the changes has {{had an impact on the}} main resource use systems, the livelihood conditions, and the levels of commercialization and social differentiation. These forces of change have to some extent triggered the establishment of new resource use systems, such as gold mining (tribal <b>communities),</b> permanent <b>farming</b> systems (<b>peasant</b> <b>communities),</b> rubber and cocoa plantation (pioneer and peasant communities), and bagan and aquaculture (coastal communities). The forces of change have also reduced or modified the existing resource use systems, such as the shift from swidden cultivation to more permanent and commercial agricultural systems, the increased level of commercialization, in terms of the use of technology, and created social differentiation among the communities. The tribal communities seem to be the least flexible in facing the forces of change whereas the <b>peasant</b> <b>farming</b> <b>communities</b> emerged as the most flexible. In addition, none of the communities can be conceived as a closed unit of analysis, or even as a homogeneous social entity, because each includes different types of households and different strategy groups, and each reacts differently to the processes of change. Some responses are strongly related to their socio-cultural background, while others are determined by the flexibility of their resources use systems. As a result, the communities show considerable mutual and internal differences in coping with the major factors of change and in managing their natural resources as a result of these changes. Furthermore, the various sustainability analyses have shown how important it is to include economic, social and ecological dimensions, as they are strongly interlinked. A system with high values in only one of the dimensions does not necessarily achieve a better total score, as the other dimensions may provide much lower values. Thus, a balancing of the combination of these three dimensions is imperative in assessing the overall sustainability characteristics, and in exploring ways to improve the sustainability of the respective systems. The government’s policy approach should also take into account the differences between communities, as no single and uniform solution can be applied to all types of <b>farming</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Production of low-input, shaded {{coffee in}} the Los Tuxtlas UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (LTBR), Veracruz, Mexico, an {{economically}} marginalized but ecologically rich region, was strongly affected by the collapse in international prices and the reconfiguration of the Mexican coffee sector in the 1990 s. This place-based study used qualitative methods to investigate local strategies to reactivate coffee cultivation and improve market integration. Ninety-five producers, processors and cooperative representatives were interviewed to: 1) characterize the different actors in the local coffee commodity chain; 2) explore how producers, organized or not, shape and are constrained by the local coffee sector, and 3) evaluate whether producers land use strategies may be compatible with conservation in the LTBR. We combine the Land Sparing and Sharing framework with the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve zonation system to conceptualize how coffee plantations can be spatially integrated in protected areas and facilitate synergies between local livelihoods and conservation. Our empirical study illustrates the complexity and dynamism of the LTBR coffee sector. It highlights the resourcefulness of producers in adapting their cultivation systems, but also the narrow maneuvering room farmers have to exploit textbook synergies between conservation and fair trade and / or certified organic markets. In principle, coffee cultivation can be expanded and intensified without affecting remaining primary forest (Land Sparing) and contribute to maintain a diverse landscape matrix in productive agroforestry systems (Land Sharing). However, few producers have the means required to successfully achieve profitable and long-term market integration. Future research on sustainable land use management in, and around, protected areas needs to explicitly address local, sectoral and market dynamics as drivers of land use at the local level. Although these dynamics may create windows of opportunity for the biggest and best-connected producers, they exacerbate asymmetries inside <b>peasant</b> <b>farming</b> <b>communities</b> and weaken producers cooperatives...|$|R

5000|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, a monocrop economy {{based on}} {{sugarcane}} production for export flourished. In {{the last quarter of}} the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. By the 1820s, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined. By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. A major reason for the decline was the British Parliament's 1807 abolition of the slave trade, under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden; the abolition of the slave trade was followed by the abolition of slavery in 1834 and full emancipation within four years. Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the post-Civil War South of the United States, planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from India, China, and Sierra Leone. Many of the former slaves settled in <b>peasant</b> or small <b>farm</b> <b>communities</b> in the interior of the island, the [...] "yam belt," [...] where they engaged in subsistence and some cash crop farming.|$|R
