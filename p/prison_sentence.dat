40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} racist policing, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and the disproportionate imposition of mandatory <b>prison</b> <b>sentences</b> on Black-Canadians It argues that the retention and expansion of mandatory <b>prison</b> <b>sentences</b> for serious offences {{will serve as a}} powerful means to perpetuate systemic racism in the criminal justice system.
