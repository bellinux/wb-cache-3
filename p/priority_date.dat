2500|$|The Department of State's [...] "Visa Bulletin," [...] issued every month, {{gives the}} <b>priority</b> <b>date</b> for those {{petition}} beneficiaries currently entitled {{to apply for}} immigrant status through immigrant visas or adjustment of status. There is no annual quota for the spouses, unmarried children, and parents of U.S. citizens, {{so there is no}} waiting period for these applicants—just the required processing time. [...] However, all other family-based categories have significant backlogs, even with a U.S. citizen petitioner.|$|E

50|$|When the Visa <b>priority</b> <b>dates</b> move {{backward}} in time rather than forward, {{the phenomenon is}} known as Visa retrogression. Visa retrogression occurs when more people apply for a Visa in a particular category or country than there are Visas available.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Priority</b> <b>date</b> – {{the visa}} becomes {{available}} when the applicant's <b>priority</b> <b>date</b> is {{earlier than the}} cutoff date announced on the DOS's Visa Bulletin or when the immigrant visa category the applicant is assigned to is announced as [...] "current". [...] A [...] "current" [...] designation indicates that visa numbers are available to all applicants in the corresponding immigrant category. Petitions with priority dates earlier than the cutoff date {{are expected to have}} visas available, therefore those applicants are eligible for final adjudication. When the NVC determines that a visa number could be available for a particular immigrant petition, a visa is tentatively allocated to the applicant. The NVC will send a letter stating that the applicant may be eligible for adjustment of status, and requiring the applicant to choose either to adjust status with the USCIS directly, or apply at the U.S. consulate abroad. This waiting process determines when the applicant can expect the immigration case to be adjudicated. Due to quotas imposed on EB visa categories, there are more approved immigrant petitions than visas available under INA. High demand for visas has created a backlog of approved but unadjudicated cases. In addition, due to processing inefficiencies throughout DOS and USCIS systems, not all visas available under the quota system in a given year were allocated to applicants by the DOS. Since there is no quota carry-over to the next fiscal year, for several years visa quotas have not been fully used, thus adding to the visa backlog.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} of inventorship {{has been}} {{resolved by the}} existence of a 1997 <b>priority</b> <b>date</b> patent application by Eran Reshef, Gili Raanan and Eilon Solan who worked at Sanctum on Application Security Firewall. Their patent application details that [...] "The invention is based on applying human advantage in applying sensory and cognitive skills to solving simple problems that prove to be extremely hard for computer software. Such skills include, {{but are not limited to}} processing of sensory information such as identification of objects and letters within a noisy graphical environment"; and a 1998 patent by Lillibridge, Abadi, Bharat, and Broder,. Both patents predate other publications by several years, though they do not use the term CAPTCHA, they describe the ideas in detail and precisely depict the graphical CAPTCHAs used in the Web today.|$|E
2500|$|Green-card holders {{married to}} non-U.S. {{citizens}} {{are able to}} legally bring their spouses and minor children to join them in the USA, but must wait for their <b>priority</b> <b>date</b> to become current. The foreign spouse of a green-card holder must wait for approval of an [...] "immigrant visa" [...] from the State Department before entering the United States. Due to numerical limitation {{on the number of}} these visas, the wait time for approval may be months or years. In the interim, the spouse cannot be legally present in the United States, unless he or she secures a visa by some other means. Green-card holders may opt to wait to become U.S. citizens, and only then sponsor their spouses and children, as the process is much faster for U.S. citizens. However, many green-card holders can choose to apply for the spouse or children and update their application after becoming a U.S. citizen.|$|E
50|$|Applications are {{processed}} from earlier to later <b>Priority</b> <b>Dates.</b> At any given point in time, the cutoff date (also {{known as the}} Qualifying Date) for current processing for each combination of category and country of chargeability is available, and published in the Visa Bulletin.|$|R

There are also many old labor certification cases pending under pre-PERM rules.|$|R
2500|$|Labor {{certification}} – {{the employer}} must legally {{prove that it}} has a need to hire an alien for a specific position and that there is no minimally qualified U.S. citizen or LPR available to fill that position, hence the reason for hiring the alien. Some of the requirements to prove this situation include: proof of advertising for the specific position; skill requirements particular to the job; verification of the prevailing wage for a position; and the employer's ability to pay. This is currently done through an electronic system known as PERM. [...] The date when the labor certification application is filed becomes the applicant's <b>priority</b> <b>date.</b> In some cases, for highly skilled foreign nationals (EB1 and EB2 National Interest Waiver, e.g. researchers, athletes, artists or business executives) and [...] "Schedule A" [...] labor (nurses and physical therapists), this step is waived. This step is processed by the United States Department of Labor (DOL). [...] The labor certification is valid for 6 months from the time it is approved.|$|E

By posing questions to the user {{in a number of}} stages, enough information was gleaned from the user's answers to produce the required documents. Questions posed in the second and subsequent stages were determined from previous answers provided and the user's answers were stored in a database structure. This process was repeated until the user had provided enough information to allow the documents legally required to create the corporate entity to be generated. A number of document templates were also stored and the data processor was configured to merge {{at least one of these}} templates with the user's answers to generate the required legal documents. The documents could then be sent to the user in an electronic form for the user to print out and submit, mailed to the user, or submitted to the appropriate registration authority on behalf of the user.|$|E

[...] If only the known MP3 patents filed by December 1992 are considered, then MP3 decoding has been patent-free in the US since 22 September 2015, when , which had a PCT filing in October 1992, expired.

40|$|Patent {{prior art}} {{retrieval}} aims to find related publications, especially patents, which may invalidate the patent. The task exhibits its own characteristic {{because of the}} possible use of a whole patent as a query.

Retrieval is performed on the collection of patents which also share the same structure as the query patent, mainly <b>priority</b> <b>dates,</b> application date, publication date and content fields. Unsurprisingly, results show that filtering using date information improves retrieval significantly. However, results also show that a careful choice of the date filter is important, given the multiple date fields existent in a patent. The actual ranking query is constructed based on word distributions of title, claims and content fields of the query patent. As {{this is the first time}} this task is run, and the training collection is fairly small (15 topics), we expect more findings to come given the 1000 topic test set made available by TREC Chemical track organizers. ...|$|R
