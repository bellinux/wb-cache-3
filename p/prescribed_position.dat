[...] "As soon {{as he had been}} carefully adjusted in the <b>prescribed</b> <b>position</b> over the hives, and almost before the gaolers had time to retire to a safe distance, Vespaluus gave a lusty and well-aimed kick, which sent all three hives toppling one over another. The next moment he was wrapped from head to foot in bees; each individual insect nursed the dreadful and humiliating knowledge that in this supreme hour of catastrophe it could not sting, but each felt that it ought to pretend to. Vespaluus squealed and wriggled with laughter, for he was being tickled nearly to death, and now and again he gave a furious kick and used a bad word {{as one of the few}} bees that had escaped disarmament got its protest home. But the spectators saw with amazement that he showed no signs of approaching death agony, and as the bees dropped wearily away in clusters from his body his flesh was seen to be as white and smooth as before the ordeal, with a shiny glaze from the honey-smear of innumerable bee-feet, and here and there a small red spot where one of the rare stings had left its mark. It was obvious that a miracle had been performed in his favour, and one loud murmur, of astonishment or exultation, rose from the onlooking crowd. The king gave orders for Vespaluus to be taken down to await further orders, and stalked silently back to his midday meal, at which he was careful to eat heartily and drink copiously as though nothing unusual had happened. After dinner he sent for the Royal Librarian.|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} three purposes. The {{first one is}} to prove unobstructedness of {{deformation}} of pseudoholomorphic curves with cusps and tacnodes. We show that if the first Chern class of a 4 -dimensional symplectic manifold is sufficiently positive then the deformation is unobstructed. We prove this result when the curves have cusps and nodes, not in a <b>prescribed</b> <b>position.</b> We also prove a similar result when the curves have cusps and tacnodes in a <b>prescribed</b> <b>position</b> with a prescribed tangency and in addition nodes, not in a <b>prescribed</b> <b>position.</b> The second part of this work deals with the local symplectic isotopy problem for cuspidal curves. Let B be the unit ball in R 4 with the standard symplectic form wst. Let J 0 be a wst-tame almost complex structure. Let Co c B be a connected J-holomorphic curve in B with a isolated singularity at 0 E B and without multiple components. Assume in addition that the boundary OCo is smoothly embedded. We prove that any two connected, reduced pseudoholomorphic curves in B, with {{the same number of}} irreducible components, the same number of nodal points and at most one ordinary cusp point, both sufficiently close to Co, are symplectic isotopic to each other. The third part of this work deals with the global symplectic isotopy problem. As an application of unobstructedness of deformation, we show that any irreducible rational pseudo-holomorphic curve in CP 2 of degree d, with only nodes and m ordinary cusps as its singularities, is symplectic isotopic to a holomorphic curve as long as d > m. by Sandra Francisco.

To this end, we entangle the quantum states of qubits that are mutually coupled by a plasmonic nanoantenna.

This occurs despite the high losses associated to the plasmonic nanoantenna that are usually considered as being detrimental. The entanglement scheme is shown to be quite robust against variations in the transition frequencies of the quantum dots and deviations in their <b>prescribed</b> <b>position</b> with respect to the nanoantenna.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to introduce, in detail, a novel {{approach}} for tuning of anisochronic singleinput single-output controllers for infinite-dimensional feedback control systems. A class of Linear Time- Invariant Time Delay Systems (LTI TDSs) is taken as a typical representative of infinite-dimensional systems. Control design to obtain the eventual controller structure is made in the special ring of quasipolynomial meromorphic functions (RMS). The use of this algebraic approach with a simple feedback loop for unstable or integrating systems leads to infinite-dimensional (delayed) controllers as well as the whole feedback loop. A natural task is to set tunable controller parameters in order to form the crucial area of the infinite closed-loop spectrum. It is worth noting that not only poles yet also zeros are taken into account. The <b>prescribed</b> <b>positions</b> of the right-most reference-to-output poles and zeros are given on the basis of the desired overshoot for a simple finite-dimensional matching model the detailed analysis of which is provided. The dominant poles and zeros are shifted to the <b>prescribed</b> <b>positions</b> using the Quasi-Continuous Shifting Algorithm (QCSA) followed by the use of an advanced optimization algorithm. The whole methodology is called the Pole-Placement Shifting based controller tuning Algorithm (PPSA). The PPSA is demonstrated on the setting of parameters of delayed controller for an unstable time delay plant of a skater on the controlled swaying bow. This example, however, shows a treachery of the algorithm and a natural feature of an infinite-dimensional system - namely, that its spectrum or even its dominant part can not be placed arbitrarily. Advantages and drawback as well as possible modification of the algorithm are also discussed...|$|R
