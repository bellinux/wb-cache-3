5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on June 8, 2015, at Apple's WWDC that the iPad 2 would support iOS 9. This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features are unavailable on the iPad 2, including predictive Siri, translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and picture-in-picture multitasking, Low <b>Power</b> <b>Mode</b> and the Health app. iOS 9 {{is said to}} feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest {{that it did not}} significantly impact available space. Other A5-based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and iPod Touch 5G (four major iOS versions).|$|E

25|$|Despite being {{introduced}} in iOS 9.3 in March 2016, it wasn't {{possible to use}} Night Shift and Low <b>Power</b> <b>Mode</b> simultaneously until the release of iOS 9.3.2 two months later. Night Shift requires a 64-bit processor only found in the Apple A7 or newer chips, which means older iOS devices, including the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, first-generation iPad Mini, and iPod Touch 5, do not receive Night Shift mode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − This paper {{presents}} an efficient system level power saving method for DRAM with multiple <b>power</b> <b>modes.</b> The proposed method {{is based on}} the power aware scheduling algorithm that controls DRAM modules in coarse grain in which the scheduler assigns appropriate <b>power</b> <b>modes</b> to memory banks at context switching time. The method controls the transition of multiple <b>power</b> <b>modes,</b> which is currently available technology, based on the history of gaining processor and memory bank usage of each process. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes in multiprogramming environment...|$|R

25|$|Demand {{response}} devices {{could receive}} {{all sorts of}} messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low <b>power</b> <b>mode</b> similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent {{of the time of}} day. The vehicle-to-grid suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Monitors running screensavers {{consume the}} same amount of power as when running normally, which can be {{anywhere}} from a few watts for small LCD monitors to several hundred for large plasma displays. Most modern computers can be set to switch the monitor into a lower <b>power</b> <b>mode,</b> blanking the screen altogether. A power-saving mode for monitors is usually part of the power management options supported in most modern operating systems, though it must also be supported by the computer hardware and monitor itself.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the BRT moved to {{eliminate}} remaining operations that required elevated trains to operate under overhead wire. In most cases this meant using third rail on fully grade-separated lines. When third rail was extended on the Canarsie Line {{it was decided}} to extend this <b>power</b> <b>mode</b> only as far as the important station at Rockaway Parkway and Glenwood Road. Beyond that point, frequent grade crossings made third rail impractical. This portion of the line was converted to the Canarsie Shuttle using elevated cars in October 1917 and converted to trolley cars on October 18, 1920.|$|E
50|$|Power gating affects design {{architecture}} {{more than}} clock gating. It increases time delays, as <b>power</b> gated <b>modes</b> {{have to be}} safely entered and exited. Architectural trade-offs exist between designing {{for the amount of}} leakage power saving in low <b>power</b> <b>modes</b> and the energy dissipation to enter and exit the low <b>power</b> <b>modes.</b> Shutting down the blocks can be accomplished either by software or hardware. Driver software can schedule the power down operations. Hardware timers can be utilized. A dedicated power management controller is another option.|$|R

25|$|The PC-24 {{is powered}} by a pair of Williams FJ44-4A {{turbofan}} engines. A unique feature of the FJ44-4A powerplant is the Quiet Power Mode; in addition to providing thrust and main power, standby power is also drawn from the main engines in Quiet <b>Power</b> <b>Mode,</b> in place of a separate auxiliary power unit (APU). An additional 5 per cent is available via an Automatic Thrust Reserve feature. The engines are mounted on the upper portion of the rear fuselage to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) during operations at rough airstrips. Other FOD-reduction measures include the enlarged flaps and chines on the nose wheel of the landing gear. The exhaust ducts of the engines feature an aerodynamic modification, having been shaped so the outflow contributes to the thrust vector during takeoff, reducing the takeoff roll distance.|$|E
25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid {{engine control unit}} (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient {{battery state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce throttle response, reducing the throttle opening to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. <b>Power</b> <b>mode</b> increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
2500|$|... iOS 9 {{comes with}} two {{important}} battery-saving updates. When a phone {{has been placed}} face-down, the screen will not light up upon receiving notifications.

For example, background app refresh and push email are paused during Low <b>Power</b> <b>Mode.</b> When a phone reaches 20% battery level, users are automatically prompted to turn on Low <b>Power</b> <b>Mode,</b> which changes the color of the battery icon in the top row status bar on the screen.

It also fixed a Bluetooth issue for iPhone SE. However, iOS 9.3.2 bricked some 9.7-inch iPad Pros, preventing them from being used. Apple pulled the update for iPad Pro on May 20, 2016, and re-released 9.3.2 for the device on June 2, 2016, fixing the issue.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1983 models {{not much}} was altered, {{but there was}} an {{increase}} in power output to [...] and [...] of torque from the same 5M-GE. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed. It featured an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT).

40|$|Abstract—Most Ethernet {{interfaces}} {{available for}} deployment in switches and hosts today can {{operate in a}} variety of different low <b>power</b> <b>modes.</b> However, currently these modes have very limited usage models. They do not take advantage of periods of inactivity, when the links remain idle or under-utilized. In this study, we propose methods that allow for detection of such periods to obtain energy savings with little impact on loss or delay. We evaluate our methods {{on a wide range of}} real-time traffic traces collected at a high-speed backbone switch within our campus LAN. Our results show that Ethernet interfaces at both ends can be put in extremely low <b>power</b> <b>modes</b> anywhere from 40 %- 98 % of the time observed.

30|$|Microprocessors often offer low <b>power</b> <b>modes</b> or a Dynamic Frequency and Voltage Scaling (DVFS) ability [46].

The CPU model defines multiple power levels (Normal, Idle, Sleep, and Doze modes) and switches between <b>power</b> <b>modes</b> depending on the DPM activity. If a more complex CPU model is required, {{we can use the}} SoftExplorer [36] tool to extract more accurate model coefficients. If external RAM is present, the model has the ability to shutdown the RAM when in low-power mode. An enhancement could be to include OS task scheduling activity for applying DVFS.|$|R
