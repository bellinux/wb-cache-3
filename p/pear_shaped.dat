5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is a {{seasonal}} breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are {{situated at the}} base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or <b>pear</b> <b>shaped,</b> with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or sedges. Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit of}} hickory is <b>pear</b> <b>shaped</b> and {{enclosed}} {{in a thin}} husk developed from the floral involucre. The fruit ripens in September and October, and seeds are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and split away from the nut into four valves along sutures. Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to the nut, which is unribbed, with a thick shell.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to changes}} in market {{desirability}} and popularity, the value of different styles of diamond fluctuate. All diamonds can be recut into new shapes that will increase value {{at that time in}} the market and desirability. An example of this is the marquise cut diamond which was popular in the 1970s to 1980s. In later decades, jewelers had little success in selling this shape in comparison to other shapes like the oval or <b>pear</b> <b>shape.</b> The marquise can be cut into an oval diamond by any diamond cutter with a loss of 5-10% in total weight. For example a 1.10 carat marquise shape would be a 1.00 oval cut diamond by rounding the sharp points and creating an oval which currently in the market has a much greater desirability and resale value. The same marquise shape also could become a <b>pear</b> <b>shape</b> instead by only trimming and rounding the side which will be turned into the base of the <b>pear</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|R

2500|$|At {{the very}} end of the 19th century, a new style, with a carved top and back {{construction}} inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European-style bowl-back instruments in the United States.

Gibson mandolins evolved into two basic styles: the Florentine or F-style, which has a decorative scroll near the neck, two points on the lower body and usually a scroll carved into the headstock; and the A-style, which is <b>pear</b> <b>shaped,</b> has no points and usually has a simpler headstock.|$|E

5000|$|A second theory, more {{complicated}} than triaxiality, proposed that observed long periodic orbital variations of the first Earth satellites indicate an additional depression {{at the south pole}} accompanied by a bulge of the same degree at the north pole. It is also contended that the northern middle latitudes were slightly flattened and the southern middle latitudes bulged in a similar amount. This concept suggested a slightly pear-shaped Earth and was the subject of much public discussion.
