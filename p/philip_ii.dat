5|$|After his {{election}} by the League of Corinth as their commander-in-chief (strategos autokrator) of a forthcoming campaign {{to invade the}} Achaemenid Empire, <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> sought to shore up further Macedonian support by marrying Cleopatra Eurydice, niece of general Attalus. Yet talk of providing new potential heirs infuriated Philip II's son Alexander (already {{a veteran of the}} Battle of Chaeronea) and his mother Olympias, who fled together to Epirus before Alexander was recalled to Pella. Further tensions arose when <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> offered his son Arrhidaeus's hand in marriage to Ada of Caria, daughter of Pixodarus, the Persian satrap of Caria. When Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead, Philip cancelled the wedding arrangements altogether and exiled Alexander's advisors Ptolemy, Nearchus, and Harpalus. To reconcile with Olympias, <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> had their daughter Cleopatra marry Olympias' brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) Alexander I of Epirus, yet <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias of Orestis during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Macedonia {{during the}} reign of <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding Illyrians and Thracians. Chief among Philip's Thracian enemies was the ruler Kersebleptes, who may have coordinated a {{temporary}} alliance with Athens. In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC, <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a tributary vassal, conquering much of Thrace in the process and founding new cities there such as Philippi (modern Filippoi, Greece) and Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria). <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> also fought against the Illyrian king Bardylis, who threatened Macedonia proper, and against Grabos and Pleuratus in Illyria (centred in modern-day Albania).|$|E

5|$|The ecclesia officially {{accepted}} Philip's harsh terms, {{including the}} renouncement of {{their claim to}} Amphipolis. However, when an Athenian delegation arrived at Pella to put Phillip under oath, which was required to conclude the treaty, he was campaigning abroad.* G.

Being very anxious about the delay, Demosthenes insisted that the embassy should travel {{to the place where}} they would find Philip and swear him in without delay.

5|$|The elite hypaspistai infantry, {{composed}} of handpicked {{men from the}} ranks of the pezhetairoi and perhaps synonymous with earlier doryphoroi, were formed during the reign of <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes) and royal pages (basilikoi paides). <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was also able to field archers, including mercenary Cretan archers and perhaps some native Macedonians. It is unclear if the Thracians, Paionians, and Illyrians fighting as javelin throwers, slingers, and archers serving in Macedonian armies from the reign of <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> onward were conscripted as allies via a treaty or were simply hired mercenaries. <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery firing large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional standing army. The increase in state revenues allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes. Although it did not succeed in every battle, the army of <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was able to successfully adopt the military tactics of its enemies, such as the embolon (i.e. 'flying wedge') formation of the Scythians. This offered cavalry far greater maneuverability and an edge in battle that previously did not exist in the Classical Greek world.|$|E

John attended the funeral of <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> at the Basilica of St Denis in July; Philip bequeathed more than 150,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land. John then visited England, attempting to mediate a peace treaty between England and France after his return to France.|$|E

5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred {{in the span of}} just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E

5|$|After campaigning {{against the}} Thracian ruler Cersobleptes, <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> began his {{war against the}} Chalcidian League in 349 BC, which had been {{reestablished}} in 375 BC following a temporary disbandment. Despite an Athenian intervention by Charidemus, Olynthos was captured by <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> in 348 BC, whereupon he sold its inhabitants into slavery, bringing back some Athenian citizens to Macedonia as slaves as well. The Athenians, especially {{in a series of}} speeches by Demosthenes known as the Olynthiacs, were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack, so in 346 BC, they concluded a treaty with Macedonia known as the Peace of Philocrates. The treaty stipulated that Athens would relinquish claims to Macedonian coastal territories, the Chalcidice, and Amphipolis in return for the release of the enslaved Athenians as well as guarantees that Philip would not attack Athenian settlements in the Thracian Chersonese. Meanwhile, Phocis and Thermopylae were captured, the Delphic temple robbers executed, and <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was awarded the two Phocian seats on the Amphictyonic Council as well as the position of master of ceremonies over the Pythian Games. Athens initially opposed his membership on the council and refused to attend the games in protest, but they were eventually swayed to accept these conditions, partially due to the oration On the Peace by Demosthenes.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} few years <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was {{occupied}} with reorganizing the administrative system of Thessaly, campaigning against the Illyrian ruler Pleuratus I, deposing Arybbas in Epirus in favor of his brother-in-law Alexander I (through Philip II's marriage with Olympias), and defeating Cersebleptes in Thrace. This allowed him to extend Macedonian control over the Hellespont in anticipation of an invasion into Achaemenid Asia. In what is now Bulgaria, <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> conquered the Thracian city of Panegyreis in 342 BC and reestablished it as Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Roman-era Trimontium). War broke out with Athens in 340 BC while <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of Perinthus and Byzantion, followed by a successful campaign against the Scythians along the Danube and Macedonia's involvement in the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa in 339 BC. Hostilities between Thebes and Macedonia began when Thebes ousted a Macedonian garrison from Nicaea (near Thermopylae), leading Thebes to join Athens, Megara, Corinth, Achaea, and Euboea in a final confrontation against Macedonia at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. After the Macedonian victory there, <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> imposed harsh conditions on Thebes, installing an oligarchy there, yet was lenient to Athens due to his desire to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. He was then chiefly responsible for the formation of the League of Corinth that included the major Greek city-states minus Sparta, being elected as the leader (hegemon) of its council (synedrion) by the spring of 337 BC despite the Kingdom of Macedonia being excluded as an official member of the league. The Panhellenic fear of another Persian invasion of Greece perhaps contributed to Philip II's decision to invade the Achaemenid Empire. The Persian aid offered to Perinthus and Byzantion in 341-340 BC highlighted Macedonia's strategic need to secure Thrace and the Aegean Sea against increasing Achaemenid encroachment, as Artaxerxes III further consolidated his control over satrapies in western Anatolia. The latter region, yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than the Balkans, was also coveted by the Macedonian king for its sheer economic potential.|$|E

5|$|In the 1190s, {{however, the}} {{struggle}} for power in France began to swing in favour of <b>Philip</b> <b>II,</b> culminating in the Capetian capture of Normandy in 1204. <b>Philip</b> <b>II</b> started to construct completely circular keeps, such as the Tour Jeanne d'Arc, with most built in his newly acquired territories. The first of Philip's new keeps was begun at the Louvre in 1190 and at least another twenty followed, all built to a consistent standard and cost. The architectural idea of circular keeps {{may have come from}} Catalonia, where circular towers in castles formed a local tradition, and probably carried some military advantages, but Philip's intention in building these new keeps in a fresh style was clearly political, an attempt to demonstrate his new power and authority over his extended territories. As historian Philippe Durand suggests, these keeps provided military security and were a physical representation of the renouveau capétien, or Capetian renewal.|$|E
