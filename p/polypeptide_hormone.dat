25|$|The POMC gene {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 2p23.3. The POMC gene is expressed in both the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. This gene encodes a 285-amino acid <b>polypeptide</b> <b>hormone</b> precursor that undergoes extensive, tissue-specific, post-translational processing via cleavage by subtilisin-like enzymes known as prohormone convertases. The encoded protein is synthesized mainly in corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, where four cleavage sites are used; adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), essential for normal steroidogenesis {{and the maintenance of}} normal adrenal weight, and β-lipotropin are the major end-products. However, there are at least eight potential cleavage sites within the polypeptide precursor and, depending on tissue type and the available convertases, processing may yield as many as ten biologically active peptides involved in diverse cellular functions. Cleavage sites consist of the sequences Arg-Lys, Lys-Arg, or Lys-Lys. Enzymes responsible for processing of POMC peptides include prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), carboxypeptidase E (CPE), peptidyl α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), N-acetyltransferase (N-AT), and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP).|$|E
5000|$|Some {{proteins}} and most eukaryotic <b>polypeptide</b> <b>hormones</b> are synthesized {{as a large}} precursor polypeptide known as a polyprotein that requires proteolytic cleavage into individual smaller polypeptide chains. The polyprotein pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) contains many <b>polypeptide</b> <b>hormones.</b> The cleavage pattern of POMC, however, may vary between different tissues, yielding different sets of <b>polypeptide</b> <b>hormones</b> from the same polyprotein. [...] Many viruses also produce their proteins initially as a single polypeptide chain that were translated from a polycistronic mRNA.
