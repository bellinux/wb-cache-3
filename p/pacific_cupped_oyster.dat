In this study the impact of feeding Skeletonema costatum and Rhodomonas baltica on the biochemical composition and sensory characteristics of <b>Pacific</b> <b>cupped</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea gigas) from the Eastern Scheldt during land-based refinement was studied. After a feeding period of four and seven weeks market-sized oysters were sampled {{for the analysis of}} fatty acids, free amino acids and volatile organic compounds and for a sensory evaluation by consumers and an expert panel. The algae Skeletonema costatum showed a lower ∑. PUFA, ∑. n. - 3, ∑. n. - 6, C 18 : 2 n 6, C 18 : 3 n 3, C 18 : 4 n 3, C 22 : 6 n 3 content as compared with Rhodomonas baltica. These differences were also reflected in the fatty acid profile of the oysters fed with the corresponding algae diets. Furthermore, general linear model and principal component analysis showed marked differences in free amino acids and volatile organic compound content between Skeletonema, Rhodomonas fed oysters and reference oysters. For example, threonine, glutamine, leucine, histidine, (E) - 2 -hexenal, (E) - 2 octenal, (E) - 2 -octen- 1 -ol, (E,E) - 2, 4 -octadien- 1 -ol, (E,Z) - 3, 6 -nonadien- 1 -ol and (Z,E) - 2, 6 -nonadienal contents were higher in Skeletonema fed oysters compared to Rhodomonas fed oysters.

Several diseases which occur in hatcheries could be disseminated with live transfers to grow-out areas. On the other hand, hatchery production may also be a way to provide disease-free juveniles and therefore be a pivotal tool to prevent the transfer of infected stocks to susceptible areas.

Since 1991, annual mass mortality of juveniles has been reported during summer months. These recurring episodes concern professionals who fear that like Portugese oyster, C. angulata, C. gigas could in turn disappear following one of these epizooties. Previously, bacteriological analysis of moribund oyster juveniles yielded an isolate of a Vibrio splendidus biovar II strain, named TNEMF 6. This isolate was demonstrated to be pathogenic to Crassostrea gigas spat by experimental challenge. To study the association between summer oyster mortality and presence of TNEMF 6 cluster strains, Vibrionaceae fauna were isolated from infected spat along the French Atlantic coast between 1997 - 1998. Strains related to V. splendidus biovar II were selected. Comparison with TNEMF 6 was performed by classical biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction - {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (PCR-RFLP) of SSU rDNA, rpoD, and gyrB genes.

Different hypothesis including {{the implication of}} environmental factors, toxic algae and/or pathogens have been explored. Diagnostic tests indicated that OsHV- 1 including a particular genotype, termed OsHV- 1 μVar, was detected in most of samples and especially in moribund oysters with the highlighting of virus particles looking like herpes viruses by TEM examination. In this study, an experimental protocol to reproduce OsHV- 1 infection in laboratory conditions was developed. This protocol {{was based on the}} intramuscular injection of filtered (0. 22 μm) tissue homogenates prepared from naturally OsHV- 1 infected spat collected on French coasts during mortality outbreaks in 2008. Results of the experimental trials showed that mortalities were induced after injection. Moreover, filtered tissue homogenates induced mortalities whereas the same tissue homogenates exposed to an ultraviolet (UV) treatment did not induce any mortality suggesting that oyster spat mortalities require the presence of a UV sensitive agent. Furthermore, analysis of injected oyster spat revealed the detection of high amounts of OsHV- 1 DNA by real-time quantitative PCR. Finally, TEM analysis demonstrated the presence of herpes virus particles. The developed protocol allowed to maintain sources of infective virus which can be useful for the development of further studies concerning the transmission and the development of OsHV- 1 infection. </p...|$|E

OsHV- 1 {{has been associated with}} mortality outbreaks in different bivalve species including the <b>Pacific</b> <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas. Since 2008, massive mortality events have been reported among C. gigas in Europe in relation to the detection of a variant of OsHV- 1, called μVar. Since 2009, this variant has been mainly detected in France. These results raise questions about the emergence and the virulence of this variant. The search for association between specific virus genetic markers and clinical symptoms is of great interest and the characterization of the genetic variability of OsHV- 1 specimens is an area of growing interest. Determination of nucleotide sequences of PCR-amplified virus DNA fragments has already been used to characterize OsHV- 1 specimens and virus variants have thus been described. However, the virus DNA sequencing approach is time-consuming in the high-scale format. Identification and genotyping of highly polymorphic microsatellite loci appear as a suitable approach. The main objective {{of the present study was}} the development of a genotyping method in order to characterise clinical OsHV- 1 specimens by targeting a particular microsatellite locus located in the ORF 4 area.

40|$|French {{production}} of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas, is currently threatened by two pathogens, OsHV- 1 and V. aestuarianus. While oysters selected for their higher resistance to OsHV- 1 are now available for the industry, the impact of V. aestuarianus on such oysters is unknown, especially for triploids. In addition, experimental infection has used the virus or the bacteria alone, {{but there have been}} no investigations of dual exposure to these pathogens. This study is the first report of single or dual exposure in spat (Spat 1 and Spat 2), juvenile and adult naïve oysters. For each of the two stocks evaluated, unselected oysters and oysters selected for their higher resistance to OsHV- 1 infection were tested, as well as their triploid siblings of the selected oysters produced using cytochalasin B. We confirmed that resistance to OsHV- 1 infection and susceptibility to V. aestuarianus increased with age and size, although selected oysters were not significantly impacted by OsHV- 1 whatever their ploidy, size or age. We found different mortality patterns depending on the pathogen tested. The mortality pattern was similar for oysters exposed to OsHV- 1 or to both pathogens in the Spat 1 trial (4 months old and 1. 9 g). The mortality pattern was similar for oysters exposed to V. aestuarianus or to both pathogens in the Adult trial (25 months old and 63. 1 g). Surprisingly, mortality was much higher (ranging from 75. 9 % to 100 %), in particular for the selected oysters, for the Spat 2 (8 months old/ 3. 9 g) and Juvenile trials (16 months old/ 18. 4 g) given a dual exposure, regardless of the level of selection for OsHV- 1 and the ploidy state. Our findings highlight an important threat for oyster farmers: oysters exposed to both pathogens could experience dramatic mortality rates, even in oysters selected for their higher resistance to OsHV- 1. Finally, our study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} triploid oysters were more susceptible to experimental challenges with V. aestuarianus at the spat stage than their diploid siblings. However, the difference in mortality between the triploids and diploids remained limited and ranged from 22. 9 % to 6. 6 % for spat and adults, respectively with a relatively regularly decrease in the difference with increased age...|$|E
40|$|Recent transcriptomic {{approaches}} {{focused on}} anti-viral immunity in molluscs {{lead to the}} assumption that the innate immune system, such as apoptosis, plays a crucial role against ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV- 1), infecting <b>Pacific</b> <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas. Apoptosis constitutes a major mechanism of anti-viral response by limiting viral spread and eliminating infected cells. In this way, an OsHV- 1 challenge was performed and oysters were monitored at three times post injection to investigate viral infection and host response: 2 h (early after viral injection in the adductor muscle), 24 h (intermediate time), and 48 h (just before first oyster mortality record). Virus infection, associated with high cumulative mortality rates (74 % and 100 %), was demonstrated in haemocytes by combining several detection techniques such as real-time PCR, real-time RT PCR, immunofluorescence assay, and transmission electron microscopy examination. High viral DNA amounts ranged from 5. 46 × 104 to 3. 68 × 105 DNA copies ng- 1 of total DNA, were detected in dead oysters and an increase of viral transcripts was observed from 2, 24, and 48 hpi for the five targeted OsHV- 1 genes encoding three putative membrane proteins (ORFs 25, 41, and 72), a putative dUTPase (ORF 75), and a putative apoptosis inhibitor (ORF 87). Apoptosis was studied at molecular and cellular levels with an early marker (phosphatidyl-serine externalisation measured by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy) and a later parameter (DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL)). The down-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in the activation of the apoptotic pathway (TNF and caspase 3) and the up-regulation of genes encoding anti-apoptotic proteins (IAP- 2, and Bcl- 2) suggested an important anti-apoptosis phenomenon in haemocytes from OsHV- 1 infected oysters at 24 and 48 hpi. Additionally, more phosphatidyl-serines were externalized and more cells with DNA fragmentation were observed in haemocytes collected from artificial seawater injected oysters than in haemocytes collected from OsHV- 1 infected oysters at 24 and 48 hpi, suggesting an inhibition of the apoptotic process in presence of the virus. In conclusion, this study is the first to focus on C. gigas haemocytes, cells involved in the host immune defense, during an OsHV- 1 challenge in controlled conditions by combining various and original approaches to investigate apoptosis at molecular and cellular levels...|$|E

Culture performance of bivalves is largely dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g. temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined with climate events. Yields of <b>Pacific</b> <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas) reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27 S 43 '; 48 W 30 ') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005 / 06, 2006 / 07, 2007 / 08, 2008 / 09) in terms of oyster survival and development time during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture management and genetics were standardized significant differences verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may also result in chlorophyll {{a rise in the}} farming area. The El Nino period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture.

40|$|Significance of {{fish for}} food webs in the Wadden sea Moritz Pockberger, Florian Kellnreitner, Harald Asmus The Wadden Sea, an UNESCO world {{heritage}} site since 2009, is widely known as a nursery ground for commercially important fish of the North Sea, and also provides a habitat for small-sized fish species. Recently the fish fauna of the North Sea shows profound alterations respecting species compositon, standing stocks and migration behavior. Therefore, {{in the frame of}} long term observations of biological parameters in the Sylt-Rømø Bight (=SRB), a fish survey was conducted since 2007, to document possible changes of species composition and stock size, considering the rise of temperature on a local scale. Sampling takes place monthly on seven locations inside SRB using a bottom trawl, which is designed to be deployed also as flyde trawl for pelagic fishing. On every location a benthic and on deeper sites additionally a pelagic haul is performed. To achieve a clear picture of trophic positions and interactions between fish species inside the SRB gut content analysis and feeding experiments are carried out. Most of the long term data will be used to portray a food web for the total SRB {{as well as for the}} particular habitats of this area. This food web will reflect certain scenarios of environmental conditions and biological status to give a holistic view of the current as well as the expected changes. Until now, fish species are underrepresented in this food web and due to the lack of basic data only eight fish species could be included. Increasing temperatures in summer may lead to immigration of lusitanian species, such as the sand smelt (Atherina presbyter), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) into the Wadden Sea. Additionally a higher proportion of thermophile species is expected to visit the Wadden Sea, whereas boreal species may move to more northern regions. During a warm summer period in 2003 a high immigration of small thermophile fish, such as sand smelt and anchovy and emigration of indigenous fish was observed in the SRB. Considering the above described changes and varying residence times during seasons, shifts in the food web can be expected. In winter, higher temperatures may delay the migration of fish species into depths that have more stable environmental conditions. Several findings indicate ongoing changes in the SRB, e. g. sand smelt was found rarely, but is now found regularly in summer during sampling and it is assumed that reproduction takes place inside the SRB. In autumn, hatchlings of grey mullets (Chelon labrosus) were caught both in beach seine and bottom trawl. This species was only recorded as a summer guest before. Furthermore, catches of black goby (Gobius niger), may be an example for ongoing faunal changes occurring in the area. To identify potential seasonal differences in species abundance and the role of southern species in the Wadden sea food web, an analysis of guild structures was conducted. Another subject of investigation will be the impact of new established habitats, like reefs of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas) and Japanese Sargasso weed (Sargassum muticum) on fishes. These two species occur densely in high numbers and are able to change abiotic factors. Identification of feeding relationships and of key prey species provide important information for coastal area management and may help to explain structural variations of fish community in an area that is subject to constant change. ...|$|E
