25|$|Stimuli {{that are}} {{directly}} attended to are projected onto the fovea, the central {{point of the}} retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to binocular vision. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of {{the left and right}} eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an innate capacity that enables us to be aware of a considerable <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> immediate environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful perceptual information. In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that makes our perceptual experiences meaningful.|$|E

The members of the Order initially used St Paul's Cathedral as their meeting place, standing near the [...] "parvis" [...] where they would give counsel to those who sought advice.

[...] "The existing public schools, he said, were dilapidated and the teachers untrained.

2500|$|Camp Nelson {{may have}} been the best choice for a central Kentucky depot, but it was inadequate. [...] When Union Major General Ambrose Burnside {{attacked}} the Cumberland Gap and Knoxville, Tennessee, Camp Nelson's distance from the Gap and Knoxville, combined with lack of railroads and the weather, hampered the Union advance. [...] When overall Union commander Ulysses S. Grant visited Camp Nelson in January 1864, he was displeased, observing that [...] "no <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> supplies can be hauled by teams from Camp Nelson". [...] The situation of the camp had not improved by spring of 1864, and Grant leaned toward abandoning it entirely. [...] William Tecumseh Sherman advocated that its role be diminished instead, which saved Camp Nelson. It took on the role of training black soldiers, who volunteered for the US Colored Troops.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{continued}} the advocacy {{of several other}} Governors on behalf of improved public education. As told by Carol Hoffecker in Democracy in Delaware, [...] "'In these portentous times,' remarked Governor Thomas in 1824, 'it seems rather a hazardous experiment to permit one generation to sleep in ignorance.' He advocated a special school tax, which he promised 'would be a blessing to the people...for it would...relieve them of the most intolerable of all burdens, the burdens of immorality and ignorance. 'In vain,' he said, 'do we boast of our elective franchise, and our civil rights, if a large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> citizens are unable to read the tickets which they annually present at the polls. Such men may think themselves free, but in fact they are slaves.... If education is confined to the rich,' he warned, 'the few will govern.'"

2500|$|The {{convention}} {{began on}} October 10 with a talk by [...] "Sharp Knife", the nickname of Jackson, {{to more than}} 500 Choctaws. Pushmataha accused Jackson of deceiving them {{about the quality of}} land west of the Mississippi. Pushmataha responded to Jackson's retort with [...] "I know the country well ... The grass is everywhere very short ... There are but few beavers, and the honey and fruit are rare things." [...] Jackson resorted to threats, which pressured the Choctaws to sign the Doak's Stand treaty. Pushmataha would continue to argue with Jackson about the conditions of the treaty. Pushmataha assertively stated [...] "that no alteration shall be made in the boundaries of the <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> territory that will remain, until the Choctaw people are sufficiently progressed in the arts of civilization to become citizens of the States, owning land and homes of their own, on an equal footing with the white people." [...] Jackson responded with [...] "That ... is a magnificent rangement and we consent to it, , readily." [...] Historian Anna Lewis stated that Apuckshunubbee, a Choctaw district chief, was blackmailed by Jackson to sign the treaty. On October 18, the Treaty of Doak's Stand was signed.|$|E
2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we want everyone to recognize themselves in every <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> universe. [...] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want {{to do it in a}} way that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is [...] "to have fun with [...] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic." ...|$|E
