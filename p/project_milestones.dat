5|$|The troubled {{development}} of Final Fantasy XIII {{that had been}} caused by the simultaneous creation of the company-wide engine Crystal Tools gave reason to rethink the production process for high-budget games at Square Enix. For Final Fantasy XIII-2, the team consulted the European subsidiary Eidos to more closely adapt a Western approach to game development. As a consequence, monthly schedules and <b>project</b> <b>milestones</b> were introduced to better monitor the staff members' progress. Furthermore, unlike its predecessor, Final Fantasy XIII-2 was not entirely developed in-house; Japanese studio tri-Ace was contracted to help out with aspects of the game design, art and programming. This was done to keep the number of internal staff members on the game lower. The contributions of external developers were planned and clearly divided beforehand to achieve a more structured team organization. Concept videos and frequent test playing during production helped constantly engage the staff and keep to the original vision of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Vortex vice {{president}} Rick Giolito {{noted that there}} was [...] "pressure" [...] by their clients [...] "to incorporate Hollywood-type production, techniques, and corporate structure." [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook agreed that Creative Wonders had streamlined its production process and produced partnerships and alliances between previously unrelated companies {{in a similar fashion}} to the [...] "'best practices' of Hollywood". Giolito asserted that publishers forced the company to create prototypes for pre-testing by focus groups before products would receive complete funding, investment, or a purchase commitment, which lead to shoe-horned Madeline prototypes that were made on a bootstrap budget. [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook wrote that the developer was required to have a [...] "lean production" [...] in order to ensure success of the multi-company entity. EA required the developer to create technical design documents which would state the <b>project</b> <b>milestones</b> based on required technical aspects like game engines that need proof of concept, how long each element would take, the amount of human resources invested which then determined the shipping date; according to executive producer Michael Pole this was a favourable alternative to choosing a release date then working backwards and it helped developers stick to a timeline and understand which assets they were able to deliver. The publisher wanted the prototype stage to be preliminary deadline, with a trivial monitary investment that would identify any [...] "technical hurdles" [...] early on; this was followed by [...] "delivery of levels and game tuning" [...] by the developer. They would only back a project once [...] "one room of an environment that includes art and animation up and running, some collision detection and some gameplay" [...] was created, thereby demonstrating a viable investment; the preliminary artwork and prototype had to be completed within four months. The outsourcing of development to Vortex was a cost-cutting measure, as [...] "software publishers ha found that they mae more money distributing and selling software than developing it"; this led to a [...] "garage developer phenomenon" [...] where companies like Vortex made games like Madeline out of houses and basements. Madeline game artists worked double shifts, and shared computers, desks, and phone lines. In terms of marketing, EA would start devising strategy early on by discussing the chosen genre, and making sure the content and design fit the genre and were [...] "demographically correct"; for instance Pole asserted that [...] "Madeline doesn't belong on the Sony Playstation". In addition to Madaline already being a recognisable brand through its 60-year history, many national sales representatives in the interactive software industry had previously worked in the book and toy space, which meant that they were especially familiar with elements of the Madeline franchise. Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, Madeline Thinking Games, and Madeline European Adventures were published by Creative Wonders in 1995â€“6, and Madeline would become Creative Wonders' [...] "flagship product". Interactive Publisher's Handbook believes that the marketing of the games would have been in vain if the games didn't live up to the expectations of Madeline branded content, and noted that its financial success paid off for DIC's original gamble, and that the critical praise of the premiere title coupled with ABC's desire to run children's programming led to the network picking up the second season of DIC's animated version of Madeline and airing it under the title The New Adventures of Madeline (the previous season and specials had aired on the Family Channel).|$|E
