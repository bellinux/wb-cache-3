50|$|Aspartate and {{glutamate}} are excitatory neurotransmitters. At {{high doses}} (consumed either independently or {{in excess of}} other protein-containing foods), can potentially stimulate neurons {{to the point of}} injury or death. The most compelling evidence that glutamate and aspartate function as neurotransmitters came from the observation that at low concentrations they excite virtually every neuron in the central nervous system. Excitotoxicity has been identified in animal studies and found that aspartic acid loads on the same brain receptors as glutamic acid, causing brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders, and to act in an additive fashion with glutamic acid.When considering aspartate sources individually, the levels of exposure estimated in this opinion amount up to 6 g/day for calcium aspartate (equivalent to 100 mg/kg bw/day for a 60 kg individual), 5.8 g/day for magnesium aspartate (equivalent to 97 mg/kg bw/day), 4 g/day for <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate</b> (equivalent to 67 mg/kg bw/day), 0.05 g/day for zinc aspartate (0.8 mg/kg bw/day) and 0.008 g/day for copper aspartate (0.1 mg/kg bw/day). These values are all below those reported to induce amino acid imbalance in intervention trials (6.3 g aspartate/day) and they are, respectively, 7, 7.2, 10.5, 875 and 7000 times lower than the NOAEL for aspartate identified from a 90-day rat study. Based on these margins of safety, the Panel concludes that the use of zinc and copper aspartate, as sources of zinc and copper at the proposed use levels, are not of safety concern but that the use of calcium, magnesium and <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate</b> could be of safety concern because the margins of safety are considered too low. The Panel notes that if all sources would be used simultaneously, combined exposure will be 16 g/day (equivalent to 267 mg/kg bw/day), which is above the reported amounts inducing amino acid imbalance in intervention trials (6.3 g/day). Furthermore, this value is only 3 times lower than the NOAEL from the rat study and due to the low margin of safety the Panel considers this of safety concern. The Panel estimates that the exposure to aspartate from these food supplements should be added to the aspartate exposure arising from the diet.Based on US data, estimates of the mean exposure to aspartic acid arising from the diet are 4.1 g/day (children 1-3 year old) to 9.3 g/day (males 19-30 year old) and at the 95th percentile 6.6 g/day (children 4-8 year old) to 12.9 g/day (males 19-50 year old). Under these conditions, estimates of maximum daily exposure to aspartate ions from the diet (13 g/day) and from calcium or magnesium aspartate supplements would be approximately 19 g/day6, and from <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate</b> would be 17 g/day. Aspartate exposure estimates from zinc or copper supplementation would not significantly change aspartate exposure from the diet. Taken individually these levels of exposure are lower than those reported to induce amino acid imbalance in intervention trials, when aspartate exposure from the diet is also taken into consideration (19.3 g/day). However, when considering the potential total intake of aspartic ions arising from the diet and from a potential multi-mineral combination of all food supplements the exposure could add up to 29 g/day. In line with the SCF concerns, the Panel considers that the use of L-amino acids in food supplements should not give rise to a nutritional imbalance of the amino acids. Thus the Panel concludes that under these conditions aspartate ion exposure from a multi-mineral combination of this type could be of safety concern.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The ideal ratio between liver graft {{mass and}} {{recipient}} body weight for liver transplantation in small infants is unknown; however, if this ratio is over 4 %, a condition called large-for-size may occur. Experimental models of large-for-size liver transplants {{have not been}} described in the literature. In addition, orthotopic liver transplantation is marked by high morbidity and mortality rates in animals due to the clamping of the venous splanchnic system. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to create a porcine model of large-for-size liver transplantation with clamping of the supraceliac aorta during the anhepatic phase as an alternative to venovenous bypass. METHOD: Fourteen pigs underwent liver transplantation with whole-liver grafts without venovenous bypass and were divided into two experimental groups: the control group, in which the weights of the donors were similar to the weights of the recipients; and the large-for-size group, in which the weights of the donors were nearly 2 times the weights of the recipients. Hemodynamic data, the results of serum biochemical analyses and histological examination of the transplanted livers were collected. RESULTS: The mortality rate in both groups was 16. 5 % (1 / 7). The animals in the large-for-size group had increased serum levels of <b>potassium,</b> sodium, <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase after graft reperfusion. The histological analyses revealed that there were no significant differences between the groups.

40|$|Background: In recent years, a rapid-clotting serum tube, BD Vacutainer Rapid Serum Tube (RSTTM), was {{introduced}} to improve turn-around times for serum samples. Previous studies reported reduced concentrations of some markers of haemolysis in RST specimens compared to other serum or plasma samples. We aimed to compare RST to plasma tubes for haemolysis markers in an emergency department (ED) setting, where increased rates of haemolysis are commonly seen. Methods: Patients presenting to ED over an eight-day period had an RST, BD Vacutainer PSTTM II (plasma) Tube and BD Vacutainer Heparin (non-gel, plasma) Tube collected. Blood was drawn from an intravenous cannula, and samples were promptly analysed for haemolysis index, <b>potassium,</b> phosphate, <b>aspartate</b> aminotrasferase (AST), magnesium and lactate dehydrogenase (LD). Results: A total of 347 patient samples were included, and 9. 2 % of the PST samples were haemolysed. The RST tubes had small increases {{in all of the}} haemolysis markers compared to both plasma tubes (P 4 0. 005), except LD which was lower in the RST group. There {{were no significant differences in}} the proportion of results above the upper reference limit between the tubes, except for LD which had a lower proportion in RST samples (P 4 0. 002). Conclusion: Compared to plasma, RST specimens show small increases in several haemolysis markers, consistent with known differences between serum and plasma, but the proportion of elevated haemolysis markers is similar to plasma.

The aim {{of this study was to}} report the results of the investigation, as well as the intervention strategies that resulted in successful control of the outbreak. MethodsAn infection control team was set up consisting of infectious disease specialists, microbiologists, infection control practitioners, and head nurses. The microbiology and medical records of case-patients with P. fulva or P. putida bloodstream infections were reviewed. Environmental samples and intravenous (IV) solutions from the wards and the pharmacy center were collected for culturing. The molecular characteristics of the bacterial isolates were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Strict infection control strategies were implemented. ResultsA total of 20 case-patients from five inpatient wards were identified during three summer seasons from 2010 to 2012. Nineteen of them recovered with proper antibiotics. Unfortunately one died from complications of heart failure. A total of 19 isolates of P. fulva and four of P. putida were identified, of which 20 were from blood, two from environmental surface samples from the hospital pharmacy, and one from an in-use compounded solution from a case-patient in the cardiology ward.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate {{the effect of a}} lower dose of <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate</b> salt on BP in individuals with essential arterial hypertension. METHODS: One hundred and four patients (65 males, age 53 +/- 12 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension (systolic/diastolic BP 154. 2 / 96. 2 +/- 10. 8 / 5. 4 mmHg) were allocated in two comparable groups of 52 to receive or not 30 mmol/day per os of <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate</b> supplementation for four weeks. Office and 24 -h BP, as well as serum and urinary electrolytes, were measured at baseline and at the follow-up visit after four weeks. RESULTS: Office and 24 -h BP did not change in the control group, while these values were significantly reduced in the potassium supplementation group. Changes in office (systolic BP: 154. 4 +/- 8. 2 vs. 142. 2 +/- 7. 6 mmHg; diastolic BP: 95. 0 +/- 5. 6 vs. 87. 2 +/- 4. 3 mmHg, P < 0. 001 for both) and 24 -h BP (systolic BP: 142. 7 +/- 8. 2 vs. 134. 8 +/- 6. 3 mmHg; diastolic BP: 90. 8 +/- 4. 4 vs. 84. 6 +/- 3. 8 mmHg, P < 0. 001 for both) following potassium supplementation were highly significant. The changes in day time and night time BP were similar. The treated group showed significantly increased potassium serum level and 24 -h urinary excretion of potassium (P < 0. 01 in both cases) after four weeks, while the untreated group showed no significant changes of the same parameters. Urinary Na/K ratio decreased significantly with potassium supplementation (P < 0. 001). In the treated group changes in office (r = 0. 58, P < 0. 001) and 24 -h SBP (r = 0. 51, P < 0. 001), but not in DBP (r = 0. 29 and r = 0. 25, n. s.), correlated positively with the urinary Na/K ratio at baseline.

Adverse reactions were also recorded. ResultsThere were no differences in gender, age, disease duration, symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings between the two groups (P> 0. 05). After an 8 -week treatment, improvements in jaundice, weakness, poor appetite, abdominal distention, and skin itching were significantly better in the treatment group than in the control group (P< 0. 05). In the treatment group, 43 patients had a significant response to the treatment, seven patients had a response, and four patients had no response, with 21, 12, and 20 patients in the control group, respectively. The total effective rate was 92. 6 % in the treatment group and 62. 3 % in the control group, which was a significant difference (P< 0. 05). The levels of TBil, DBil, TBA, ALP, ALT, AST, and γ-GT in both groups were significantly lower after treatment, and were significantly different between the two groups (P< 0. 05). A few patients in the treatment group had mild adverse effects such as increased bowel movement frequency and mild stomachache. No other adverse reactions were observed in either group.

40|$|Objective Dietary {{restriction}} {{or reduced}} food intake was supported {{to protect against}} renal and hepatic ischemic injury. In this vein, short fasting was recently shown to protect in situ rat liver against ischemia-reperfusion. Here, perfused ex vivo instead of in situ livers were exposed to ischemia-reperfusion to study the impact of disconnecting liver from extrahepatic supply in energetic substrates on the protection given by short-term fasting. Methods Perfused ex vivo livers using short (18  h) fasted compared with fed rats were submitted to ischemia-reperfusion and studied for release of cytolysis markers in the perfusate. Energetic stores are differently available in time and cell energetic charges (ratio of adenosine triphosphate plus half of the adenosine diphosphate concentrations to the sum of adenosine triphosphate + adenosine diphosphate + adenosine monophosphate concentrations), adenosine phosphates, and glycogen, which were further measured at different time points in livers. Results Short fasting versus feeding failed to protect perfused ex vivo rat livers against ischemia/reperfusion, increasing the release of cytolysis markers (<b>potassium,</b> cytochrome c, <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase) in the perfusate during reoxygenation phase. Toxicity of short fasting versus feeding was associated with lower glycogen and energetic charges in livers and lower lactate levels in the perfusate. Conclusion High energetic charge, intracellular content in glycogen, and glycolytic activity may protect liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury. This work does not question how much the protective role previously demonstrated in the literature for dietary restriction and short fasting. In fact, it suggests that exceeding the energy charge threshold value of 0. 3 might trigger {{the effectiveness of this}} protective role. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated species-specific stress responses in sharks. To assess the biochemical effects of net capture and restraint, nineteen serum constituents were measured in three species of sharks: bonnethead, Sphyrna tiburo (Linnaeus, 1758), n = 36; blacktip, Carcharhinus limbatus (Muller and Henle, 1841), n = 33; and bull, C. leucas (Muller and Henle, 1841), n = 27. Sharks were captured in gill nets placed at various locations along the southwest coast of Florida between April and July, 1994. Stress level of each animal was judged in five categories using an index of behavioral response to capture and restraint devised for use in tag-recapture studies. These categories ranged from level I 2 ̆ 2 minimal stress response 2 ̆ 2 to level 5 2 ̆ 2 moribund or dead 2 ̆ 2. The serum constituents assayed included: glucose, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, chloride, potassium, inorganic phosphorus, total and ionized calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate, lactate dehydrogenase; aspartate aminotransferase, triglycerides, cholesterol, and total iron. Hematocrit was also measured for each sample. There were significant intraspecific differences in several serum constituent values for all three species. With increased stress, S. tiburo had increased potassium, inorganic phosphorus, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase and lactate and decreased glucose levels (P 3 ̆c 0. 05 ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis). C. limbatus had increased uric acid, potassium, lactate, total and ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), while C. leucas had increased <b>potassium,</b> inorganic phosphorus, <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase, lactate and decreased glucose levels (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The wide variation observed in serum constituent values among species when compared with intraspecific differences in lifestyle, behavior, general morphology and environmental requirements may help explain differences in species-specific mortality rates previously documented...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} the contribution of blood cells subtypes on hemolysis. Methods: Separated blood cell subtype suspensions prepared with blood from 10 volunteers were serially diluted to obtain different concentrations of cell suspensions. The cells were fully lysed and cell hemolysates were added (1 : 20) to aliquots of serum pool. Thus, seven serum pools with different concentrations of interferent were obtained for each blood cell subtype. Biochemical parameters and serum indices were measured by an autoanalyzer. As cell lysis markers, free hemoglobin was measured by spectrophotometry while myeloperoxidase and b-thromboglobulin were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The percent changes in analyte levels of the serum pools were evaulated by Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and compared with clinical thresholds defined for each test. Results: The clinical thresholds were exceeded in lactate dehydrogenase, <b>potassium,</b> <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase, creatine kinase, magnesium, total protein, total cholesterol, inorganic phosphate, glucose for red blood cells (RBC); lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, inorganic phosphate and glucose for platelets (PLT).

In all the experiments the tissues were incubated in ASP buffer (<b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate)</b> during three hours, and then one hour with plasmid DNA (pCambia 3201, containing gus and bar genes) at room temperature. The electroporation was performed at a capacitance of 900 &# 956;F. The effect of the parameters evaluated {{was determined by the}} transient expression of the gus gene.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of lignocaine to monoethylglycinexylidide {{has been}} found useful {{as an indicator of}} hepatic function in association with liver transplantation. It has been postulated that this might be due to the common effect of hypoxic damage on liver function and lignocaine metabolism. The aim of this work was to establish whether hepatic lignocaine elimination was impaired by hypoxia and whether lignocaine extraction ratio and clearance {{could be used as a}}n indicator of hepatic function. This was studied using the isolated pig liver perfused via the hepatic artery and portal vein. To establish whether the pig liver could be used as a possible human model for this investigation and whether lignocaine had any detrimental effects on liver function and blood flow in vivo, hepatic lignocaine elimination and the effects of lignocaine administration on hepatic function and blood flow were studied in the anaesthetized pig, surgically prepared to allow sampling across the liver and direct hepatic blood flow measurement. Hepatic lignocaine elimination was then studied in the isolated perfused liver to determine whether this was similar to that found in vivo. The definitive studies required preliminary investigations not available from the literature to determine the feasibility of comparing in vivo and ex vivo hepatic function using the same liver. In addition, by studying the decay of lignocaine after bolus dose administration the necessary pharmacokinetic parameters to achieve similar constant hepatic affluent lignocaine concentrations in vivo and in the isolated preparation could be determined. The preliminary investigations showed that a sequential experiment using the same liver to compare in vivo and ex vivo function was inappropriate as the energy state of isolated perfused livers previously studied in vivo was significantly different from that in livers perfused immediately. The decay of lignocaine after a bolus dose in vivo and ex vivo could be described by a two-compartment open model and in both preparations the derived pharmacokinetic parameters from this analysis were used to achieve similar constant hepatic affluent concentrations over the study period used to determine hepatic lignocaine elimination. Lignocaine extraction ratio by the in situ pig liver was similar to that reported in man and together with hepatic clearance and intrinsic clearance was similar to that determined in the isolated state when different livers were used for this comparison. There was no detrimental effect of lignocaine administration on hepatic function and blood flow In vivo. Lignocaine extraction ratio and clearance and monoethylglycinexylidide formation were significantly impaired in livers subjected to hypoxia. Lignocaine elimination correlated strongly with hepatic cellular ATP, energy charge and ATP/ ADP ratio as well as with hepatic potassium release but less strongly with aspartate aminotransferase release when this relationship was tested using the combined data from hypoxic and normoxic livers ex vivo. These correlations were positive for hepatic adenine nucleotide status and negative for hepatic <b>potassium</b> and <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase release. Neither hepatic alanine aminotransferase release nor lactate utilization were significantly affected by hypoxia. Lignocaine extraction ratio, hepatic oxygen consumption, ATP content, bile flow and potassium release were shown to be equivalent, more highly sensitive, and earlier indicators of hypoxic hepatic injury than hepatic aspartate aminotransferase release in the isolated perfused pig liver...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} for poor short-term {{prognosis of patients with}} hepatic encephalopathy (HE). MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 316 patients with HE who were hospitalized and treated in The First Hospital of Jilin University from January 2013 to December 2015, and according to their prognosis, they were divided into survival group (229 patients) and death group (87 patients). The univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for their general data and biochemical parameters to screen out the risk factors for poor prognosis of HE. The t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of continuous data between groups, and the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for the variables with statistical significance identified in the univariate analysis. ResultsAll the patients were followed up for 30 days, and 87 patients died, resulting in a mortality rate of 27. 5 %. The male/female ratio was 1. 72 ∶ 1, and 269 patients (85. 13 %) were aged ≥ 45 years. The univariate analysis showed that there were {{significant differences between the two}} groups in age, a combination of primary liver cancer, HE stage, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hemoglobin, platelet count, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, prothrombin time activity (PTA), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum sodium, serum <b>potassium,</b> alanine aminotransferase, <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, albumin, indirect bilirubin, total bilirubin (TBil), and prealbumin (all P＜ 0. 05).

Sunulan araştırmada akut ishalli {{neonatal}} buzağılarda intravenöz izotonik sodyum bikarbonat uygulamasının venöz asit-baz durumu ve renal fonksiyon üzerine zamana bağlı etkileri araştırıldı. Materyali; yaşları 1 - 30 gün arasında değişen, farklı ırk ve cinsiyette, akut ishal şikayeti ile kliniğe başvuran ve primer basit metabolik asidoz tanısı alan 10 neonatal buzağı oluşturdu. Çalışmada etiyolojik tanı dikkate alınmamıştır. Çalışma kapsamında, tedavi öncesi (0. saat) ve hesap edilen total bikarbonat ihtiyacı izotonik solüsyon tarzında intravenöz yolla buzağılara verildikten sonra, tedavi sonrası; 15. dakika, 30. dakika, 1. saat, 2. saat, 3. saat, 4. saat, 6. saat, 12. saat ve 24. saatte kan örnekleri toplandı. Venöz kan örneklerinde; pH, parsiyel karbondioksit basıncı, total karbondioksit konsantrasyonu, baz durumu, bikarbonat, klor, sodyum, potasyum, kalsiyum ve laktat düzeyleri ve serum örneklerinde; üre, kreatinin, alanin amino transferaz, aspartat amino transferaz, gamma-glutamil transferaz, laktat dehidrogenaz, kreatin kinaz, total protein, albumin ve glukoz konsantrasyonları ölçüldü. Tam kan örneklerinde ise lökosit, eritrosit, lenfosit, granulosit, hemoglobin, hemotokrit ve trombosit sayımı yapıldı. Çalışma sonuçları, ishalli buzağılarda, farklı ölçüm zamanları arasında gerçekleştirilen grup içi değerlendirmede; pH, bikarbonat, baz durumu, parsiyel karbondioksit basıncı, total karbondioksit konsantrasyonu, potasyum ve aspartat amino transferaz kan düzeylerinde istatistiki açıdan önemli derecede bir farkın olduğunu ortaya koydu. Alanin amino transferaz, gamma-glutamil transferaz, laktat dehidrogenaz, glukoz, laktat, total protein, albumin, kreatin kinaz, lökosit, eritrosit, trombosit, lenfosit, granulosit, hemoglobin ve hemotokrit kan konsantrasyonları açısından istatistiki bir fark tespit edilmedi. Üre ve kreatinin serum konsantrasyonlarında ise ölçüm zamanlarına göre gerçekleştirilen grup içi istatistiki değerlendirmede önem arz eden bir fark belirlenmemesine rağmen, tedavi sonrası dönemde numerik bir azalma belirlenmiştir. Her iki parametre için 0. ile 24. saat ölçüm değerleri karşılaştırıldığında p< 0. 05 düzeyinde önemli bir fark tespit edildi. Elde edilen veriler, neonatal buzağılarda akut ishale bağlı gelişen primer basit metabolik asidozunintravenöz izotonik sodyum bikarbonat uygulaması ile başarılı bir şekilde tedavi edilebileceğini ortaya koydu. Sonuçlara göre, neonatal buzağı ishallerinde tedavi protokolünün belirlenmesi ve prognozun tayininde, metabolik asidozun yanı sıra renal fonksiyondaki bozulmanın da göz önünde bulundurulması gerektiği değerlendirildi.

This study investigates time-dependent {{effects of}} intravenousadministration of isotonic sodium bicarbonate on venous acid-base status and renal function in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea. The material consists of 10 neonatal calves (1 - 30 days old) with different races and genders which were accepted {{to the clinic}} with complaints of acute diarrhea and then diagnosed with simple primary metabolic acidosis. The etiologic diagnosis was not taken into consideration in this study. Following the intravenous administration of calculatedtotal sodium bicarbonate on the calves {{in the form of}} isotonic solution blood samples were collected pre- treatment (0 hour) and post-treatment: 15 min, 30 min, 1 hrs, 2 hrs, 3 hrs, 4 hrs, 6 hrs, 12 hrs and 24 hrs later. Venous blood samples were analyzed to measure pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure, total carbon dioxide concentration, basicity, bicarbonate, chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium, and lactate levels. Serum samples were analyzed to measure urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, total protein, albumin, and glucose concentrations. And finally, full blood samples were analyzed to count leukocytes, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet. Based on the intra-group assessments at different measurement times, the study results revealed a statistically significant difference in pH, bicarbonate, basicity, partial carbon dioxide pressure, total carbon dioxide concentration, <b>potassium</b> and <b>aspartate</b> amino transferase blood levels of the calves with diarrhea. No statistical difference was found in alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, lactate, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, granulocytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit blood concentrations. A numerical decrease was determined in the post-treatment period despite the absence of a significant difference in serum concentrations of urea and creatinine as shown by the intra-group statistical assessments conducted in line with measurement times. A significant difference of p < 0. 05 was noticed when 0 and 24 hour measurement values were compared for both parameters. The obtained data revealed that primary simple metabolic acidosis occurring in calves in relation to acute diarrhea can be treated successfully with the administration of intravenous isotonic sodium bicarbonate. According to the results, renal function deterioration should be considered along with the metabolic acidosis during the determination of treatment protocol and prognosis. The submitted study emphasizes the importance of hours 12 and 24 post-treatment for blood acid-basis status and renal function, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{thermodynamic}} activation {{parameters of}} cold-adapted proteins from Archaea are described {{for the first}} time for the irreversible protein unfolding and ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of elongation factor 2 (EF- 2) from the psychrotolerant Methanococcoides burtonii and the thermophilic Methanosarcina thermophila. Thermolability of Methanococcoides burtonii EF- 2 was demonstrated by a low activation free-energy of unfolding as a result of low activation-enthalpy. Although structural data for EF- 2 are presently limited to protein homology modeling, the observed thermodynamic properties are consistent with a low number of noncovalent bonds or an altered solvent interaction, causing a loss of entropy during the unfolding process. A physiological concentration of <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate</b> or potassium glutamate was shown to stabilize both proteins against irreversible denaturation by strengthening noncovalent interactions, as indicated by increased activation enthalpies. The transition state of GTPase activity for Methanococcoides burtonii EF- 2 was characterized by a lower activation enthalpy than for Methanosarcina thermophila EF- 2. The relative entropy changes could be explained by differential displacement of water molecules during catalysis, resulting in similar activation free energies for both proteins. The presence of solutes was shown to facilitate the breaking of enthalpy-driven interactions and structuring of more water molecules during the reaction. By studying the thermodynamic activation parameters of both GTPase activity and unfolding and examining the effects of intracellular solutes and partner proteins (ribosomes), we were able to identify enthalpic and entropic properties that have evolved in the archaeal EF- 2 proteins to enable Methanococcoides burtonii and Methanosarcina thermophila to adapt to their respective thermal environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{predominant}} type {{of liver}} alteration in asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic chronic male alcoholics (N = 169) {{admitted to a}} psychiatric hospital for detoxification was classified by two independent methods: liver palpation and multiple quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), the latter applied to two parameters reported by the patient (duration of alcoholism and daily amount ingested) and to the data obtained from eight biochemical blood determinations (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glycemia, <b>potassium,</b> <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase, albumin, globulin, and sodium). All 11 soft and sensitive, and 13 firm and sensitive livers formed fully concordant groups as determined by QDA. Among the 22 soft and not sensitive livers, 95 % were concordant by QDA grouping. Concordance rates were low (55 %) in the 73 firm and not sensitive livers, and intermediate (76 %) in the 50 not palpable livers. Prediction of the liver palpation characteristics by QDA was 95 % correct for the firm and not sensitive livers and moderate for the other groups. On a preliminary basis, the variables considered to be most informative by QDA were the two anamnestic data and bilirubin levels, followed by alkaline phosphatase, glycemia and potassium, and then by aspartate aminotransferase and albumin. We conclude that, when biopsies would be too costly or potentially injurious to the patients to varying extents, clinical data could be considered valid to guide patient care, {{at least in the}} three groups (soft, not sensitive; soft, sensitive; firm, sensitive livers) in which the two noninvasive procedures were highly concordant in the present study...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{most cases}} of {{pediatric}} liver transplantation, the clinical scenario of large-for-size transplants {{can lead to}} hepatic dysfunction and a decreased blood supply to the liver graft. The objective of the present experimental investigation was to evaluate the effects of ischemic preconditioning on this clinical entity. METHODS: Eighteen pigs were divided into three groups and underwent liver transplantation: a control group, in which the weights of the donors {{were similar to those}} of the recipients, a large-for-size group, and a large-for-size + ischemic preconditioning group. Blood samples were collected from the recipients to evaluate the pH and the sodium, <b>potassium,</b> <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. In addition, hepatic tissue was sampled from the recipients for histological evaluation, immunohistochemical analyses to detect hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation and molecular analyses to evaluate the gene expression of Bax (pro-apoptotic), Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic), c-Fos and c-Jun (immediate-early genes), ischemia-reperfusion-related inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1, TNF-alpha and IL- 6, which is also a stimulator of hepatocyte regeneration), intracellular adhesion molecule, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (a mediator of the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning) and TGF-beta (a pro-fibrogenic cytokine). RESULTS: All animals developed acidosis. At 1 hour and 3 hours after reperfusion, the animals in the large-for-size and large-for-size + ischemic preconditioning groups had decreased serum levels of Na and increased serum levels of K and aspartate aminotransferase compared with the control group. The molecular analysis revealed higher expression of the Bax, TNF-alpha, I-CAM and TGF-beta genes in the large-for-size group compared with the control and large-for-size + ischemic preconditioning groups. Ischemic preconditioning was responsible for an increase in c-Fos, IL- 1, IL- 6 and e-NOS gene expression. CONCLUSION: Ischemia-reperfusion injury in this model of large-for-size liver transplantation could be partially attenuated by ischemic preconditioning...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inflammatory and {{nutritional}} biomarkers {{have an important}} bearing on outcomes of acute exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (AECOPD), but the temporal profile of these compounds during an acute episode is unclear. Patients and Methods: Plasma leptin, prealbumin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were estimated at baseline and before hospital discharge in patients with AECOPD. Results: A total of 82 patients were evaluated (66 males; mean (standard deviation) age, 61. 6 (10. 1) years. Of these, 74 subjects (90. 2 %) were current or former smokers, with median (range) pack-years of 15 (0 – 96), duration of COPD of 8 years (range, 2 – 25 years) and duration of current symptoms being 5 days (range, 1 – 30 days). Majority (41. 5 %) had type I (severe) exacerbation. During the current episode, 46 patients (58. 9 %) required mechanical ventilation for a median of 6 days (range, 1 – 34). The median duration of hospital stay was 13 days, (range, 1 – 110). At discharge, significant reduction was observed in dyspnea, total leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), partial pressure of carbon dioxide, hemoglobin, urea, creatinine, <b>potassium,</b> <b>aspartate</b> transferase, and TNF-α levels compared to baseline, whereas arterial pH, PO 2, serum albumin, prealbumin, and leptin significantly improved. No difference was seen in leptin, prealbumin, and TNF-α between patients with mild/moderate and severe exacerbation, or between patients who required or did not require mechanical ventilation. Change in leptin correlated with body mass index and change in ESR; no associations were observed between leptin, prealbumin, and TNF-α with other clinico-laboratory variables. Conclusion: Plasma levels of novel inflammatory {{and nutritional}} biomarkers, i. e., leptin, TNF-α, and prealbumin are altered in AECOPD episodes and lag behind other parameters during recovery. These biomarkers are not reliable predictors of clinical outcomes in these patients...|$|E
40|$|A clone {{of human}} HeLa cells stably {{transfected}} with mouse connexin 40 DNA {{was used to}} examine gap junctions. Two separate cells were brought into physical contact with each other ("induced cell pair") to allow insertion of gap junction channels and, hence, formation of a gap junction. The intercellular current flow was measured with a dual voltage-clamp method. This approach enabled us to study the electrical properties of gap junction channels (cell pairs with a single channel) and gap junctions (cell pairs with many channels). We found that single channels exhibited multiple conductances, a main state (gamma j(main state)), several substates (gamma j(substates)), a residual state (gamma j (residual state)), and a closed state (gamma j(closed state)). The gamma j(main state) was 198 pS, and gamma j(residual state) was 36 pS (temperature, 36 - 37 degrees C; pipette solution, <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate).</b> Both properties were insensitive to transjunctional voltage, Vj. The transitions between the closed state and an open state (i. e., residual state, substate, or main state) were slow (15 - 45 ms); those between the residual state and a substate or the main state were fast (1 - 2 ms). Under steady-state conditions, the open channel probability, Po, decreased in a sigmoidal manner from 1 to 0 (Boltzmann fit: Vj,o = - 44 mV; z = 6). The temperature coefficient, Q 10, for gamma j(main state) and gamma j(residual state) was 1. 2 and 1. 3, respectively (p < 0. 001; range 15 - 40 degrees C). This difference suggests interactions between ions and channel structure in case of gamma j(residual state). In cell pairs with many channels, the gap junction conductance at steady state, gj, exhibited a bell-shaped dependency from Vj (Boltzmann fit, negative Vj, Vj,o = - 45 mV, gj(min) = 0. 24; positive Vj, Vj,o = 49 mV, gj(min) = 0. 26; z = 6). We conclude that each channel is controlled by two types of gates, a fast one responsible for Vj gating and involving transitions between open states (i. e., residual state, substates, main state), and a slow one involving transitions between the closed state and an open state...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to its antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects magnesium {{is said to have}} a beneficial effect in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Magnesium can protect myocardial tissue after coronary occlusion and reduces infarct size in experimental models of ischaemia and reperfusion, though the given doses of magnesium are relatively high and differ from clinically reachable serum concentrations. We tested 2 hypotheses in a dog model of ischaemia-reperfusion: 1. The protective effect may be due to a direct, local influence of magnesium on myocardial reperfusion injury. 2. Systemic magnesium treatment with low doses comparable to clinical study regiments may reduce myocardial infarct size. Anaesthetized open chest dogs underwent 1 h of left anterior descending artery occlusion followed by 6 h of reperfusion. 1. Ten animals received intracoronary magnesium aspartate (Mg i. c.) or vehicle infusion (control i. c.) for the first hour of reperfusion to increase regional Mg-concentration by 2 mmol/l. 2. Fourteen animals received intravenous infusion with magnesium <b>potassium</b> <b>aspartate</b> (Mg-K i. v.) or vehicle infusion (control i. v.), beginning 1 h before occlusion {{until the end of the}} 6 h reperfusion period. Regional magnesium concentration in the Mg i. c. -group increased to 2. 7 +/- 1. 00 mmol/l at 45 min of reperfusion. Intravenous infusion raised serum magnesium from 0. 71 +/- 0. 03 mmol/l to 1. 29 +/- 0. 14 mmol/l in the Mg-K i. v. group (5 min of reperfusion, p < 0. 01 vs. baseline). Infarct size after 6 h reperfusion (TTC staining) was similar in both groups of intracoronary treatment (Mg i. c., 20. 6 +/- 5. 0; control, 24. 4 +/- 8. 7 % of area at risk; p = n. s.) and intravenous treatment (Mg-K i. v. 18. 1 +/- 14. 8; control 14. 1 +/- 12. 2 % of area at risk; p = n. s.). Neither regional nor systemic magnesium leads to a clinically relevant reduction of infarct size in the regional ischaemic-reperfused dog heart when it is given in clinically usable doses. The beneficial action of systemic Mg is probably not due to an early direct protective effect on ischaemic-reperfused myocardium but to its antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects. Possibly only to high doses of Mg applied under experimental conditions can reduce infarct siz...|$|E
