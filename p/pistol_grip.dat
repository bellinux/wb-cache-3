5|$|The Laserex P90 laser {{systems have}} a weight of 131 g (0.29lb), {{and they are}} {{activated}} {{by means of a}} green pressure switch located {{on the underside of the}} weapon's <b>pistol</b> <b>grip.</b> The lasers can be configured for three different internal settings: Off– disabled to prevent accidental activation, Training– low intensity for eye safety and extended battery life in training, or Combat– high intensity for maximum visibility. The Laserex P90 laser systems have a battery life of 250 hours when used on the Training setting, or a life of 50 hours when used on the Combat setting.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the <b>pistol</b> <b>grip.</b> The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a <b>pistol</b> <b>grip,</b> as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
50|$|The M3 Super 90 is {{available}} with various barrel lengths and stock options, with fixed butt and semi-pistol or <b>pistol</b> <b>grips,</b> or with top-folding butts and <b>pistol</b> <b>grips.</b> Sight options include shotgun-type open sights, rifle type open sights, ghost ring (diopter) sights and various mounts for reflex or low magnification telescope sights and tactical flashlights and laser pointers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> {{could be}} checked (less common) or smooth without {{checkering}} (most common).|$|R
5000|$|Folding {{stock and}} <b>pistol</b> <b>gripped</b> {{model with a}} 20" [...] Tribore barrel, no heatshield, receiver-mount Picatinny rail, and a large flip-up blade sight.|$|R
25|$|Its ambidextrous fire mode {{selector}} above the <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> has a semi-automatic mode and a fully automatic mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of a simple <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> adapter to an aerosol paint spray can create a cheap alternative to a spray gun.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} rifle version {{which is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic handguard and <b>pistol</b> <b>grip,</b> a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular metal skeleton stock as fitted to all variants except the Galil Sniper.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Volksmaschinenpistole ("people's machine pistol"), the weapon was closely based on the Sten Mk II submachine gun, except for its {{vertical}} magazine; some had additional <b>pistol</b> <b>grips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ball {{and shot}} guns {{resemble}} {{side by side}} double-barrelled shotguns, typically with <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> and flip up sights. The ball and shot gun has broad, shallow rifling in the chokes of smoothbore shotgun barrels.|$|R
5000|$|The AR-7 {{was also}} {{manufactured}} in Argentina as the Sistema de Armas [...]22 LR Fire de Brenta. It came with various barrel lengths, shrouds and fixed rifle stocks {{as well as}} <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> with retractable stocks.|$|R
25|$|Bakelite was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for metal in the magazine, <b>pistol</b> <b>grip,</b> fore grip, hand guard, and butt stock of firearms. Some early AK-74 rifles have been identified as using Bakelite, but most were made with AG-S4, commonly mistaken for Bakelite.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{receiver}} incorporates the magazine well, the <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> and the buttstock. The {{lower receiver}} also contains the trigger, disconnector, hammer and fire selector (collectively {{known as the}} fire control group). Full-sized rifles use a fixed buttstock, while carbines generally use an adjustable telescoping buttstock.|$|E
25|$|Mark III DEMS. Intended for Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships (DEMS), it {{was similar}} to the Mk III** but with the {{addition}} of a <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> on the fore-stock, so that the weapon could be fired free-standing from the shoulder, from any part of a ship's decks.|$|E
50|$|Like all {{semi-automatic}} rifles {{with features}} such as <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> and flash suppressors, L1A1s are classified as military-style semi-automatics, requiring a special permit to own them. Magazine capacities for other centrefire semi-automatics are limited to seven rounds.|$|R
5000|$|The Rhodesian Air Force used twin Browning Mk 2 models, {{chambered}} in the British [...]303 cartridge, {{mounted on}} Alouette III G-Car helicopters {{as well as}} modified variants fitted with FN MAG bipods, <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> and stocks for ground use.|$|R
50|$|Widely produced, {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen major variations are the RPG-7D paratrooper model (can be broken into two parts for easier carrying), and the lighter Chinese Type 69 RPG. DIO of Iran manufactures RPG-7s with olive green handguards, H&K <b>pistol</b> <b>grips,</b> and a Commando variant.|$|R
25|$|The spare {{lubricant}} clip (on {{the left}} side of the cocking lever assembly) was removed, replaced with an oil reservoir and an oiler in the <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> of the receiver assembly. The stylus on the oiler cap could also double as a drift to remove the extractor pin.|$|E
25|$|The Tavor uses a bullpup configuration, {{in which}} the receiver, bolt carrier group and {{magazine}} are placed behind the <b>pistol</b> <b>grip.</b> This shortens the firearm's overall length without sacrificing barrel length. As a result, the Tavor provides carbine overall length, yet can achieve rifle muzzle velocities if equipped with a rifle-length barrel.|$|E
25|$|The Type 36 is {{a direct}} clone of the M3A1, {{manufactured}} in 1947 at the Shenyang Arsenal in Mukden. It resembles a M3A1, except {{that it has no}} flats to allow the use of a wrench for easy removal and it has no oil bottle trap in the <b>pistol</b> <b>grip.</b> Its parts are not interchangeable with the M3A1.|$|E
50|$|Crash B-Daman {{was first}} sold in 2005/12/31. This series {{specialized}} on shooting. It uses <b>pistol</b> type <b>grip</b> and trigger, {{making it look}} vaguely like a pistol. It is also compatible with some Battle B-Daman parts. The <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> and triggers vary in both size, color, and functionality. Crash only made 40 models before being canceled. Many import players liked the design, but Japanese parents believed that gun models were too violent for their kids just as their kids can enjoy, handle and be allowed to see guns on TV.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{connections}} to organized crime, Frantzius was never prosecuted against {{and continued to}} operate his sporting goods business Sports, Inc. until his death on April 6, 1968. Sports, Inc. produced and sold many firearms related items, including his namesake FRANZITE <b>pistol</b> <b>grips,</b> until {{going out of business}} in 1969.|$|R

25|$|The two Charlton designs {{differed}} markedly in {{external appearance}} (amongst other things, the New Zealand Charlton had a forward <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> and bipod, whilst the Australian one did not), but {{shared the same}} operating mechanism. Most of the Charlton Automatic Rifles were destroyed in a fire after the Second World War, but a few examples survive in museums and private collections.|$|E
25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} buttstock assembly, bolt carrier group with bolt and the return mechanism and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, carry handle with integrated sights, trigger group with <b>pistol</b> <b>grip,</b> handguard and magazine socket.|$|E
25|$|The Mini-14 GB ("government bayonet") models feature {{either a}} <b>pistol</b> <b>grip,</b> side folding stock or a {{standard}} semi-pistol grip stock, a 20 or 30-round magazine, bayonet lug, threaded barrel, and flash suppressor. The GB models also come with standard rifle stocks. Sales {{are intended for}} only the law enforcement, military and private security markets, and can only be found in their Law Enforcement Catalog. However, some have entered the civilian market.|$|E

50|$|Both the VP9 and VP40 use Heckler & Koch's {{ergonomic}} handgun grip {{design that}} includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels {{that allow the}} pistol's to fit any and all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves {{in the front of}} the <b>pistol's</b> <b>grip</b> also instinctively position the shooters hand for optimal shooting.|$|R

25|$|Firing {{tests showed}} that the M14, when {{equipped}} with the selector switch, hinged buttplate and bipod, performed {{as well as the}} M15. As a result, the M15 was dropped and the modified M14 became the squad automatic weapon. Accuracy and control problems with this variant led to the addition of a <b>pistol</b> <b>grip,</b> a folding rubber covered metal foregrip and a muzzle stabilizer. However, it was a poor suppressive fire weapon owing to 20-round magazines and it overheated rapidly.|$|E
25|$|The Tantal {{features}} a metal wire side-folding stock (folds {{to the right}} side), ended with a profiled shoulder pad. The rifle can also use a fixed wooden or synthetic buttstock designed for AKM or AK-74 rifles. Both {{the upper and lower}} handguard and <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> are fabricated from bakelite, although a limited number of Tantal-specific black polymer handguards and pistol grips have also been produced. Most handguards designed for use with the wz. 1996 Beryl assault rifle may also be installed on the Tantal.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic {{handguard}} and <b>pistol</b> <b>grip</b> and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle {{can be used with}} a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|E
5000|$|The original, 1935, steel-and-aluminum weapon held {{twenty four}} rounds of 12-gauge x 2.75-inch (18.5mmx70mmR) shells in a spring-driven rotary-cylinder {{that had to}} be wound {{counter-clockwise}} before firing. It consisted of a steel barrel of 11.1 inch mm, a rotating aluminum-alloy ammo cylinder, a single-piece steel body and foregrip, and wooden <b>pistol</b> <b>grips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Serbu Firearms is {{also noted}} for its {{production}} of the Super-Shorty, a compact 12- or 20-gauge (on special order) shotgun with front and rear <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> which in the United States is regulated as what is called Any Other Weapon under the National Firearms Act. They have also appeared in several movies and video games.|$|R
50|$|Drills with <b>pistol</b> <b>grips</b> are {{the most}} common type in use today, and are {{available}} in a huge variety of subtypes. A less common type is the right-angle drill, a special tool used by tradesmen such as plumbers and electricians. The motor used in corded drills is often a universal motor due to its high power to weight ratio.|$|R
