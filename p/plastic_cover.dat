5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Honda {{introduced}} their newer NF series motorcycles, known as Honda Wave series, called the Honda Innova in some markets, which use steel tube frames, front disc brake and <b>plastic</b> <b>cover</b> sets in various displacement options: 100cc, 110cc and 125cc. Though not Cubs, these bikes sold consistently well particularly in European countries, where {{the production of}} Honda Cub models had been previously discontinued. However, the production of Honda Cubs in Asia, Africa and South America still continues today, even though the newer Honda Wave Series and other designs have been introduced alongside the Cub.|$|E

5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or <b>plastic</b> <b>cover</b> which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>plastic</b> <b>covers</b> {{instead of}} glass covers in solar {{collectors}} requires {{a modification of}} the calculation of radiation heat loss, because plastics are, in contrast to glass, partly transparent for thermal radiation. This article describes a simple method which enables calculation of radiation heat loss in collectors equipped with <b>plastic</b> <b>covers.</b> Comparison of this method with an incorrect method used by some authors shows that the latter leads to large errors in some cases. The results of the correct method indicate that in some situations the glass covers can be replaced by much cheaper <b>plastic</b> <b>covers</b> with a negligible increase in collector heat loss. ...|$|R

40|$|The Guadalentín Basin in Spain {{is one of}} the driest {{areas of}} Europe and has {{problems}} with high evaporation rates, and high risks of desertification exist including soil quality loss and soil erosion. Farmers in this semi-arid region use polyethylene covers on their irrigated croplands to reduce evaporation in order to enhance crop yield. When farmers abandon the acres, they leave the <b>plastic</b> <b>covers</b> on the fields. Up to now research has been concentrating on the effects of <b>plastic</b> <b>covers</b> on crop yield and microclimate under these covers but there is little known about the effects of <b>plastic</b> <b>covers</b> and irrigation on soil quality, erosion susceptibility and hydrology after abandonment of these fields. The research question in this paper is: How do the former irrigation practices and <b>plastic</b> soil <b>covers</b> affect organic Carbon content, aggregate stability, hydrological properties and erosion susceptibility? Organic Carbon content and aggregate stability are important soil quality parameters that are easy to measure. Beside these two parameters, soil crusting, infiltration rates and sediment yields have been determined for a set of irrigated fields that have been abandoned at different times (up to 20 years) and where <b>plastic</b> <b>covers</b> have been used. The properties of these fields were compared to control sites with comparable periods of abandonment and substrate, but where only classical rain fed cropping systems have been applied. It was expected that leaving plastic remains in the soil after abandonment would be harmful to soil quality and would lower infiltration. The first associations with seeing the plastic are those of garbage and pollution. In fact, most of the indicators of soil quality considered in this survey turned out to be better or the same on the fields where irrigation and <b>plastic</b> <b>covers</b> had been used, when compared to control fields. Organic Carbon contents were up to 40 % higher on fields with plastic sheet remains and soil aggregates were more stabile. Fields where plastic had been mixed with the soil by tillage showed lower erosion susceptibilities...|$|R

25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a <b>plastic</b> <b>cover</b> (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E
