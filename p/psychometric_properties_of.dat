2500|$|Lexical {{measures}} use individual adjectives {{that reflect}} extravert and introvert traits, such as outgoing, talkative, reserved and quiet. Words representing introversion are reverse coded to create composite measures of extraversion/introversion {{running on a}} continuum. Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure {{as part of his}} 100-word Big Five markers. Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. However, the <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> Saucier's original mini-markers have been found suboptimal with samples outside of North America. As a result, a systematically revised measure was developed to have superior psychometric properties, the International English Mini-Markers. The International English Mini-Markers has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing extraversion/introversion and other five factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. Internal consistency reliability of the Extraversion measure for native English-speakers is reported as [...]92, that for non-native English-speakers is [...]85.|$|E

Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is critical to outcome assessment after total joint replacement, a surgery aimed at improving pain, function and HRQoL of the patients undergoing these procedures. In a recent study, Shi et al. examined the responsiveness to change of various subscales of two instruments, physician-administered Harris Hip Score and patient self-administered Short Form- 36 (SF- 36), 6 months after revision total hip arthroplasty. The responsiveness statistics for both scales were reasonable, higher for Harris Hip Score than SF- 36. This is the first study to examine responsiveness of these instruments in revision THA patients in a systematic fashion. </p...|$|R

The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with {{a convenience sample of}} 161 participants was employed to analyze the conceptual framework and <b>psychometric</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> the scale.
