Here, we show that a largely CD 117 -negative population of human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stromal cells (AF-MSCs) obtained from fetuses with or without prenatally diagnosed anomalies are readily abundant and have limited baseline differentiation potential when compared with bone-marrow-derived MSCs and other somatic cell types. Nonetheless, the AF-MSCs could be easily reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using nonintegrating Sendai viral vectors encoding for OCT 4, SOX 2, KLF 4, and cMYC. The iPSCs were virtually indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells in multiple assays and could be used to generate a relatively homogeneous population of neural progenitors, expressing PAX 6, SOX 2, SOX 3, Musashi- 1, and PSA-NCAM, for potential use in neurologic diseases. Further, these neural progenitors showed engraftment potential in vivo and were capable of differentiating into mature neurons and astrocytes in vitro. This study demonstrates the usefulness of AF-MSCs as an excellent source for the generation of human transgene-free iPSCs ideally suited for autologous <b>perinatal</b> regenerative <b>medicine</b> applications...|$|R

The Correspondence analysis indicated that the seven considered indexes, concerning both parents' education levels and occupations, dwelling quality and the length of father's residence in the area in which the baby was born, were highly and similarly correlated in each centre. The Dynamic cluster analysis enabled us to bring together the socioeconomic profiles of the families into six classes, {{on the basis of their}} similarities, which depend only upon the multivariate distribution of the seven categorical variables under study. Therefore, the attained classification not only is independent of whatever score is assigned to the socioeconomic categories but also allows for the strong interactions between the variables and exploits all the available information. Our six classes were found to be rather similar to the six socioeconomic groups (S. E. G.) of the U. K. Registrar General and to show some resemblance to certain social groups defined by other classifications adopted in obstetric and pediatric field. The socioeconomic indicator constructed here should enable us to find out how much, in different areas of Italy, the social classes may account for inequalities in health conditions and care of the mother and her baby. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: As in {{clinical}} practice, {{the objective is}} to manage the case with the minimum of intervention without jeopardizing the safety of the mother and infant. The emphasis is on interpretation of the CTG {{in clinical}} context and intervention should be done accordingly. Therefore, computer based training and certification in fetal monitoring course was introduced to improve core knowledge and skills of staff working at Obs Gyne ward at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi Pakistan. The core chapters of the course included: shoulder dystocia, pre-eclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, acid base and fetal physiology, intrapartum CTG with training simulator and case presentations. Methods: The Online K 2 Medical Systems: Knowledge in <b>Medicine,</b> <b>Perinatal</b> Training Programme was introduced by Aga Khan University Hospital’s Obs/Gyne Department from Nov 2011 - May 2012. All Registered Nurses and Registered Midwives working at Labour Room and Obs Gyne wards participated in it with the coordination of Nursing Education Service AKUH, Nurse Manager, Head Nurses and Clinical Nurse Instructors of the wards. At initial stage, sessions were arranged for all staff to get acquainted with the system and how to attempt the course. Course Coordinators were assigned to check individual staff’s progress. LRC (Learning Resource Centre- AKUH) was utilized for educational purpose and combine studies. In 6 months time, staffs’ progresses were continuously monitored and they were motivated by course coordinator, Head Nurse and Clinical Nurse Instructors with varied motivational strategies such as: displaying of their names on ward Notice boards upon completion of chapters at gradual pace. Results: In these 6 months, 102 number of staff participated out of 116 in which 42 / 48 were RNs and 60 / 68 were RMs. Since the course was in continuation for 6 months, few staff could not participate due to leave factors. Conclusions: Strategies such as online courses for knowledge enhancement are admired and have impact on patient care outcome.

Three trials were included, of 190 term and 40 preterm infants, a proportion of whom were SGA. DCC was associated with higher haemoglobin levels in term infants at follow-up [two trials, 127 infants, weighted mean difference (WMD) 9. 17 g/L, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5. 94 - 12. 40]. In preterm infants, the proportion who required a blood transfusion in the 1 st 6 weeks after birth was lower after DCC (one trial, 38 infants, RR 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 34 - 0. 94). It was not possible to infer from the available data whether SGA infants were at greater risk of adverse effects in the early neonatal period. CONCLUSIONS: DCC in a group that contains both AGA and SGA infants was associated with higher haemoglobin levels at 2 - 3 months of age in term infants and a reduction in the number of blood transfusions needed in the 1 st 4 - 6 weeks of life in preterm infants. No reliable conclusions could be drawn about the potential adverse effects of DCC. The paucity of information on DCC in SGA infants justifies further research, especially in developing countries where the baseline risk for polycythaemia-hyperviscosity syndrome is likely to be lower than in industrialised countrie...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{effects of}} {{perinatal}} glucocorticoid treatment {{on the heart}} Chronic lung disease in the extremely preterm baby is still a major complication in neonatal intensive care <b>medicine.</b> <b>Perinatal</b> (ante- and neonatal) glucocorticoids are widely used to prevent severe infant respiratory syndrome and to reduce chronic lung disease. The aim of this thesis was to describe the histopathological, functional and hemodynamic impact of antenatal and neonatal glucocorticoid treatment on the developing and adult heart. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone is widely used in preterm infants {{for the prevention of}} chronic lung disease. However, major concern has arisen about the long-term sequelae of this therapy. Glucocorticoid treatment in preterm babies to prevent chronic lung disease causes myocardial hypertrophy and hypertension. Although these changes are thought to be transient, there is evidence that dexamethasone induces permanent myocardial abnormalities as well. In the studies described in this thesis long-term cardiovascular side effects were investigated in a rat model. Rats were treated neonatally with dexamethasone in dosages comparable to those used in neonates and compared to a control group. Found was that neonatal treatment with dexamethasone significantly shortens life span in rats, notably by 25 % in males and by 18 % in females. Histopathological examination of dexamethasone treated animals showed signs of end stage cardiac failure and end stage renal disease. Already at young adult age, dexamethasone treated rats showed symptoms of hypertension that increased with age. Thus, a brief period of glucocorticoid treatment during early life results in untimely death presumably due to cardiovascular and renal disease later in life. Neonatal dexamethasone treatment causes a temporary suppression of cardiomyocyte proliferation in the rat pup, which eventually leads to a reduced number of cardiomyocytes and hypertrophy of these cardiomyocytes during adult life. Furthermore it causes in rat pups a permanent decrease in heart weight, as well as hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and increased interstitial collagen during adulthood. The combination of lower heart weight and hypertrophy also strongly suggests that the number of cardiomyocytes will be reduced. Taken together these findings may indicate early ageing of the heart. In a follow-up study at school age (7 - 10 years) of children who had been born prematurely and treated ante- and/or neonatally with glucocorticoids to reduce chronic lung disease {{no significant differences were found}} between groups for blood pressure, heart rate, myocardial performance, intima-media thickness or biochemical parameters (BNP, N-Terminal proBNP). However, these children were still young as compared to the data obtained from the animal experiments, assuming that the results of the rat studies can be extrapolated to humans. Furthermore the normal human heart has a large reserve capacity and in the present study no challenge of the cardiovascular system was applied. In future follow-up studies, tests challenging the cardiovascular system should be applied (such as stress echocardiography) and also more sophisticated echocardiographic techniques such as tissue Doppler imaging should be employed. Moreover, possible alterations may occur later in life. For instance, the large reserve capacity of the heart might be affected unfavourably. If necessary, secondary prevention might be offered to alleviate or to cure clinical symptoms of cardiovascular disease. The rate of successful treatment will improve when the symptoms are detected as early...|$|R
40|$|The goal {{of modern}} <b>perinatal</b> {{intensive}} care <b>medicine</b> {{is to increase}} the survival rate of extremely premature infants and concomitantly avoid long term sequalae in this high risk population. Therefore it is essential to identify factors which influence long term outcome of these infants. In this context the potential contribution of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its therapy to a compromised long term result is of interest. The uniqueness of the fetal structure of the ductus arteriosus (DA) has already been described in ancient medicine by Galen. Despite research on the complex molecular mechanisms enrolled during postnatal closure of the DA continues until today. Knowledge concerning the exact sequence of the physiologic maturation processes leading to occlusion is mandatory in order to optimize current treatment strategies of a hemodynamically significant PDA. Therefore, the herein presented cumulative work was motivated by the acquisition of further scientific knowledge concerning the different aspects of PDA closure in preterm infants using experimental and clinical studies. It is well known, that programmed proliferative degeneration of the DA already starts during fetal life, underlies great developmental variability and does not stricktly correlate with calculated age of maturation. Thus, delayed spontaneous closure of the DA or a PDA warrating treatment, as seen in approximately 50 % of extremely premature infants, is only partially explained by immaturity. The main requirements for a definite closure of the duct rather seem to be the undisturbed interaction of the following two vital processes: first the functional DA closure by contraction and then the subsequent proliferative obliteration of the vessel. Maturity dependant differential expression of the key factors for DA closure, which have previously only been described in animal models, were confirmed to be also present in human ductal tissue by this work. The changes of the expression profiles of COX- 1, EP 4 receptor and the VEGF receptors correlate more to the morphologic maturity status of the DA than to the calculated maturity stage. Still, the interaction of the tested key factors with each other as well as with other putative factors contributing to ductal closure has to be clarified by further studies. The performed clinical works dealed with different diagnostic and therapeutic questions which were highly motivated by missing pharmacokinetic data, lacking data on side-effects of the medical intervention for PDA and non-existing long-term results after ibuprofen therapy. Our prospective clinical {{studies have shown that the}} biomarker BNP is a valid tool besides distinct echokardiographic parameters for steering PDA therapy in preterms. Particularly for planning the further therapeutic strategy after failure of the first COX-inhibitor cycle, e. g. the individual decision between a second pharmacological PDA intervention or a surgical ligation, this parameter could proove to be helpful in the future. By means of in vitro experiments in a neuronal cell culture model we further characterized the apoptotic degradation mechanism of high ibuprofen concentrations. Our evaluation of clinical data has shown an increase of the total bilirubin serum concentration during ibuprofen therapy. This illustrates a potential side-effect of ibuprofen on the bilirubin metabolism in vivo. The exact analysis of complications atributed to pharmacological and surgical PDA intervention in our patient cohort of extremely preterm infants over a period of more than ten years lead to a paradigm change of the algorithm for PDA therapy at our clinic. Consequently, surgical PDA ligation is not a primary therapeutic option for extremely premature infants and restricted to ventilated infants after failed pharmacological PDA intervention. Investigation of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome at a corrected age of two years revealed no differences between the two COX-inhibitors indomethacin and ibuprofen in our patient cohort. However, an opposite effect of the surgical PDA closure on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome could not fully be ruled out. In summary, the herein presented cumulative work has illucidated different aspects of DA closure in extremely premature infants by using various experimental and clinical models. Furthermore, the included publications have lead to continuous questions that should be worked out in the future. This will contribute to a better understanding of a failed PDA closure in some of the extremely premature infants and to a concomitant modification of the current therapeutic strategies. In view of the superior purpose to improve long-term outcome of extremely premature infants, an optimized therapy for a hemodynamically significant PDA might be one piece of the puzzle for fewer long-term sequela of preterm infants. In order to get reliable results, future clinical studies should include a non-treated control group and evaluation of long-term outcome should be performed...|$|R

Spinal Fluid Lactate Dehydrogenase Level Differentiates between Structural and Metabolic Etiologies of Altered Mental Status in Children. Iran J Child Neurol. 2015 Winter; 9 (1) : 31 - 36. Abstract Objective Altered mental {{status is}} a common cause of {{intensive}} care unit admission in children. Differentiating structural causes of altered mental status from metabolic etiologies is of utmost importance in diagnostic approach and management of the patients. Among many biomarkers proposed to help stratifying patients with altered mental status, spinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase {{appears to be the}} most promising biomarker to predict cellular necrosis. Materials & Methods In this cross sectional study we measured spinal fluid level of lactate dehydrogenase in children 2 months to 12 years of age admitted to a single center intensive care unit over one year. Spinal fluid level of lactate dehydrogenase in  40 pediatric cases of febrile seizure was also determined as the control group. Results The study group included 35 boys (58. 3 %) and 25 girls (41. 7 %). Their mean age was 2. 7 +/- 3 years and their mean spinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase level was 613. 8 +/- 190. 4 units/liter. The control group included 24 boys (55. 8 %) and 19 girls (44. 2 %). Their mean age was 1. 3 +/- 1. 2 years and their mean spinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase level was 18. 9 +/- 7. 5 units/liter. The mean spinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase level in children with abnormal head CT scan was 246. 3 +/- 351. 5 units/liter compared to 164. 5 +/- 705. 7 in those with normal CT scan of the head (p= 0. 001).
