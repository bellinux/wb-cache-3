40|$|Design, synthesis, and {{structural}} and functional studies of rigid-rod ionophores of different axial electrostatic asymmetry are reported. The employed design strategy emphasized presence of (a) a rigid scaffold {{to minimize the}} conformational complexity, (b) a unimolecular ion-conducting pathway to minimize the suprastructural complexity and monitor the function, (c) an extended fluorophore to monitor structure, (d) variable axial rod dipole, and (e) variable terminal charges to create axial asymmetry. Studies in isoelectric, anionic, and polarized bilayer membranes confirmed a general increase in activity of uncharged rigid <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> in polarized bilayers. The similarly increased activity of cationic rigid <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> with an electrostatic asymmetry {{comparable to that of}} a-helical bee toxin melittin (positive charge near negative axial dipole terminus) is shown by fluorescence-depth quenching experiments to originate from the stabilization of transmembrane rod orientation by the membrane potential. The reduced activity of rigid <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> having an electrostatic asymmetry comparable to that in a-helical natural antibiotics (a positive charge near the positive axial dipole terminus) is shown by structural studies to originate from rod “ejection” by membrane potentials comparable to that found in mammalian plasma membranes. This structural evidence for cell membrane recognition by asymmetric rods is unprecedented and of possible practical importance with regard to antibiotic resistance...|$|R
25|$|Ki-84-II: Sometimes {{known as}} the 'Hayate-Kai', the Ki-84-II had certain {{duralumin}} components replaced with ones made of wood and plywood, mainly concerning the rear fuselage, tail unit elements, wing tips, <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> and other, minor components. This model was produced with the designations Ko, Otsu and Hei depending on the armament.|$|R
50|$|The {{airframe}} of the C2 {{was virtually}} {{identical to the}} model C1. Differences included an aileron control system that actuated the single set ailerons on the upper wings via torque tubes internal to the upper wings rather than from vertical <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> connected to the lower wings. All further C-series Stearmans had this system.|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} other Le Rhône series engines, the 9J {{featured}} highly visible copper induction pipes {{and used a}} single <b>push-pull</b> <b>rod</b> to operate its two overhead valves. The main visual difference between the 9J and the earlier, less powerful Le Rhône 9C engine is that the copper intake manifold tubing (with round section lower ends) on the 110 hp 9J {{is attached to the}} crankcase behind the cylinders, whereas on the 9C (80 hp) the intake manifolds (with rectangular lower ends) are fully visible from the front.|$|E
50|$|The Le Rhône engines used an {{unconventional}} valve actuation system, {{with a single}} centrally-pivoting rocker arm moving the exhaust valve and the intake valve. When the arm moved down it opened the intake valve and when it moved up it opened the exhaust value. To make this system work a two-way <b>push-pull</b> <b>rod</b> was fitted, instead of the more conventional one-way pushrod. This feature required the cam followers to incorporate a positive action, a function designed in by {{using a combination of}} links and levers. This design prevented valve overlap and so limited power output, but as the engine structure and cooling arrangements would not have been adequate at a higher power output this should not be considered a significant design fault.|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{usefulness}} of rigid-rod molecules to address pertinent questions of biological relevance are summarized. Emphasis is placed on (a) the supramolecular functional plasticity of p-octiphenyl ß-barrels expressed in molecular recognition (adaptable synthetic hosts), molecular translocation (adaptable synthetic ion channels) and molecular transformation (esterases, RNases), (b) molecular recognition of polarized membranes by rigid <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods,</b> as well as (c) the synthetic organic chemistry of rigid-rod molecules...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of research on uniformed <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> endings. The aim of research was the analysis of characteristics and the possibility of durability improvement, in particular fatigue durability. The research included microstructure analysis and numerical modelling of manufacturing process. The influence of technological parameters on characteristics improvement was also analysed. The obtained results will be used to develop a new method of forming, and to produce sample elements which will be subjected to verification trials...|$|R
2500|$|Features of the Austro-Daimler {{included}} {{welded steel}} water jackets, (originally copper), seven main bearings and large diameter inclined inlet and exhaust valves opened by dual action <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> and closed by spring pressure. The single-overhead cam valvetrain was driven from the crankshaft through the usual vertically-oriented shaft as the contemporary Mercedes D.III was, but the Austro-Daimler had its vertical camshaft drive system mounted {{at the front}} of the engine instead, and not the usual aft-end placement of other Central Powers straight-six [...] "SOHC" [...] liquid-cooled aircraft powerplants, like the Mercedes and BMW designs.|$|R
40|$|Design, synthesis, and {{evaluation}} of 14 -methoxy- 84 -methylsulfonyl- 22, 33, 42, 53, 62, 73 -hexa(Gla-Leu-Lys-Leu-NH 2) -p-octiphenyl (1) and 14, 84 -bismethoxy- 22, 33, 42, 53, 62, 73 -hexa(Gla-Leu-Lys-Leu-NH 2) -p-octiphenyl (2) are described (Gla = -OCH 2 CO-). Nanomolar concentrations of <b>push-pull</b> <b>rod</b> 1 are found to suffice to selectively form ion channels in polarized spherical bilayer membranes composed of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine. Exponential dependence of the ion-channel activity on membrane polarization reveals a gating charge of 0. 85 /channel. Independence of the activity of push-push rod 2 on membrane potential demonstrates that cell membrane recognition originates from the axial dipole in <b>push-pull</b> <b>rod</b> 1. Nonlinear concentration dependence of activity at - 180 mV indicates parallel self-assembly of <b>push-pull</b> <b>rod</b> 1 into a tetrameric barrel-stave supramolecule...|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{working under}} Grigorovich and Polikarpov, {{as well as}} at the TsKB (Central Construction Bureau) and OKB-30, Nikitin {{designed}} and built aircraft that carried his name despite not having an OKB. Inspired by racing aircraft in the USA, Nikitin designed and built the NV-1 tailwheeled monoplane sporting aircraft. The wooden wing was braced to the fuselage and fixed spatted main undercarriage with streamlined steel struts. The fuselage was built up with welded steel tubing and a duralumin tail unit, all covered with fabric.The flying controls were operated by <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> throughout.|$|R

40|$|In small {{commuter}} category aircraft, {{the control}} surfaces viz., Aileron, Elevator and Rudder are operated using mechanical {{flight control system}} consisting of elements like <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods,</b> cables, pulleys, quadrants, etc. There is a considerable reduction in stiffness of the flight control circuit due to the stretch in these elements, resulting in control surface deflections lesser than desirable values. This paper focuses on the application of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in design, analysis and optimization of flight control circuits of a typical Light Transport Aircraft (LTA) using FEA software Altair Hypermesh and MSC Nastran. Various Finite Element Modeling techniques have been extensively {{used in this study}} to simulate the control circuit mechanisms that exist on the aircraft. The stiffness and stretch values obtained from the analysis are in good agreement with the experimental results obtained from ground tests conducted on the LTA. The methodology proposed in this paper minimizes the time and effort in designing and implementing an optimum control circuit, and also eliminates the need for extensive ground testing...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic ion {{channels}} and pores formed by rigid-rod molecules are summarized. This includes work on hydrogen-bonded chains installed along membrane-spanning rigid-rod scaffolds to transport protons. As a second topic, programmed assembly of p-septiphenyls with terminal iminodiacetate-copper complexes for potassium transport by cation-p interactions is described. The third topic concerns rigid <b>push-pull</b> <b>rods</b> as fluorescent a-helix mimics {{to probe the}} importance of dipole-potential interactions for voltage gating, both on the functional and the structural level. Topic number four deals with p-octiphenyl staves as key scaffolds for the synthesis of rigid-rod ß-barrel pores. The description of internal and external design strategies for these rigid-rod ß-barrels covers a rich collection of pH-, pM-, voltage-, ligand-, and enzyme-gated synthetic multifunctional pores that can act as hosts, sensors, and catalysts. As far as practical applications are concerned, the possibility to detect chemical reactions with synthetic multifunctional pores appears most attractive. Recent molecular mechanics simulations are presented as a valuable approach to insights on the elusive suprastructures of multifunctional pores made from rigid rods...|$|R
