25|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body <b>plastic</b> <b>cladding,</b> silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The C-pillar ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central ceiling light, and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|E
2500|$|Upon introduction, {{the model}} {{had only one}} trim level, which would later {{be known as the}} LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0L straight-four B20B {{producing}} [...] at 5400rpm and [...] of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra's 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger [...] bore to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine utilized a one-piece cylinder sleeve construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis was a unibody design with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension. Inside, the rear seats were able to fold down, and a picnic table was stowed in the rear floor area. A common external trait that was visible with this generation was <b>plastic</b> <b>cladding</b> covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. A major difference between the LX and EX trims was that the EX had anti-lock brakes and 15inch alloy wheels while the LX did not. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time AWD.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of optical radiation outside {{the core of}} a step index fibre - the so called evanescent wave - offers a technique for chemical sensing by attenuated total interval reflection spectroscopy (ATR). The penetration of the evanescent wave power in the sensing region is dependent upon the modal structure in the fibre core. In this thesis a method for measuring the variation of modal power distribution with distance along the fibre using a CCD camera is described and used for large diameter <b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> silica fibre (PCS). Both linear and two dimensional array cameras are used to profile the optical power distribution in the fibre core and the results obtained are discussed in terms of diffusion models. The suitability of such fibre for ATR spectroscopy is evaluated in light of the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Typically, {{output from}} high power, diode lasers and arrays must be transported {{to a final}} {{application}}/treatment site, whether the application is industrial, military or medical. Many demands are placed on optical fibers to couple the laser output into their structures and to transmit the power to the application site. All silica fibers become much more expensive as {{the diameter of the}} fiber increases to handle larger spot sizes and higher NA beams, especially from diode arrays. High strength, low fatigue Hard <b>Plastic</b> <b>Clad</b> Silica fibers provide benefits of larger Numerical Aperture (NA), more flexibility and less strain at the core-clad interface.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation is}} presented of {{the propagation of}} power in a step-index <b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> tapered optical fiber operating in the infrared region of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The chosen materials are widely used in low cost optical links. It is assumed that the taper section has a linear profile. Following rigorous analytical approach, the general expressions for power in the core and the cladding sections are derived, and a study 1 : 3 presented of the variation of the relative power along the propagation direction in respect of different (meriodinal and skew) lower order modes. It is observed that, in general, the confinement of power is fairly high in the core section, and the confinement increases {{with the increase in}} the taper length and/or mode index. In the cladding region, the confinement decreases for higher taper lengths. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} evanescent field wave based fiber-optic liquid concentration sensors of two different configurations. The two different set-up being proposed here {{has the potential to}} detect concentration changes in a liquid to a good degree of precision [...] Important characteristics of the proposed sensors are that they utilize inexpensive materials like multimode plastic optical fiber and are applicable for various solutions at normal temperatures. The amount of rays guided along the fiber probe {{is a result of the}} absorption of evanescent waves being produced at the core-cladding interface. A millivolt range multimeter displays voltage output which is an indicator of the refractive index of a certain concentration of a solution. The two separate set-up measures light intensities across unclad portion of a <b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> silica optical fiber, where salt solutions of known concentrations serve as cladding regions. According to results, the sensitivity of the direct transmission mode is 1. 23 and that of the reflection mode is 11. 00 which follows that the reflection configuration mode is more sensitive than the other...|$|R

40|$|This Letter {{reports a}} lead (II) ion sensor {{composed}} of a tapered multimode fibre (MMF) coated with chitosan. The diameter and length of the tapered fibre region is 20 μm and 1 cm, respectively. Tapered MMF is used {{because it is more}} flexible and compact compared with <b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> silica. Chitosan is chosen as the sensing layer because it can absorb heavy metal ions due to its unique properties as polyelectrolyte and chelating agent. The refractive index of the chitosan layer changes as it absorbs lead (II) ion and this leads to an increase in the absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer. This is tested by immersing the sensor in a solution that contains lead (II) ion with different concentrations, from 0. 2 to 1 ppm. The results show that the absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer increased as the concentration of the lead (II) ion increased. The sensor's average sensitivity is measured as 40. 554 abs/ppm. This sensor is simpler compared with surface plasmon resonance-based lead (II) ion sensor because it does not require metal coating prior to the sensing layer coating...|$|R

40|$|Evanescent wave {{absorption}} based PCS (<b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> silica) {{fiber optic}} pH sensor is constructed by encapsulation of indicator dyes in the heterogeneous inorganic hybrid silica-titania nanomatrix {{in the presence}} of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant by sol-gel method. A nanoporous multilayers (triple layer and six layers) of silica-titania hybrid is deposited on 5 cm uncladed middle portion of the fiber by dip-coating sol-gel technique. The CTAB surfactant expressively improved the host matrix structure and enhanced its porosity. Thermally stable, adhesive and smooth thin nanocladding has been examined using microscopic and thermal analysis. Indicators encapsulated nanomatrices are highly sensitive to pH and show optical output signals in terms of intensity. Therefore, it provides confirmation that interactions between the host matrix and pH-indicator molecules are in good assistance. Furthermore, experimental findings reveal that the sensing species are probably better encapsulated in the matrix and show no leaching of sensing molecules. The prepared nanosensors exhibit a much faster response time because of the material to be sensed diffuses faster into the triple-layer sensors < 2 s. These pH sensors are found to have 60 days (2 months) age stability and high reproducibility. A repeatable response over a wide range of pH values between 3 and 11 is obtained...|$|R

40|$|New {{formulations}} of cladding materials have become available {{in recent times}} for Hard <b>Plastic</b> <b>Clad</b> Silica (HPCS) fibers, Initial data showed gains in some properties, particularly dynamic strength, especially for high numerical aperture (NA) fibers. A systematic study has been undertaken to determine the full strength and fatigue behavior of these HPCS fibers and to make comparisons to earlier HPCS fibers. Preliminary results, now confirmed, has shown improved median dynamic strength and higher Weibull slope. Full results are presented below including fatigue behavior and optical properties. These fibers have many applications and benefits in the high power delivery and medical laser uses as highlighted below. High power diode laser systems with their laser diode bars and arrays not only require special fibers to couple directly to the diode emitters, but also require special fibers to couple from the laser to application sites. These latter power delivery fibers are {{much larger than the}} internal fibers but still must be flexible, and have not only good strength but also good fatigue behavior. This particularly important industrial systems using robotic arms to apply the high power laser energy at a treatment site. The optical properties of HPCS fibers are well suited for the needs of the delivery of high power from diode laser bars and arrays to an application site. Benefits of strong median dynamic strengths and tighter flaw distributions in such cases will be discussed. Many medical applications, especially endoscopic ones, can benefit from the use of highly flexible, high NA, cost effective, HPCS optical fibers. Benefits of high strength and good fatigue behavior for such fibers in endoscopic procedures, including laser surgery, are discussed briefly including implications for mechanical reliability in medical and industrial settings...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Agronomy)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The use of hydroponic {{strawberry}} {{production systems}} is increasing worldwide. Although higher planting densities are possible in vertical production systems, these higher planting densities {{may have a}} negative effect on individual plant yield and fruit quality due to lower light levels when compared to conventional (horizontal) production systems. Optimum planting densities will for this reason be affected by light intensities inside the greenhouse and configuration of the vertical production systems. Two experiments were conducted in a <b>plastic</b> <b>cladded</b> greenhouse, fitted with a wetwall and fan cooling system, at the Department of Agronomy, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa during the period of April 2007 to November 2007 (late autumn to early summer). Mean daily maximum temperatures exceeded 26 oC during most of the 14 week harvest period (22 August to 30 November 2007), while photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), measured at 12 h 00 on cloudless days, inside the greenhouse increased from about 200 μMol m- 2 s- 1 to about 460 μMol m- 2 s- 1 during this period. The first experiment compared the effect of two vertical production systems (vertical system and ‘A-shape’ system), subjected to different planting density (16. 7, 23. 3 and 33. 3 plants m- 2) and shading (0 %, 20 %, 50 %) treatments, as measured on selected yield, quality and growth factors. The second experiment studied the effect of different planting density (3. 3, 5. 6 and 10 plants m- 2) and shading (0 %, 20 %, 50 %) treatments on the same yield, quality and growth factors in a conventional production system. A comparison with regard to these factors was also made between the highest planting densities of the conventional-, vertical- and ‘A-shape’ system...|$|R
