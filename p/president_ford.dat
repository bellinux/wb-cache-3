5|$|In 1976, Reagan {{challenged}} incumbent President Gerald Ford {{in a bid}} {{to become}} the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the American Conservative Union which became key components of his political base, while <b>President</b> <b>Ford</b> was considered a more moderate Republican. Though Reagan lost the Republican nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. Ford ultimately lost the general election to Carter.|$|E
5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a mint mark, {{similar to the}} dollar in the {{prototype}} set given to <b>President</b> <b>Ford,</b> is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days later}} Herb Caen, a {{columnist}} at The San Francisco Chronicle, exposed Sipple as gay {{and a friend}} of Milk's. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk's name was included in many of the stories. Time magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco's gay community. Sipple, however, was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch Baptist in Detroit, now refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the Chronicle for invasion of privacy. <b>President</b> <b>Ford</b> sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.|$|E
5|$|The first Medal of Honor {{presentation}} for Vietnam was to Captain Roger Donlon {{for actions}} on 6 July 1964 as {{commanding officer of}} the U.S. Army Special Forces Detachment defending Camp Nam Dong against a Viet Cong attack. The last actions to earn a Medal of Honor in this war were those of Bud Day, for actions as {{a prisoner of war}} from 26 August 1967 through 14 March 1973. Day and three others were presented with the Medal of Honor by <b>President</b> <b>Ford</b> at the White House on March, 4, 1976. They were the last of the 236 servicemen awarded the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War and in the following twelve months.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean {{to do the best}} he could. At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees into the parking lot LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that <b>President</b> <b>Ford</b> had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E

Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E
5|$|The {{high winds}} knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania {{were called in}} to assist in {{restoring}} electricity. Damage across the island reached $8million, of which $3million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. An estimated 36,000residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. <b>President</b> <b>Ford</b> later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000people lost electricity. Commuter train service along Conrail's New York–New Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm. A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August14.|$|E

25|$|Schlesinger's {{insistence on}} higher defense budgets, his {{disagreements}} {{within the administration}} and with Congress on this issue, and his differences with Secretary of State Kissinger all contributed to his dismissal from office by <b>President</b> <b>Ford</b> in November 1975. Schlesinger's legacy included {{the development of the}} close-air support aircraft the A-10, and the lightweight F-16 fighter. Kissinger strongly supported the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks process, while Schlesinger wanted assurances that arms control agreements would not put the United States in a strategic position inferior to the Soviet Union. The secretary's harsh criticism of some congressional leaders dismayed <b>President</b> <b>Ford,</b> who was more willing than Schlesinger to compromise on the Defense budget. On 2 November 1975, the president dismissed Schlesinger and made other important personnel changes. Kissinger lost his position as special assistant to the President for national security affairs but remained as secretary of state. Schlesinger left office on 19 November 1975, explaining his departure in terms of his budgetary differences with the White House.|$|E
