40|$|The muscles {{serving the}} ventral {{portion of the}} gill arches ( = infrabranchial musculature) are poorly known in bony fishes. A {{comparative}} analysis of the infrabranchial muscles in the major percomorph lineages reveals {{a large amount of}} phylogenetically-relevant information. Characters derived from this anatomical system are identified and discussed in light of current hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships among <b>percomorphs.</b> New evidence supports a sister-group relationship between the Batrachoidiformes and Lophiiformes and between the Callionymoidei and Gobiesocoidei. Investigated data also corroborate the existence of two monophyletic groups, one including the Pristolepididae, Badidae, and Nandidae, and a second clade consisting of all non-amarsipid stromateiforms. New synapomorphies are proposed for the Atherinomorphae, Blenniiformes, Lophiiformes, Scombroidei (including Sphyraenidae), and Gobiiformes. Within the latter order, the Rhyacichthyidae and Odontobutidae are supported as the successive sister families of all remaining gobiiforms. The present analysis further confirms the validity of infrabranchial musculature characters previously proposed to support the grouping of the Mugiliformes with the Atherinomorphae and the monophyly of the Labriformes with the possible inclusion of the Pholidichthyiformes. Interestingly, most hypotheses of relationships supported by the infrabranchial musculature have been advanced by preceding anatomists on the basis of distinct data sources, but were never recovered in recent molecular phylogenies. These conflicts clearly indicate the current unsatisfactory resolution of the higher-level phylogeny of <b>percomorphs...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{elucidate}} the ancestral (plesiomorphic) condition for visual pathways to the hypothalamus in teleost fishes. Three patterns of pretectal organization can be discerned morphologically and histochemically in teleosts. Their taxonomic distribution suggests that the intermediately complex pattern (seen in most teleost groups) is ancestral to both the elaborate pattern (seen in <b>percomorphs)</b> and the simple pattern (seen in cyprinids). The pretectal nuclei involved can be demonstrated with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry selectively and reliably in different species of teleosts, suggesting that the same-named nuclei are homologous in representatives of the three different patterns. Whereas there are visual pathways to the hypothalamus in both the elaborate (percomorph) and the simple (cyprinid) patterns, different pretectal and hypothalamic nuclei are involved. Thus visual hypothalamic pathways in these two patterns would {{not appear to be}} homologous. In this study, circuitry within the third, i. e., the intermediately complex, pattern is investigated. It is demonstrated that visual pathways project via the pretectum to the hypothalamus in Osteoglossum bicirrhosum and that they are very similar to the visual pathways in the elaborate pattern. This suggests that the circuitry in the intermediately complex pattern, as represented by Osteoglossum, is plesiomorphic (evolutionarily primitive) and the circuitry in both the simple pattern (seen in cyprinids) and the elaborate pattern (seen in <b>percomorphs)</b> is apomorphic (evolutionarily derived) for teleosts. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Antarctic notothenioids are an {{impressive}} adaptive radiation. While they share recent common ancestry with several species-depauperate lineages that exhibit a relictual distribution in areas peripheral to the Southern Ocean, {{an understanding of}} their evolutionary origins and biogeographic history is limited as the sister lineage of notothenioids remains unidentified. The phylogenetic placement of notothenioids among major lineages of perciform fishes, which include sculpins, rockfishes, sticklebacks, eelpouts, scorpionfishes, perches, groupers and soapfishes, remains unresolved. We investigate the phylogenetic position of notothenioids using DNA sequences of 10 protein coding nuclear genes sampled from more than 650 <b>percomorph</b> species. The biogeographic history of notothenioids is reconstructed using a maximum likelihood method that integrates phylogenetic relationships, estimated divergence times, geographic distributions and paleogeographic history. Results: Percophis brasiliensis is resolved, with strong node support, as the notothenioid sister lineage. The species is endemic to the subtropical and temperate Atlantic coast of southern South America. Biogeographic reconstructions imply the initial diversification of notothenioids involved the western portion of the East Gondwanan Weddellian Province. The geographic disjunctions among the major lineages of notothenioids show biogeographic and temporal correspondence with the fragmentation of East Gondwana. Conclusions: The phylogenetic resolution of Percophis requires {{a change in the}} classification of <b>percomorph</b> fishes and provides evidence for a western Weddellian origin of notothenioids. The biogeographic reconstruction highlights the importance of the geographic and climatic isolation of Antarctica in driving the radiation of cold-adapted notothenioids...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in exploring how the mechanisms that regulate gene expression might generate diversity in phenotypes {{as a function of}} habitat Utilisation (at both inter- and intra-specific levels). Prolactin (PRL) is the main hormone involved in adaptation to low salinity in teleosts. Several mechanisms regulating PRL-A gene expression have been described. The main mechanisms involve Pit- 1 binding sites and length polymorphism of a short sequence repeat (SSR) located in the proximal promoter (PP) of the gene. Together, these processes may generate phenotypes with potentially distinct physiological responses to salinity. To gain insight into their relative roles and importance, we sequenced the PP of the PRL-A gene in the euryhaline European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and in the stenohalnie sister species, Dicentrarchus punctatus. Then, we assessed the presence of both SSR and binding elements in PP among several teleost lineages, by checking available data from the literature and GenBank. The sequence of PRL-A PP was completely distinct between the <b>percomorphs</b> and other lineages Such as salmoniform, siluriform and cypriniform, except for short stretches of nucleotides that were highly conserved across all species, also including mammals. Most of them were identified as Putative cis-regulatory elements, including Pit- 1, but also delta EF 1, c-ETS, CEBP, and GATA binding factor 2, previously unreported as regulating PRL-A transcription in teleosts, but involved in gene regulation in mammals. This result Suggests that there is greater conservation of PRL-A regulatory mechanisms across vertebrate lineages than previously thought, and offers new perspectives for future Studies. The presence and homology of all SSR in the PP of PRL-A gene of <b>percomorphs</b> was demonstrated, but no SSR polymorphisms were found amongst the two Dicentrarchus species, or within natural D. labrax populations covering the known range of natural genetic variation, including marine, brackish water and freshwater populations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Based on the {{observation}} of an increased number of paralogous genes in teleost fishes compared with other vertebrates and on the conserved synteny between duplicated copies, {{it has been shown}} that a whole genome duplication (WGD) occurred during the evolution of Actinopterygian fish. Comparative phylogenetic dating of this duplication event suggests that it occurred early on, specifically in teleosts. It has been proposed that this event might have facilitated the evolutionary radiation and the phenotypic diversification of the teleost fish, notably by allowing the sub- or neo-functionalization of many duplicated genes. Results: In this paper, we studied in a wide range of Actinopterygians the duplication and fate of the androgen receptor (AR, NR 3 C 4), a nuclear receptor known to play a key role in sex-determination in vertebrates. The pattern of AR gene duplication is consistent with an early WGD event: it has been duplicated into two genes ARA and AR-B after the split of the Acipenseriformes from the lineage leading to teleost fish but before the divergence of Osteoglossiformes. Genomic and syntenic analyses in addition to lack of PCR amplification show that one of the duplicated copies, AR-B, was lost in several basal Clupeocephala such as Cypriniformes (including the model species zebrafish), Siluriformes, Characiformes and Salmoniformes. Interestingly, we also found that, in basal teleost fish (Osteoglossiformes and Anguilliformes), the two copies remain very similar, whereas, specifically in <b>Percomorphs,</b> one of the copies, AR-B, has accumulated substitutions in both the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the DNA binding domain (DBD). Conclusion: The comparison of the mutations present in these divergent AR-B with those known in human to be implicated in complete, partial or mild androgen insensitivity syndrome suggests that the existence of two distinct AR duplicates may be correlated to specific functional differences that may be connected to the well-known plasticity of sex determination in fish. This suggests that three specific events have shaped the present diversity of ARs in Actinopterygians: (i) early WGD, (ii) parallel loss of one duplicate in several lineages and (iii) putative neofunctionalization of the same duplicate in <b>percomorphs,</b> which occurred a long time after the WGD...|$|E
40|$|Extract] The Chaetodontidae is {{a diverse}} family of <b>percomorph</b> fishes {{represented}} by 122 extant species, characterised by deep compressed bodies, small protruded mouths and bristle-like teeth (Allen et al., 1998). The family {{is dominated by}} fishes of the genus Chaetodon, which {{are among the most}} conspicuous inhabitants of coral reef environments. Two thirds of all butterflyfishes are found living within coral reef habitats, and many of these species feed mainly, if not exclusively, on reef-building corals (Cole et al., 2008; Cole and Pratchett, Chapter 5). Because of their reliance on corals for food, Chaetodon butterfly fishes are regarded among the most specialised and highly evolved coral reef fishes (e. g., Gosline, 1985). These fishes are inextricably linked to the corals on which they feed (Reese, 1977, 1981), but did the family originate within coral reef environments...|$|R

A corresponding change occurred in the spectral distribution, with proportionately more shorter wavelength photons contributing to the total spectrum during crepuscular periods. Electrophysiological recordings from the optic nerve of rainbow trout subjected to light stimuli of varying polarization percentages show that the animal's threshold for detecting polarized light is between 63 and 72 %.

Here we find that scombrids share a common ancestry with 14 families based on (i) bioinformatic analyses using partial mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences from all <b>percomorphs</b> deposited in GenBank (10, 733 sequences) and (ii) subsequent mitogenomic analysis based on 57 species from those targeted 15 families and 67 outgroup taxa.

Thus, we have charted the cyctoarchitecture of the telencephalon of the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia (Haplochromis) burtoni. We examined tissue sectioned in the transverse plane, and categorized cell groups based on size, shape, and staining intensity of cells, the density and distribution of cells, cell-poor zones, and relationship of cell groups to the anterior commissure and external sulci.

Refining existing primer sets to target a single locus could circumvent this problem. Results Aldolase intron 'G' was amplified from four fish species using previously described primer sets that target several loci indiscriminately. Phylogenetic analyses were used to group these fragments and other full-length aldolase proteins from teleost fishes into orthologous clades and a primer set was designed to target specifically an intron within the aldolase-B locus in acanthopterygian fishes.

They {{have been described}} in all classes of vertebrates and seem to be morphologically and functionally similar. However, early studies had shown that fish and amphibian mast cells were devoid of histamine. In this study, we take {{a fresh look at}} the evolution of histamine and find that the mast cells of fish belonging to the Perciformes order, the largest and most evolutionarily advanced order of teleosts, are armed with histamine. More importantly, histamine is biologically active in these fish where it is able to regulate the inflammatory response by acting on professional phagocytes. In addition, the actions of histamine in these immune cells seem to be mediated through the engagement of H 1 and H 2 receptors, which, together with the H 3 receptor, are well conserved in bony fish. We propose that the storage of histamine in vertebrate mast cells and its use as an inflammatory messenger was established in primitive reptiles (Lepidosauria) ≈ 276 million years ago.

Lutjanids show a great diversity of habitat preferences, based on depth segregation and distribution across reef and associated habitats (e. g. mangroves, seagrass beds, estuaries). In spite of their great ecological and economic importance {{little is known about}} the tempo of evolution in this group. The present study provides the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny to date for lutjanids, including 70 % of extant species and 19 of the 21 currently described genera.

Lutjanids experienced significant radiation during the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene, in contrast to a pattern of Late Oligocene/Miocene radiation observed in many other reef-associated groups. The time-tree allows us to investigate the tempo of diversification, and our results suggest a variation in the rate of speciation during the evolution of the major clade formed by “lutjanins and caesionins”.

Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts, which include most commercially important fish species, several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology, and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes, {{the lack of a}} single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses, which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints, result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems: specifically identifying elopomorphs (eels and tarpons) as the sister lineage of all other teleosts, providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts, and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the "bush {{at the top of the}} tree" that includes <b>percomorphs</b> and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes, we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences, but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, identifying this period as the "Second Age of Fishes. ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCichlid fish of the East African Rift Lakes are {{renowned for}} their {{diversity}} {{and offer a}} unique opportunity to study adaptive changes in the visual system in rapidly evolving species flocks [1, 2]. Since color plays a significant role in mate choice [3 – 6], differences in visual sensitivities could greatly influence and even drive speciation of cichlids. Lake Malawi cichlids inhabiting rock and sand habitats have significantly different cone spectral sensitivities [7, 8]. By combining microspectrophotometry (MSP) of isolated cones, sequencing of opsin genes, and spectral analysis of recombinant pigments, we have established the cone complements of four species of Malawi cichlids. MSP demonstrated that each of these species predominately expresses three cone pigments, although these differ between species to give three spectrally different cone complements. In addition, rare populations of spectrally distinct cones were found. In total, seven spectral classes were identified. This was confirmed by opsin gene sequencing, expression, and in vitro reconstitution. The genes represent the four major classes of cone opsin genes that diverged early in vertebrate evolution [9]. All four species possess a long-wave-sensitive (LWS), three spectrally distinct green-sensitive (RH 2), a blue-sensitive (SWS 2 A), a violet-sensitive (SWS 2 B), and an ultraviolet-sensitive (SWS 1) opsin. However, African cichlids determine their spectral sensitivity by differential expression of primarily only three of the seven available cone opsin genes.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{inference}} {{based on}} evidence from DNA sequences has led to significant strides {{in the development of}} a stable and robustly supported framework for the vertebrate tree of life. To date, the bulk of those advances have relied on sequence data from a small number of genome regions that have proven unable to produce satisfactory answers to consistently recalcitrant phylogenetic questions. Here, we re-examine phylogenetic relationships among early-branching euteleostean fish lineages classically grouped in the Protacanthopterygii using DNA sequence data surrounding ultraconserved elements. We report and examine a dataset of thirty-four OTUs with 17, 957 aligned characters from fifty-three nuclear loci. Phylogenetic analysis is conducted in concatenated, joint gene trees and species tree estimation and summary coalescent frameworks. All analytical frameworks yield supporting evidence for existing hypotheses of relationship for the placement of Lepidogalaxias salamandroides, monophyly of the Stomiatii and the presence of an esociform + salmonid clade. Lepidogalaxias salamandroides and the Esociformes + Salmoniformes are successive sister lineages to all other euteleosts in the majority of analyses. The concatenated and joint gene trees and species tree analysis types produce high support values for this arrangement. However, inter-relationships of Argentiniformes, Stomiatii and Neoteleostei remain uncertain as they varied by analysis type while receiving strong and contradictory indices of support. Topological differences between analysis types are also apparent within the otomorph and the <b>percomorph</b> taxa in the data set. Our results identify concordant areas with strong support for relationships within and between early-branching euteleost lineages but they also reveal limitations in the ability of larger datasets to conclusively resolve other aspects of that phylogeny...|$|R
40|$|Family level {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{analyses of}} cichlid fishes have generally {{suffered from a}} limited number of characters and ⁄or poor taxonomic sampling across one or more major geographic assemblage, and therefore have not provided a robust test of early intrafamilial diversification. Herein we use both nuclear and mitochondrial nucleotide characters and direct optimization to reconstruct a phylogeny for cichlid fishes. Representatives of major cichlid lineages across all geographic assemblages are included, as well as nearly twice the number of characters as any prior family-level study. In a strict consensus of 81 equally most-parsimonious hypotheses, based on the simultaneous analysis of 2222 aligned nucleotide characters from two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, four major subfamilial lineages are recovered with strong support. Etroplinae, endemic to Madagascar (Paretroplus) and southern Asia (Etroplus), is recovered as the sister taxon to the remainder of Cichlidae. Although the South Asian cichlids are monophyletic, the Malagasy plus South Asian lineages are not. The remaining Malagasy lineage, Ptychochrominae, is monophyletic and is recovered as the sister group to a clade comprising the African and Neotropical cichlids. The African (Pseudocrenilabrinae) and Neotropical (Cichlinae) lineages are each monophyletic in this reconstruction. The use of multiple molecular markers, from both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, results in a phylogeny that in general exhibits strong support, notably for early diversification events within Cichlidae. Results further indicate that Labroidei is not monophyletic, and that the sister group to Cichlidae may comprise a large and diverse assemblage of <b>percomorph</b> lineages.

We investigated the molecular evolution of two HoxA paralogous pairs in seven representative percomorph fishes and found elevated rates of evolution in the a-paralogs of the hoxal 3 and h ox a ll genes in one percomorph lineage (Gobiidae) relative to other <b>percomorphs.</b> These elevated rates were driven by an increase in synonymous mutations. Additionally, we found a novel pattern of nested expression of these two paralogs during embryonic development of the posterior intestine of the Bluebanded goby, Lythrypnus dalli, where hoxal 3 a is broadly expressed yet nested between two narrow domains of hoxal l a expression. This nested pattern is consistent with the ???distal phase??? expression pattern that is found in distal regions of fins and limbs, and has recently been implicated in a variety of other body plan features in ray-finned fishes. Finally, this pattern of hoxal la expression is associated with a constriction in the gut of L. dalli, which separates the mid and posterior intestines, a trait not observed in Danio rerio. These data suggest that the elevated substitution rates may be associated with changes in the expression pattern of hoxal l a and hoxal 3 a, and the evolution of a novel intestinal-rectal sphincter in gobiid fishes...|$|E
40|$|Reproduction is {{controlled}} by two pituitary gonadotropin hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study reports the cloning, sequence analysis, and gene expression of gonadotropin (GTH) subunits from the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). The GTH subunits were cloned from a sea bass brain-pituitary cDNA library. The nucleotide sequences of the common alpha, the FSHbeta, and the LHbeta subunit cDNAs were 625, 521, and 591 base pair (bp) long, respectively, encoding for mature peptides of 94, 105, and 115 amino acids (aa), respectively. Sequence analysis showed that sea bass FSHbeta is more similar to higher vertebrate FSHbeta's (35 - 37 %) than to LHbeta's (26 - 30 %), whereas sea bass LHbeta is more similar to LHbeta's (40 - 53 %) than to FSHbeta's (26 - 41 %). Phylogenetic analysis of fish GTH sequences grouped the beta subunits into two groups, FSH and LH, distributed into four classes, corresponding to the accepted divisions of Elopomorphs, Ostariophysis, Salmonids, and <b>Percomorphs.</b> A dot-blot technique was developed to analyze GTH pituitary mRNA levels during the reproductive cycle of male sea bass. From October (initiation of gametogenesis) to February (spermiation), the expression of all three subunits in the pituitary increased in parallel, concomitantly with the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the accumulation of LH protein in the pituitary, all values declining sharply at post-spermiation. This study demonstrates that the pituitary of sea bass contains two gonadotropin hormones and that both gonadotropins are probably involved in the control of gametogenesis, gamete maturation, and spermiation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the main}} {{explanations}} for the stunning diversity of teleost fishes (~ 29, 000 species, {{nearly half of all}} vertebrates) is that a fish-specific whole-genome duplication event (FSGD) in the ancestor to teleosts triggered their subsequent radiation. However, one critical assumption of this hypothesis, that diversification rates in teleosts increased soon after the acquisition of a duplicated genome, has never been tested. Results Here we show that one of three major diversification rate shifts within ray-finned fishes occurred {{at the base of the}} teleost radiation, as predicted by the FSGD hypothesis. We also find evidence for two rate increases that are much younger than the inferred age of the FSGD: one in the common ancestor of most ostariophysan fishes, and a second one in the common ancestor of <b>percomorphs.</b> The biodiversity contained within these two clades accounts for more than 88 % of living fish species. Conclusion Teleosts diversified explosively in their early history and this burst of diversification may have been caused by genome duplication. However, the FSGD itself may be responsible for a little over 10 % of living teleost biodiversity. ~ 88 % of species diversity is derived from two relatively recent radiations of freshwater and marine fishes where genome duplication is not suspected. Genome duplications are a common event on the tree of life and have been implicated in the diversification of major clades like flowering plants, vertebrates, and gnathostomes. However our results suggest that the causes of diversification in large clades are likely to be complex and not easily ascribed to a single event, even a dramatic one such as a whole genome duplication. </p...|$|E
40|$|Single-gene and whole-genome duplications are {{important}} evolutionary mechanisms {{that contribute to}} biological diversification by launching new genetic raw material. For example, the evolution of animal vision is tightly linked {{to the expansion of}} the opsin gene family encoding light-absorbing visual pigments. In teleost fishes, the most species-rich vertebrate group, opsins are particularly diverse and key to the successful colonization of habitats ranging from the bioluminescence-biased but basically dark deep sea to clear mountain streams. In this study, we report a previously unnoticed duplication of the violet-blue short wavelength-sensitive 2 (SWS 2) opsin, which coincides with the radiation of highly diverse <b>percomorph</b> fishes, permitting us to reinterpret the evolution of this gene family. The inspection of close to 100 fish genomes revealed that, triggered by frequent gene conversion between duplicates, the evolutionary history of SWS 2 is rather complex and difficult to predict. Coincidentally, we also report potential cases of gene resurrection in vertebrate opsins, whereby pseudogenized genes were found to convert with their functional paralogs. We then identify multiple novel amino acid substitutions that are likely to have contributed to the adaptive differentiation between SWS 2 copies. Finally, using the dusky dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus, we show that the newly discovered SWS 2 A duplicates can contribute to visual adaptation in two ways: by gaining sensitivities to different wavelengths of light and by being differentially expressed between ontogenetic stages. Thus, our study highlights the importance of comparative approaches in gaining a comprehensive view of the dynamics underlying gene family evolution and ultimately, animal diversification. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Major {{modifications}} to the pharyngeal jaw apparatus are widely regarded as a recurring evolutionary key innovation that has enabled adaptive radiation in many species-rich clades of <b>percomorph</b> fishes. However {{one of the central}} predictions of this hypothesis, that the acquisition of a modified pharyngeal jaw apparatus will be positively correlated with explosive lineage diversification, has never been tested. We applied comparative methods to a new time-calibrated phylogeny of labrid fishes to test whether diversification rates shifted at two scales where major pharyngeal jaw innovations have evolved: across all of Labridae and within the subclade of parrotfishes. Results Diversification patterns within early labrids did not reflect rapid initial radiation. Much of modern labrid diversity stems from two recent rapid diversification events; one within julidine fishes and the other with the origin of the most species-rich clade of reef-associated parrotfishes. A secondary pharyngeal jaw innovation was correlated with rapid diversification within the parrotfishes. However diversification rate shifts within parrotfishes are more strongly correlated with the evolution of extreme dichromatism than with pharyngeal jaw modifications. Conclusion The temporal lag between pharyngeal jaw modifications and changes in diversification rates casts doubt on the key innovation hypothesis as a simple explanation for much of the richness seen in labrids and scarines. Although the possession of a secondarily modified PJA was correlated with increased diversification rates, this pattern is better explained by the evolution of extreme dichromatism (and other social and behavioral characters relating to sexual selection) within Scarus and Chlorurus. The PJA-innovation hypothesis also fails to explain the most dominant aspect of labrid lineage diversification, the radiation of the julidines. We suggest that pharyngeal jaws might have played a more important role in enabling morphological evolution of the feeding apparatus in labrids and scarines rather than in accelerating lineage diversification. </p...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{evolution}} of feeding mechanisms in the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) {{is a compelling}} example of transformation in a musculoskeletal complex involving multiple skeletal elements and numerous muscles that power skull motion. Biomechanical models of jaw force and skull kinetics aid our understanding of these complex systems and enable broad comparison of feeding mechanics across taxa. Mechanical models characterize how muscles move skeletal elements by pulling bones around points of rotation in lever mech-anisms, or by transmitting force through skeletal elements connected in a linkage. Previous work {{has focused on the}} feeding biomechanics of several lineages of fishes, but a broader survey of skull function in the context of quantitative models has not been attempted. This study begins such a survey by examining the diversity of mechanical design of the oral jaws in 35 species of ray-finned fishes with three main objectives: (1) analyze lower jaw lever models in a broad phylogenetic range of taxa, (2) identify the origin and evo-lutionary patterns of change in the linkage systems that power maxillary rotation and upper jaw protrusion, and (3) analyze patterns of change in feeding design in the context of actinopterygian phylogeny. The mandibular lever is present in virtually all actinopterygians, and the diversity in lower jaw closing force transmission capacity, with mechanical advantage ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 68, has important functional con-sequences. A four-bar linkage for maxillary rotation arose in the Amiiformes and persists in various forms in many teleost species. Novel mechanisms for upper jaw protrusion based on this linkage for maxillary rotation have evolved independently at least five times in teleosts. The widespread anterior jaws linkage for jaw protrusion in <b>percomorph</b> fishes arose initially in Zeiformes and subsequently radiated into a wide range of premaxillary protrusion capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of morphological and hodological aspects of the glomerular nucleus in the weakly electric fish Gymnotus sp., and explores the evolutionary and functional implications flowing from this analysis. The glomerular nucleus of Gymnotus shows numerous morphological similarities with the glomerular nucleus of percomorph fish, although cytoarchitectonically simpler. In addition, congruence of the histochemical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) distribution with cytoarchitectonic data suggests that the glomerular nucleus, together with the ventromedial cell group of the medial subdivision of the preglomerular complex (PGm-vmc) rostrally, and the subglomerular nucleus (as identified by Maler et al. [1991] J Chem Neuroanat 4 : 1 - 38) caudally, may form a distinct longitudinally organized glomerular complex. Our results show that an important source of sensory afferents to the glomerular nucleus originates in the pretectal and electrosensorius nuclei. The glomerular nucleus in turn projects to the hypothalamus (inferior lobe and anterior hypothalamus), to the anterior tuberal nucleus, and to the medial region of the preglomerular nucleus (PGm). These data suggest that visual and electrosensory information reach the glomerular nucleus and are relayed to the hypothalamus and, via PGm, to the pallium. Such connections {{are similar to those of}} the glomerular nucleus in <b>percomorphs</b> and the posterior pretectal nucleus in osteoglossomorph, esocids, and salmonids, where they comprise one component of a visual processing pathway. In Gymnotiform fish, however, the pretectal region that projects to the glomerular nucleus is dominated by electrosensory input (visual input is minor), which is consistent with the dominant role of electroreception in these fish.

40|$|Examination of the {{connections}} of the corpus cerebelli in one perciform (Lepomis cyanellus) and one cypriniform teleost (Carassius auratus) reveal that ipsilateral afferent connections in both species arise from an anterior group of nuclei in the diencephalon and mesencephalon, and a posterior group of nuclei in the rhombencephalon. Some nuclei of the anterior group {{and all those}} of the posterior group have in addition a weaker, and the medial octavolateralis nucleus a stronger, contralateral component. The inferior olivary nucleus in both species projects solely contralaterally. Nucleus paracommissuralis, the ventral accessory optic nucleus and nucleus isthmi are minute in Carassius compared to Lepomis. The latter species has in addition a bilateral corpopetal projection (ipsilaterally stronger) from the lateral cuneate nucleus. Efferent fibers in both species reach the contralateral nucleus ruber, oculomotor nucleus, nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, torus semicircularis, ventromedial and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei, optic tectum and superior and inferior reticular formation. An additional weaker ipsilateral terminal field could be observed in all nuclei except in the ventrolateral and ventromedial thalamic nuclei, the dorsal periventricular pretectal nucleus and the optic tectum. Lepomis in addition has a bilateral terminal field in the ventral accessory optic nucleus (contralaterally stronger). In both species, stronger ipsilateral and weaker contralateral terminal fields {{were present in the}} torus Iongitudinalis and the valvula cerebelli. The two patterns of corpopetal connections in Lepomis and Carassius were used as models for perciforms and cypriniforms in the analysis of the existing information in the literature on teleosts. While most discrepancies in the literature on <b>percomorphs</b> and ostariophysines could be interpreted consistently, the available information on mormyrids revealed a very different pattern of corpopetal organization: presence of additional connections (from a division of the nucleus preglomerulosus) and absence of otherwise well-established corpopetal connections in teleosts. In a second step, a phyletic analysis of teleostean corpopetal organization revealed that while teleosts share with all other vertebrates a group of corpopetal connections from the rhombencephalon, they evolved many new, more anteriorly located afferent inputs to the corpus cerebelli. Furthermore, electroreceptive mormyrids in addition evolved newly at least one corpopetal connection and lost many others. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>percomorph</b> order Gobioidei {{comprises}} over 2200 species worldwide distributed that occupy most freshwater, brackish {{and marine}} environments, and show a spectacular variety in morphology, ecology, and behaviour. However, phylogenetic relationships among many gobioid groups still remain poorly understood. Such {{is the case}} of Gobiidae, a rapidly radiating lineage that encompass an unusually high diversity of species (nearly 2000), including the largely endemic European species whose origin and ancestry remain uncertain. The resolution and accuracy of previous molecular phylogenetic studies has been limited due to the use of only a few (generally mitochondrial) molecular markers and/or the absence of representatives of several key lineages. Our study (built on Agorreta et al. 2013) is the first to include multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes for nearly 300 terminal taxa representing the vast diversity of gobioid lineages. We have used this information to reconstruct a robust phylogeny of Gobioidei, and we are now investigating the historical biogeography and diversification times of European gobies with a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny. Robustness of the inferred phylogenetic trees is significantly higher than that of previous studies, hence providing the most compelling molecular phylogenetic hypotheses for Gobioidei thus far. The family Eleotrididae branches off the gobioid tree after the Rhyacichthyidae + Odontobutidae clade followed by the Butidae as the sister-group of the Gobiidae. Several monophyletic groups are identified within the two major Gobiidae subclades, the gobionelline-like and the gobiine-like gobiids. The European gobies cluster in three distinct lineages (Pomatoschistus-, Aphia-, and Gobius-lineages), each with different affinities with gobiids from the Indo-Pacific and perhaps the New World. Our ongoing more-detailed study on European gobies will reveal whether their origin is related to vicariant events linked to the closure of the Paratethys in the Early-Middle Miocene or to immigration to the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Indo-Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cichlid fishes have {{undergone}} rapid, expansive evolutionary radiations that are {{manifested in the}} diversification of their trophic morphologies, tooth patterning and coloration. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the cichlids' unique patterns of evolution requires a thorough examination of genes that pattern the neural crest, from which these diverse phenotypes are derived. Among those genes, the homeobox-containing Dlx gene family {{is of particular interest}} since it is involved in the patterning of the brain, jaws and teeth. Results In this study, we characterized the dlx genes of an African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, to provide a baseline to later allow cross-species comparison within Cichlidae. We identified seven dlx paralogs (dlx 1 a, - 2 a, - 4 a, - 3 b, - 4 b, - 5 a and - 6 a), whose orthologies were validated with molecular phylogenetic trees. The intergenic regions of three dlx gene clusters (dlx 1 a- 2 a, dlx 3 b- 4 b, and dlx 5 a- 6 a) were amplified with long PCR. Intensive cross-species comparison revealed a number of conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) that are shared with other <b>percomorph</b> fishes. This analysis highlighted additional lineage-specific gains/losses of CNEs in different teleost fish lineages and a novel CNE that had previously not been identified. Our gene expression analyses revealed overlapping but distinct expression of dlx orthologs in the developing brain and pharyngeal arches. Notably, four of the seven A. burtoni dlx genes, dlx 2 a, dlx 3 b, dlx 4 a and dlx 5 a, were expressed in the developing pharyngeal teeth. Conclusion This comparative study of the dlx genes of A. burtoni has deepened our knowledge of the diversity of the Dlx gene family, in terms of gene repertoire, expression patterns and non-coding elements. We have identified possible cichlid lineage-specific changes, including losses of a subset of dlx expression domains in the pharyngeal teeth, which will be the targets of future functional studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pectoral fins {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{features}} of locomotor design in ray-finned fishes and exhibit a well-documented phylogenetic transition from basal to derived clades. In <b>percomorph</b> fishes, the pectoral fins are often used to generate propulsive force via oscillatory movements, and pectoral fin propulsion in this relatively derived clade has been analyzed extensively. However, in the plesiomorphic pectoral fin condition, exemplified by sturgeon, pectoral fins extend laterally from the body in a generally horizontal orientation, have been assumed to generate lift to balance lift forces and moments produced by the heterocercal tail, and are not oscillated to generate propulsive force. The proposal that pectoral fins in fishes such as sturgeon generate lift during horizontal locomotion has never been tested experimentally in freely swimming fishes. In this paper, we examine the function of pectoral fins in sturgeon swimming at speeds from 0. 5 – 3. 0 Ls- 1, where L is total body length. Sturgeon were studied during steady horizontal locomotion as well as while sinking and rising in the water column. Pectoral fin function was quantified using three-dimensional kinematics to measure the orientation of the fin surface, digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was used to describe flow {{in the wake of the}} fin and to estimate force exerted on the water, and electromyography was used to assess pectoral fin muscle function. Sturgeon (size range 25 – 32 cm total length) swam horizontally using continuous undulations of the body with a positive body angle that decreased from a mean of 20 ° at 0. 5 Ls- 1 to 0 ° at 3. 0 Ls- 1. Both the angle of the body and the pectoral fin surface angle changed significantly when sturgeon moved vertically in the water column. Three-dimensional kinematic analysis showed that during steady horizontal swimming the pectoral fins are oriented with a negative angle of attack predicted to generate no significant lift. This result was confirmed by DPIV analysis of the pectoral fin wake, which only revealed fin vortices, and hence force generation, during maneuvering. The orientation of the pectoral fins estimated by a two-dimensional analysis alone is greatly in error and may have contributed to previous suggestions that the pectoral fins are oriented to generate lift. Combined electromyographic and kinematic data showed that the posterior half of the pectoral fin is actively moved as a flap to reorient the head and body to initiate rising and sinking movements. A new force balance for swimming sturgeon is proposed for steady swimming and vertical maneuvering. During steady locomotion, the pectoral fins generate no lift and the positive body angle to the flow is used both to generate lift and to balance moments around the center of mass. To initiate rising or sinking, the posterior portion of the pectoral fins is actively moved ventrally or dorsally, respectively, initiating a starting vortex that, in turn, induces a pitching moment reorienting the body in the flow. Adjustments to body angle initiated by the pectoral fins serve as the primary means by which moments are balanced...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, genetic data {{considerably}} improved {{our understanding of the}} phylogenetic history and diversity of species, but the ultimate drivers of speciation remain poorly understood. However, it became clear that evolutionary divergence has a strong ecological component. How ecological factors contribute to evolutionary divergence at historical or contemporary time scales is therefore a key question in evolutionary biology. Parasites represent a strong ecological pressure, which is predominant in all animals. Since parasites influence survival and reproduction, they can also influence adaptation, reproductive isolation and ultimately perhaps even speciation of their host. Whether or not parasites induce local immunogenetic adaptation and hence divergence of their host across landscape, depends on how parasite communities respond to environmental and biogeographic variation, and the strength of host-parasite co-evolution. In this doctoral thesis, we address questions related to parasite infection patterns and parasite driven adaptation in a cichlid radiation in Lake Tanganyika. The African Great Lake cichlids are famous because of their astonishing species-richness, and represent {{one of the most powerful}} model systems to study the genetic basis of diversification. Especially the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika are genetically and morphologically very diverse. A diversity that yet has to be explained. The processes, which lead to the emergence of so many species in such an adaptive radiation, are probably manifold and due to an interaction of several extrinsic (e. g. ecological opportunities) and intrinsic factors (e. g. key innovations or genetic propensity of a taxon to diversify). Interestingly, adaptive divergence causing shifts in diet, habitat use or behaviour might directly relate to shifts in parasite infection. We chose three host species for our studies. All of them inhabit rocky outcrops in the littoral zone of Lake Tanganyika. Whereas Tropheus moorii and Variabilichromis moorii are stenotopic and philopatric species, Simochromis diagramma is more eurytopic and may disperse across various habitats. We found this dispersal behaviour to be reflected in genetic connectivity among populations. Furthermore, screening of sympatric populations of the three species for infection with metazoan ecto- and endoparasites revealed that populations face contrasting parasite communities. In S. diagramma, contrasts are weaker, probably as a consequence of homogenization of parasite communities by host dispersal. But host dispersal is only one of many factors determining the spatial structure of parasite communities. Despite these recent advances in our understanding of parasite community structure in Lake Tanganyika, we still lack information on the distribution of intermediate hosts or how parasite communities respond to environmental variation. We observed that ecological differentiation by infection with contrasting parasite communities is paralleled by adaptive immunogenetic divergence among host populations at genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in all three host species. MHC genes play a pivotal role in the recognition of antigens and are the most polymorphic genes known in jawed vertebrates. In cichlids MHC class IIB genes occur as two clusters (a and b) on two different chromosomes. We found that the loci of the more diverse of these clusters probably originated from a single ancestral gene through a birth and death process of gene evolution after the divergence of cichlids from other <b>percomorph</b> lineages. Some of these loci show elevated levels of polymorphism, whereas others are less variable, indicating the existence of several MHC class IIB b loci with non-classical functions. Cichlid individuals vary in respect to the number of loci within their MHC class IIB b cluster. In our studies we found that T. moorii individuals with an intermediate number of MHC loci can deal more efficiently with their fat reserves than those with few or too many loci. The reason might be that they suffer less from parasite infection or the negative consequences of T-cell selection by a high MHC diversity. At the host species level, we observed parallel parasite infection patterns and parallel immunogenetic adaptation among sympatric populations of T. moorii and S. diagramma. Shared infection patterns might be the ultimate reason for frequent MHC trans-species polymorphism among African cichlids. But detailed information on more species will be necessary to reveal general patterns in multi-host-multi-parasite infection dynamics and how this translates to immunogenetic adaptation. The water level of Lake Tanganyika fluctuates at geological time scales. Previous research suggested that populations of the rock-dwelling cichlids T. moorii and V. moorii along the Zambian shore-line of Lake Tanganyika diverge during isolation at lake level high stands and face increased levels of gene flow at low stands. In this thesis we propose that ecological divergence might be caused by contrasting parasite communities. We speculate that this ecological differentiation significantly contributed to the morphological and genetic diversity found in these two cichlid species today. nrpages: 203 status: publishe...|$|R
