50|$|This <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> {{system was}} first {{introduced}} by the United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in the Pentagon in the 1960s. McNamara allegedly wanted to control the many costly weapons development programmes that were plagued by ever-increasing costs and delays. He called this new system the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS). The system was taught at the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University but it evoked little interest except from critics.|$|E
50|$|This new {{approach}} introduced an unprecedented transparency into management operations {{together with a}} concomitant precise pinpointing of managers' responsibilities, and so was widely resisted throughout the entire public sector. However, in the eighties, the UN Inspectorate General picked up the idea and recommended that the United Nations use it to improve its performance. A few institutions tried half-heartedly but only the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) went about it seriously and introduced a complete <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> system that is still in place today.|$|E
50|$|However, {{over the}} years, strong {{opposition}} by managers {{and lack of}} interest by top management as well as member States have taken {{the sting out of}} the system and reduced its transparency. A few years later, the Government of New Zealand was the first to introduce it with great success: within a few years it had solved an intractable stagflation problem. More recently, the United Kingdom government discovered it and now, one government after another is following suit. The need to improve public sector and government performance has worked wonders for <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Programme</b> <b>budgeting,</b> {{developed}} by U.S. president Lyndon Johnson, is the budgeting system that, contrary to conventional budgeting, describes {{and gives the}} detailed costs of every activity or programme {{that is to be}} carried out with a given budget. For example, Expected results in a proposed programme are described fully, along with its necessary resource, raw materials, equipment, and staff costs. The sum of all activities or programmes constitute the Programme Budget. Thus, when looking at a Programme Budget, one can easily find out what precisely will be carried out, at what cost and with what expected results in considerable detail.|$|E

This has involved working directly with decision makers in several contexts at various levels of health care systems in the UK, Canada and New Zealand, working largely with Craig Mitton at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, using mainly qualitative research networks to document experiences. The main objective has been to adapt economics to complex management processes, so enhancing its uptake in decision-making and the framework has been used in several hundred health organisations globally.

40|$|Objectives To {{explore the}} views of dental {{decision-makers}} in Primary Care Organisations {{with regard to the}} management of NHS dental services, and to gauge participants' awareness of economics-based approaches including <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis, with which to potentially structure commissioning decisions. Methods Recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 NHS dental decision-makers (mixed clinical and finance backgrounds) predominantly across Primary Care Trusts in England. Data were analysed using qualitative methods and the constant comparative approach. Results Participants were generally involved with contracting rather than commissioning new dental services at the time of interview. It was unclear how oral health needs assessments would guide future resource shifts and how commissioners would ensure the efficient use of finite resources. Whilst many participants thought that economic approaches would assist their commissioning decisions, few participants were aware of <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis as an alternative economics-based approach. Conclusions An assessment {{of the extent to which}} finite resources actually maximise the oral health of local populations is timely. Pragmatic economic approaches such as <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis may offer a framework to guide decision-makers through commissioning and the stages which lie beyond oral health needs assessments.

However, the organisation of care for many people is still divided across several agencies in the public and independent sectors.

40|$|Reorienting <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and {{marginal}} analysis (PBMA) towards disinvestment Duncan Mortimer Background: Remarkable {{progress has been}} made over the past 40 years in developing rational, evidence-based mechanisms for the allocation of health resources. Much of this progress has centred on mechanisms for commissioning new medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The attention of fund-managers and policy-makers is only now turning towards development of mechanisms for decommissioning, disinvesting or redeploying resources from currently funded interventions. While <b>Programme</b> <b>Budgeting</b> and Marginal Analysis would seem well-suited to this purpose, past applications include both successes and failures in achieving disinvestment and resource release. Discussion: Drawing on recent successes/failures in achieving disinvestment and resource release via PBMA, this paper identifies four barriers/enablers to disinvestment via PBMA: (i) specification of the budget constraint, (ii) scope of the programme budget, (iii) composition and role of the advisory group, and (iv) incentives for/against contributing to a ‘shift list ’ of options for disinvestment and resource release.

40|$|English <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> {{data have}} yielded major new {{insights}} into the link between health care spending and health outcomes. This paper updates two recent studies that have used <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> data for 295 Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England to examine the link between spending and outcomes for several programmes of care. We use the same economic model employed in the two previous studies. It focuses on a decision maker who must allocate a fixed budget across programmes of care so as to maximize social welfare given a health production function for each programme. Two equations – a health outcome equation and an expenditure equation – are estimated for each programme (data permitting). The two previous studies employed expenditure data for 2004 / 05 and 2005 / 06 for 295 health authorities and found that in several care programmes – cancer, circulation problems, respiratory problems, gastro-intestinal problems, trauma burns and injury, and diabetes – expenditure had the anticipated negative effect on the mortality rate. Each health outcome equation was used to estimate the marginal cost of a life year saved. In 2006 / 07 the number of PCTs in England was reduced to 152, largely through a series of mergers. In addition, several changes were made to the methods employed to construct the <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> data. This paper employs updated budgeting and mortality data for the new 152 PCTs to re-estimate health production and expenditure functions, and also presents updated estimates of the marginal cost of a life year saved in each programme. Although there are some differences, the results obtained are broadly similar to those presented in our two previous studies. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{acceptability}} of <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis (PBMA) {{as a tool for}} priority setting in the Indigenous health sector. Methods The study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. A survey of key decision makers in Indigenous health in Victoria was conducted to assess the acceptability of PBMA as a potential tool for priority setting. Respondents comprised 24 bureaucrats from the Victorian Department of Human Services (DHS) and 26 senior executives from the aboriginal community controlled health sector (ACCHS) in Victoria. The survey instrument included both closed-ended and open-ended questions and was administered face-to-face by a trained researcher in 2007 – 2008. Closed-ended questions were analysed using descriptive statistics, and content analysis was used for the open-ended ones. Results The PBMA was well received as having the potential to improve priority setting processes in Indigenous health. Sixty-nine percent of the DHS respondents felt that PBMA was acceptable as a routine decision-making tool, and nearly 80 % of ACCHS respondents thought that PBMA was intuitively appealing and would most probably be an acceptable priority setting approach in their organisations. The challenges of using PBMA were related to resource constraints and data intensity. Conclusion <b>Programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis is potentially acceptable within the ACCHS and was perceived as useful in terms of assisting the decision maker to maximise health outcomes, but data systems need to be re-oriented to address its significant data needs. Implication Proper guidelines need to be developed to facilitate PBMA application within the Indigenous-controlled community health sector...|$|E
