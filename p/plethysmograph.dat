2500|$|A third line of {{research}} has examined sexual arousal patterns and their relation to sexual orientation in men and women. This {{research has focused on}} both genital and self-reported sexual arousal measures. For example, Bailey's lab showed that men's genital sexual arousal patterns closely tracked their sexual orientations, but women's did not. In 2005 this research produced a study which questioned whether male bisexuality exists in the way that it is sometimes described; the study was based on results of penile <b>plethysmograph</b> testing. The testing found that of men who identified themselves as bisexual, 75% were only aroused genitally by homosexual imagery, and 25% were only aroused genitally by heterosexual imagery. They concluded: [...] "Male bisexuality appears primarily to represent a style of interpreting or reporting sexual arousal rather than a distinct pattern of genital sexual arousal." [...] The study received wide attention after a New York Times piece on the study. A 2011 study using similar methodology filtered participants more stringently, requiring at least two sexual partners of each sex and at least one romantic relationship lasting three months or longer; this study finds both genital and subjective arousal, though it is not clear which arousal pattern is more prevalent in the modern bisexual community.|$|E

50|$|The {{principles}} of plethysmography were first {{applied to the}} measurement of the body volume and composition of infants in the early 1900s, {{but it was not}} until the 1960s that relatively stable measurements were achieved. However, these systems required that ambient conditions be maintained constant. Applications in humans have been limited, in part by technical difficulties in adjusting for irregularities in temperature and humidity of the air next to the skin and the air.

Functional residual capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity. The total lung capacity depends on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres. Females {{tend to have a}} 20–25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity, and capacity can be increased by physical training as much as 40%.|$|R

50|$|Penile {{plethysmography}} (PPG) or phallometry is {{measurement of}} bloodflow to the penis, typically {{used as a}} proxy for measurement of sexual arousal.

Corpora cavernosa nerve penile <b>plethysmographs</b> measure changes in response to inter-operative electric stimulation during surgery.

50|$|A 2009 {{research}} paper by Ray Blanchard and colleagues indicated that, based on penile <b>plethysmographs,</b> sex offenders could be grouped {{according to the}} sexual maturity of individuals they found most attractive (because ages are not a specific indication of adolescent sexual development, Blanchard used stimuli with a Tanner scale rating of 1 on essentially all measures to evaluate hebephilic offenders while adult control stimuli all had a Tanner rating of 5). Blanchard noted that the most common age of victims for sexual offenders was 14 years, and suggested there were qualitative differences between offenders who preferred pubertal sex-objects and those with a prepubertal preference. The paper concluded that the DSM-5 could better account for those data if it split the DSM-IV-TR's existing criteria for pedophilia, which focuses on sexual attraction to prepubescent children, but sets the age range at generally 13 or younger.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare exercise performance between patients with COPD who visited and did not visit an emergency department in the last year; we also aimed to investigate the correlation between frequency of emergency visits and exercise performance. Methods: We recorded the number of emergency department visits of 206 COPD patients.

Results: We had one hundred twenty seven participants visited an emergency department at least once in the last year. Exercise performance, dyspnea, pulmonary functions, and oxygenation were significantly poorer in those patients (p< 0. 05). The number of emergency department visits was correlated with exercise performance, dyspnea, oxygenation, forced expiratory volume in one second forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Exercise performance was poor and negatively related to the frequency of emergency department visits in COPD patients.

40|$|AUTHOR'S YNOPSIS. Experiments {{were carried}} out to stucjY {{the effect of a}} change in posture on some rasodilator responses. Reactire {{hyperaemia}}, post-exercise hyperaemia, and local heat hyperaemia in the forearm were investigated with the subject lying and standing. In each case the hyperaemia was reduced on standing, though this reduction could be abolished by the intra-arterial infusion of a sympa-thetic adrenergic antagonist. The intravenous infusion of adrenaline into the recumbent subject causes a vasodilatation of the forearm blood vessels (Allen, Barcroft, and Ed-holm, 1946). If the infusion is given t o the stand-ing subject, the sustained vasodilatation does not occur (Brick, Glover, Hutchison, and Roddie, 1967). Brick et al. (1967) suggested that the in-crease in vasomotor tone which occurs on standing, is responsible for the alteration in the response t o adrenaline. The present experiments were designed t o see if vasodilatation in the forearm caused by some other stimuli was affected by a similar change in posture. Vasodilatation was produced by occluding the forearm circulation for 5 min (reactive hyperaemia), by rhythmic contractions of the forearm muscles (exercise hyperaemia), or by the local application of heat. Methods In the first series, observations were made on seven healthy young adults. They rested, normally clothed, for at least 30 min before any measurements were taken. Room temperature was between 21 °C and 25 "C, but varied by only f 1 °C in any experiment.

40|$|Tidal volume can be {{measured}} by recording the chang- in impedance of the thorax caused by breathing. Thus breathing can be recorded quantitatively from two electrodes placed {{on each side of}} the chest. The method is especially useful in breathless patients and studies of breathing patterns during sleep. A patient with a long circulation time due to left ventricular failure had periodic breathing both awake and asleep. When asleep the respiratory minute volume was considerably reduced, and there were long apnoeic periods. This was associated with a rise in mean right atrial pressure until the patient woke with an attack of paroxysmal dyspnoea. The right atrial pressure dropped to normal when the patient breathed more regularly. Anoxia probably caused the rise in right atrial pressure. Periodic breathing disappeared when the circulation time shortened after treatment of the heart failure. The possible mechanism of these changes is discussed. Until recently it has been difficult to study breathing quantitatively without influencing its pattern by the method of recording. Face masks, mouthpieces, and constricting <b>plethysmographs</b> are all likely to alter the way a patient breathes, and are tolerated with difficulty by breathless patients. The impedance pneumograph (Pallett and Scopes, 1965) measures breathing quantitatively by recording the change in thoracic impedance to a high frequency current using surface electrodes. The method does not disturb the patient. Quantita-tive recordings of breathing can be made, even in breathless patients, both awake and asleep. This method of recording breathing was used in a patient with left ventricular failure who com-plained of attacks of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. The right atrial pressure was recorded before and during an attack of dyspnoea, in order to establish the nature of the attack and so find possible means of prevention. As the patient's cardiac condition improved, there were changes in the pattern of breathing which were recorded. METHOD...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} an increase in blood flow to extremities involved by Paget's disease of bone. It has been assumed {{that the increase in}} blood flow is through bone, but warmth of skin overlying Pagetic bone suggests that cutaneous blood flow might be increased. In three patients with Paget's disease involving one extremity, we compared blood flow in "Pagetic" extremities with flow in the contralateral normal extremities. Resting blood flow (measured with water <b>plethysmographs)</b> was 14. 2 plus or minus 2. 9 (meanplus or minusSE) ml/min times 100 ml extremity in the Pagetic limbs. The contribution of cutaneous flow to the increase in extremity blood flow was evaluated with epinephrine iontophoresis, which suppresses flow to skin but not to underlying tissue. Epinephrine iontophoresis of the Pagetic extremities decreased blood flow from 14. 2 plus or minus 2. 9 to 3. 6 plus or minus 1. 5 ml/min. Local heating (which increases cutaneous flow only) failed to increase blood flow in the Pagetic extremities as much {{as it did in the}} normal extremities. This suggests that cutaneous vessels in the Pagetic extremities were already dilated. During heating, blood flow in the normal extremities was similar to resting flow in the Pagetic extremities; this indicates that increases in cutaneous flow could account for most of the increase in total blood flow in the Pagetic extremities. Adrenergic control of blood flow to the Pagetic extremities was compared with that of the normal extremities. Vasoconstrictor responses to reflex stimuli in the Pagetic extremities were reduced; when vasoconstriction occurred it was gradual and sustained after termination of the stimuli, which suggests an exaggerated humoral response but reduced neural response to the stimuli. Intravenous epinephrine produced vasoconstriction in the Pagetic extremities and vasodilatation in the normal extremities. In summary, responses to epinephrine iontophoresis and heating suggest that the increase in blood flow in Pagetic extremities is primarily the result of cutaneous vasodilatation...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{skin and}} muscle {{vascular}} beds in baroreceptor-mediated alterations of peripheral vascular resistance was evaluated in six normal subjects in whom the skin circulation in one forearm was temporarily suppressed by epinephrine iontophoresis. Baroreceptor activity was enhanced by application of negative pressure to the neck (neck suction) and inhibited by application of lower body negative pressure. Forearm blood flow was measured simultaneously in both arms with strain gauge <b>plethysmographs.</b> Since blood flow in the treated arm consisted entirely of muscle flow, skin flow was calculated from the difference between total forearm flow in the intact arm and muscle flow in the treated arm. Vascular resistances were calculated as the ratio of mean arterial pressure to the blood flow of each vascular bed. During neck suction, mean arterial pressure decreased {{from an average of}} 89 to 75 mm of Hg (P < 0. 005), heart rate decreased from an average of 60 to 55 beats/min (P < 0. 005), and total skin and muscle flows remained essentially unchanged. Cutaneous vascular resistance decreased from an average of 75 to 49 mm of Hg/ml per 100 g per min (P < 0. 05), muscle vascular resistance from 68 to 51 (P < 0. 005), and total forearm vascular resistance from 36 to 24 (P < 0. 025). During lower body negative pressure, heart rate increased from an average of 59 to 69 beats/min (P < 0. 005), mean arterial pressure did not change significantly, and significant decreases occurred in forearm blood flow from 5. 4 to 2. 7 ml/ 100 g per min, in skin blood flow from 3. 1 to 1. 4, and in muscle blood flow from 2. 3 to 1. 3. Cutaneous vascular resistance increased from an average of 47 to 110 mm of Hg/ml per 100 g per min (P < 0. 05), muscle vascular resistance from 43 to 72 (P < 0. 005), and total forearm vascular resistance from 20 to 38 (P < 0. 001). These results demonstrate that both the skin and muscle resistance vessels participate in reflex changes initiated by alterations in baroreceptor activity...|$|R
