5|$|Keto{{acidosis}} is {{not always}} the result of diabetes. It may also result from alcohol excess and from starvation; in both states the glucose level is normal or low. Metabolic acidosis may occur in people with diabetes for other reasons, such as poisoning with ethylene glycol or <b>paraldehyde.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1939 she was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and refused surgery, seeking alternative treatments. The following year, World War II separated her from Barney; she fled Paris for England while Barney went to Italy with Brooks. She died in 1941 from causes that have never been fully explained, possibly a <b>paraldehyde</b> overdose.|$|E

5000|$|This region {{produces}} mainly sweet dessert wines using similar {{techniques to}} those used {{for the production of}} sherry, that is, by crianza bajo velo de flor (which involves allowing a [...] "veil" [...] of flor yeast to form {{on the surface of the}} must in the casks) and por el sistema de criaderas y soleras (which refers to the process of aging the wine in soleras). Apart from forming a barrier between the wine and the air, the flor also cause certain chemical phenomena in the wine which affect the taste: they consume glycerine (thus conferring a typically dry character to the wine), they significantly reduce the volatile acidity level of the wine, and they produce great quantities of <b>paraldehydes</b> and acetaldehydes which are responsible for the almond notes of the wines.|$|R
25|$|The cooxidation {{technique}} uses {{an auxiliary}} substance which is simultaneously oxidized to hydrogen peroxide {{which increases the}} activity of the oxidation catalyst. Auxiliaries include: acetaldehyde (Toray process, Japan), <b>paraldehyde</b> (Eastman, USA), and methyl ethyl ketone.|$|E
25|$|TAA {{produces}} euphoria, sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects {{similar to}} ethanol through ingestion or inhalation. It {{is active in}} doses of 2,000–4,000mg, making it 20 times more potent than ethanol. Its hypnotic potency is between chloral hydrate and <b>paraldehyde</b> and between benzodiazepines and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Very limited {{evidence}} indicates that topiramate or pregabalin {{may be useful in}} the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Limited evidence supports the use of gabapentin or carbamazepine for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however, gabapentin {{does not appear to be}} effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting. A 2010 Cochrane review similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported. <b>Paraldehyde</b> combined with chloral hydrate showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and carbamazepine may have advantages for certain symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Nick Adams {{has been cited}} in {{articles}} and books about Hollywood's unsolved mysteries along with speculation by a few of Adams' acquaintances he was murdered (according to author David Kulczyk, Adams was apparently planning to write a tell-all book revealing many sexual secrets of Hollywood names) and claims no trace of <b>paraldehyde</b> (a liquid sedative often given to alcoholics {{at the time and}} one of two drugs attributed to his death) was ever found in his home. However, Adams' brother Andrew had become a medical doctor and prescribed the sedative to him. Moreover, a story in the Los Angeles Times reported stoppered bottles with prescription labels were found in the medicine cabinet near the upstairs bedroom where Adams' body was discovered. Through the years, Adams' children offered speculation ranging from murder to accidental death, the latter perhaps caused by Roeder while trying to calm the actor's nerves with an unintentionally lethal combination of alcohol and prescription drugs (although the autopsy found no alcohol in Adams' blood). Actor Robert Conrad, Adams' best friend, has consistently maintained the death was accidental.|$|E
500|$|Like Vivien, Wilde seemed bent on self-destruction. [...] She drank heavily, was {{addicted}} to heroin, and attempted suicide several times. [...] Barney financed Drug detoxifications, which were never effective; she emerged from one nursing-home stay with a new dependency on the sleeping draught <b>paraldehyde,</b> then available over-the-counter.|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Waugh sailed on the SS Staffordshire, {{bound for}} Ceylon. He hoped on the voyage {{to find the}} peace that would enable him to finish his stalled book. On board, his strange {{behaviour}} became an increasing concern to his fellow-passengers, and the letters which {{he wrote to his}} wife Laura from the ship alarmed her—Waugh appeared to be {{in the grip of a}} persecution mania in which he was beset by threatening, malevolent voices. He left the ship at Alexandria and flew on to Ceylon, but the voices continued to harass him. He wrote to Laura: [...] "Everything I say or think or read is read aloud by the group of psychologists whom I met in the ship... the artful creatures can communicate from many hundreds of miles away". Laura arranged for her friend Jack Donaldson to fly out with her to Colombo to bring Waugh home, but before they could do so Waugh returned to London of his own volition. There he was persuaded by his friend, the Jesuit priest Philip Caraman, to accept treatment from Eric Strauss, the head of psychiatry at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Strauss quickly diagnosed that Waugh's delusions arose from poisoning by his sleeping drugs, and substituted <b>paraldehyde</b> for chloral. The hallucinations disappeared immediately, and Waugh recovered his senses.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the autopsy}} Dr. Thomas Noguchi found enough <b>paraldehyde,</b> {{sedatives}} {{and other drugs}} in the body [...] "to cause instant unconsciousness." [...] The death certificate lists [...] "paraldehyde and promazine intoxication" [...] as the immediate cause of death along with the notation [...] "accident; suicide; undetermined". During the 1960s, drug interaction warnings were not so prominent as they later would be, and the American Medical Association has subsequently warned {{these two types of}} drugs should never be taken together.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{molecules}} of acetaldehyde condense to form [...] "paraldehyde," [...] a cyclic trimer containing C-O single bonds. Similarly condensation of four {{molecules of}} acetaldehyde give the cyclic molecule metaldehyde. [...] <b>Paraldehyde</b> {{can be produced}} in good yields, using a sulfuric acid catalyst. [...] Metaldehyde is only obtained in a few percent yield and with cooling, often using HBr rather than H2SO4 as the catalyst. [...] At -40°C {{in the presence of}} acid catalysts, polyacetaldehyde is produced.|$|E
2500|$|The M*A*S*H (TV series) episode [...] "Bottoms Up" [...] (Season 9, Episode 15) {{featured}} a side {{story about a}} Nurse (Cpt. Helen Whitfield) who {{was found to be}} drinking heavily off-duty. By the culmination of the episode, after a confrontation by Maj. Margaret Houlihan, the character swears off her alcoholism and presumably quits immediately. At mealtime, an unspecified time later, Whitfield becomes hysterical upon being served food in the Mess tent, claiming that there are things crawling onto her from it. The characters of Margaret and Col. Sherman Potter, subdue her. Potter, having recognized the symptoms of Delirium Tremens (which he abbreviates [...] "D.T."), orders 5ml of <b>Paraldehyde</b> from a witnessing nurse.|$|E
2500|$|Colonel Smith {{was taken}} to Tokyo Army Hospital, but died there from loss of blood at 6am the {{following}} morning. Dorothy Smith {{was held in the}} isolation ward of the 8167th Station Hospital for observation. Major General William E. Shambora, the Surgeon General of the Far East Command, ordered a psychiatric evaluation. In December 1952, an [...] Army Medical Board declared her fit to stand trial. A military court martial was convened in Tokyo under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A nine-member court was convened in January 1953, headed by Major General Joseph P. Sullivan. Its members, all military officers, included a Women's Army Corps lieutenant colonel. Dorothy Smith's defense lawyer, Lieutenant Colonel Howard S. Levie, initially argued that the court had no legal jurisdiction over the wife of an Army officer. When this was rejected by the court, he argued that she was not guilty due to temporary insanity. At the time of the incident, Dorothy Smith had been taking barbiturates and <b>paraldehyde.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paraldehyde</b> {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1835 by the German chemist Justus Liebig; its empirical formula was determined in 1838 by Liebig's student [...] Hermann Fehling. [...] <b>Paraldehyde</b> was first synthesized in 1848 by the German chemist Valentin Hermann Weidenbusch (1821-1893), another student of Liebig; he obtained <b>paraldehyde</b> by treating acetaldehyde with acid (either sulfuric or nitric acid).

50|$|<b>Paraldehyde</b> is the {{cyclic trimer}} of {{acetaldehyde}} molecules. Formally, it is a derivative of 1,3,5-trioxane. The corresponding tetramer is metaldehyde. A colourless liquid, it is sparingly {{soluble in water}} and highly soluble in ethanol. <b>Paraldehyde</b> slowly oxidizes in air, turning brown and producing an odour of acetic acid. It quickly reacts with most plastics and rubber.|$|E

50|$|Today, <b>paraldehyde</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used to treat}} status epilepticus. Unlike diazepam and other benzodiazepines, it does not suppress breathing at therapeutic doses and so is safer when no resuscitation facilities exist or when the patient's breathing is already compromised. This makes it a useful emergency medication for parents and other caretakers of children with epilepsy. Since the dose margin between the anticonvulsant and hypnotic effect is small, <b>paraldehyde</b> treatment usually results in sleep.|$|E
