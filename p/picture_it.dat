5|$|The Silence of the Lambs, a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The Silence of the Lambs earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best <b>Picture.</b> <b>It</b> {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay.

5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings the picture to school and gives a copy of it to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other students for a copy of the <b>picture.</b> <b>It</b> is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy of the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E
5|$|The Wrath of Khan {{opened on}} June 4, 1982 in 1,621 theaters in the United States. It made $14,347,221 in its opening weekend, {{at the time}} the largest opening weekend gross in history. It went on to earn $78,912,963 in the US, {{becoming}} the sixth highest-grossing film of 1982. It made $97,000,000 worldwide. Although the total gross of The Wrath of Khan was less than that of The Motion <b>Picture,</b> <b>it</b> was more profitable due to its lower production cost. The film's novelization, written by Vonda N. McIntyre, stayed on the New York Times paperback bestsellers list for more than three weeks. Unlike the previous film, Wrath of Khan was not promoted with a toy line, although Playmates Toys created Khan and Saavik figures in the 1990s, and in 2007 Art Asylum crafted a full series of action figures to mark the film's 25th anniversary. In 2009 IDW Publishing released a comic adaptation of the film, and Film Score Monthly released an expanded score.|$|E

25|$|It is {{one thing}} to worship a <b>picture,</b> <b>it</b> is another by means of {{pictures}} to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant see what they ought to follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.|$|E

25|$|That the Drillers {{inflated}} their announced attendance {{came as no}} surprise, as it is {{a common}} practice in pro sports, but part way through the season {{the degree to which the}} Drillers did became public and the numbers did not paint a rosy <b>picture.</b> <b>It</b> was exposed that while the club was announcing attendance in the 5,800 range, when the actual was only ~4,200. Coupled with even the announced figures falling far short of the previously stated 8,000 break even point, there were questions abound about how long Wojcicki could continue bankrolling the team.|$|E

25|$|Despite her {{significant}} art patronage {{which included}} a number of portraits– no other person of her time was so often portrayed– {{there are very few}} surviving identified portraits of Isabella. These few identifications are known as inhomogeneous (i.e. differing eye and hair colours as well as divergent eyebrows in both Titian portraits) and there are no images of her between the ages of 26 and 54 (see <b>picture).</b> <b>It</b> is known that the elderly Isabella preferred idealized paintings and even waived sitting as a model. However it could be assumed that she still insisted on seeing her personal characteristics in the outcome.|$|E

25|$|During {{restoration}} in 2002, {{the back}} of the cloth was photographed and scanned for the first time. Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic corona discharge as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud. Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front <b>picture,</b> <b>it</b> is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those {{on the other side of}} the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Díaz was never sympathetic to all Indians. In fact, {{he stated that}} the Yaquis and the Mayas {{had always been a}} pest for Mexico and that they needed to be dealt with. This {{is not to say that}} Díaz loved the rest of Mexico’s Indians. Perhaps, it could be argued that Díaz’s ultimate drive was that of economic expansion. Once Díaz amassed absolute legislative power, his indigenismo went out of the <b>picture.</b> <b>It</b> was not so much about elevating the lower classes into modern society and thus integrating them, but more about the economic and power status of the nation. After all, Indians composed less than half of Mexico’s population and their unwillingness to participate in the dominant culture made them political enemies of the state, especially those who persistently refused assimilation like the Yaqui and the Maya.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of the album and some Warped Tour 2011 appearances, the band {{announced}} its first headlining tour across the United States, with locations beginning in New Mexico, looping around the east coast, and concluding in Colorado.

The band's first supporting tour was to be a ten-show tour in November 2011 with headliners Black Veil Brides and supporting acts Aiden and Drive-A, but was canceled after Black Veil Brides dropped out when their lead vocalist Andy Biersack broke his nose. Emmure replaced Falling in Reverse on {{the second half of the}} Take A <b>Picture,</b> <b>It</b> Lasts Longer Tour with We Came As Romans and the band played an exclusive show at KROQ on November 8 to make up for the canceled shows.|$|E
