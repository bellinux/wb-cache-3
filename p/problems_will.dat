25|$|Both {{aircraft}} {{manufacturers have}} good safety records on recently manufactured aircraft and generally, both firms {{have a positive}} reputation of delivering well-engineered and high-quality products. By convention, both companies tend to avoid safety comparisons when selling their aircraft to airlines or comparisons on product quality. Most aircraft dominating the companies' current sales, the Boeing 737-NG and Airbus A320 families and both companies' wide-body offerings, have good safety records. Older model aircraft such as the Boeing 707, Boeing 727, Boeing 737-100/-200, Boeing 747-100/SP/200/300, Airbus A300, and Airbus A310, which were respectively first flown during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, have had higher rates of fatal accidents.

500|$|When parents {{divorce and}} the {{children}} are in the picture, many <b>problems</b> <b>will</b> arise during the difficult process of determining custody. [...] For instance, {{if there is an}} argument regarding joint legal custody, the process to earn legal custody will take longer than anticipated and will ultimately impact the relationship of the parents {{and the children}}. [...] It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds, which, in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody. [...] Another criticism of having a joint legal custody arrangement {{is that it is a}} frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child's life (regardless of what the decree of joint legal custody states), which generally leads to conflict. Additionally, in a joint legal custody arrangement, if the parents of the children do not get along, this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that needs to be made about their children, which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved, but also for the parents.|$|E

2500|$|A {{question}} has been raised over the grandfathering of allowances. Countries within the EU ETS have granted their incumbent businesses {{most or all of}} their allowances for free.

2500|$|If {{the child}} has had a {{peaceful}} gestation, but after birth suffers pain or ungratified needs during the first year, attachment will again be blocked.

2500|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} in the Chinese legal community that the endemic corruption {{is caused by the}} lack of an independent judiciary and a failure to enforce laws and regulations. They contend that these <b>problems</b> <b>will</b> not be permanently fixed until much deeper systemic problems are addressed. Guanxi and other social customs, may have also contributed to the prevalence of practices seen as corrupt from a strictly legal perspective but seem relatively benign from a cultural standpoint. Gift-giving during holidays, securing patrons for career advancement, hosting banquets at expensive restaurants to secure minor deals, exchanging favours, and navigating the complex web of guanxi to get things done was seen as an ordinary part of Chinese life. Indeed, many people did not see these activities as illegal or even morally problematic. [...] Moreover, many regulations and law governing cadre work and public service were rarely enforced, resulting in two prevailing winds among Chinese officialdom that [...] "if everyone else is doing it then it must be okay," [...] and that [...] "I probably won't ever be caught anyway".|$|E
2500|$|Treatment is expensive; {{indirect}} costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a U.S. study estimated an average discounted lifetime cost of $ ( [...] dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% medical care, 30% extra {{education and other}} care, and 60% lost economic productivity. A UK study estimated discounted lifetime costs at ₤ and ₤ for an autistic person with and without intellectual disability, respectively ( [...] pounds, inflation-adjusted from 2005/06 estimate). Legal rights to treatment are complex, vary with location and age, and require advocacy by caregivers. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 U.S. study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care <b>problems</b> <b>will</b> greatly affect parental employment.
