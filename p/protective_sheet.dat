Rainfall was artificially generated by a rainfall simulator in order to observe the variations of tension of soil moisture beneath the <b>protective</b> <b>sheets</b> for a given period of rainfall. The another experiment was designed to pbserve the traced out flow patterns through the soil and the <b>protective</b> <b>sheets</b> using colored injected materials and a transparent water channel apparatus. Three types of <b>protective</b> <b>sheets</b> were spread out on three adjacent plots composed of MASA soil with equal dimensions of 18 ^。 Slope, 10 m length, 1 m width and 50 cm depth. The intensity of the rainfall varied within the limit of 25 mm for 4 hours to 200 mm for 1 hour. The tension of soil moisture at the points of 1 m, 5 m, 9 m from the downward ending of each plot and 10 cm, 25 cm, 40 cm beneath the sheet of each points were recorded automatically by the tensiometers. Simultaneously, the volume of runoff, seepage and the mass of sediment from these plots were also measured. From {{the results of the}} first experiment, it was found that, in the cases of rainfall-intensity 50 mm and 100 mm, the tension of soil moisture at the point of 10 cm depth, started to decrease first and followed at the points of 25 cm, and 40 cm respectively. As a result, the water-table began to rise. Finally, when the water table reached the soil surface, the volume of runoff and soil loss reached at their maximum values. In the cases of 150 mm and 200 mm, runoff and soil loss started to occur about the same time the rainfall was applied. The results obtained from the second experiment showed that the fibrous sheets prevented rill-formation by absorbing water and dispersing the flow due to their high permeable characteristics...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{vacuum tube}} {{collectors}} {{are used in}} middle Europe use heat pipes for their core instead of passing liquid directly through them. Direct flow is more popular in China. Evacuated heat pipe tubes (EHPTs) are composed of multiple evacuated glass tubes each containing an absorber plate fused to a heat pipe. The heat is transferred to the transfer fluid (water or an antifreeze mix—typically propylene glycol) of a domestic hot water or hydronic space heating system in a heat exchanger called a [...] "manifold". The manifold is wrapped in insulation and covered by a <b>protective</b> <b>sheet</b> metal or plastic case.The vacuum inside of the evacuated tube collectors have been proven to last more than 25 years, the reflective coating for the design is encapsulated in the vacuum inside of the tube, which will not degrade until the vacuum is lost.The vacuum that surrounds {{the outside of the}} tube greatly reduces convection and conduction heat loss, therefore achieving greater efficiency than flat-plate collectors, especially in colder conditions. This advantage is largely lost in warmer climates, except in those cases where very hot water is desirable, e.g., for commercial processes. The high temperatures that can occur may require special design to prevent overheating.Some evacuated tubes (glass-metal) are made with one layer of glass that fuses to the heat pipe at the upper end and encloses the heat pipe and absorber in the vacuum. Others (glass-glass) are made with a double layer of glass fused together at one or both ends with a vacuum between the layers (like a vacuum bottle or flask), with the absorber and heat pipe contained at normal atmospheric pressure. Glass-glass tubes have a highly reliable vacuum seal, but the two layers of glass reduce the light that reaches the absorber. Moisture may enter the non-evacuated area of the tube and cause absorber corrosion. Glass-metal tubes allow more light to reach the absorber, and protect the absorber and heat pipe from corrosion even if they are made from dissimilar materials (see galvanic corrosion).|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} requirements to existing heat-insulation layers in enclosure structures of wall panels has been carried out, a general principles on development of thermal insulation systems, substantiation on the necessity {{to develop a new}} wall panel design with improved thermal characteristics. The proposed design of the wall panel differs from the existing one in the fact that its external layer is made of <b>protective</b> <b>sheets</b> being perforated in their top and bottom parts with perforated aluminum foil layer placed on them. Air layer performs function of one of thermal insulation layers, and the second layer is made up in the form of several micro-modular sub-layers which are divided by perforated aluminum foil and a grid. An inner concrete layer is also separated from micro-modular layers by aluminum foil. <b>Protective</b> <b>sheets</b> and the grid can be made of aluminum or polyethylene. The arrangement of hollow micro-modular cells in the zone of negative temperatures prevents condensate accumulation. The arrangement of the perforated aluminum foil layers between micro- modular layers leads to increase in thermal resistance of the panel due to decrease of a radiant component in presence of several screens and does not interfere with a vapor permeability of thermal insulation layers from micro-modules. At the same time placement of a non-perforated foil layer on an inside panel layer interferes with penetration of water vapor from rooms in micro-modular thermal insulation layers. Technological principles lie in the arrangement of perforation slots in the top and bottom zones of <b>protective</b> <b>sheets</b> that allows to delete excess moisture from thermal insulation layers and air layer and also leads to improvement of thermo-technical characteristics, durability and reliability in construction operation as a whole. The executed calculations of heat and humidity fields in external enclosure structures confirm advantages of the presented technical solution. </p...|$|R

Experiments show that it indeed has a strong effect on its transport, magnetic and mechanical characteristics. However, to use ion irradiation as an engineering tool requires understanding of the type and detailed characteristics of the produced defects which is still lacking, as the use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) - the only technique allowing direct imaging of atomic-scale defects - often modifies or even creates defects during imaging, thus making it impossible to determine the intrinsic atomic structure.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the rheology and processing of solvent-free core shell ?polymer opals? that consist of a soft outer shell grafted to hard colloidal polymer core particles. Strong iridescent colours can be produced by shearing the material in a certain way that causes the initially disordered spheres to rearrange into ordered crystalline structures and produce colours by diffraction and interference of multiple light scattering, similar to gemstone opals. The basic linear viscoelastic rheology of a polymer opal sample was determined as a function of temperature and the material was found to be highly viscoelastic at all tested temperatures. A Cambridge Multipass Rheometer (MPR) was specifically modified in order to make controlled mechanical measurements of initially disordered polymer opal tapes that were sandwiched between <b>protective</b> PET <b>sheets.</b> Axial extension, simple shear and a novel ?edge shearing? geometry were all evaluated and multiple successive experiments of the edge shearing test were carried out at different temperatures. The optical development of colloidal ordering, measured as optical opalescence, was quantified by spectroscopy using visible backscattered light. The development of opalescence was found {{to be sensitive to the}} geometry of deformation and a number of process variables suggesting a complex interaction of parameters that caused the opalescence. In order to identify aspects of the deformation mechanism of the edge shearing experiment, a separate series of in situ optical experiments were carried out and this helped indicate the extent of simple shear generated with each edge shear deformation. The results show that strong ordering can be induced by successive edge shearing deformation. The results are relevant to polymer opal rheology, processing and mechanisms relating to ordering within complex viscoelastic fluids. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

In order to allow ventilation to keep the fire burning, they left small spaces uncovered, after which they meticulously surrounded the homemade kiln with cow chips - very dry cow dung - used to fuel the fire, careful to leave the vents free. The goal was to prevent any flame from actually touching the pots, hence the <b>protective</b> metal <b>sheets.</b> After covering the kiln with the cow chips, they lit the kindling on all sides to ensure an even distribution of heat. They continued to feed the fire with dry cedar until the fire reached the desired temperature of around 12 to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on what look they were attempting. If the fire continued to burn, the pottery would achieve a red-brown color. But {{in order to make}} the black pottery that Maria was famous for, the fire was smothered with dry powered horse dung. By doing this, the amount of oxygen within the kiln was greatly reduced, therefore creating a reduction atmosphere which caused the color of the pots to turn black. After several hours, they shifted the horse dung around to kill the fire and bury the pots so they could cool slowly. After the kiln had cooled enough, they carefully pulled the pots out using either a stick if the pots were still hot, or waiting until they were cool enough to touch.|$|R
