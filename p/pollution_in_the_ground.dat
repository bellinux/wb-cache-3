5000|$|Until recently, the Bratsk Reservoir—one of the world's largest—was {{a source}} of {{drinking}} water for many nearby cities. In 1998, after tons of mercury were found {{at the bottom of}} the reservoir, warnings were posted urging local citizens to avoid the reservoir at all costs. However, owing to Russia's economic troubles, the reservoir still remains {{a source of}} fish and other food products for many hard-pressed local residents. According to Yuri Udodov, head of the Federal Committee on Ecology (FCE) in Irkutsk Oblast, this region has [...] "the highest rate of discharge of metallic mercury into the environment in all of Siberia." [...] The extent of mercury <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> around the nearby Usolye chemical plant is equal to half the total global production of mercury in 1992.|$|E
40|$|Bioremediation {{is a term}} {{which refers}} to the {{degradation}} of chemicals in the environment by microorganisms. This process has been harnessed by man {{in the form of}} enhanced bioremediation technologies which stimulate the growth of microbes in the subsurface in order to destroy pollution in-situ. These systems typically utilize a number of vertical wells to pump water amended with nutrients to enhance microbial activity into the aquifer. This type of scheme is often costly and ineffective at removing all of the <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Horizontal well drilling has emerged as a new technology in environmental remediation and promises to be an important tool in the future. These wells can be drilled to follow the course of a plume or to cut underneath and across it. Gaseous nutrients can be injected beneath a plume and allowed to diffuse into it and stimulate microbial degradation of contaminants within it. A gaseous enhanced biodegradation system is designed to treat a plume of chlorinated solvent...|$|E

It includes the analysis of the model of oil pollution as a low resistivity zone, the field study technique, advanced data processing, petrophysical simulation and data interpretation. Oil pollution is widespread and arises at all stages of the petroleum industry: extraction, transportation, refining and distribution. Under the influence of biodegradation, oil <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> changes the resistivity of the groundwater and the surrounding rocks, exhibiting as a zone of low resistivity. Resistivity sounding can estimate its position in plan and with depth, lithology, pollution sources, possible migration paths and contamination grade. Resistivity soundings are performed as electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), which has high space resolution and low distortion caused by near-surface inhomogeneities (geological noise). For the separation of contaminated and non-contaminated areas, a petrophysical simulation is used for calculation of rock resistivity based on underground water resistivity or salinity...|$|E
40|$|If {{taking a}} closer look of what is {{essential}} in soil remediation and risk situations, communication is one of <b>the</b> main <b>ground</b> values. This study is resembling just that. How the people have been informed and due to this is an ongoing process, how the risk communication can be developed for this situation. The method {{was based on a}} survey which was created using facts and knowledge about risk communication. The survey targeted owners of summer houses at an island called Norrbyskär <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of Sweden. The island has elevated levels of environmental <b>pollutions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> due to a Steam sawmill company, that was active during the years 1895 to 1953. <b>In</b> year 2008 <b>the</b> county administrative board of Västerbotten discovered high volume of dioxins. Since then a couple of different consulting companies have been hired to perform sampling to assess the volume of environmental pollutions. During this time information about the risks has been communicated. The results show that the information that the participants received was good and that the work with sampling and soil remediation at the island is important. There was no change in peoples feeling of security when they visited Norrbyskär. They thought that municipality of Umeå has the most credibility. Knowledge about pollutions was low and {{the majority of the people}} wants extended information about <b>pollutions.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> future work with information there is three main words to make the risk communication successful: reliance, trust and credibility...|$|R
50|$|Tire {{stockpiles}} {{create a}} great {{health and safety}} risk. Tire fires can occur easily, burning for months, creating substantial <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and <b>ground.</b> Recycling helps {{to reduce the number}} of tires in storage. An additional health risk, tire piles provide harborage for vermin and a breeding ground for mosquitoes that may carry diseases. Illegal dumping of scrap tires pollutes ravines, woods, deserts, and empty lots; which has led many states to pass scrap tire regulations requiring proper management. Tire amnesty day events, in which community members can deposit a limited number of waste tires free of charge, can be funded by state scrap tire programs, helping decrease illegal dumping and improper storage of scrap tires.|$|R
5000|$|The {{disposal}} of tires in landfills {{have proven to}} have negative effects on the environment. Not only do they take up {{a great deal of}} space within a landfill, but their process of decomposing has created a wide variety of issues that have made their disposal in landfills unfeasible and in many regions, banned.The process of bubbling of trapped methane gas has been linked to increased mosquito and other insect breeding (increase risk of disease spreading), contamination of both underground and above ground water systems, as well as chemically destroying many beneficial bacteria that grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil within and surrounding a landfill. Tires have been stock piled for years both legally (landfills) and illegally. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States alone there are about two billion around the country, with an estimated 279 million to be added to this number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next few years. The legal stockpiling of tires increases the risk of fires which can burn for months on end, creating further <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and <b>ground,</b> while <b>the</b> illegal {{disposal of}} tires in forests, water ways and empty lots have caused pollution which cannot be regulated.The most obvious hazard associated with the uncontrolled disposal and accumulation of large amounts of tires outdoors is the potential for large fires which are extremely detrimental to the environment. Once a large pile catches fire, it is very hard, if not impossible, to extinguish.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{nitrogen}} (N) balances for China's {{crop production}} systems were estimated using statistical {{data collected from}} 1980 to 2004 at the national and provincial scale and from 1994 to 1999 at the county level. There was a surplus N balance throughout these periods, but the surplus was nearly stable in recent years. Projections using nonseasonal Box-Jenkins model or exponential models show that the N surplus for the total cultivated land in China was likely to increase from 142. 8 kg ha¿ 1 in 2004 to 168. 6 kg ha¿ 1 in 2015. The N balance surplus in the more developed southeastern provinces was the largest, and was slightly less in the central region, which caused the nitrate <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> water. The N surplus was much less in the western and northern provinces because of lower synthetic fertilizer inputs. The region with high N risk includes Beijing Municipality and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, and Shandong provinces for 2002 ¿ 2004. The projections suggested that 15 provinces (or municipalities) {{in the middle and}} southeastern part of China except Jiangxi and Shanxi provinces would become the high-risk region by 2015. The level of economic development, transportation, and labor force condition had an important efiect on the N balance surplus at the county level, but the last two factors showed remarkable impact at the provincial level. To decrease the nonpoint pollution (Npp) risk from crop production, the authors suggested to reduce the target level for national grain self-sufficiency to 90 %¿ 95 % and change the regional structure of grain production by moving some of the future grain production from the high Npp risk areas of eastern China to parts of the central and western provinces where the Npp risk was much less...|$|E
40|$|Geophysical {{investigation}} {{is used to}} differentiate lithological units. In addition to this, geophysics is also useful for the detection. definition and monitoring of <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{on the condition that}} the pollution. due to Spills. leakage or illegal discharges causes a significant difference in conductivity/resistivity. The methodology of geophysical investigation in environmental issues will be illustrated. The first presented method is the electromagnetic profiling method. which measures the lateral variation in ground conductivity using a transmitter and a receiver. At the transmitter coil, a time-varying electromagnetic field is induced by an alternating current. This field interacts with the ground, proportional to ground conductivity. The resulting field is measured and recorded by the receiver. The background conductivity needs to be defined along a profile in a non-polluted zone. Subsequently, all the collected data can be used to plot the lateral variation in conductivity. Areas with higher conductivity reflect in most cases pollution from which the Source can be traced. A second method is geo-electrical tomography, which is a combination of resistivity profiling and sounding where a large number of electrodes arc placed at a constant distance along a line. During each measurement, the electrical potential caused by a current sent into the soil by two current electrodes is measured between the two potential electrodes. By automatically addressing a combination of four electrodes, and increasing the distance between the electrodes, the depth of penetration increases. Considering the resistivity of the corresponding lithology, pollution along the profile can be delimited vertically and horizontally. Finally, the investigation of the conductivity (resistivity) carried out with borehole loggings delivers information on the vertical distribution of the conductivity in the groundwater reservoir, resulting in the vertical delimitation of pollution close to the borehole. A great advantage for these methods applied to soil pollution consists in the avoidance of direct contact with the Pollution, resulting, in a reduction of health risks. These methods are non-destructive and fairly fast investigations are possible. They will be illustrated by case studies where the results are validated based on the analyses of soil and groundwater samples...|$|E
