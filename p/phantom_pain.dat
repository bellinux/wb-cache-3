25|$|Metal Gear Solid V: The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain</b> {{includes}} two multiplayer modes: first, the new Metal Gear Online, developed by Kojima Productions' newly formed Los Angeles division (now known as Konami Los Angeles Studio). The first footage for multiplayer was revealed in December 2014. While originally set for launch alongside {{the release of}} The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain,</b> Metal Gear Online was postponed to October 6 for consoles and January 2016 for Microsoft Windows.|$|E
25|$|The game sold noticeably {{more on the}} PlayStation {{family of}} systems than the {{competing}} Xbox in the UK. Excluding computer sales, The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain</b> moved approximately 72 percent of copies on PlayStation 4, roughly three times the amount sold on the Xbox One, which accounted for 22 percent of sales. 3 percent of sales were on PlayStation 3, and 2 percent on Xbox 360. By the end of September 2015, Metal Gear Solid V: The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain</b> had shipped 5 million copies. By the end of December 2015, the game had shipped 6 million copies.|$|E
50|$|The {{neurological}} {{basis and}} mechanisms for <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> are all derived from experimental theories and observations. Little {{is known about}} the true mechanism causing <b>phantom</b> <b>pains,</b> and many theories highly overlap. Historically, <b>phantom</b> <b>pains</b> were thought to originate from neuromas located at the stump tip. Traumatic neuromas, or non-tumor nerve injuries, often arise from surgeries and result from the abnormal growth of injured nerve fibers. Although stump neuromas contribute to <b>phantom</b> <b>pains,</b> they are not the sole cause. This is because patients with congenital limb deficiency can sometimes, although rarely, experience <b>phantom</b> <b>pains.</b> This suggests that there is a central representation of the limb responsible for painful sensations. Currently, theories are based on altered neurological pathways and cortical reorganization.|$|R
40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{recently}} {{argued that the}} content of pains (and bodily sensations more generally) is imperative rather than descriptive. I show that such an account can help resolve competing intuitions about <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain.</b> As imperatives, <b>phantom</b> <b>pains</b> are neither true nor false. However, <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pains</b> presuppose falsehoods, {{in the same way}} that any imperative which demands something impossible presupposes a falsehood. <b>Phantom</b> <b>pains,</b> like many chronic pains, are thus commands that cannot be satisfied. I conclude by showing that some of the negative psychological consequences of chronic pain are a direct consequence of their imperative nature. 12 page(s...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain</b> was {{critically}} acclaimed upon release, with its gameplay drawing praise for featuring {{a variety of}} mechanics and interconnected systems which allow {{a high degree of}} player freedom in approaching objectives. While the story drew criticism from some critics for its lack of focus, others acknowledged its emotional power and exploration of mature themes. The game received perfect review scores from several publications, and was described by many {{to be one of the}} greatest stealth games of all time. A complete edition which bundles The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain</b> and Ground Zeroes together, titled Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience, was released in October 2016.|$|E

40|$|Treatment for <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> is {{difficult}} and challenging. There is often suboptimum treatment with fewer than 10 % receiving lasting relief. Treatments based broadly on other neuropathic pains may not be appropriate for a clinical success. We report a case of <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain,</b> which proved resistant to multiple analgesics, including opioids and continuous epidural blockade. Treatment with intravenous (IV) ketamine as an alternate day infusion, gave complete remission of <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain.</b> This demonstrates an early and effective use of a potent NMDA antagonist for treatment of <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain.</b> Mechanisms underlying <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain is {{pain that}} has been present {{for more than three}} months. Chronic pain may affect all aspects of a person’s life. It is thought that there is no cure for chronic pain and that {{therefore}} chronic pain may only be managed. Within chronic <b>pain,</b> <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> is prevalent in individuals who have had amputations. Phantom limb phenomena includes <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain,</b> <b>phantom</b> limb sensation and stump <b>pain.</b> <b>Phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> differs from <b>phantom</b> limb sensation where sensations; such as itching and burning are experienced in the missing limb. Whereas with <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain,</b> it is pain that is experienced in the missing limb. <b>Phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> is often described as a shooting, burning or crushing pain. Stump pain is usually experienced at the point of amputation where nerves may have been severed as a result of trauma or an elected amputation. Occupational therapists use meaningful occupations in their occupational therapy interventions to enhance occupational performance. A meaningful occupation is a subjective activity that the individual participates in and is a unique experience to them. From the literature review many themes emerged on the relationship between chronic pain and participation in meaningful occupations. There was a lack of literature on occupational therapy and <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain.</b> The role of the occupational therapist was looked at in relation to evidence based practice and education of <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain.</b> The biopsychosocial model emerged and its link with the social environment and other factors of <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> management such as catastrophizing. In this research proposal 10 participants will be positively selected from an amputation clinic in Scotland and semi-structured interviews will be used to collect data on the experiences of amputees, who experience <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> which may affect meaningful occupations {{and the role of the}} occupational therapist will also be considered in the management of <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2015, Konami {{revealed}} {{that they were}} recruiting new staff members {{to develop a new}} Metal Gear game as Kojima left the company. On August 17, 2016, Konami announced during Gamescom 2016 that a new Metal Gear title was in the works, known as Metal Gear Survive. It is a spin-off title as well as a supplemental to Metal Gear Solid V as a whole, taking place between Ground Zeroes and The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to peripheral mechanisms, spinal mechanisms {{are thought to}} have an influencing role in <b>phantom</b> <b>pains.</b> Peripheral nerve injury can lead to the degeneration of C fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and terminating A fibers may subsequently branch into the same lamina. If this occurs, A fiber inputs could be reported as noxious stimuli. Substance P, involved in the transmission of pain signals, is usually expressed by Aδ and C fibers, but following peripheral nerve damage, substance P is expressed by Aβ fibers. This leads to hyperexcitability of the spinal cord, which usually occurs only in the presence of noxious stimuli. Because patients with complete spinal cord injury have experienced <b>phantom</b> <b>pains,</b> there must be an underlying central mechanism responsible for the generation of <b>phantom</b> <b>pains.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{relationship}} between phantom limb sensation and neuroplasticity {{is a complex}} one. In the early 1990s V.S. Ramachandran theorized that phantom limbs {{were the result of}} cortical remapping. However, in 1995 Herta Flor and her colleagues demonstrated that cortical remapping occurs only in patients who have <b>phantom</b> <b>pain.</b> Her research showed that phantom limb pain (rather than referred sensations) was the perceptual correlate of cortical reorganization. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as maladaptive plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Metal Gear Solid V: The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain</b> is an action-adventure stealth {{video game}} {{developed}} by Kojima Productions {{and published by}} Konami for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} treatment options for <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pain</b> that are actively being researched. Most treatments do {{not take into account}} the mechanisms underlying <b>phantom</b> <b>pains,</b> and are therefore ineffective. However, there are a few treatment options that have been shown to alleviate pain in some patients, but these treatment options usually have a success rate less than 30%. It is important to note that this rate of success does not exceed the placebo effect. It is also important to note that because the degree of cortical reorganization is proportional to <b>phantom</b> limb <b>pains,</b> any perturbations to the amputated regions may increase pain perception.|$|R
50|$|Pharmacological {{techniques}} are often continued {{in conjunction with}} other treatment options. Doses of pain medications needed often drop substantially when combined with other techniques, but rarely are discontinued completely. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, and sodium channel blockers, mainly carbamazepine, are often used to relieve chronic pain, and recently have been used in an attempt to reduce <b>phantom</b> <b>pains.</b> Pain relief may also be achieved through use of opioids, ketamine, calcitonin, and lidocaine.|$|R

25|$|The {{music of}} The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain</b> was {{produced}} by Harry Gregson-Williams, making it his fourth Metal Gear title. It was released on September 2, 2015. In July 2015, Rika Muranaka told Fragged Nation {{in an interview that}} over 30 commissioned songs were never used, thus playing part in Konami's budget concerns over the Metal Gear Solid V project. In game, players can acquire cassette tapes in the field, which can then be played in the Airborne Command Center, during a mission, or when the helicopter inserts or extracts Snake. The tapes include a variety of pop songs, instrumentals, and theme music from previous games in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>phantom</b> <b>pain</b> in upper limb amputees is nearly 82%, and in lower limb amputees is 54%. One {{study found that}} eight days after amputation, 72% of patients had phantom limb pain, and six months later, 67% reported it. Some amputees experience continuous pain that varies in intensity or quality; others experience several bouts of pain per day, or it may reoccur less often. It {{is often described as}} shooting, crushing, burning or cramping. If the pain is continuous for a long period, parts of the intact body may become sensitized, so that touching them evokes pain in the phantom limb. Phantom limb pain may accompany urination or defecation.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of The <b>Phantom</b> <b>Pain,</b> many ascertained that the {{tensions}} between Konami and Kojima had {{had an effect on}} the development of the game which could be seen in the end product, specifically with regards to the storyline. The decision to force players to replay past missions to progress through the second half of the story was criticized, with one theory being that original content had been envisioned but which had not been incorporated into the finished game, resulting in the reused sections for time constraints. Another aspect that received similar criticism was the story ending, which many agreed felt abrupt and left several plot points unresolved. The general consensus was that such shortcomings with the design choices had resulted from Konami giving strict deadlines for the game's release, as well as their dissatisfaction with how much money Kojima had spent on development.|$|E

Cagalli's bodyguard Athrun Zala joins ZAFT pilot Shinn Asuka to stop them. During the fight, ZAFT's battleship Minerva is ordered to destroy the ruins of a space colony to prevent it from crashing into Earth. They find out that rogue ZAFT soldiers are controlling the colony in order to crash it into Earth. After failing to completely destroy the colony, a second war starts between the factions, the Earth Alliance and ZAFT, once news has spread that ZAFT soldiers caused the colony to collide on Earth. The neutral country of Orb allies with the Earth Alliance, with the former having also joined Blue Cosmos. This leads these three faction to confront the ZAFT soldiers several times, with Athrun having returned there.|$|E
