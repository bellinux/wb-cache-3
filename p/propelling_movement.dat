A short while after the station foreman {{instructed}} the signalman to allow the parcels train to move forward, beyond the scissors crossing {{at the south end}} of the platform. The engine moved forward to the south end of Platform 1 and waited. The shunter was then given instructions to take charge of the necessary shunting movements. During this time a train left No. 2 Bay line. The shunter passed instructions face-to-face with the driver whilst they waited for a fish train to pass. Once his signal was clear the shunter signalled the driver to start the movement. The shunter at this point riding on the last of the three carriage trucks, at this point the train had to move far enough forward to clear No. 53 points. Once these points were clear the signalman reversed the points and signalled to the shunter to begin the <b>propelling</b> <b>movement.</b> These movements were completed at approximately 11.02 pm. Whilst here, the shunter coupled up the necessary vehicles and connected the brakes. At 11.04pm the signalman in the Platform East signal box offered the parcels train to the signalman in the South Junction Signal Box. The train was accepted [...] "under caution". Up to this point all movements had been completed correctly and no errors had been made.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} New Atheism as a secular fundamentalism {{that is both}} a utopian ideology and a social movement.

It also examines the New Atheism’s role in the secular movement through research on major movement actions, campaigns, and debates on goals and strategies. It argues that the New Atheism comes into conflict with two other movement discourses: secular humanism and libertarian rationalism. These ideological conflicts are <b>propelling</b> the <b>movement</b> away from the New Atheism’s aggressive critique of religion toward more a more accommodating and inclusive approach that emphasizes basic humanistic values...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} Bartók's {{compositional}} process {{as it relates to}} the Improvisations, Op. 20. The study, which focuses on the analysis of the draft manuscript 50 PS 1, compares the draft and other relevant sources with the final composition. Bartók's framework for the entire Improvisations is based on a compositional strategy of pairing individual improvisations combined with systematic revision of the draft copy by the introduction of tritones as tonal equivalents and movement by fifths from semitones, to achieve structural coherence in the individual improvisations. The tonic-dominant relationship is used to rearrange the individual improvisations in the draft and tritones as tonal equivalents are used to <b>propel</b> the <b>movement</b> between the improvisations to produce a coherent whole...|$|R

The authors discuss globalization and what <b>propels</b> transnational <b>movement</b> and argue that existing immigrant adaptation research from the fields of sociology and anthropology focuses on immigration processes extensively without making connections to the classroom. The authors maintain that transnationalism remains largely under- theorized in educational research. Drawing on their experiences as researchers and teachers, the authors provide a glimpse into the lives of these ‘overlooked’ transnational students through a series of vignettes. The essay concludes by addressing the teaching and learning implications of working with transnational students...|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. As South Africa transitioned into {{democracy}} and began negotiating {{the terms of}} the new dispensation, the near exclusion of women from {{the early stages of the}} negotiations <b>propelled</b> a <b>movement</b> of women across the country, organising to ensure that their needs and aspirations were represented in the defining of the new political order. At the heart of this movement was the Women's National Coalition (WNC), formed in 1991 to identify and advocate for women's primary needs in the post-apartheid Constitution. This created unprecedented opportunities for women from all parts of the country to identify and to organise around commonalities, and it also exposed some of the deep divisions and power inequalities that separated groups of women from each other. In seeking to understand these dynamics, I explore dominant discourses that were employed within the WNC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Recent {{studies of}} aquatic and land plants show that similar {{phenomena}} determine intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles. This suggests that aspects of cell signaling involved in development {{and response to}} external stimuli are conserved across species. The movement of molecular motors along cytoskeletal filaments directly or indirectly entrains the fluid cytosol, driving cyclosis (i. e., cytoplasmic streaming) and affecting gradients of molecular species within the cell, with potentially important metabolic implications as a driving force for cell expansion. Research has shown that myosin XI functions in organelle movement driving cytoplasmic streaming in aquatic and land plants. Despite the conserved cytoskeletal machinery <b>propelling</b> organelle <b>movement</b> among aquatic and land plants, the velocities of cyclosis in plant cells varies according to cell types, developmental stage of the cell, and plant species. Here, we synthesize recent insights into cytoplasmic streaming, molecular gradients, cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics, and expand current cellular models to identify important gaps in current research...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how rhetoric {{functions}} in the Alternative Birth Movement (ABM). In particular, communication published by movement leaders will be examined to discover how rhetoric <b>propels</b> the <b>movement</b> from one stage to the next as well as how rhetoric facilitates the goals of the movement. When the ABM began in the early 1970 s, it faced strong opposition from medical organizations, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Through the use of powerful rhetoric, however, the movement was able to withstand pressure from the opposition, attract members, and move toward achieving its goals. To understand the functions of rhetoric throughout the alternative birth movement, this study combines Leland Griffin's method of examining movements in phases with Charles Stewart's functional perspective. The study will address the following research questions: 1. How does rhetoric progress the movement from one stage to another? 2. How does rhetoric facilitate the goals of the movement...|$|R

Eschewing the in-the-trenches police work for a little history, a great guest performance, and a twisty game of, yes, cat and mouse, the episode felt a little more cinematic than normal, which is a good sign heading forward. For the longest time, Grimm had been stuck in a certain mode, but recently, it's expanded the scope of what it can do visually and story-wise, something that could launch it from good to great in the upcoming second season.
