(Massumi, 1993 : viii) The perpetuation of ethno-sectarian conflicts reminds us that, despite the onset of globalisation, cultural ‘homogenisation ’ and mass consumption, the links between ethno-sectarian separation and fear remain central to the logic and explanation of violent enactment and cultural polarisation.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{provides}} an overview of the emerging policy landscape for marine spatial planning (MSP) in Europe, which consists of various policies, directives and regulations related to MSP in the EU. For the development of this emerging policy landscape, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 represents an important context, in which principles related to environmental sustainability are given fundamental importance in guiding decision-making in the EU, and co-decision (with shared legislative power between the European Council and Parliament) is established as the ‘ordinary legislative procedure’. As {{in other parts of the}} world, environmental protection and management of different activities in the marine environment in Europe were, and still are to some extent, fragmented into different laws and policies. In recent years, with the passage of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Integrated Maritime Policy, there is a clear trend towards integrated planning and management in marine waters, underpinned by an ecosystem-based approach to achieve sustainability. This paper explores the interactions, both in terms of potential synergies and tensions, between different policies and directives, and discusses the main challenges for their integration. The paper concludes with six key issues that may have major implications for MSP in Europe: 1) the integration of environmental protection and economic development objectives; 2) the prospects for reforming the CFP in order to deliver such integration; 3) the relationship between the MSFD and the IMP; 4) the necessity of and potential roles of an MSP Directive; 5) the implications of co-decision making; 6) <b>power,</b> <b>displacement</b> and justice issues in the ‘race for space ’ in Europe’s seas...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the hypothesis {{that there were no}} significant differences between forwards and backs in the elements of leg power between the ID and DD genotypes of the ACE (I/D) gene in developing young adult Rugby Union players. METHODS: Sixty-eight players were recruited to identify the distribution of genotypes between forwards and backs. Fifty-eight players were investigated for leg power. Forwards (n= 28) comprised 15 ID and 13 DD genotypes, and backs (n= 30) 19 ID and 11 DD genotypes. Leg power was measured on a force platform using a counter movement jump; the parameters of interest were peak and relative force, peak and relative <b>power,</b> <b>displacement</b> and velocity. The three-primer polymerase chain reaction was used to assay the region of interest for I and D variants of the ACE gene. The distribution of genotypes was determined by chi-square and comparisons between forwards and backs made using the independent t-test. RESULTS: No significant differences were identified in the distribution of genotypes between forwards and backs (c 2 = 2. 2, P= 0. 336). However, significant differences were identified between forwards and backs in a number of components of leg power. Backs had significantly larger values than forwards for relative force (1. 50 vs. 1. 30 Wt%, P= 0. 001) and relative power (27. 1 vs. 24. 3 W. kg- 1, P= 0. 034) for the ID genotype, whereas backs had significantly larger values than forwards for displacement (0. 42 vs. 0. 38 m, P= 0. 049) and velocity (2. 76 vs. 2. 55 m. s. - 1, P= 0. 007) for the DD genotype.

40|$|The Google Art Project is {{an ambitious}} attempt by Google to curate {{worldwide}} artwork online {{in the highest}} resolution possible. Google accomplishes this by partnering with museums where museums provide access to art collections and Google provides the technology to capture high quality images. Under this existing model, Google places the burden of copyright clearances on museums and removes images from online if requested by copyright owners. An endeavor like the Google Art Project is not unprecedented however, when Google attempted to put the world’s books online under the Google Books Project, scanning millions of titles and offering snippets for users to view online. The legal strategy seen in the Books Project differs drastically from the Art Project, where Google proceeded aggressively with the Books Project, going forward without preemptively obtaining copyright clearances from authors and relying on fair use as a defense against infringement liability. As {{a result of a}} more restrained legal strategy for the Art Project, a lot of contemporary and modern art is absent from Google’s collection as newer works tend to be still under copyright protection. The paper addresses the question of what the best legal strategy for the Google Art Project is, considering Google’s previous strategy with the Books Project as well as various stakeholder interests such as the artists, museums, Google, and the public. An evaluation of the pros and cons leads to the conclusion that a restrained legal strategy is more suitable for the Art Project as opposed to an aggressive one used in the Books Project. Followed by the legal analysis, the paper addresses major arguments against the Google Art Project from a societal perspective, including concerns for Google’s monopolistic <b>power,</b> <b>displacement</b> of traditional museums, and potential exploitation of museums. In addressing the problem of missing contemporary art, the paper proposes two measures: monetizing the Google Art Project to obtain funding for copyright clearances and enhancing the terms and conditions for use on the Google website...|$|E
40|$|Research {{shows that}} {{traditional}} methods of identifying the propulsion phase of non-ballistic exercises may underestimate their kinetic and kinematic benefits, overemphasising the superiority of ballistic exercises for power development training. Aims: The aims {{of the study were}} to compare the differences between ballistic jump squat (JS) and non ballistic back squat (BS) mean force, velocity, power, and propulsion phase time, and the effect the method used to identify the propulsion phase had on these variables over a range of loads. Methods: Ground reaction forces (GRF) were recorded at 1000 Hz from 12 active men, completing four single repetitions with 30 %, 45 %, 60 % and 75 % of 1 RM for both JS and BS exercises. System weight was subtracted from GRF data to obtain net force; net force divided by mass to gain acceleration; acceleration multiplied by time to gain velocity; and force was multiplied by velocity to obtain <b>power.</b> <b>Displacement</b> was obtained by multiplying velocity by time. Force, velocity and power were averaged over the propulsion phase. This was identified as starting from the lowest displacement to either peak displacement (PD) or peak velocity (positive acceleration [PA]). Results: When identified using PD, JS showed significantly greater mean power with 30 %- 75 % 1 RM and mean velocity with 45 %- 75 % 1 RM compared to BS. There was no difference in mean force. When identified using PA, JS showed significantly greater power, velocity and force with 30 %- 75 % 1 RM compared to BS. Importantly, PD underestimated BS power by an average of 16 % and BS force by 18 %, but did not effect velocity. Conclusions: JS is shown to be superior in terms of velocity and power production, and should therefore be the primary exercise used to develop these attributes. The method used to identify the propulsion phase appears to dramatically alter both force and power outputs for both exercises; whilst also changing the characteristics of the load-power relationship and optimal load. Results therefore emphasise the importance of valid strategies for identifying the propulsion phase...|$|E
