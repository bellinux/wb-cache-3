Here we present a <b>personal</b> <b>digital</b> rights <b>system</b> for mobile devices where the end user has the ability to place DRM protection and controls on his or her own personal content. We designed the personal DRM system to allow users of a mobile device to transparently define controls and generate licenses on custom content and securely transfer them to other mobile devices.

40|$|Abstract – A modern {{handheld}} {{solution for}} the retail industry {{has been designed to}} replace older proprietary hardware with a PDA-based (<b>Personal</b> <b>Digital</b> Assistant) <b>system.</b> As part of the design, alternative handheld hardware was identified; retail handheld software was written; wireless communication protocols were implemented; and server software and utilities to access product databases were written. The system uses off-the-shelf hardware for which there are multiple suppliers, so the future of the system is secure. The cost to the retailer is potentially one fifth that of previous systems. As well as the lower price tag, the handheld device is competitive due to the amount of features the system boasts. A comprehensive set of user-friendly applications has been created for product creation, checking, etc. The speed of the system is instantaneous, solving a common problem with many handheld implementations on the market today. There is a reduced cost in supporting and maintaining the hardware, and there is also a greater opportunity for future development of the product beyond the retail sector. This system has undergone quality testing and has been deployed successfully in four live shop environments. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} use of a <b>personal</b> <b>digital</b> library <b>system,</b> UpLib. The system consists of a full-text indexed repository accessed through an active agent via a Web interface.

Unlike many other systems of the sort, user access to the document collection is assured even if the UpLib system is unavailable. It is “universal ” in the sense that documents are canonically represented as projections into the text and image domains, and uses a predominantly visual user interface based on page images. UpLib can thus handle any document format which can be rendered as pages. Provision is made for alternative representations existing alongside the text-domain and image-domain representation, either stored or generated on demand. The system is highly extensible through user scripting, and is intended {{to be used as a}} platform for further work in document engineering.

The culmination of our labours is a Tablet PC system (BGS•SIGMAmobile) which is currently used to collect and utilise digital field data across the globe. BGS geoscientists use BGS•SIGMAmobile {{in some of the}} harshest environments in the world from the sweltering heat of the Emirates to subzero temperatures in the Antarctic, encompassing all possible terrains in between from the tropical rainforests of Madagascar to the Cairngorm Mountains in Scotland (see Figure 1). Following an evaluation of existing technologies in 2001, it was evident that none provided the functionality to collect the full range of data required by BGS geoscientists. We began by developing a PDA (<b>Personal</b> <b>Digital</b> Assistant) <b>system</b> for point data capture, however the advent of rugged Tablet PCs with their larger screens and increased processing power meant that full digital survey and mapping tools could be placed into the geologists’ hands.

The result is an integrated field mapping system based on those software packages that has been successfully implemented in many geoscience applications from traditional geological mapping to landslide monitoring and earthquake damage assessment.

Since {{today more}} and more {{complementary}} information is available in different electronic media there is an increasing demand for the integration of traditional <b>digital</b> library <b>systems</b> and multimedia systems. In this paper we present the OMNIS/ 2 system, which is an advanced meta system and enhances existing <b>digital</b> library <b>systems</b> or retrieval systems by additional storing and indexing of user-defined multimedia documents, automatic and personal linking concepts, annotations, filtering and personalization. 1 The key concept of OMNIS/ 2 {{is that all of}} the above mentioned features are accomplished without changing the underlying documents.

40|$|Background/Objective: Proficiency in {{computerized}} documentation {{systems is}} {{an essential element of}} most areas of nursing practice today. Community health is one example of an area of nursing practice where computerized documentation systems help in the provision of high quality care. Nursing students must learn the basic principles of and begin to participate in the practices of computerized nursing documentation. It is, therefore, the responsibility of nursing faculty to promote student involvement in this important process. Methods: Two different faculty experiences with students participating in computerized nursing documentation were described using different electronic systems, a notebook computer <b>system</b> and a <b>Personal</b> <b>Digital</b> Assistant (PDA) <b>system.</b> Results/Conclusions: After reviewing the results of this descriptive experience, it is recommended that before students participate in computerized documentation, they receive written instructions. Sample charts, practice under direct faculty and staff guidance, and standardizing the learning experience are imperative. Educating the student in a technological environment is no longer optional for nurse faculty as the accurate documentation, transmission and management of data assures that the best practices are maintained, the proper billing of visits can be ensured, and the communication between the nursing student and community health nurses, as well as all members of the multi-disciplinary team is fostered. </p...|$|R
