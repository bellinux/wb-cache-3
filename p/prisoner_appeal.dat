There was a Royal Commission into the Massacre and Hotham wasn't blamed, probably because Hotham's critics were not heard. Hotham's post was raised to a full governorship on 3 February 1855.|$|R

2500|$|The Spanish Church {{approved}} of the White Terror and cooperated with the rebels. According to Antony Beevor: [...] "Cardinal Gomá stated that 'Jews and Masons poisoned the national soul with absurd doctrine'... A few brave priests put their lives at risk by criticizing nationalist atrocities, {{but the majority of}} the clergy in nationalist areas revelled in their new-found power and the increased size of their congregations. Anyone who did not attend Mass faithfully was likely to be suspected of 'red' tendencies. Entrepreneurs made a great money selling religious symbols... It was reminiscent of the way the Inquisition's persecutions of Jews and Moors helped make pork such {{an important part of the}} Spanish diet." [...] One witness in Zamora said: [...] "Many priests acted very badly. The bishop of Zamora in 1936 was more or less an assassinI don't remember his name. He must be held responsible because <b>prisoners</b> <b>appealed</b> to him to save their lives. All he would reply was that the Reds had killed more people than the falangist were killing." [...] Nevertheless, the Nationalists killed at least 16 Basque nationalist priests (among them the arch-priest of Mondragon), and imprisoned or deported hundreds more. Several priests who tried to halt the killings and at least one priest who was a Mason were killed.|$|R
25|$|According to Article 475 of the Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure, {{the death}} penalty must be {{executed}} within {{six months after the}} failure of the <b>prisoner's</b> final <b>appeal</b> upon an order from the Minister of Justice. However, the period requesting retrial or pardon is exempt from this regulation. Therefore, in practice, the typical stay on death row is between five and seven years; a quarter of the prisoners have been on death row for over ten years. For several, the stay has been over 30 years (Sadamichi Hirasawa died of natural causes at the age of 95, after awaiting execution for 32 years).|$|R

50|$|Since the {{abolition}} of the death penalty in the Netherlands in 1870, life imprisonment has almost always meant imprisonment until death; unlike in other countries in Europe, there is no possibility of parole for anyone sentenced to life imprisonment. Though the <b>prisoner</b> can <b>appeal</b> for pardon, it must be granted by royal decree; since the 1970s, only two such pardons have been successful, both being terminally ill. Since 1945, 41 criminals (excluding war criminals) have been sentenced to life imprisonment. There has been a noticeable increase of life imprisonment sentences being given in the last decade, and more than triple the number of life imprisonment sentences {{in the last few years}} than the previous decades.|$|R
5000|$|Fitzgerald {{was educated}} at Ladycross Preparatory School in Seaford, and then Downside School in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, Somerset, England, where he joined Barlow House. [...] Dom Raphael Appleby, the house master, {{introduced}} him to the art of debate and honed his skills. He also encouraged the boys to help those less fortunate than themselves with visits to the nearby Cheshire Homes, and thus encouraged them to bring justice and peace to the oppressed. Dom Raphael {{introduced him to}} the concept of social justice and encouraged thought about prisons and prisoners. Another of this monk’s beliefs was that problems and disputes should be resolved by argument. Fitzgerald went on to study at Corpus Christi College, Oxford where he read Literae Humaniores (Classics), and graduated with a Congratulatory First. [...] At Oxford, Fitzgerald played rugby for Corpus Christi, became involved in College politics, was elected secretary of the Junior Common Room, spoke regularly at the Oxford Union, wrote for the University paper, and edited the College magazine. After finishing his degree, Fitzgerald signed up to the two-year Bar course and then took a year off. He volunteered as a drama teacher at Kingswood reformatory, Bristol, for six months where Derek Bentley had been sent several years before. This proved to be inspirational and he decided that working with <b>prisoners</b> <b>appealed</b> to him. Halfway through the year, he moved to work for Mind. He then resumed his legal career with a one-year pupillage, before going up to Cambridge. Fitzgerald studied at the Institute of Criminology, Cambridge, leaving with a Master of Philosophy degree. He also qualified in New York and in American law.|$|R

On 12 July 1517 he sold concessions to soap production on the island of São Miguel to Henrique de Bettencourt.|$|R
50|$|An 1822 law allowed debtors {{freedom to}} roam a six-acre {{plot of the}} city (known as being 'on the liberty') if someone would post a bond on their behalf. This allowed them to work within those {{constrained}} limits and earn the money for their freedom. Reform politician John Rolph introduced a bill to abolish imprisonment for debt in 1829 but it was defeated by the Family Compact. The laws remained basically unchanged into the 1850s. The only alteration was in 1836, when the indefinite imprisonment until the debt was paid was reduced. A <b>prisoner</b> could <b>appeal</b> for release after 3 months for debts below £20; after 6 months for debts between £20 and £100; and after a year for debts greater than £100. They still remained liable for the debt.|$|R
50|$|In his {{conviction}} for murder to life imprisonment in July 2003, the court established his grave level of guilt (besondere Schwere der Schuld).

His complaint to the Federal Constitutional Court was rejected in December 2004. In 2005, he filed a complaint against Germany at the European Court of Human Rights (partially won in 2010: Germany was convicted for violation of article 3 ECHR (Prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment) but was acquitted for violation of article 6 (Right to a fair trial)). Additionally, he sued the state of Hesse and demanded compensation for allegedly suffering trauma after being threatened with torture, however, he lost the case.|$|R
40|$|As a class, {{prisoners are}} {{vulnerable}} to numerous privations while in custody. In particular, prisoners are at a distinct disadvantage {{in terms of being}} able to control the central features of their daily lives. The lives of prisoners are circumscribed by numerous rules and regulations and their administration by correctional administrators. It is important that prisoners are aware of the content of the rules that govern their existence and the precise basis upon which power is exercised over them. In a recent freedom of information application in Victoria, a prisoner sought a personal copy of the rules that would govern his life in that particular institution. The prison authorities refused that request. The <b>prisoner</b> then <b>appealed</b> that decision to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal and was unsuccessful. It is contended that the analysis used in that case was flawed through the misreading of the nature of correctional environment and the fundamental importance of transparency in such a context. <br /...|$|R
40|$|From early times law {{enforcement}} authorities have utilized informers. Their value in ferreting out crime was recognized in the ancient practice of English medieval law called approvement. Being arraigned {{on a charge of}} treason or felony the approver confessed his guilt and, in order to obtain a pardon, offered to appeal and convict other criminals called the appellees. If the appellees were found guilty the approver was pardoned. If the appellees were acquitted, the approver was hanged. The approvement was open to obvious abuses and Sir Matthew Hale observed that 2 ̆ 2 this course of admitting of approvers hath been long disused, and the truth is, that more mischief hath come to good men by these kind of approvements by false accusations of desperate villains, than benefit to the public by the discovery and convicting of real offenders, gaolers for their own profits often constraining <b>prisoners</b> to <b>appeal</b> honest men. 2 ̆...|$|R
