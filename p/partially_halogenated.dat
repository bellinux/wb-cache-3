50|$|A {{variety of}} {{reagents}} {{have been used}} to dope PTs. Iodine and bromine produce highly conductive materials, which are unstable owing to slow evaporation of the halogen. Organic acids, including trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, and sulfonic acids produce PTs with lower conductivities than iodine, but with higher environmental stabilities. Oxidative polymerization with ferric chloride can result in doping by residual catalyst, although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) studies have shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene)s are also <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> by the residual oxidizing agent. Poly(3-octylthiophene) dissolved in toluene can be doped by solutions of ferric chloride hexahydrate dissolved in acetonitrile, and can be cast into films with conductivities reaching 1 S/cm. Other, less common p-dopants include gold trichloride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coupling {{agents are}} used in wood plastic {{composites}} to improve interfacial adhesion between natural fibers and polymers. However, improvement in interfacial adhesion leads to increased melt viscosity, thereby affecting the processing rate. To overcome this limitation, viscosity modifiers are added. Since interface modifiers and viscosity modifiers are chemically active substances, {{there is a high}} possibility of interactions between them. To investigate this point, the effect of interactions between viscosity modifiers and an interface modifier on melt flow viscosity and mechanical properties of the composite were analyzed. The results showed that the acrylated maleated polyethylene based interface modifier interacts synergistically with the <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> viscosity modifier, whereas its interaction is antagonistic with the carboxylic acid amide based viscosity modifier.

40|$|The study {{identifies}} the main fields of political {{activities of the}} EU that {{have an impact on}} the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), names the regulations (Directives, Regulations and Programmes) adopted and planned in those areas and evaluates their relevance for climate policy. Furthermore, the political options and room for manoeuvre as well as the probable implementation opportunities, especially during the German Council Presidency in the first half of 1999 are discussed. In addition to the most important GHG CO_ 2, methane (CH_ 4), nitrous oxide (N_ 2 O), <b>partially</b> and fully <b>halogenated</b> fluorocarbons (HFCs and PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF_ 6) are considered in the study. Apart form measures of climate policy aiming directly at a reduction of GHGs, the analysis includes activities which have an indirect impact. The latter are to be found mainly in the policy areas of energy, agriculture and forestry, transportation, the environment and in the promotion of regional development (structural policies) within the EU. The report comes to the conclusion that the implemented climate policy measures of the EU are currently limited to the GHG CO_ 2, focusing on selected aspects of energy policy. Apart form this, several announcements and proposals exist. In case of their implementation, measures taken on the European level could prove sufficient alone to reduce GHG emissions of the EU by 8 % until 2008 - 2012 as envisaged in the Kyoto Protocol. This would strengthen the leadership role of the EU proclaimed internationally. However, it is the implementation of proposed regulations which constitutes the weak point of EU climate policy. A collection of the legislative initiatives with the greatest relevance to climate policy points to the most important areas of activities for an effective EU climate policy. (orig.) Die Studie identifiziert die wesentlichen politischen Handlungsfelder der EU mit Einfluss auf die Emissionen von Treibhausgasen (THG), benennt die bisherigen und geplanten Regelungen und Aktivitaeten (Richtlinien, Verordnungen und Programme) in diesen Bereichen und bewertet ihre klimapolitische Relevanz. Weiterhin werden die politischen Handlungsspielraeume und voraussichtlichen Umsetzungsmoeglichkeiten, insbesondere unter der deutschen Ratspraesidentschaft Anfang 1999, diskutiert. Neben dem massgeblichen THG CO_ 2 werden Methan (CH_ 4), Lachgas (N_ 2 O), teilhalogenierte Fluorkohlenwasserstoffe (H-FKW), perfluorierte Kohlenwasserstoffe (FKW) und Schwefelhexafluorid (SF_ 6) in der Untersuchung beruecksichtigt. Neben unmittelbar klimapolitischen Massnahmen, die direkt auf eine THG-Reduktion abzielen, werden auch indirekt wirksame Aktivitaeten in die Bewertung einbezogen. Letztere sind vor allem in den Bereichen Energiepolitik, Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Verkehrspolitik, Foerderung der Regionalentwicklung (Strukturpolitik) in der EU und in der Umweltpolitik zu finden. Ergebnis der Studie ist, dass sich existierende klimapolitische Massnahmen der EU bislang auf das Treibhausgas CO_ 2 beschraenken und sich hier wiederum auf Teilbereiche der Energiepolitik konzentrieren. Daneben existieren eine Reihe von Ankuendigungen und Vorschlaegen. Im Falle von deren entschiedener Umsetzung koennte das im Kioto-Protokoll fuer die EG verankerte Minderungsziel von 8 % voraussichtlich allein durch Massnahmen auf der europaeischen Ebene erreicht und so die international proklamierte Vorreiterrolle untermauert werden. Genau in der Umsetzung von Regelungsvorschlaegen liegt aber die Schwaeche der EG-Klimapolitik. Eine Zusammenstellung der klimapolitisch bedeutsamsten Rechtsetzungsinitiativen zeigt die wichtigsten Handlungsbereiche fuer eine wirksame EG-Klimapolitik auf. (orig.)

30|$|The {{amount of}} {{chemicals}} with high ODP produced worldwide has decreased following the Montreal protocol and further international treaties. Because {{of the high}} volatility of the substances in question, the real decontamination of the technosphere can only be demonstrated by measurements in the troposphere followed by model calculations {{for the development of}} the ozone concentration. As a result of the implementation of the conventions mentioned before, the concentration of chlorine and of fully halogenated CFCs is decreasing, whereas the amount of <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> chemicals like HCFCs is increasing again. The influence of improper waste management on the overall development cannot be assessed quantitatively. But closing the sources of illegal emission of Freon compounds would help to revitalize the earth’s ozone belt years earlier. The decontamination of the stratosphere will need a lot of time. Actually, the ozone layer is expected to return to its pre- 1980 levels around the middle of the 21 st century [49].|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{have made}} a {{literature}} survey and performed a critical analysis of the available experimental surface tension data for the most volatile compounds in petroleum fluids: nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane. Including the selected data with those for oxygen, xenon, krypton and those obtained recently for 16 <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> hydrocarbons (refrigerants), we propose the following extended scaled equation to represent the surface tension of these substances:σ=kTc(NAVc) 2 / 3 (4. 35 + 4. 14 ω) t 1. 26 (1 + 0. 19 t 0. 5 - 0. 25 t) where t= 1 -T/Tc is reduced temperature, k, NA, Vc, and ω are the Boltzmann constant, Avogadro number, the critical volume and the acentric factor, respectively.

40|$|We have charted a symmetry-based {{approach}} to complex, dimeric {{members of the}} pyrrole–imidazole family of alkaloids; palau'amine, axinellamines, massadines and ageliferin. New methods to prepare and manipulate bis-guanidine containing intermediates in this context are discussed. These efforts culminated in the synthesis of a <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> variant of the complete (±) -axinellamine A ring system and the total synthesis of (±) -ageliferin from a common spirocyclopentane intermediate. A novel N-amidinyliminium ion rearrangement was examined for the requisite ring-expansion to provide the 2 -aminotetrahydrobenzimidazole core of ageliferin directly. This method was applied to epimeric intermediates to obtain structurally novel tetracycles coined ‘iso’axinellamines. We proposed access to (±) -axinellamine A via controlled oxidation and subsequent ring-contraction of (±) -ageliferin. This led us to examine oxidative methods for the transformation of 2 -aminotetrahydrobenzimidazoles. Progress toward the synthesis of (−) -ageliferin via the oxidative desymmetrization of symmetric 2 -aminotetrahydrobenzimidazole intermediates is discussed. Additionally, we report synthetic access to functionalized 3, 3 '-bipyrrolidines, coined ‘dispacamide dimer precursors’, for the synthesis of complex pyrrole&# 8722;imidazole dimers. The dimeric framework was obtained by a diastereoselective, nickel-catalyzed reductive homocoupling of an unactivated secondary bromide derived from trans- 4 -hydroxy-L-proline. Dimeric precursors were desymmetrized by an auto-oxidative process. The method involves a cascading sequence of indiscrete oxidation and guanidine incorporation events followed by desymmetrization...|$|E

This type of plant is applied to a commercially available cold store, generally adopted for preservation of foodstuff. Its working is regulated by on/off cycles of the compressor, operating at the nominal frequency of 50 Hz, imposed by the classical thermostatic control. The problems related to {{the replacement of the}} fully halogenated chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs) and of the <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> (HCFCs) have been only partially solved. As for R 22, there is no unanimous solution for its substitution. In this paper, the refrigerant fluid experimentally tested as a substitute for R 22 is the non-azeotropic mixture R 417 A. R 417 A is a non-ozone depleting long term replacement for R 22, which can be used in new and existing direct expansion systems using traditional R 22 lubricants. R 417 A provides an easy solution to the legislation requirement, since it presents an ozone depletion potential equal to zero, and it does not require a change of lubricant type, equipment redesign or significant modifications. The experimental analysis has allowed the determination of the best energetic performances of R 22 in comparison with those of R 417 A in terms of the coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency, exergy destroyed in the plant components and other variables characterizing the refrigeration plant performance...|$|E
40|$|We {{have become}} {{increasingly}} aware of the fundamental importance of water, and aqueous alteration, on primitive solar-system bodies. All classes of astromaterials studied show some degree of interaction with aqueous fluids. Nevertheless, we are still lacking fundamental information such as the location and timing of the aqueous alteration and the detailed nature of the aqueous fluids. Halite crystals in two meteorite regolith breccias were found to contain aqueous fluid inclusions (brines) trapped approx. 4. 5 BYBP. Heating/freezing studies of the aqueous fluid inclusions in these halites demonstrated that they were trapped near 25 C. The initial results of our O and H isotopic measurements on these brine inclusions {{can be explained by}} a simple model mixing asteroidal and cometary water. We have been analyzing solids and organics trapped alongside the brines in the halites by FTIR, C-XANES, SXRD and Raman, as clues to the origin of the water. The organics show thermal effects that span the entire range witnessed by organics in all chondrite types. Since we identified water-soluble aromatics, including <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> methanol, in some of the halite, we suspected amino acids were also present, but have thus far found that levels of amino acids were undetectable (which is very interesting). We have also been locating aqueous fluid inclusions in other astromaterials, principally carbonates in CI and CM chondrites. Although we have advanced slowly towards detailed analysis of these ancient brines, since they require techniques right at or just beyond current analytical capabilities, their eventual full characterization will completely open the window onto the origin and activity of early solar system water...|$|E

40|$|DE 102006019461 A 1 UPAB: 20080208 NOVELTY - An etchant {{capable of}} being {{activated}}, {{is added to the}} liquid jet (1). It is activated after leaving the nozzle which produces the jet. Activation is effected by irradiation using an annular radiation source (3) close to the jet. Irradiation is at right angles to the jet. A reflective surface (2, 2 ') at least part-surrounds the jet. Photo- and/or thermochemical activation takes place. Irradiation takes place in the W band of electromagnetic radiation, resulting in photochemical activation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Alternatively, infra red radiation promotes thermochemical activation. In a further variant, the visible waveband is used, causing photochemical activation. The light is incoherent and continuous, or it is pulsed. Ultraviolet light is provided by e. g. a mercury lamp, photodiode and/or a flash lamp. In addition, the location on the solid where the jet impinges, is irradiated using one of the above methods. The etchant is a water-free halogen- containing organic or inorganic compound or mixture. It is a straight chain, branched, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic C 1 -C 12 hydrocarbon which is at least <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated.</b> It is e. g. carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, bromoform, dichloromethane or a mixture of them. A wide range of further examples is specified in accordance with these principles, including diverse sulfur-, phosphorous- and ammonium compounds. Lewis-acids may be employed, especially boron trichloride or aluminum trichloride. The etchant includes at least one radical initiator, e. g. dibenzoyl peroxide or azo-isobutyronitrile. A radiation absorber is included, e. g. a dye, especially eosin, fluoroscene, phenolphthalein and/or Bengal red. It is alternatively a polycyclic aromatic compound, especially pyrene or napthacene. A solid body of silicon is used. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR corresponding apparatus. USE - To etch material from solids including semiconductor wafers, using an activated liquid jet. To cut, microstructure, dope solids, make local deposits, cut trenches and/or conduct metallization of solids or silicon wafers. (All claimed). Wafers may be cut from the single crystal by parallel jets. ADVANTAGE - The apparatus used, is not damaged by the etchant. This is because the etchant is not activated until after it has left the nozzle and is in flight. Virtually all of the activated etchant has sufficient life to reach and act upon the solid. Illumination of the jet at right angles, minimizes irradiation of and consequent undesired effects on the solid, avoiding problems of earlier laser-irradiation systems. Process efficiency is increased by mirrors, which are optionally elliptical, with the source at one focus, the jet at the other. Irradiation generates highly-reactive free radicals of e. g. chlorine, which etch silicon both directly and rapidly. Technical implementation is simple. Outstanding material removal is assured.

30|$|Freon gases from refrigerators, freezers, air {{condition}} equipment, and heat pumps shall be recovered for destruction, recycling or reclamation [39]. The destruction of Freon is regulated to avoid improper disposal techniques: Rotary kiln is approved {{for all types}} of ODS, municipal waste incineration is approved only for foams, and some plasma arc methods are approved for ODS with the exception of foams [39]. With respect to the WEEE directive [20], used refrigerators, freezers, and other electric and electronic devices have to be collected separately. The producers are obliged to take back used items and to pay for recycling and disposal. German authorities [40] urge companies running e-waste recycling facilities to recover 90 % of the Freon compounds from used devices including the isolation foam of freezers. To prevent improper recycling, the export of unusable devices in non-EU countries has been prohibited. In daily life, the success of these efforts is rather poor: The yearly minimum collection target within the EU is 4 kg per inhabitant (4 kg inh- 1 yr- 1) with respect to all waste from electric and electronic equipment. In 2008, about 6.95 kg inh- 1 yr- 1 have been collected in the European Union, whereas the overall amount of waste from electric and electronic devices was about 20.8 kg inh- 1 yr- 1. (The latter figure has been calculated using an empirical correlation published by Huisman [41].) According to European statistics, freezers and refrigerators are recorded in the category of large household appliances (“white goods”). Therefore, we have only few data concerning the recycling of used appliances containing Freon compounds. Actually, most of the devices to be disposed contain either F- 11 /F- 12 or the successor products, i.e. <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> hydrocarbons like F- 22 or fluorinated hydrocarbons. In new refrigerators, pentane is used as cooling agent. In the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen (17.8 Mio inhabitants), 550, 000 to 600, 000 refrigerators have to be disposed per year. Until 2014, more than 50 % of these devices will be contaminated with CFCs because of the long lifetime of household refrigerators [42]. Due to compulsory Freon elimination before metal recovery, the costs for the recycling of freezers are normally higher than the earnings from scrap. Therefore, refrigerators which do not work any longer (broken) cannot be sold by their owners. This might be the reason for the relatively high amount of refrigerators collected in comparison with other household appliances reported from the Dutch waste collection [43]. A considerable percentage of refrigerators and freezers are severely damaged by informal collectors who cut out copper tubes and compressors. Statistical data about these emissions are normally not found in government reports. Following an assumption by a German NGO, about 45 % of Freon compounds from household appliances are emitted [44]. The problems show primarily up with kerbside collection. In the city of Düsseldorf (~ 600, 000 inhabitants), about 70 % of the freezers and refrigerators declared for e-waste collection are damaged or stolen [45]. But also appliances brought to recycling yards are sometimes damaged. In the recycling facilities, Freon compounds used in the compressor and in the isolation must be separated in a first step. The recovery target for these contaminants is 90 % according to German authorities [40]. Following some random samples [46], the recovery targets are not met by most recycling facilities. The emissions from German point sources in 2009 add up to 0.82 Mg CFCs and 21.9 Mg HCFCs, respectively (data taken from [47]). Assuming a mean amount of 250 g Freon in a refrigerator, 2.5 million items to be disposed per year of which 50 % are filled with CFCs and 45 % loss during collection, the overall emission from this source is about 140 Mg per year. Thus, the diffuse sources mainly caused by improper waste management are far more important than the point sources.|$|E
40|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is a large}} photochemical reactor consisting primarily of N 2 (~ 78 %) and O 2 (~ 21 %) with Ar and water vapor being the next most abundant constituents. All of the remaining gases in the atmosphere {{are referred to as}} 'trace gases', and they {{play a critical role in}} understanding climate change, urban air quality, ozone production and depletion, and in determining the overall 'health' of the atmosphere. These trace components are present in our atmosphere with mixing ratios, i. e., mole fractions, ranging from sub parts per trillion to several hundred parts per million. One class of trace constituents that play a critical role in atmospheric chemistry are free radicals. Free radicals are highly reactive, often initiating the oxidation of natural and anthropogenic atmospheric species, thereby often controlling the fate and lifetimes of these species. The research comprising this dissertation focuses on laboratory studies of the kinetics and mechanisms of free radical (atomic halogen) reactions that can impact the levels of important trace atmospheric species. In the studies reported herein, laser flash photolysis (LFP) was coupled with time resolved atomic resonance fluorescence (RF) spectroscopic detection of Cl or Br atoms to investigate halogen atom chemistry. The research addresses three groups of reactions: Cl atom reactions with alkyl bromides, Cl and Br-initiated oxidations of small (C 2 -C 6) alkenes, and Cl reactions with CH 3 SCH 3 (DMS, dimethylsulfide) and CH 3 SeCH 3 (DMSe, dimethylselenide). The alkyl bromide reactions were experimentally unique in that we were able to deduce kinetics of the Cl atom reaction with bromoethane, n-bromopropane, and 1, 2 -dibromoethane by monitoring the appearance of the Br product by LFP-RF. The Br is formed via elimination that occurs essentially instantaneously following β-H abstraction by the Cl atom. All three of the bromoalkanes investigated are emitted into the atmosphere primarily from anthropogenic sources and all three have been identified by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as very short-lived (lifetime less than 6 months) source gases with significant ozone depletion potentials (ODPs). Additionally, the bromoalkanes mentioned above have been of interest as model compounds for larger <b>partially</b> <b>halogenated</b> organics found in the atmosphere, and they have been considered as potential replacement compounds for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that have been banned as a result of the Montreal Protocol. Brominated very short-lived compounds are thought to contribute 20 - 25 % of total stratospheric bromine. Thus, there is considerable interest in understanding the atmospheric chemistry of even the most short-lived organic bromine compounds. Temporal profiles of Br atoms provided important kinetic and mechanistic insight for the reactions over a wide range of temperature and pressure. Temperature-dependent rate coefficients are determined for the alkyl bromides of interest for the first time, and the potential importance of the Cl reaction as an atmospheric degradation pathway for each alkyl bromide is qualitatively assessed. The studies of halogen atom reactions with alkenes focused on formation of weakly-bound adducts where kinetics of adduct formation and dissociation as well as non-adduct forming channels were evaluated. The elementary steps in the Br initiated oxidation of the alkenes 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -butadiene (isoprene), 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -butene (tetramethylethylene, TME), and 1, 3 -butadiene have been investigated. The experimental kinetic database for these reactions is quite sparse. The kinetic results reported herein, suggests that Br reaction with the above olefins is much faster than previously thought. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the "approach to equilibrium" kinetic data in conjunction with electronic structure calculations allows for determination of enthalpy and entropy changes associated with each addition reaction. Where possible, both forward addition and reverse dissociation channels as well as H-abstraction pathways were characterized. The enthalpy change associated with the addition reaction to give the Br−isoprene and Br− 1, 3 -butadiene adducts has been determined for the first time and the bond dissociation enthalpy obtained for the Br−TME adduct is in reasonable agreement with the only other previously reported value. It should be noted that in the case of isoprene and 1, 3 -butadiene, there are multiple possible adducts that could be formed. In order to help clarify which adducts are more or less likely to be formed, we rely on electronic structure calculations (see Chapter 5) to aid in our overall understanding of the adduct forming channels. Furthermore, for the Br reactions with the three alkenes above, atomic Br kinetics have been monitored directly both in the absence and in the presence of O 2 which allowed, for the first time, determination of rate coefficients for the elementary steps in the overall complex mechanism including determination of the Br−olefin + O 2 rate coefficient. Also included in this group of reactions is the chlorine reaction with isoprene. In addition to the well-known fact that isoprene is emitted into the atmosphere from vegetation, a potentially significant marine source of isoprene has received considerable attention. Chlorine has long been thought to exist primarily in marine environments, however, recent findings also suggest a significant Cl production rate in the middle of the continental United States. There are numerous room temperature kinetic studies for the Cl + isoprene reaction in the literature, however, there is only one temperature dependent study reported. Current recommended 298 K rate coefficients for isoprene reactions suggest the Cl reaction is ~ 4 x faster than the analogous OH reaction. If indeed this is the case, the Cl reaction could play a non-neglibible role in isoprene oxidation in atmospheric locales where Cl concentrations are relatively high. In addition, the C−Cl bond strength in Cl−C 5 H 8 is obtained from direct measurements of the forward and reversible addition rate coefficients. Our results are compared with the literature data, and the potential importance of Cl-initiated oxidation as an atmospheric sink for isoprene is assessed. The final group of reactions investigated involves reactions of Cl with DMS and DMSe. DMS and DMSe are the most prevalent sulfur and selenium compounds emitted to the atmosphere from the oceans. The oxidation of DMS has been studied extensively due to the interest in the possible role of DMS oxidation in the formation of sulfate aerosols, however, DMSe oxidation processes have hardly been studied at all. And, DMSe oxidation products are likely to be less volatile than the analogous DMS species. Selenium is an essential nutrient for many plants and animals; however, there is a fine line between enough and excess selenium which can be toxic. Most studies suggest that atmospheric deposition is an important source of Se contamination, and it is therefore critical to evaluate the source emissions and fate of Se in the atmosphere. Since the majority of atmospheric Se exists in the form of DMSe, determination of the kinetics and oxidation mechanisms of DMSe will go a long way towards understanding the global biogeochemical cycle of Se. Both reversible addition and H-abstraction pathways have been characterized, and the first experimental determination of bond strength of the gas-phase DMS−Cl and DMSe−Cl adducts have been obtained.
