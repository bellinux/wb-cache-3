40|$|Scoliosis is a {{deformity}} {{which tends}} to increase during growth. The origin ofthe deformity may be congenital, infantile, paralytic or idiopathic, but {{there is always a}} secondary or continuing factor, namely growth disturbance which leads to distortion of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs (Roaf 1960, Stilwell 1962). This inhibition of growth of a number of vertebrae acts as a tether producing secondary or “ delayed malformation “ (Willis 1958). If the retardation is mainly anterior there will be kyphosis similar to the progressive deformity seen in children with untreated tuberculosis of the spine. If the curve arrest is mainly anterior but also slightly lateral there will be kypho-scoliosis with slight lateral curvature and rotation-a deformity not infrequently associated with paraplegia (Fig. 1). Sometimes as a result of treatment, as for example by a <b>plaster</b> <b>bed</b> in hyperextension, the kyphosis may be converted into scoliosis with pronounced lateral curvature and rotation, suggesting that the tethering or growth inhibition has been shifted to one side (Fig. 2). if arrest of growth is predominantly on the lateral side of the spine there will be pure lateral curvature with little or no rotation of the vertebral bodies. This is often seen in congenital vertebral defects varying in severity from simple lateral wedging of on...|$|E
50|$|The {{focus of}} the {{cultural}} centre is the pottery and {{it is for this}} that the centre has become best known. The clay for the pots is all acquired locally from different areas and until recently preparing the clay for use was a time consuming process, using only simple <b>plaster</b> <b>beds.</b> In 1994 the centre invested in a variety of new equipment such as a mixer, filter press and pug mill which has reduced the preparation time from weeks to days.|$|R
40|$|Since its {{abandonment}} 185 years ago, the XII century Santa Maria de Bonaval Monastery {{located in}} Guadalajara (Spain) has suffered significant deterioration: first {{the roof was}} lost, followed by partial collapse of the walls, moisture infiltration and extensive loss of stone surfaces due to salt weathering. This case study is a clear example of the incompatibility of some building materials: in this case, the combination of sulphate-bearing mortars and magnesium-rich stone and mortars leading to extensive weathering by magnesium sulphate crystallization. Samples of <b>plaster,</b> <b>bedding</b> and core mortars, stone fragments and flakes, salt crust and powders were collected, as well stone samples from the historic quarries located close to the Monastery. Characterization by XRD (X-ray diffraction), ESEM-EDS (environmental scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) shows {{that the most important}} stone-type used in the structure, dolostone, is mainly affected by magnesium sulphate salts (epsomite, MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O), although other salts as kalicinite (KHCO 3) and mercallite (KHSO 4) were also detected. The connected porosity and pore size distribution determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry and capillarity behaviour suggest that the core mortar could easily be dissolved and the stone, <b>plaster</b> and <b>bedding</b> mortars are able to transport infiltrating solutions, giving rise to th...|$|R
40|$|The work {{deals with}} an {{integral}} {{approach to the}} characterisation of historical mortars coming from the Basilica of St. Lorenzo. The monument, {{one of the most}} important of Milan (Italy), has undergone various interventions during the last centuries. At the occasion of a recent conservation work various techniques (optical microscopy on thin sections, X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, thermal analyses, ion chromatography) were used in order to thoroughly analyse <b>plasters</b> and <b>bedding</b> mortars from the brick masonry. Investigations from various complementary points of view allowed the identification of the original components of the mortars, i. e. binder and aggregate fraction, and determination of the technology used. Moreover the nature of degradation compounds was elucidated, which enabled us to plan the optimal intervention...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} that the internal defect in cement mortar plaster finishing is found out before cement plaster is hardened. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the possibility of it by using an infrared thermography. The conclusion from experimental results is following; <b>Plastering</b> materials, its <b>bed</b> and measuring time of the day are not effect on inspection of defect. The inspection is possible if thickness of coating is 10 millimeter or less. The inspection without destruction of plastering materials is possible by using an infrared thermography...|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting for}} reply, {{she turned to}} her bedroom, which opened {{directly}} off the kitchen. It was a small room, eight by twelve, and the earthquake had left its marks upon the <b>plaster.</b> A <b>bed</b> and chair of cheap pine and a very ancient chest of drawers constituted the furniture. Saxon had known this chest of drawers all her life. The vision of it was woven into her earliest recollections. She knew it had crossed the plains with her people in a prairie schooner. It was of solid mahogany. One end was cracked and dented from the capsize of the wagon in Rock Canyon. A bullet-hole, plugged, {{in the face of the}} top drawer, told of the fight with the Indians at Little Meadow. Of these happenings her mother had told her; also had she told that the chest had come with the family originally from England in a day even earlier than the day on which George Washington was born.|$|R
