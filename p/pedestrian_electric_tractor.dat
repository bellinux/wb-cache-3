40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform a {{comparative}} lifecycle analysis of low sulfur diesel, compressed natural gas, and <b>electric</b> baggage <b>tractors</b> for United Airlines’ seven domestic hubs (SFO, LAX, DEN, IAH, ORD, EWR, and IAD). Both baggage tractor manufacturing burdens as well as fuel and electricity consumption burdens were modeled for the three different technologies. Due to a lack of baggage tractor specific fuel consumption and production data, this study relied heavily on information and assumptions in the GREET lifecycle model; MHDVs were used as proxies for determining CNG and LS diesel baggage tractor fuel consumption and emissions and an electric and ICEV pickup truck were used as proxies to model the production burdens of baggage tractors. Electricity generation mixes were approximated using NERC subregion mixes and eGrid data. The model shows that <b>electric</b> baggage <b>tractors</b> at each hub emit more vehicle lifecycle PM 10 emissions compared to CNG and LS diesel baggage <b>tractors.</b> <b>Electric</b> baggage <b>tractors</b> at most hub airports emit lower lifecycle GHG emissions compared to CNG and LS diesel baggage tractors, with the exception of <b>electric</b> baggage <b>tractors</b> at DEN and ORD airports emitting higher lifecycle CO 2 emissions compared to CNG <b>tractors.</b> <b>Electric</b> baggage <b>tractors</b> at DEN and ORD also emit higher SOx emissions as compared to the fossil fuel baggage <b>tractors,</b> and <b>electric</b> baggage <b>tractors</b> at EWR and IAH emit more SOx as compared to LS diesel. It is recommended that <b>electric</b> baggage <b>tractors</b> be used at SFO, LAX, IAH, EWR, and IAD airports, and CNG baggage tractors be used at ORD and DEN airports...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the main applications of electric vehicles in rural areas, {{pointing out the}} trends and challenges for the future. Technological conditions and difficulties faced by the industry for a wide dissemination of this technology are discussed. The paper described the main researches with proposals to overcome the problems of implementing <b>electric</b> <b>tractors,</b> as supply and electricity storage. Technical and economic comparisons between conventional internal combustion <b>tractors</b> and <b>electric</b> <b>tractors</b> are also presented and discussed. The paper showed the existence of barriers {{to the implementation of}} electric vehicles in rural areas, as well as the need for batteries technological evolution, which have high costs and for that reason they are very heavy for these purposes, but there are already systems that can be applied to minimize dependence of fossil fuels in this sector and increase the use of sustainable energy...|$|R

50|$|Vitte (pronounced: Fitte), first {{mentioned}} in 1513, {{is the main}} settlement and {{the largest and most}} central village on the island. The name is a derivation of vit; a word that was used to refer to places where fish was sold. In Vitte is the parish hall and council administration. In addition there is the ferry landing stage for the goods ferry that brings delivery and waste disposal vehicles from Schaprode on the island of Rügen. Goods are transferred to trailers that are pulled by <b>electric</b> <b>tractors</b> and distributed to the food markets and restaurants on the island. Sometimes smaller goods are still delivered by horse and cart. The heath landscape on Hiddensee, between Vitte and Neuendorf, is also part of Vitte. In Vitte is the oldest surviving house on the island, the Witch's House (Hexenhaus), the old summer house for Adolf Reichwein. In addition there is the last tented cinema and the Seebühne Hiddensee (a puppet theatre).|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{electrical}} conversion efficiency of an <b>electric</b> <b>tractor</b> motor, a load torque based control strategy (LTCS) is designed in this paper by using a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). By mathematically modeling electric-mechanical performance and theoretical energy waste of the electric motor, {{as well as the}} transmission characteristics of the drivetrain, the objective function, control relationship, and analytical platform are established. Torque and rotation speed of the motor’s output shaft are defined as manipulated variables. LTCS searches the working points corresponding to the best energy conversion efficiency via PSO to control the running status of the electric motor and uses logic and fuzzy rules to fit the search initialization for load torque fluctuation. After using different plowing forces to imitate all the common tillage forces, the simulation of traction experiment is conducted, which proves that LTCS can make the tractor use electrical power efficiently and maintain agricultural applicability on farmland conditions. It provides a novel method of fabricating a more efficient electric motor used in the traction of an off-road vehicle...|$|R

50|$|Previously the {{location}} of a railway goods yard with canal wharves off the Worcester and Birmingham Canal leading to Gas Street Basin, the site was {{the location}} of the Royal Mail's main sorting office building for Birmingham (hence its current name) which was completed in 1970, replacing the Victorian head post office (now Victoria Square House), in Victoria Square. The new building was designed by R. H. Ousman of the Ministry of Public Building and Works, who collaborated with project architect H. A. E. Giddings and with Hubbard Ford & Partners, who supplied E. Winters and R. Lee as architects. When completed, it was the largest mechanised letters and parcels sorting office in the country with a floor area of 20 acre and the largest building in Birmingham. A tunnel was constructed between the site and New Street railway station allowing <b>electric</b> <b>tractors</b> hauling carts carrying sacks of mail to be driven directly to the office.

50|$|Brush Electrical Engineering Company {{had been}} {{established}} in 1889, and had manufactured electric cars between 1901 and 1905. In 1940, Brush required some small <b>electric</b> <b>tractor</b> units, but as none were commercially available, they asked AE Morrison and Sons to produce a design for one. Morrisons produced a 3-wheeled design, which Brush then used to manufacture a number of units for internal use. They then began selling them to customers, shipping a large order to Russia in 1941. They expanded to producing battery electric road vehicles in 1945, when they bought designs and manufacturing rights from Metrovick. The Metrovick designs were for 4-wheeled vehicles, but they also produced 3-wheeled vehicles, which were marketed as the Brush Pony. In early 1949, they reduced the prices of their electric vehicles by around 25 per cent, {{in an attempt to}} make them more competitive with petrol vehicles. All of their road vehicles were sold through the motor trade, in order to achieve a good standard of after-sales service. Production of 4-wheeled battery electrics ceased in 1950, although the company continued to manufacture the 3-wheeled Brush Pony, and their range of industrial trucks. By 1969, Brush were owned by the Hawker Siddeley group, which also owned half of Morrison-Electricars, and manufacture of Brush electric vehicles moved to the newly established Morrison factory at Tredegar. Most were industrial trucks, but the transfer also included the Brush Pony, and a number were manufactured at Tredegar subsequently.|$|R
