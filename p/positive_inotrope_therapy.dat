40|$|OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a {{frequent}} complication of hospitalized patients {{that is associated with}} high mortality rate despite all developments. Continuous and intermittent hemodialysis are renal replacement treatment modalities for AKI. In our study we aimed to compare the mortality rates of continuous hemodialysis (CHD) and intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) in hospitalized patients. MATERIAL and METHODS: Seventy-two patients in Uludag University Hospital diagnosed with AKI in 2008 were enrolled our study. Intermittent or continuous hemodialysis was prescribed by the nephrology counsultant. Data were recorded from patients files retrospectively. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups (38 IHD, 34 CHD). Mortality rate (52, 6 %, 88, 2 %), oligoanuria (63. 2 %, 94. 1 %), <b>positive</b> <b>inotrope</b> <b>therapy</b> (28. 9 %, 85. 3 %), sepsis (15. 8 %, 55. 9 %), mechanical ventilation (15. 8 %, 76. 5 %), rate of surgery (2. 6 %, 32. 4 %) and the SOFA score (7. 1, 9. 5) were significantly higher in CHD group. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate was higher in CHD group, and this might be associated with the greater severity of problems such as hemodynamic instability, multi-organ dysfunction and co-morbid diseases in this group...|$|E

50|$|Several {{synthetic}} {{drugs have}} been developed that can act either as a stimulant or inhibitor inotrope.

Pimobendan also causes peripheral vasodilation by inhibiting the function of phosphodiesterase III.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study, we {{characterized}} 24 -month-old Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), their heart weights, and the responses of the isolated left ventricles to electrical stimulation. In the main part of the study, we tested whether the positive inotropic effects of BDF 9198, which prevents the closure of the cardiac sodium channel, were present in senescence and heart failure. Thus, we studied the effects of BDF 9198 on the left ventricle strips of 24 -month-old WKY rats (senescence) and SHRs using contractility methods. In comparison with WKY rats, the left ventricles of 24 -month-old SHRs were hypertrophied and had prolonged times to peak contraction. BDF 9198 (10 (- 8) to 10 (- 6) m) was a <b>positive</b> <b>inotrope</b> on the left ventricles of WKY rats, with a maximum augmenting effect of 122 % with BDF 9198 at 10 (- 7) m.

40|$|Introduction: A {{model for}} the {{cardiovascular}} and circulatory systems (CVS) has previously been validated in silico, {{as well as in}} porcine models of pulmonary embolism (PE), septic shock, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrations at different volemic levels. An accurate CVS system model can be used to monitor and diagnose dysfunction and support clinical decisions. This research validates this model with respect to <b>inotrope</b> <b>therapy</b> commonly used in circulatory support, prior to first human clinical trials. Method: The model and parameter identification process is used to study the effect of different adrenaline doses in healthy and critically ill patients. The hemodynamic effects on arterial blood pressures and stroke volume (cardiac index) are simulated in the model and adrenaline-specific parameters identified. These parameters are then used to capture and predict the future responses to a change in dose and-or over time. Results are compared to clinical data from 3 adrenaline published dosing studies, comprising a total of N= 37 data sets. Results: All identified parameter trends match clinically expected changes. The adrenaline-specific parameters are physiologically relevant. Absolute percentage errors for the patient-specific, predicted hemodynamic responses (N= 15) are within 10 % compared to clinical data. The adrenaline-specific parameters accurately and uniquely capture the impact of <b>inotrope</b> <b>therapy</b> on the CVS, independent of other model parameters. Conclusions: Clinically accurate prediction of the impact of circulatory support drugs, such as adrenaline, offers significant clinical potential for this type of model-based application. Overall, this work represents a further clinical validation of the underlying fundamental CVS model and methods, and their use for cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy selection in critical care. These results are presented as (further) justification for (beginning) human trials of this model-based diagnostic and therapeutic approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{test whether}} {{dofetilide}} has some potential {{for use in the}} treatment of heart failure. Dofetilide at {{less than or equal to}} 3 x 10 (- 5) m had no effect on the quiescent Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat aorta, mesenteric and intralobar arteries, or the spontaneous contractions of the WKY rat portal vein. Dofetilide at 10 (- 6) to 3 x 10 (- 5) m relaxed the KCl-contracted aorta. Dofetilide at 10 (- 9) - 10 (- 7) m augmented the force of contraction of left ventricle strips from 12 - and 18 -month-old WKY rats at 2 Hz. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) at 12 and 17 - 21 months of age are models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure, respectively. The augmentation of force at 2 Hz with dofetilide was similar on 12 - and 18 -month-old WKY rats and 12 -month-old SHRs but reduced on the 18 -month-old SHR left ventricle. At a higher more physiological frequency, 4 Hz, the threshold concentration of dofetilide required to augment the force responses of 21 -month-old SHR left ventricles was markedly increased and the maximum augmenting effect was decreased. Dofetilide at 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 5) m reduced the rate of the 17 -month-old WKY rat right atrium, and had a similar effect on age-matched SHR right atrium. In summary, dofetilide is a <b>positive</b> <b>inotrope</b> and negative chronotrope in the rat.

40|$|AIMS: Use of inotropic {{agents in}} {{patients}} with heart failure (HF) has been limited by adverse effects on outcomes. However, administration of <b>positive</b> <b>inotropes</b> at lower doses and concomitant treatment with beta-blockers might increase benefit-risk ratio. We investigated the effects of low doses of the <b>positive</b> <b>inotrope</b> enoximone on symptoms, exercise capacity, and major clinical outcomes {{in patients with}} advanced HF who were also treated with beta-blockers and other guideline-recommended background therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Studies of Oral Enoximone Therapy in Advanced HF (ESSENTIAL) programme consisted of two identical, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that differed only by geographic location (North and South America: ESSENTIAL-I; Europe: ESSENTIAL-II). Patients with New York Heart Association class III-IV HF symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 30 %, and one hospitalization or two ambulatory visits for worsening HF {{in the previous year}} were eligible for participation in the trials. The trials had three co-primary endpoints: (i) the composite of time to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, analysed in the two ESSENTIAL trials combined; (ii) the 6 month change from baseline in the 6 min walk test distance (6 MWTD); and (iii) the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) at 6 months, both analysed in each trial separately. ESSENTIAL-I and -II randomized 1854 subjects at 211 sites in 16 countries. In the combined trials, all-cause mortality and the composite, first co-primary endpoint did not differ between the two treatment groups [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 97; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 80 - 1. 17; and HR 0. 98; 95 % CI 0. 86 - 1. 12, respectively, for enoximone vs. placebo]. The two other co-primary endpoints were analysed separately in the two ESSENTIAL trials, as prospectively designed in the protocol. The 6 MWTD increased with enoximone, compared with placebo, in ESSENTIAL-I (P = 0. 025, not reaching, however, the pre-specified criterion for statistical significance of P < 0. 020), but not in ESSENTIAL-II. No difference in PGA was observed in either trial. CONCLUSION: Although low-dose enoximone appears to be safe in patients with advanced HF, major clinical outcomes are not improved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} assess the effects of {{combined}} oral positive inotropic and beta-blocker therapy in patients with severe heart failure. Background. Patients with severe, class IV heart failure who receive standard medical therapy exhibit a 1 -year mortality rate > 50 %. Moreover, such patients generally do not tolerate beta-blockade, a promising new therapy for chronic heart failure. <b>Positive</b> <b>inotropes,</b> including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, are associated with increased mortality when administered {{over the long term}} in these patients. The addition of a beta-blocker to positive inotropic therapy might attenuate this adverse effect, although long-term oral inotropic therapy might serve as a bridge to beta-blockade. Methods. Thirty patients with severe heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 17. 2 ± 1. 2 %, cardiac index 1. 6 ± 0. 1 liter/min per m 2) were treated with the combination of oral enoximone (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and oral metoprolol at two institutions. Enoximone was given at a dose of ≤ 1 mg/kg body weight three times a day. After clinical stabilization, metoprolol was initiated at 6. 25 mg twice a day and slowly titrated up to a target dose of 100 to 200 mg/day. Results. Ninety-six percent of the patients tolerated enoximone, whereas 80 % tolerated the addition of metoprolol. The mean duration of combination therapy was 9. 4 ± 1. 8 months. The mean length of follow-up was 20. 9 ± 3. 9 months. Of the 23 patients receiving the combination therapy, 48 % were weaned off enoximone over the long term. The LVEF increased significantly, from 17. 7 ± 1. 6 % to 27. 6 ± 3. 4 % (p = 0. 01), whereas the New York Heart Association functional class improved from 4 ± 0 to 2. 8 ± 0. 1 (p = 0. 0001). The number of hospital admissions tended to decrease during therapy (p = 0. 06). The estimated probability of survival at 1 year was 81 ± 9 %. Heart transplantation was performed successfully in nine patients (30 %). Conclusions. Combination <b>therapy</b> with a <b>positive</b> <b>inotrope</b> and a beta-blocker appears to be useful in the treatment of severe, class IV heart failure. It may be used as a palliative measure when transplantation is not an option or as a bridge to heart transplantation. Further study of this form of combined therapy is warranted...|$|R
40|$|As bstract. We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} the di-terpene compound forskolin in human myocardial ad-enylate cyclase preparations, isolated trabeculae and pap-illary muscles derived from failing human hearts, and acutely instrumented dogs. Forskolin was a potent, pow-erful activator of human myocardial adenylate cyclase and produced maximal effects that were 4. 82 (normally functioning left ventricle) and 6. 13 (failing left ventricle) fold greater than isoproterenol. In contrast to isoproter-enol, forskolin retained full activity in membrane prep-arations derived from failing hearts. In cyclase prepara-tions, forskolin demonstrated unique substrate and Mg 2 + kinetic properties that could be distinguished from hor-mone receptor-coupled agonists or fluoride ion. The ad-enylate cyclase stimulatory effect of forskolin was syn-ergistic with isoproterenol, apparently due to the location of forskolin activation being beyond the level ofhormone receptor-agonist in the receptor-cyclase complex. For-skolin was a potent <b>positive</b> <b>inotrope</b> in failing human myocardium, producing a stimulation ofcontraction that was similar to isoproterenol. Finally, in open chest dogs forskolin was a positive inotropic agent that reduced pre-load and afterload.

40|$|AbstractBeing {{the largest}} form of {{intravascular}} and tissue storage of nitric oxide (NO) and a signalling molecule itself, the nitrite anion (NO 2 −) {{has emerged as}} a key player in many biological processes. Since the heart is under an important NO-mediated autocrine–paracrine control, in mammals the cardiac effects of nitrite are under intensive investigation. In contrast, nothing is known in non-mammalian vertebrates. We evaluated nitrite influence on cardiac performance in the perfused beating heart of three different cold-blooded vertebrates, i. e. two teleost fishes, the temperate red-blooded Anguilla anguilla, the Antarctic stenotherm, hemoglobinless Chionodraco hamatus (icefish), and the frog Rana esculenta. We showed that, under basal conditions, in all animals nitrite influences cardiac mechanical performance, inducing negative inotropism in eel and frog, while being a <b>positive</b> <b>inotrope</b> in C. hamatus. In all species, these responses parallel the inotropic effects of authentic NO. We also demonstrated that the nitrite-dependent inotropic effects are i) dependent from NO synthase (NOS) activity in fish; ii) sensitive to NO scavenging in frog; iii) cGMP/PKG-dependent in both eel and frog. Results suggest that nitrite is an integral physiological source of NO and acts as a signalling molecule in lower vertebrate hearts, exerting relevant inotropic actions through different species-specific mechanisms...|$|R
