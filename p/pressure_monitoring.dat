40|$|Abstract: This {{application}} note presents {{the two main}} types of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors,</b> various measurement techniques, the functions of electrical components, and some crucial aspects that designers must consider when selecting products. Overview A blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor,</b> or sphygmomanometer, uses an inflatable air-bladder cuff and a listening device or pressure sensor to measure blood pressure in an artery. This monitoring can be performed by using either of two methods: a manually inflated cuff with a stethoscope for listening to arterial wall sounds (the auscultatory method), or a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor</b> that contains a pressure sensor for sensing arterial wall vibrations (the oscillometric method).

5000|$|Microlife's blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> and the {{technologies}} they house {{have been the}} subject of numerous studies and have been validated for both clinical and home use. One of Microlife's technologies is the atrial fibrillation detection incorporated into their blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors.</b> Their WatchBP Home A device was recommended by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013. WatchBP Home A was recommended to be used for hypertension monitoring and atrial fibrillation screening in primary care, using the device in primary care could increase the detection rate of atrial fibrillation compared with taking the pulse by hand. Microlife also patented the [...] "Microlife Average Mode" [...] (MAM), which is a feature in the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> that takes three consecutive readings and creates an average from that data. Pulse arrhythmia detection (PAD), which is another feature in some Microlife blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> that automatically detects irregular heartbeats, is another one of the company's primary technologies. Over their lifespan and their different iterations, Microlife blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> have been validated by the British Hypertension Society with their highest rating (AA).|$|R

25|$|Arterial {{monitoring}} systems {{are unable to}} predict changes in vascular tone; they estimate changes in vascular compliance. The measurement of pressure in the artery to calculate the flow in the heart is physiologically irrational and of questionable accuracy, and of unproven benefit. Arterial <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> is limited in patients off-ventilation, in atrial fibrillation, in patients on vasopressors, and in those with a dynamic autonomic system such as those with sepsis.|$|E

Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing {{the front of the}} car to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature is also on the current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E

25|$|For 2010, {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic. It included a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine producing 150 horsepower, a standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack and six speakers, a rear-mounted spoiler, standard air conditioning, standard cruise control, standard tire <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> system (TPMS), standard front and front and rear side SRS airbags, standard keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, standard ABS anti-lock brakes, standard sixteen-inch alloy wheels, and more. Optional features included leather seating surfaces, a power front driver's bucket seat, an engine block heater, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats. Pricing for the 2010 Chrysler PT Cruiser Classic, in MSRP, started at $18,275.00. Exterior color options were Bright Silver Metallic, Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat, Inferno Red Crystal Tinted Pearl Coat, Silver Steel Metallic, and Stone White Clear Coat. The only interior color option was Pastel Slate Gray.|$|E
25|$|In {{the safety}} aspect the Statesman comes with Bosch Electronic Stability Control, {{traction}} control, ABS brakes, EBD, BAS and a tyre <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> system as standard Front, side and curtain airbags come as standard {{which is another}} incentive to improve the Caprice's safety equipment, this {{also contributed to the}} fact that the Caprice’s safety rating surpass that off its main rival, the LTD. Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and breakaway brake pedal.|$|E
500|$|The 20th century saw the {{advancement}} of technologies that improved treatment and diagnosis such as the development of imaging tools including CT and MRI, and, in the 21st century, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The introduction of intracranial <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> in the 1950s has been credited with beginning the [...] "modern era" [...] of head injury. Until the 20thcentury, the mortality rate of TBI was high and rehabilitation was uncommon; improvements in care made during World War I reduced the death rate and made rehabilitation possible. Facilities dedicated to TBI rehabilitation were probably first established during World War I. Explosives used in World War I caused many blast injuries; {{the large number of}} TBIs that resulted allowed researchers to learn about localization of brain functions. [...] Blast-related injuries are now common problems in returning veterans from Iraq & Afghanistan; research shows that the symptoms of such TBIs are largely the same as those of TBIs involving a physical blow to the head.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, {{the company}} {{became the first}} medical {{diagnostics}} manufacturer to produce a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor</b> that detected both hypertension and atrial fibrillation (both of which are warning signs for stroke). Microlife entered into a partnership with PharmaSmart in 2012 {{in an effort to}} reach more consumers in the United States in need of personal blood pressure management devices. In 2013, Microlife received the Red Dot Design Award for its A6PC blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor</b> with stroke detection. They also received the award for Competitive Strategy Innovation and Leadership from Frost & Sullivan. In 2015, Microlife won a German design award for its A6PC blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor</b> with stroke risk detection.|$|R
50|$|First {{appearing}} in 2011, Blood <b>Pressure</b> <b>Monitor</b> was upgraded in March 2014 to a wireless version that connects through Bluetooth to both iOS and Android mobile devices.

The monitor measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} using data that was collected {{as part of the}} National Income Dynamic Study(NIDS). We hypothesized that in the NIDS study conducted in South Africa this phenomenon would be observed as a rise in the first blood pressure and a drop to normal on the second reading. We then set out to investigate whether this phenomenon would be more pronounced among those with limited access to medical services such as those in the rural areas, those from low-income homes, the population with little or no education and lastly the black or colored population. Our analysis revealed that the white coat effect did indeed exist significantly among black races and the colored race but was not dependent on sex, education level, or income level. Based on the inaccuracies that come from the white coat effect and the resulting preference for home or ambulatory blood pressure readings we then set out to investigate whether those with home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> would have better blood pressure control than those individuals without home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors.</b> This investigation was carried out in Zimbabwe for 10 weeks and will go on for a year. From the 10 week results, it would seem those individuals with home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> achieved better blood pressure control than individuals without home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors.</b> It seems this was a function of a higher number of clinic visits that were made by those with home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> compared to individuals who did not have home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors.</b> Thesi...|$|R
2500|$|Trepanation is a {{treatment}} used for epidural and subdural hematomas, and for surgical access for certain other neurosurgical procedures, such as intracranial <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring.</b> [...] Modern surgeons generally {{use the term}} craniotomy for this procedure. The removed piece of skull is typically replaced as soon as possible. [...] If the bone is not replaced, then the procedure is considered a craniectomy. Trepanation instruments are now available with diamond-coated rims, which are less traumatic than the classical trephines with sharp teeth. They are smooth to soft tissues and cut only bone.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, {{signs of}} {{elevated}} intracranial pressure, such as papilledema {{and loss of}} pupillary reflexes, are not reliable, and occur late in the disease process. [...] CT imaging of the brain is also unhelpful in detecting early cerebral oedema, but is often performed to rule out intra-cerebral bleeding. [...] Invasive intracranial <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> via subdural route is often recommended; however, the risk of complications must be weighed against the possible benefit (1% fatal haemorrhage). [...] The aim is to maintain intracranial pressures below 25mm Hg, and cerebral perfusion pressures above 50mm Hg.|$|E
