40|$|Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} is very common, {{but some}} of the cases do require hospitalization for treatment, particularly when older patients and/or co-morbidities are involved; both "typical" and "atypical" respiratory pathogens take part etiologically, and there is increasing concern about the emergence of resistance. There is interest in therapeutic options that can: a) comprehend such a spectrum of bacteria and resistance; b) allow parenteral to oral sequential treatment. We made a multicenter, prospective and randomized trial to compare the "standard" treatment of ceftriaxone IV alone or in combination with erythromycin IV, followed by clarithromycin PO (ceftriaxone treatment arm), with gatifloxacin IV, followed by oral administration (gatifloxacin treatment arm). The need for hospitalization was based on clinical criteria as judged by the investigators. Standardized criteria for diagnosis and follow-up were employed. Fifty-six patients were enrolled, with 48 % over 65 years old, and there were frequent co-morbidities. Of these, 51 were clinically evaluable, 26 in the gatifloxacin and 25 in the ceftriaxone arm, with comparable success rates, 92 % and 88 %, respectively, even when major prognostic factors were considered. There were no serious adverse events or significant laboratory value changes attributable to the study drugs. Gatifloxacin as monotherapy (initially IV then orally until completion of treatment) was shown to be effective and safe, comparable to ceftriaxone IV alone or in combination with a macrolide (initially IV then orally until completion of treatment), in empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonias, for patients that, at the <b>physician</b> <b>s</b> <b>discretion,</b> require initial treatment as inpatients...|$|E

40|$|The Federal Trade Commission 2 ̆ 7 s (2 ̆ 2 Commission”) {{decision}} in In re Kraft, Inc., shocked {{many members of}} the legal community. The decision reasserted the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s long dormant authority to disregard relevant extrinsic evidence and rely solely on its own reasoned analysis in determining whether an advertisement implicitly conveys deceptive claims. Viewed by many {{as an example of the}} Commission flexing its regulatory muscle, the decision was reminiscent of the expansive discretion asserted during the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s pre-Reagan era. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit reluctantly upheld the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s decision, solidifying the Commission 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> broad <b>discretion</b> to determine when commercial speech is deceptive and thereby exclude such speech from full constitutional protection. This Note analyzes the dilemma the Seventh Circuit faced in Kraft, Inc. v.

Part II begins by describing the basis of the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s authority to regulate advertising and how that authority is implemented, and then provides the factual background and procedural history of Kraft. Part III first provides an analysis of the standard for deception implemented by the Commission in advertising cases. Next, it provides an analysis of Kraft 2 ̆ 7 s principle arguments regarding extrinsic evidence and why those arguments succeed as a matter of policy but fail as a matter of law. Finally, it suggests that both the development of precedent and the issuance of policy statements have failed to adequately restrain the Commission 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>discretion</b> in the area of extrinsic evidence, and that administrative rulemaking would provide a more efficient and effective means of restraining the Commission 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>discretion.</b> Part IV concludes the note with a suggestion that the Commission initiate a rulemaking proceeding to clarify the area of reliance on extrinsic evidence...|$|R

40|$|The {{grand jury}} {{possesses}} an unqualified power to decline to indict - despite probable cause that alleged criminal conduct has occurred. A grand jury might exercise this power, for example, {{to disagree with}} the wisdom of a criminal law or its application to a particular defendant. A grand jury might also use its discretionary power {{to send a message}} of disapproval regarding biased or unwise prosecutorial decisions or inefficient allocation of law enforcement resources in the community. This ability to exercise discretion on bases beyond the sufficiency of the evidence has been characterized pejoratively as grand jury nullification. The dominant substantive critiques of grand jury nullification attack the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>discretion</b> in this regard as bad criminal justice policy at best and subversive {{of the rule of law}} at worst. Any acknowledgement of the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s discretionary power often is accompanied by concerns regarding the damage that critics perceive it to levy upon the criminal process. This Article argues that such concerns largely are unfounded and derive from a fundamental misunderstanding of the scope of the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>discretion</b> and its function in the constitutional structure. The Article defends grand jury discretion against the critique that it is necessarily inconsistent with the rule of law. It contends instead that grand jury discretion actually buttresses the rule of law by facilitating the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s structural role in the constitutional design as a check on the three branches of government and as a moderator of criminal law federalism. In addition, the Article maps the spectrum of discretion that is exercised by various actors throughout the criminal process and argues that the grand jury 2 ̆ 7 s discretionary power represents an appropriate, if not optimal, allocation of that discretion. Finally, the Article argues that grand jury discretion is desirable because it can enhance the administration of criminal justice - not only from an individual rights perspective but also from crime control and efficiency perspectives...|$|R

The behavior of strongmen diverges from that of more constrained military rulers in other areas, however. Military strongmen start more international wars than either military regimes or civilian dictators, perhaps because they have more reason to fear postouster exile, prison, or assassination. Fear of the future may also motivate their resistance to transition.

Finally, we design and run a new empirical test to verify our theoretical result.

This study aims to compare such perceptions in Canada, the United States (U. S.), and Norway. Methods We analyzed data from large, nationwide, representative samples of physicians in Canada (n =  3, 213), the U. S. (n =  6, 628), and Norway (n =  657), examining demographics, job satisfaction, and professional autonomy. Results Among U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians,</b> 79 % strongly agreed/agreed they could provide high quality patient care vs. only 46 % of Canadian and 59 % of Norwegian <b>physicians.</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians</b> also perceived more clinical autonomy and time with their patients, with differences remaining significant even after controlling for age, gender, and clinical hours. Women reported less adequate time, clinical freedom, and ability to provide high-quality care. Country differences were the strongest predictors for the professional autonomy variables. In all three countries, physicians’ perceptions of quality of care, clinical freedom, and time with patients influenced their overall job satisfaction. Fewer U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians</b> reported their overall job satisfaction to be at-least-somewhat satisfied than did Norwegian and Canadian <b>physicians.</b> Conclusions U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians</b> perceived higher quality of patient care and greater professional autonomy, but somewhat lower job satisfaction than their colleagues in Norway and Canada.
