40|$|Background: <b>Toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> {{is a rare}} but {{potentially}} fatal toxin-mediated febrile illness. Although classically associated with tampon use, it is now known that many nonmenstrual conditions are related to this syndrome. Serious morbidity and mortality can occur if this syndrome is not promptly recognized. Methods: MEDLINE was searched from 1978 to the present using the phrase “toxic shock syndrome. ” Case reports and articles related to tampon-associated <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> {{were excluded from the}} literature review except when defining <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> or discussing the cause of the syndrome. A case of nonmenstrual <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> associated with an intrauterine device and a review of the definition, cause, diagnostic criteria, and management are reported. Results and Conclusions: <b>Toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> can mimic many common diseases. Because it can be associated with a number of nonmenstrual-related conditions, patients with unexplained fever and rash and a toxic condition out of proportion to local findings should have the diagnosis of <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> in their differential diagnosis. Early recognition and aggressive management can decrease the overall morbidity and mortality. (J Am Board Fam Pract 2001; 14 : 131 – 6.) <b>Toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> is an acute, toxin-mediated febrile illness that rapidly leads to multiorgan system failure with serious morbidity and mortality. Although classically associated with tampon use, <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> has also been associated with a variety of nonmenstrual-related conditions. No reports in the literature have specifically cited a direct relation between <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> and intrauterine device (IUD) use. A case of <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> and septicemia associated with copper T IUD use is described, with a brief review of the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis of <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> Although the potential link between <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> and IUD use is equivocal, this case clearly illustrates that tampon use is not the only clinical situation associated with this syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Audience: This {{scenario}} {{was developed}} to educate emergency medicine residents on the diagnosis and management of a pediatric patient with <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> The case is also appropriate for teaching of medical students and advanced practice providers, {{as well as a}} review of the principles of crisis resource management, teamwork, and communication. Introduction: <b>Toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> is a low-frequency, high-acuity scenario requiring timely identification and aggressive management. If patients suffering from this condition are managed incorrectly, they may progress into multi-organ dysfunction and potentially death. <b>Toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> has been associated with Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus (Staph). Approximately half of Staph cases are associated with menstruation, which was first described in the 1970 s- 1980 s and was {{associated with the use of}} absorbent tampons. 1 Group A Streptococcus may cause complications such as necrotizing fasciitis and gangrenous myositis. 2 Pediatric patients may present critically ill from <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> Providers need to perform a thorough history and physical exam to discern the source of infection. Management requires aggressive care with antibiotics and IV fluids. Objectives: By the end of this simulation session, the learner will be able to: 1) Recognize <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> 2) Review the importance of a thorough physical exam. 3) Discuss management of <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome,</b> including supportive care and the difference in antibiotic choices for streptococcal and staphylococcal <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> 4) Appropriately disposition a patient suffering from <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> 5) Communicate effectively with team members and nursing staff during a resuscitation of a critically ill patient.

40|$|Introduction. Streptococcal <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> is now {{recognized}} as a toxin-mediated, multisystem illness. It is characterized by an early onset of shock with multiorgan failure {{and continues to be}} associated with high morbidity and mortality, caused by group A Streptococcus pyogenes. The symptoms for staphylococcal and streptococcal <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> are similar. Streptococcal <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> was not well described until 1993, when children who had suffered from varicella presented roughly 2 - 4 weeks later with a clinical syndrome highly suggestive of <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> Characteristics, complications and therapy. It is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches and rash. It can rapidly progress to severe and intractable hypotension and multisystem dysfunction. Almost every organ system can be involved. Complications of streptococcal <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> may include kidney failure, liver failure and even death. Crystalloids and inotropic agents are used to treat the hypovolemic shock aggressively, with close monitoring of the patient’s mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure. An immediate and aggressive management of hypovolemic shock is essential in streptococcal <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> Targeted antibiotics are indicated; penicillin or a betalactam antibiotic is used for treating group A streptococci, and clindamycin has emerged as a key portion of the standard treatment...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the involvement of}} the recently described staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I in <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome.</b> We reexamined Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with menstrual and nonmenstrual <b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> (nine cases) or staphylococcal scarlet fever (three cases). These strains were selected because they produced none of the toxins known to be involved in these <b>syndromes</b> (<b>toxic</b> shock <b>syndrome</b> toxin 1 and enterotoxins A, B, C, and D), enterotoxin E or H, or exfoliative toxin A or B, despite the fact that superantigenic toxins were detected in a CD 69 -specific flow cytometry assay measuring T-cell activation. Sets of primers specific to the enterotoxin G and I genes (seg and sei, respectively) were designed and used for PCR amplification. All of the strains were positive for seg and sei.

In 16 instances more than one worker was exposed to the dust, and in 12 of these shared exposures more than one worker became ill. Patients presented 5. 3 (SD 3. 3) hours after inhalation of organic dust and mould with fever (79 %), myalgia (76 %), chest tightness (72 %), cough (66 %), and headache (59 %).
