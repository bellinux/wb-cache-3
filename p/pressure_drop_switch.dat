Calculation of static <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> has been well understood for many years. Calculation of dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> resulting from flow fluctuations requires specialized pressure pulsation analysis. Dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> can be as large, or larger, than static <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in some cases, so accurate calculation of the dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> is critical. Technical gaps in some pressure pulsation simulation programs do not allow for calculation of dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> Also, industry practice for compressor performance modeling is to make generic assumptions about <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> through the piping system. These factors can lead to large errors in the calculated compressor performance. New simulation tools {{have been developed to}} address this technical gap in calculating dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> as well as including the true total <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in compressor performance calculations. Accurate calculation of dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> means the compressor performance can be verified in the design stage, thus avoidin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple theoretical and experimental method {{to determine the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> across mitral caged-ball and caged-disc prosthetic heart valves under steady state flow conditions. The overall <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> across any mechanical artificial heart valve is affected not only by its orifice, {{but also by the}} poppet design and the entire superstructure of the valve. In this study, the total <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> across the prosthesis is considered to be equal to the sum of the <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> due to the valve occluder and the orifice.

40|$|As {{deposits}} {{accumulate in}} a granular filter, <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> across the filter bed {{required to maintain}} a constant fluid flow rate may increase. Two <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> increase patterns had been observed. In slow sand filters <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> remains unchanged for {{a certain period of}} time then increases exponentially with the volume of filtrate; in granular aerosol filters <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> increases linearly with the amount of deposits from the beginning of the filtration process. New concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous depositions were introduced in this paper. A statistical model based on these new concepts was developed.

40|$|The {{traditional}} design {{method for}} plate heat exchangers(PHEs), either epsilon-number of transfer units (epsilon-NTU) or logarithmic mean temperature difference method, involves many trials {{in order to}} meet the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> constraints. This can be avoided through the developed design method, which takes the full utilization of the allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> as a design objective. The proposed method is valid for the design situations with and without <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> specifications. In the case of the design with <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> specification, only one stream can fully utilize the allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> In the case of no <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> specification, allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> can be determined through economical optimization. Compared to the previous design method, the proposed method does not require many trial iterations. Instead, all heat exchanger parameters, including plate size, number of passes, path, fluid velocity, etc., are determined in a straightforward way. Moreover, the suggested method can guarantee that the optimized values of allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> can be fully utilized simultaneously by the two streams.

The availability of micro-technology to create three-dimensional structures at a micro-meter scale opens opportunities to better control process conditions in once-through boilers. However, process miniaturization possesses some inherent drawbacks as well. Among others, the relatively large <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in a micro-system makes it rather unsuitable for low-pressure applications. Especially in phase-change processes, the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> may become large due to the expansion in small-sized channels. To address this drawback, flow boiling relations for small diameter tubes are first studied. These relations show a general form of the empirical correlations. Using this formulation, reduction factors could be deduced for the momentum <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> and friction <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> {{in case of a}} conical channel. These theoretically derived reduction factors show that the total <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> can be reduced significantly. The momentum <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> completely vanishes for outflow/inlet diameter ratios of 6. 3 in the case of water. The friction <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> is reduced by a factor of ten at an outflow/inlet diameter ratio larger than four.

The third is to study the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> characteristics of two modified structures (by manufacturing holes on the ceramic foams) that are expected to decrease the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in ceramic foams, but maintain good heat transfer properties. The experimental results from the samples, including two modified structures, along with the simulation results, show that the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in the ceramic foams follows a modified Darcy relationship. The experimental results also show that the two modified structures dramatically decrease the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> (with <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> decreases up to 70 % at a superficial velocity of 5 Â m/s). Based on both the experimental and the simulation results, a generalized model for predicting the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in ceramic foams was proposed.
