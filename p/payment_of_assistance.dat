As municipalities had no authority to change the eligibility rules for social <b>assistance,</b> the effects <b>of</b> the welfare reform are solely due {{to the efforts of}} municipalities to decrease the number of welfare recipients. Using variation in the timing of policy changes, this paper uses a difference-in-difference approach to assess the effectiveness of the incentive for municipalities. Based on individual panel data from administrative records, we show that the high-powered scheme led to a decline of the welfare caseload of 14 % up till 2008. The reform has been most effective for those with the highest welfare dependency: single mothers and singles from non-western origin. In line with standard economic predictions, the reform does not give an incentive for cream skimming: the welfare caseload declined as well for easy to place recipients as for difficult to place recipients...|$|R

The research used satisfaction and benefit analysis to produce internal strengths and weal(nesses of sub-contract system, while using external analysis to produce opportunity and threat. TOWS matrix {{was used to determine}} alternative strategies. The result showed that the problems in sub-contract system implementation at PT FAK were sub-conkactor's low bargaining position especially in price determination, ineffective communication and the company has not managed the sub-contract system in optimal level. The company satisfied with price determinination process and <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> loan <b>assistance</b> from the sub-contractors but has not satisfied with the continuity of subcontractors production capacity, the production quality level and time delivery accuracy.

40|$|Beyond the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> child support, {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about the nature and extent of contributions of divorced fathers to their children. Using nationally representative data from a sample of ever-divorced women taken from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, the nature and extent of various forms <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> (in eight areas) provided by divorced fathers are examined. The majority of fathers seldom or never make contributions to their children. Fathers who do contribute to their children have more economic resources and enjoy better relationships with the custodial mother. In addition, there is little support for the notion that fathers substitute other forms <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> child support. Rather, other forms of support are provided in addition to making child-support payments. Concern over the consequences of marital disruption has spurred considerable research, documenting the negative consequences of marital dissolution for female-headed families (Garfinkel and McLanahan 1986; Hoffman and Duncan 1988) and the long-term negative con-sequences for children (McLanahan and Bumpass 1988). At least part of the negative impact of divorce on women and children can be traced to the loss of economic support from fathers. Specifically, women with children experience a 30 percent decline in income in the first year following divorce (Hoffman and Duncan 1988), and divorce accounts for many women fallin...|$|R
