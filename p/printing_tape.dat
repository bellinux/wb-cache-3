40|$|Thick {{films of}} ZnO-based varistors have been {{prepared}} by screen <b>printing</b> and <b>tape</b> casting techniques. The manufacture of varistor thick films by screen printing shows two critical problems; the excessive volatilization of Bi 2 O 3 during the sintering step, due to the exaggerated area–volume ratio of these devices {{and the lack of}} density of the green compacts, problem inherent to screen <b>printing</b> technology. <b>Tape</b> casting improves compact density and it is also possible to include an additional press step before sintering. An electrical and microstructure comparison between thick films prepared by both technologies has been carried out {{for a wide range of}} sintering temperatures. Although far from the electrical response of bulk ceramics, the results obtained show good varistor behavior when sintering the films at low temperatures. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} computing gage with IBM {{card punch}} {{was found to}} be a practical system for monitoring the critical steps in the crimping process of the assembly of some parts. In the crimping process a plastic part is compressed into a metal cup to obtain an assembled component without gaps. Dimensional data of the plastic part and metal cup are recorded on a <b>printed</b> <b>tape</b> and on IBM cards, which are used to program a computer to calculate the standard deviation of the lot. Lot acceptance is statistical and is based on the standard deviation of the lot. The electronic computing gage compares the height of the assembled components before and after crimping and indicates whether or not an acceptable assembly (without gaps) has been made. This system eliminates the need for the manual calculation of height and recording of data at the production site, thereby increasing the reliability of the assembly process at a decrease in cost...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} for entering college {{students who are blind}} or visually impaired, administrators, faculty and staff, family members, and counselors. First, characteristics of people with blindness and visual impairments are briefly summarized. Services such as translation of texts into braille or audiotaping, readers or assistants, and computer technology are identified. Then, rights and responsibilities of the students are reviewed. These include requesting such services as priority scheduling and registration, advance notice of books and resources required, preferential seating, and permission to use special equipment in classes. Financial aid for postsecondary education is considered next including help available from the vocational rehabilitation system and the institution's responsibilities. Advance evaluation of an institution's disability support services is recommended to students and families. Additional tips are offered for students and instructors.
