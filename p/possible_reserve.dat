However, the need for counter air and ground support operations predominated in German air thinking. Hitler demanded close air support for the army, implying at least one Air Corps should be attached to each of the three Army Groups. There were four Air Corps (or Fliegerkorps) in the Soviet Union, giving one <b>possible</b> <b>reserve</b> Corps. Had production been brought up to a level commensurate with total war in 1940 and early 1941, a reserve of one Air Corps {{could have been}} set aside for strategic operations to commence with air-land operations. The splitting of tactical and strategic air units, the later being formed into one unified air command, would have done much to clarify the problem of organisation. The Strategic air units could have been freed from ground support duties which they were not trained or equipped for, while being able to carry out strategic bombing as advocated by the late General Wever. The concept of concentrating all available forces for the army, in the decisive battle became invalid, since it was the ability of the Soviets to re-arm and rebuild, through the failure of the Axis to bomb industrial regions beyond the front, that contributed to ultimate failure of Barbarossa to win a decisive victory. It was not until the winter, 1941-42 that Jeschonnek and Hitler revisited the idea of producing a heavy bomber to hit far ranging targets. Fliegerkorps IV was finally ready for operations after the publication of the Luftwaffe study Battle against Russian Armaments Industry in November 1943. However, the project was abandoned as there was no capable aircraft.|$|E

6000|$|It often amazed me, however, that Hollingsworth {{should show}} himself so {{recklessly}} tender towards Priscilla, and never once {{seem to think}} of the effect which it might have upon her heart. But the man, as I have endeavored to explain, was thrown completely off his moral balance, and quite bewildered as to his personal relations, by his great excrescence of a philanthropic scheme. I used to see, or fancy, indications that he was not altogether obtuse to Zenobia's influence as a woman. No doubt, however, he had a still more exquisite enjoyment of Priscilla's silent sympathy with his purposes, so unalloyed with criticism, and therefore more grateful than any intellectual approbation, which always involves a <b>possible</b> <b>reserve</b> of latent censure. A man--poet, prophet, or whatever he may be--readily persuades himself of his right to all the worship that is voluntarily tendered. In requital of so rich benefits as he was to confer upon mankind, it would have been hard to deny Hollingsworth the simple solace of a young girl's heart, which he held in his hand, and smelled too, like a rosebud.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a wide range}} of stochastic reserving models for use in general insurance, beginning with stochastic models which reproduce the traditional chain-ladder reserve estimates. The models are extended to consider parametric curves and smoothing models for the shape of the development run-off, which allow extrapolation for the estimation of tail factors. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique is also considered, within a Bayesian framework, which allows expert opinion to be used to provide prior estimates of ultimate claims. The primary advantage of stochastic reserving models is the availability of measures of precision of reserve estimates, and in this respect, attention is focused on the root mean squared error of prediction (prediction error). Of greater interest is a full predictive distribution of <b>possible</b> <b>reserve</b> outcomes, and different methods of obtaining that distribution are described. The techniques are illustrated with examples throughout, and the wider issues discussed, in particular, the concept of a `best estimate'; reporting the variability of claims reserves; and use in dynamic financial analysis models...|$|E

40|$|As {{essential}} compounds {{of plant}} cell walls, hemicelluloses {{account for about}} a quarter of all plant biomass worldwide. In seed cotyledons and endosperm of species from several plant families, hemicelluloses are used as mobile carbon reserves. Whether cell wall hemicelluloses of non-reproductive plant tissue are multifunctional molecules, which can also serve as carbon sources during periods of enhanced carbon demand, is still equivocal. This review summarizes the current understanding of a <b>possible</b> <b>reserve</b> function of hemicelluloses. Although several descriptive and experimental studies suggested at least partial mobility of cell wall polysaccharides in mature, non-reproductive plant tissues, there is still a need for a broad-scale, ecophysiological exploration of the actual nature of hemicelluloses beyond their structural function. The chemical heterogeneity of hemicelluloses may be the major problem for precise quantitative analyses on a large, comparative scale. Because of the abundant distribution of hemicelluloses in plants, the existence of a significant mobile carbohydrate pool in cell walls of non-reproductive organs would shed rather new light on plant carbon relations in a source-sink context. Consequently, a reserve function of hemicelluloses questions the conventional division of cell compounds into structural (i. e. immobile) and non-structural (i. e. mobile) compounds...|$|E
