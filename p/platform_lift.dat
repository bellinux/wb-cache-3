50|$|An indoor {{vertical}} <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> operates {{much like}} an elevator which is installed within a hoist-way or shaft-way. Although the installation of a vertical <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> {{is similar to that}} of an elevator it's much less expensive. Some models, such as the Savaria V-1504 hydraulic lift, offer options to finish a vertical <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> to make it operate more like a home elevator.|$|E
50|$|A {{wheelchair}} lift, {{also known}} as a <b>platform</b> <b>lift,</b> or vertical <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> is a fully powered device designed to raise a wheelchair and its occupant in order to overcome a step or similar vertical barrier.|$|E
50|$|Vertical <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> - Midilifts are {{designed}} to provide an easy alternative to the stairs for travel up to 12 metres. Four product ranges are available: Lowriser, a simple low rise open platforms for wheelchair users; Midilift SL, standard <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> and the Midilift SLplus and Midilift XLplus, their top-of-the-range cabin <b>platform</b> <b>lifts.</b> All Midilifts are supplied either in a skeleton structure or with their own structure-supported enclosure, which can be fitted with either steel or glass panels, {{or a combination of}} the two. Quick and easy to install, vertical <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> require a minimum of builders' work, making them extremely cost-effective access solutions.|$|R

50|$|Cibes Lift is a {{manufacturer}} of low speed, screw-driven <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> for installation {{in public and private}} environments. The company's head office, sales, manufacturing and service offices are located in Gävle, Sweden. <b>Platform</b> <b>lifts</b> are an alternative to conventional elevators for lower lift heights. The company has three subsidiaries and approximately 200 foreign distributors.|$|R
5000|$|The Base {{tends to}} be of average size. She should have good leg {{strength}} and a solid core (when performing a <b>platform</b> <b>lift,</b> a strong core and length is essential).|$|E
50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> and a spiral conveyor. A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift,</b> input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Platform</b> <b>Lift</b> is {{the oldest}} form. In a platform, the Plank lays out in a back layout {{position}} underwater. The top sets in a squatting position on her torso and stands once the lift reaches the surface. The remaining teammates use eggbeater to hold the platform and the top out of the water.|$|E

50|$|Inclined <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> - Stairiser {{inclined}} <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> are {{an access}} solution if a building cannot accommodate a vertical lift. A Stairiser carries one person safely over a straight or curved stairway, {{seated in a}} wheelchair or on the seat provided on the lift. When the lift is not in use it folds neatly away to leave the stairway free for pedestrian use.|$|R

50|$|An incline elevator, {{also known}} as an incline <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> or {{hillside}} tram, is an elevator that runs in a direction diagonal to the ground. Unlike a standard elevator, incline elevators can go up tilted grades, {{and can be used}} for both residential and commercial purposes. The purpose of incline elevators is to provide accessibility to steep hillsides and inclines at minimal effort to the user.|$|E
50|$|Users with {{mobility}} and disability challenges often use an incline <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> to climb staircases {{in their home}} with their mobility scooter or motorized wheelchair. Outdoor incline elevators are used to access steep hillside property where stairs are not a preferred option. Incline elevators {{can also be used}} to move equipment and materials to hard to reach elevated locations for industrial or construction purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Braun started [...] "Save-A-Step" [...] {{manufacturing}} in 1963 {{to build the}} first motorized scooter. In 1966 Braun created the first wheelchair accessible vehicle, by creating a wheelchair <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> and hand controls that were added to an old postal van. In 1970, Ralph added wheelchair platform lifts to full-sized vans. [...] "Save-A-Step" [...] was incorporated under a new name, The Braun Corporation, in 1972.|$|E

50|$|The Memorial Centre also hosts various activities, {{including}} painting, dancing, indoor bowls, yoga, model car racing, and the Decorative and Fine Arts Society. It contains one of {{the largest}} function rooms in the local area, seating 350, with a raised stage. It also has two further rooms for hire upstairs, and there is a <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> for disabled access. The newly formed Friends group is promoting involvement of local schools and businesses and is currently refurbishing the Centre to make it more attractive to hirers.|$|E
50|$|A {{continuous}} product lift or reciprocating elevator can {{be chosen}} for the upright transporting of products. Such lifts are found in two forms: an L-shaped conveyor or mat lift and a fork-lift. An L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> is a goods lift in which the products lie on a support which is suspended between a number of chains. This {{means that there is}} a considerable risk of contamination (with oil or grease) where use is made of traditional chains. A possible disadvantage of such a lift is that it requires more control, but the area required is again appreciably less than with a spiral conveyor. The difference in height which is able to be bridged with only one drive motor is almost unlimited. When bridging a greater height, it is necessary with spiral conveyors to place several systems one above the other. Another disadvantage of an L-shaped conveyor or a <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> {{is the fact that it}} is difficult to control the transfer of products on intake to the system, with the incorrect receiving of a product being able to cause considerable consequential damage and with considerable additional costs to be expected as a result of lost production just as in the case of a spiral conveyor.|$|E
5000|$|Modified {{roller chain}} {{has been used}} {{extensively}} in material handling equipment, but could only be used in push-pull applications when a continuous loop of chain was used (with the exception of chain encapsulated in a guide channel). The development of efficient rigid chain actuators broadened the use of chain actuation for industrial applications. Small scale rigid chain actuators are used as building hardware, incorporated into windows, door and hatches as motorized open/close mechanisms. [...] Rigid chain actuators are also used as the lifting columns in performing arts facilities, incorporated in stage, orchestra and seating <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> systems.|$|E

Boarding aids range in cost, complexity, safety and ease of use, from a rope ladder, through rigid ladders and stairs with handrails, christmas tree ladders which allow the diver to climb while wearing fins, to temporary and fixed stern <b>platforms,</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>platforms</b> and [...]|$|R
50|$|An Access for All scheme, {{funded by}} the Department for Transport, gave easier access {{to all of the}} <b>platforms.</b> <b>Lifts</b> were built to give step-free access to the entire station, though the station had no steps {{previously}} as there were ramps to all platforms.|$|R
50|$|This type of rotary stage {{includes}} {{ball bearing}} stages, {{crossed roller bearing}} stages, and possibly others. Any {{of a number of}} different rolling-element bearings may be employed. Typically, a pair of bearings is used and they are preloaded to take up any slack which could result in the stage <b>platform</b> <b>lifting</b> relative to the base.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to Swedish social {{reforms and}} legislation, to {{increase}} the {{integration of disabled people}} in society, the sales increased throughout the 1980s.1986 Cibes started to manufactured and product developed the platform lifts in Järbo, Sweden.The export began in 1989, first to the Nordic countries, Finland and 1990 to Norway.1991 Cibes Elevator AB (now Cibes Lift AB) was formed with sales and marketing.1992 Cibes Elevator AB moved to new and more suitable premises to meet the expected expansion.1996 Sweden joined the European Community (EC). The <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> A5000 was certified for the EC market, exports began on a broad field and the company expanded rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, it was {{announced}} that Caerphilly County Borough Council had been successful in obtaining £943,200 in funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to replace the roof, install a <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> for better accessibility, and restore the attic, previously closed to the public, as servants' quarters; the addition of the slate roof was delayed by the presence of bats (a protected species) in the attics. [...] The project started in late 2013, and was completed in 2015. In 2015, First minister Carwyn Jones unveiled the results of the project that has restored the servants quarters to the way they were in 1645. The aim is to attract 80,000 visitors a year by 2020.|$|E
50|$|While some wheelchair-accessible vans use a {{powered lift}} {{to assist the}} {{occupant}} in boarding, a wheelchair ramp is usually less expensive for this purpose and is often installed on minivans. Full-size vans, however, require use of a <b>platform</b> <b>lift.</b> There {{are two types of}} platform lifts installed on wheelchair-accessible vans: single-arm and dual-arm. Single-arm wheelchair lifts are only used in side-entry applications. They take up less interior space and leave the passenger entry open; however, they have less lifting capacity than dual-arm lifts. Most dual-arm wheelchair lifts have a lift capacity up to 800 pounds. These lifts consume more interior space and block the side entry and, for these reasons, are often mounted {{in the back of the}} vehicle for rear-entry applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} canopies {{are in a}} pseudo-antique style {{which is}} {{in stark contrast to}} the poured concrete style of the rest of the station's structural features. The line runs below street level with access via staircases to each <b>platform.</b> <b>Lifts</b> are presently (2012) under construction and due to open by July Ticket barriers are in operation.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>platforms</b> have <b>lifts,</b> {{making the}} station fully {{accessible}} {{to people in}} wheelchairs.|$|R

50|$|In {{internal}} logistics, {{there are}} various ways for getting product flows up or down. A solution which is often used is the deployment of incline or lowering belts. When placed at an angle in order to bridge a height difference, such belt conveyors also {{have the advantage of}} covering a certain distance. A disadvantage is the loss of much useful floor space {{as a result of the}} presence of the necessary supports for the belt conveyor. A bigger distance over a smaller floor area can be bridged using a product lift or a vertical conveyor. A continuous conveyor or a discontinuous conveyor can be chosen as a vertical conveyor. Continuous conveyors can take the form of a spiral conveyor, an L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> or a product lift fitted with a fork.|$|E

50|$|Until September 2010, St John's had {{no access}} or {{facilities}} for disabled people {{and was not}} easily accessible to the elderly. The sole access to the church from the exterior was by 14 steps - too steep for ramps. Interior access was again by steps either to the restaurant or the hall. A scheme {{was put in place}} to remedy this, the main elements of which involved the installation of a lift to serve the ground, crypt (box office and restaurant) and concert levels. The box office and main entrance foyer were relocated to the area near to the lift, providing a new and more attractive and prominent shared point of entry for all. Adapted toilets were also provided in the crypt. The artists’ dressing rooms also relocated allowing more direct access to the stage. A <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> is also available, allowing disabled performers {{to gain access to the}} stage level.|$|E
