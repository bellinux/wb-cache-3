5|$|In another study, Gregory S. Paul <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flexed kneed and digitigrade adult Tyrannosaurus {{were much}} better adapted for running than {{elephants}} or humans, {{pointing out that}} Tyrannosaurus had a large ilium bone and cnemial crest that would have supported large muscles needed for running. He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He also <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Clal Center {{was the target}} of criticism. Some critics decried the {{decision}} to demolish the historic Alliance Vocational School in order to build the project in the first place.

25|$|Greece and Rome were {{looked to}} as model republics {{throughout}} this debate, and authors {{on both sides}} took Roman pseudonyms. Brutus <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greek and Roman states were small, whereas the U.S. is vast. He also <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> expansion of these republics resulted in a transition from free government to tyranny.|$|R

5|$|On 24 April 2017, rumours of Creative Assembly {{producing}} a sequel were published by PSU.com.

5|$|While {{some critics}} have feared the {{revision}} of the Champagne region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson has <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion.

5|$|Critics also <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> index {{could allow}} {{the city to}} reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department {{had to contend with}} the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, three senior health {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August. Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader Brian Mason speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame. Detractors <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.|$|E
5|$|Longrich et al. <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} {{of a single}} finger in ingeniine oviraptorids {{is similar to that}} seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E

They also <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police failed to call in the force's gay community liaison officer. Goliath's reopened {{a little more than a}} month after the raid.|$|E
5|$|The American {{telecast}} on ABC drew in {{an average}} of 37.19 million people over its length, which was a 2% decrease from the previous year's ceremony. However, the show drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 27.5% of households watching over a 43 share. Many media outlets <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> broadcast earned higher ratings compared to {{the final game of}} the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament which was airing on CBS that same night.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{maintained}} that Hoover's {{response to the}} continuing depression and the severe drought in 1930 were inadequate and <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> $45million in loans to farmers that he approved amounted to {{less than half the}} losses sustained by Kentucky's farmers alone. He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Croatian {{historian}} Davor Marijan {{concluded that}} the battle was too complex for the HV and especially for the HVO.

Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica SimiÄ‡, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, 91 revolutionaries {{were sentenced to}} exile. Of these, a small group was transported by barges from Giurgiu, {{on their way to}} the Austrian-ruled SviniÈ›a, near the Danube port of Orschowa. The revolutionary artist Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti, both of whom had been allowed to go free and had {{subsequently}} followed the barges on shore, <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of SviniÈ›a to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee. The escapees then made their way to Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sultan Iskandar {{was accused}} of causing {{the death of a}} golf caddy in Cameron Highlands by assault, {{following}} an incident in which the golf caddy laughed when the Sultan missed a hole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sultan (then the Agong) could not be prosecuted due to the immunity that was accorded to the rulers, yet he condemned Sultan Iskandar's actions at the same time. In the end the matter was let off without much public attention. The brother of the caddy â€“ who also suffered injuries from the incident, being distressed from what he saw, subsequently ran amok in Kuala Lumpur and had to be quarantined in a mental hospital.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Leo Joseph {{and colleagues}} {{acknowledged}} the finding but <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sample {{might have been}} damaged and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the Coracopsis genus, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. In 2012, Hume expressed surprise at these findings due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the Mascarene islands that {{are believed to be}} psittaculines. He also pointed out that there is no fossil evidence found on other islands to support the hypothesis that the species evolved elsewhere before reaching RÃ©union.|$|E
