40|$|Pneumatic {{directional}} valves {{are used in}} most industrial pneumatic systems. Most of them are two-stage valves controlled by a <b>pilot</b> <b>valve.</b> <b>Pilot</b> <b>valves</b> are often chosen randomly. Experimental studies {{in order to determine}} the flow-rate characteristics and parameters of <b>pilot</b> <b>valves</b> were not conducted.

50|$|A <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> {{is a small}} valve that {{controls}} a limited-flow control feed to a separate <b>piloted</b> <b>valve.</b> Typically, this valve controls a high pressure or high flow feed. <b>Pilot</b> <b>valves</b> are useful because they allow a small and easily operated feed to control a much higher pressure or higher flow feed, which would otherwise require a much larger force to operate; indeed, this is even useful when a solenoid is used to operate the valve.|$|R

50|$|If the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> is opened, water drains {{from the}} upper chamber and its {{pressure}} is reduced. The <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> is always larger in flowrate than the filling through the throttle valve. Pressure in the annular chamber now forces the piston upstream, lifting the valve body from the conical seat and opening the valve.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic {{characteristics}} of a direct-pressure sensing water hydraulic relief valve. Four hydrostatic bearings support the main valve to reduce hysteresis of static characteristics of the valve. Hence, Coulomb friction acting on the main valve is not available as damping force. A damping orifice is inserted between the main- and <b>pilot</b> <b>valves</b> to get a damping force for the main valve, while the orifice diameter affects on stability of the main valve. In addition, {{the motion of the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> has large effects on the response of the relief valve itself. To show these influences, we compute the response to a step input of relief flowrate with the MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the design parameters affecting the stability are followings: (1) the damping orifice diameter, (2) spring stiffness for the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve,</b> and (3) volume of a chamber between the damping orifice and the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Like other {{pressure}} relief <b>valves</b> (PRV), <b>pilot</b> operated relief <b>valves</b> (PORV) {{are used for}} emergency relief during overpressure events (e.g., a tank gets too hot and the expanding fluid increases the pressure to dangerous levels). The difference between PORV and conventional PRV is that <b>pilot</b> <b>valves</b> use system pressure to seal the valve. A PRV typically uses a spring to hold the disc or piston on seat. The essential parts of a PORV are a <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> (or control <b>pilot),</b> a main <b>valve,</b> a <b>pilot</b> tube, the dome, a disc or piston, and a seat. The volume above the piston is called the dome.|$|R
5000|$|A {{solenoid valve}} has two main parts: the solenoid and the valve. The solenoid {{converts}} electrical energy into mechanical energy which, in turn, opens or closes the valve mechanically. A direct acting valve {{has only a}} small flow circuit, shown within section E of this diagram (this section is mentioned below as a <b>pilot</b> <b>valve).</b> In this example, a diaphragm <b>piloted</b> <b>valve</b> multiplies this small pilot flow, by using it to control the flow through a much larger orifice.|$|R

50|$|A {{direct acting}} solenoid valve {{typically}} operates in 5 to 10 milliseconds. The operation {{time of a}} <b>piloted</b> <b>valve</b> depends on its size; typical values are 15 to 150 milliseconds.|$|R
50|$|A bi-stable {{pneumatic}} valve is typically a <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> {{that is a}} 3 ported 2 position detented valve. The valve retains its position during loss of power, hence the bi-stable name.|$|R

50|$|The {{pressure}} from the pilot tube to the dome is routed through the actual control <b>pilot</b> <b>valve.</b> There are many designs but the control pilot is essentially a conventional PRV with the special job of controlling pressure to the main valve dome. The pressure at which the control pilot relieves at is the functional set pressure of the PORV. When the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> reaches set pressure it opens and releases the {{pressure from}} the dome. The piston is then free to open and the main valve exhausts the system fluid. The control pilot opens either to the main valve exhaust pipe or to atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] <b>Pilot</b> <b>valves</b> are {{considered}} as one of most common types of valves in the industry today. They are widely-used because their design is simple, they are available in wide range of number of ports, they have high efficiency and smooth flow rate, and {{they are easy to}} operate and maintained. They are used in many applications like aircraft flight control, machinery, and automobiles etc. In this thesis, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been implemented practically to estimate the spool displacement of the main valve in a hydraulic system. The system includes a supply pressure feeding a three-way <b>pilot</b> <b>valve,</b> which controls a four-way main valve. Based on the mathematical equations, Matlab/Simulink models of the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> and system components were made to compare with experimental data and used in EKF. Extended Kalman filter algorithm has employed to estimate the displacement of the main valve in presence of random noise and distortions again taking into account the noise measurement. EKF being an optimal estimator tracks the displacement with noise and distortion quite accurately. Adaptive tracking of movement of the main valve in the Hydraulic system can easily be done using this algorithm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, an {{automated}} {{statistical analysis of}} vibration characteristics for the condition monitoring of hydraulic systems is proposed. Features from FFT vibration data of a micromechanical accelerometer measured at the gear pump are extracted, selected by their correlation coefficient to the target fault value, and subsequently reduced to discriminant functions which allow the classification of component conditions using multivariate statistics. The approach was successfully evaluated with an experimental hydraulic test bench simulating typical fault scenarios like <b>valve</b> <b>switching</b> degradation or gas leakage of the accumulator. It was shown that the studied fault scenarios can be selectively detected (internal pump leakage) and even quantified concerning the grade of severity in case of <b>valve</b> <b>switching</b> degradation, accumulator gas leakage, and oil aeration. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the statistical model was evaluated over several weeks...|$|R
50|$|At {{intermediate}} positions, {{pressure in}} the two chambers is balanced and the valve remains part-open. This depends on the piston size, the pressure reduction downstream and the flows through the two control <b>valves.</b> The <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> gives a proportional control over main valve flowrate, with the opening being controlled, slow and gradual.|$|R
40|$|An ion chromatographic method with a <b>valve</b> <b>switching</b> {{facility}} {{was developed to}} determine trace nitrate concentrations in seawater using two pumps, two different suppressors, and two columns. A carbohydrate membrane desalter was used to reduce the high concentrations of sodium salts in samples. In this method, trace nitrate was eluted from the concentrator column to the analytical columns, while the matrix fl owed to waste. Neither chemical pre-treatment nor sample dilution was required. In the optimized separation conditions, the method showed good linearity (R > 0. 99) in the 0. 05 and 50 mg/L concentration range, and satisfactory repeatability (RSD < 5 %, n = 6). The limit of detection for nitrate was 0. 02 mg/L.

50|$|Internally {{the fixed}} valve body is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving {{part of the}} valve within this as a piston. The conical valve {{is part of this}} piston. The piston is double-acting and splits the internal valve body in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of the piston is larger, the full diameter of the piston, and is supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of the piston is an annular space surrounding the moving valve body and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of the conical valve contains a small <b>pilot</b> <b>valve,</b> linking the upper chamber of the valve to the downstream drain below the <b>valve.</b> This <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> is controlled mechanically from outside the valve chamber and is the main control over the valve position.|$|R
25|$|Some demand valves use a small, {{sensitive}} <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> {{to control}} {{the opening of the}} main valve.
