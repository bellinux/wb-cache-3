In June 1937, the leftist political party with whose militia he served (the POUM, the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification, an anti-Stalinist communist party) was declared an illegal organisation, and Orwell was consequently forced to either flee or face imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|On 10 August 1779, Harrison's {{regiment}} {{was renamed}} the 1st Continental Artillery Regiment. After two boards of generals reviewed the seniority of the officers, {{it was decided}} that the regiments of John Lamb and John Crane could not claim lineage to Knox's original Continental Artillery Regiment. Therefore, Harrison's regiment became the 1st, Lamb's the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment, Crane's the 3rd Continental Artillery Regiment, and Thomas Proctor's the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment. Meanwhile, three Maryland artillery companies joined Harrison's regiment in 1778 on a <b>provisional</b> <b>basis.</b> They officially merged with the 1st Artillery on 9 May 1780. The 1st Maryland Company became the 11th Company while the 2nd and 3rd Maryland consolidated as the 12th Company.|$|E

5000|$|The Constitution of Yugoslavia (1974 Constitution), in its Basic Principles, in {{the very}} beginning, stated [...] "The peoples of Yugoslavia, {{starting}} from the right of every nation to self-determination, {{including the right to}} secession,...". The opinion of the Serb leadership of that time was that the internal borders of Yugoslavia were <b>provisional.</b> The <b>basis</b> for this statement was derived from the Constitution of Yugoslavia. President Slobodan Milošević, also the leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia, had repeatedly stated that all Serbs should enjoy the right to be included in Serbia. Mihajlo Marković, the Vice President of the Main Committee of Serbia's Socialist Party, rejected any solution that would make Serbs outside Serbia a minority. He proposed establishing a federation consisting of Serbia, Montenegro, BiH, Macedonia and Serbs residing in the Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina, Slavonia, Baranja, and Srem.|$|R
25|$|As Germany {{was losing}} the war, the Lithuanians {{received}} more freedom of action. On October 20, 1918, Chancellor of Germany Prince Maximilian of Baden repeated recognition of independent Lithuania, promised {{to convert the}} German military administration into a civilian government, and to allow the Lithuanians to take over once they had sufficient capabilities. After receiving this news, the Council of Lithuania convened on October 28 to discuss a provisional constitution and formation of the government. As no projects or drafts had been prepared beforehand, these decisions needed {{to be made by}} the Council during its session and this process took several days. The changed political situation also dictated the Council's need to rescind its decision to elect Mindaugas II. Lithuania, hoping to receive recognition from the Entente, could not have the Entente's enemy as its king. Duke William indicated {{that he was willing to}} abandon the throne. Therefore, on November 2, the Council suspended its invitation to Duke William leaving the final decision to the future Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. Later the same day the Council adopted the first provisional constitution, which did not declare either monarchy or republic. The constitution simply organized the government on a <b>provisional</b> <b>basis</b> until the Constituent Assembly made a final decision. Further constitutions did not reconsider a monarchy.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, the colony's governance and religious attitudes came under greater scrutiny, which finally led to the revocation of its charter in 1684. [...] King James II then established the Dominion of New England, an appointed regime not well received in the colonies. [...] It took effect in 1686 and lasted until 1689, when the Glorious Revolution toppled James {{and led to the}} arrest in Massachusetts of the Dominion's unpopular governor, Sir Edmund Andros. [...] The colony reverted to its previous rule on a <b>provisional</b> <b>basis,</b> because it then lacked any sort of legal charter. [...] In 1691 King William III merged the colonies of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay along with the territory of Maine, the islands south of Cape Cod (including Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and the Elizabeth Islands), and recently captured Nova Scotia (which included present-day New Brunswick) to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay. [...] This new governmental structure took effect in 1692, {{with the arrival of the}} new royal governor, Sir William Phips.|$|E

40|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} {{adoption of the}} 1982 Law of the Sea Convention coastal States have dramatically expanded the spatial extent of their respective claims to maritime zones of national jurisdiction. At present many of the world’s oceans and seas feature, and are characterised by, extensive maritime spaces where the zones of national jurisdiction claimed by two or more neighbouring coastal States have not been delimited by an international maritime boundary and thus overlap with one another. These spaces – {{hereinafter referred to as}} overlapping claims areas (OCAs) – are likely to be an enduring feature of the world’s political geography given that maritime boundary delimitation is often a lengthy or intractable process. Maritime boundary negotiations between several coastal States are impeded by long-standing and polarised negotiating positions, heightened diplomatic tensions, and/or daunting geographical and technical complexities. In several cases maritime boundary negotiations are further complicated by disputed claims to territorial sovereignty over islands and other littoral features. As an alternative to maritime boundary delimitation, or during the period where delimitation negotiations are ongoing, several coastal States that assert overlapping claims have agreed to establish frameworks to manage the relevant OCA on a <b>provisional</b> and joint <b>basis.</b> <b>Provisional</b> joint management is increasingly viewed by government officials and other policymakers as a useful tool to minimise diplomatic tensions associated with OCAs, and enable the effective management of such spaces and the resources contained therein. In recent years several senior government officials, commentators and reports have highlighted a need for further consideration of options for provisional joint management of OCAs and their implementation in particular regional contexts. The present thesis responds to this need by critically examining provisions of international law concerning the provisional joint management of OCAs, in addition to the design features of provisional joint management frameworks that have been established to date. Drawing on the results of the examination, the thesis then proposes legal and policy options for the provisional joint management of OCAs. The proposed options are intended to inform the future negotiation of provisional joint management frameworks. The proposed options are also intended to facilitate the functionally comprehensive management of OCAs by the relevant claimant coastal States – in other words, they are intended to enable claimant coastal States to collectively implement, within the relevant OCA, all functional components of coastal State jurisdiction recognised in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Revenue Assurance is an {{emerging}} {{discipline in the}} Communication Service Provider (CSP) industry. It is a fast changing and maturing field driven by proactive CSPs and industry providers of Revenue Assurance technology and services. Two practice guideline bodies, the TeleManagement Forum and the Global Revenue Assurance Professions Association (GRAPA), have issued various practice guidelines, maturity assessment models, and the first attempts to certify practitioners in this discipline. The discipline, however, lacks a working set of definitions. Industry writing is of commercial value with little contribution from an academic perspective. This study provides a <b>provisional</b> taxonomy as <b>basis</b> for introducing a working' set of definitions to support academic enquiry into the discipline of Revenue Assurance. The study employed Grounded Theory and document analysis techniques to code and analyse data available in the public domain. The result {{is a set of}} grounded concepts, re-conceptualised into a taxonomy, which provides structure to academia as primary users. It is hoped that the proposed taxonomy will provide a common base of understanding, which will guide future dialogue and expansion of the field, with contributions from both industry and academia...|$|R
2500|$|In late 1970, at age 65, {{urged by}} the Abbot of the Abbey of Hauterive and Dominican theologian Father Marie-Dominique Philippe {{to teach the}} seminarians personally, Lefebvre, feeling too old to {{undertake}} such a large project, told them he would visit François Charrière, Bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg, with a request {{to set up a}} religious society. He told them, if he said to go through with it, he would see in it a sign of Divine Providence. Charrière granted Lefebvre's request and, with a document predated by six days to 1 November 1970, he established the Society of St. Pius X as a pia unio (Latin, for [...] "pious, or holy, union") on a <b>provisional</b> (ad experimentum) <b>basis</b> for six years. Pia unio status was the first stage through which a Catholic organisation passed prior to gaining official recognition as a religious institute or society of apostolic life. (Since 1983, the term [...] "association of the faithful" [...] has replaced [...] "pia unio".) The Society of Saint Pius X was formally founded, adhering to all canonical norms, and receiving the episcopal blessing and encouragement of the local ordinary. Some Swiss laymen offered the seminary at Ecône to the newly formed group, and in 1971 the first 24 candidates entered, followed by a further 32 in October 1972.|$|R

2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties {{brought about a}} GATT anti-dumping Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies {{was the first major}} attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two. Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a <b>provisional</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|E
