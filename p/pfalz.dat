5|$|At this time, C Flight arrived. As it dipped {{down through}} the {{overcast}} toward the dogfight, Gardiner and Taylor went astray. Maybery was attacked by a green <b>Pfalz</b> D.III. Hoidge's counterattack foiled the German. Bowman and Maybery remained to join the attack on Voss. Hoidge, having broken off his pursuit of the falling <b>Pfalz,</b> changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.|$|E
5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk dress shirt beneath his unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite was at his throat. He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower <b>Pfalz</b> D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three <b>Pfalz</b> D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch their Staffelführer.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{captain in}} August 1917, Cole was posted to France as a flight {{commander}} with No.2 Squadron AFC (also known until 1918 as No.68 Squadron RFC). Flying S.E.5 fighters on the Western Front, he {{was credited with}} destroying or sending out of control ten enemy aircraft between July and October 1918, making him an ace. In a single sortie over the Lys Valley on 19August, Cole shot down two German fighters and narrowly avoided being shot down himself immediately afterwards, when he was attacked by five Fokker Triplanes that were being pursued by Allied Bristol Fighters. On 24 September, he led into battle a patrol of fifteen S.E.5s that destroyed or damaged eight German fighters over Haubourdin and Pérenchies, claiming one <b>Pfalz</b> D.III for himself.|$|E
5|$|In April 1792, Hotze and his {{regiment}} {{joined the}} autonomous Austrian Corps under Paul Anton II, Count von Esterházy in the Breisgau although they took {{no part in}} any military clashes. Early in 1793, Hotze and his regiment {{were assigned to the}} Upper Rhine Army, commanded by General of Cavalry Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, at which time Hotze was promoted to major general. As commander of the third column, he played an essential role the storming of the line at Wissembourg and Lauterburg, for which he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Maria Theresia Order. In the following year, 1794, he was assigned to the Army Corps of the Prince von Hohenlohe-Kirchberg, on the left bank of the Rhine, and later, from May–September at Heiligenstein on the Rhine, Schweigenheim, Westheim, and Landau in der <b>Pfalz,</b> against the French army commanded by the general of division Louis Desaix.|$|E
5|$|On 22 and 23 September {{small groups}} of soldiers, {{remnants}} of the Yildirim Army Group, were attacked by aircraft on the Shibleh to Beisan road near the Jordan River. Shortly afterwards a column of several thousand Ottoman soldiers were seen marching back under a white flag along the Wady el Fara road. Meanwhile, east of the Jordan River, three German <b>Pfalz</b> scout aircraft {{and a number of}} D.F.W. two–seater aircraft from Deraa aerodrome were attacked by three Bristol Fighters over Um es Surab. During the aerial fight a German two–seater was shot down near Mafrak, another aircraft was forced to land near the railway and an Ottoman outpost, while the third aircraft was chased back to Deraa. Deraa aerodrome was attacked in the early morning of 23 September, by aircraft flying from Ramle. It was attacked again that night by the Handley-Page, which ended the enemy's use of that aerodrome.|$|E
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the <b>Pfalz</b> Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E
5|$|Despite some progress, by 1914 the Citizen Forces {{were still}} incomplete, {{numbering}} approximately 45,915 men, with many units {{still to be}} raised. During the precautionary stage on 2 August 1914 prior to the outbreak of war, Citizen Forces units were called up to guard key infrastructure and essential points and man coastal forts and harbour defences. Militia fortress companies assisted the permanent artillery and engineers in manning defence electric lights at Port Jackson, Port Phillip, Fort Lytton, Fremantle and on the Derwent River. All coastal defence batteries were activated hours before the declaration of war against Germany (which took place at 9:00 am Melbourne time on 4 August). The next morning the first Allied shots of the war were fired by the garrison at Fort Nepean, which was located {{at the opening of}} Port Phillip Bay, after the examination battery there fired a shell over the bows of the German cargo ship SS <b>Pfalz</b> when the ship failed to stop. In accordance with pre-war plans mines were ready to be laid by the Royal Australian Engineers to protect Port Jackson and Port Phillip; however, the risk of attack was not considered sufficient to justify the establishment of the minefields and their ongoing maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pfalz</b> D.XII was a German fighter {{aircraft}} {{built by}} <b>Pfalz</b> Flugzeugwerke. Designed by Rudolph Gehringer {{as a successor}} to the <b>Pfalz</b> D.III, the D.XII entered service in significant numbers {{near the end of}} the First World War. It was the last <b>Pfalz</b> aircraft to see widespread service. Though the D.XII was an effective fighter aircraft, it was overshadowed by the highly successful Fokker D.VII.|$|E
25|$|Prior to World War I, <b>Pfalz</b> Flugzeugwerke {{produced}} Morane-Saulnier monoplane designs under license. These aircraft entered {{military service}} as the <b>Pfalz</b> A- and E-series. In September 1916, <b>Pfalz</b> began producing {{the first of}} 20 Roland D.I and 200 Roland D.II fighters under license.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September 1917 {{with his}} score at 12, he {{received}} the first <b>Pfalz</b> D.III assigned to his Jasta. The <b>Pfalz</b> would almost end his life. Kroll apparently still used his Albatros D.V, marked with a taijitu on a tan background. Kroll considered the <b>Pfalz</b> to be the Albatros's inferior in performance; He thought the <b>Pfalz</b> the slower of the two planes, climbed no better, but could be faster in a dive. Whichever aircraft he used, he rounded off 1917 by scoring his 15th victory on 4 December.|$|E
25|$|Because it was {{approved}} for production so late, the <b>Pfalz</b> XV never reached operational status. Nonetheless, several were built and finished, {{and there were}} 74 completed fuselages in the <b>Pfalz</b> works when these were inspected by the Allies {{in the autumn of}} 1919.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pfalz</b> built {{approximately}} 260 D.III and 750 D.IIIa aircraft. Most {{were delivered}} to Bavarian Jastas. Once <b>Pfalz</b> completed the final batch in May 1918, production {{shifted to the}} D.IIIa's successor, the D.XII. Some aircraft from the final D.IIIa batch were delivered to Turkey.|$|E

25|$|The Pfalz’s primary {{advantage}} was {{its strength}} and sturdiness. The Albatros scouts were plagued by failure of their single-spar lower wings. The <b>Pfalz,</b> however, could safely dive {{at high speeds}} due to its twin-spar lower wing. For this reason, the <b>Pfalz</b> was well-suited to diving attacks on observation balloons, which were usually heavily defended by anti-aircraft guns trained to the balloon's altitude.|$|E
25|$|Idflieg {{found the}} {{prototype}} promising. It directed <b>Pfalz</b> to halt {{production of the}} Roland D.III and to complete {{the balance of the}} contract, 70 aircraft, to the new design. After a Typenprüfung (type test) at Adlershof in May, the Idflieg ordered various modifications, including an enlarged rudder and horn-balanced ailerons. In June 1917, <b>Pfalz</b> received a second order for 300 aircraft.|$|E

25|$|He was {{reassigned to}} the Prussian Jagdstaffel 36 for {{transitional}} training into flying <b>Pfalz</b> D.III fighters in August 1917, but lasted fewer than four days. The process involved zeroing in an aircraft's machine guns on a firing range. Degelow accidentally wounded {{a member of}} the unit and was hastily reassigned on 17 August to Prussian Jasta 7 to fly a <b>Pfalz</b> D.III under the leadership of Leutnant Josef Jacobs.|$|E
25|$|Jasta 34 {{was founded}} with Albatros D.IIIs, on 20 February 1917. By 6 March 1918, they were {{operating}} Albatros D.V and Albatros D.Va fighters. The following month, on 10 April, they received Fokker Dr.I triplanes and <b>Pfalz</b> D.IIIs. On 15 June 1918, they took Fokker D.VIIs on strength. Near {{the end of}} August, they also received some <b>Pfalz</b> D.XIIs. The unit's aircraft markings featured white or silver tails and rear fuselages.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} D.XII first flew in March 1918. Subsequently, Idflieg {{issued a}} production order for 50 aircraft. <b>Pfalz</b> entered several D.XII prototypes {{in the second}} fighter competition at Adlershof in May/June 1918. Only Ernst Udet and Hans Weiss favored the D.XII over the Fokker D.VII, but Udet's opinion carried such weight that <b>Pfalz</b> received substantial production orders for the D.XII. The aircraft passed its Typenprüfung (official type test) on 19 June 1918.|$|E
25|$|The most {{pressing}} complaint {{about the new}} <b>Pfalz</b> was that the guns were buried in the fuselage, preventing pilots from clearing gun jams in flight. This feature had been carried over from the earlier Roland designs. In November 1917, <b>Pfalz</b> responded by producing the slightly modified D.IIIa, which relocated the guns to the upper fuselage decking. The D.IIIa was distinguishable by its enlarged semicircular horizontal stabilizer and cropped lower wingtips. It also featured a more powerful version of the Mercedes D.III engine.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pfalz</b> D.XV was a German {{single seat}} fighter {{aircraft}} which was approved for production {{right at the}} end of World War I, too late to enter service.|$|E
25|$|All {{seven of}} Kemp's {{remaining}} aerial victories (6–12) were from Bristol F.2b (C843). On 19 May 1918, Kemp and Thomson {{were on a}} patrol with No. 20 Squadron when they engaged about twenty enemy aircraft. As Thomson dived on a <b>Pfalz</b> D.III, Kemp fired three drums into it. The <b>Pfalz</b> was destroyed, crashing into a house at Estaires. Kemp racked up his seventh win on 21 May 1918 when an Albatros D.V was destroyed in flames over Warneton. His eighth {{was the result of}} an Albatros D.V that was sent out of control over Bac St Maur on 29 May 1918. Two days later, on 31 May 1918, Second Lieutenant Kemp scored a double victory when a <b>Pfalz</b> D.III was destroyed over Bois-Grenier and, minutes later, an Albatros D.V was sent out of control over Armentières. On 1 June 1918, Kemp earned his final two victories (11 and 12) when two Albatros D.V aircraft were destroyed over Comines.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Pfalz</b> D.XII {{which is}} now in the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C., was flown in The Dawn Patrol (1930), Hell's Angels (1930), and Men with Wings (1938).|$|E
25|$|Scaramanga {{racked up}} his seventh victory on 1 July 1918 {{when he sent}} a <b>Pfalz</b> D.III out of control over Armentières. He took out his eighth plane on 4 July 1918 when a Fokker D.VII was {{destroyed}} over Noyelles, north of Seclin, Nord. The lieutenant's ninth victory involved a DFW C destroyed north of La Bassée, Nord. Scaramanga's last three victories (10 through 12) all {{took place on the}} same day, 10 July 1918, from Bristol F.2b (C1003). He and his pilot Gurdon took on three <b>Pfalz</b> D.III aircraft, all over Armentières-Lille, Nord. One was destroyed and the other two sent out of control.|$|E
25|$|In April 1945 the Fifteenth Army {{crossed the}} Rhine, 2–3 weeks {{behind the other}} Allied Field Armies. It took over {{responsibility}} for the Hesse, Saarland, <b>Pfalz,</b> and Rhine provinces, where it processed many German POW's and Displaced Persons.|$|E
25|$|The type {{was also}} {{produced}} under licence in Germany by <b>Pfalz</b> Flugzeugwerke, who built {{it as the}} E.I, E.II, E.IV, E.V, and E.VI, with increasingly powerful engines. These were armed with a single, synchronised lMG 08 machine gun.|$|E
25|$|Then 46 Squadron re-equipped with Sopwith Camels. On 30 November 1917, Thomson used Camel no. B3514 {{to destroy}} an Albatros D.V and capture a <b>Pfalz</b> D.III. On 10 December, he drove down another D.V out of control, using Camel no. B2451.|$|E
25|$|A pair {{of flying}} replica <b>Pfalz</b> D.IIIs were {{constructed}} {{to appear in}} the 1966 epic First World War film The Blue Max, based on the novel of the same name by Jack D. Hunter. The aircraft subsequently appeared in Darling Lili (1970) and Von Richthofen & Brown (1971).|$|E
25|$|Mannock {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Order on 9 May 1918. The {{recommendation}} for the DSO was not signed by the King until two months after Mannock's death. This month Mannock nearly doubled his tally from 21 to 41. On 12 May he accounted for a trio of fighters—two Albatros D.Vs and a <b>Pfalz</b> D.III but the squadron lost Henry Eric Dolan. Mannock lamented his loss. Mannock again achieved two victories on 17 May. On 21 May in dogfights around Ypres he downed four enemies including three <b>Pfalz</b> D.IIIs; {{one in the morning}} patrol and three in the evening patrol within the space of five minutes. Two more confirmed victories on 26 and 29 May inflated his tally to 41. On the later date Mannock received the Bar to his DSO.|$|E
25|$|Original {{equipment}} upon foundation {{was four}} Fokker E.IVs, two Albatros D.IIs, two Fokker D.IIs, and a Halberstadt D.II. Later in the war, during the Summer of 1918, the unit operated Albatros D.Vs, <b>Pfalz</b> D.IIIs, Fokker D.VIIs, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, {{and a few}} Fokker D.VIIIs. The triplanes often had their cowlings painted black, with white facing.|$|E
25|$|Under {{his command}} A Flight scored many successes. Among the {{growing list of}} aces were Henry Eric Dolan and George McElroy. Mannock's own score {{increased}} to 20 {{by the end of}} the month. On 23 and 29 April he downed a <b>Pfalz</b> D.III and Fokker D.VI. Leutnant Ludwig Vortmann of Jasta 2 became Mannock's 20th victory.|$|E
25|$|Waight was {{assigned}} to 22 Squadron as an observer; {{he sat in the}} back seat of a two-seated Bristol F.2 Fighter and manned the rear machine guns to ward off attacks from behind. On 10 July 1918, Waight scored his first victory while piloted by ace T. W. Martin; he drove down a German <b>Pfalz</b> D.III fighter over Lille.|$|E
25|$|Following the referendum, the Council of the League of Nations {{decided that}} the Saar should return to Germany. The Saar once again became part of Germany on 1 March 1935, with Josef Bürckel as Reichskommissar. In 1936 it was {{incorporated}} into the Gau of <b>Pfalz</b> (Palatinate) to form the Gau Pfalz-Saar (renamed Saarpfalz in 1937 and Westmark in 1940).|$|E
25|$|Waight would score {{one more}} victory, {{a week before}} the Armistice; piloted by Stanley Wallage, he drove down a <b>Pfalz</b> D.XII out of control {{northwest}} of Bavay for the final victory for both himself and his squadron. Waight's personal victory score tallied as six enemy planes destroyed, two of which were shared; he also drove down six enemy planes out of control.|$|E
25|$|Gilmour {{destroyed}} a <b>Pfalz</b> the next day, and two the day after, for his final successes. In the end, his victory record {{showed that he}} had 1 balloon destroyed, 1 enemy aircraft captured, 24 aircraft destroyed (and 3 shared destroyed) and 10 claimed 'out of control'. Eight of the destroyed craft had gone down in flames, as had the balloon.|$|E
25|$|Serial 2600/18 was one {{of several}} <b>Pfalz</b> D.XIIs awarded to Australia in 1919 {{under the terms of the}} Armistice. Its service history is unknown. In late 1919, the {{aircraft}} was shipped from 2nd Aircraft Salvage Depot in France to England, and subsequently to Australia. It was temporarily exhibited in Melbourne and Adelaide in 1920. In 1924, the aircraft went on display in Sydney.|$|E
