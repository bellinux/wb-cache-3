"Another {{aspect of}} {{economic}} imperialism at {{work is the}} export of raw, unprocessed materials: live {{cattle on the hoof}} - mineral wealth, fish caught by foreign trawlers, etc. Further, from 1956 on, the Free State abandoned all attempts to secure an independent economy, and brought in foreign multi-national companies to create jobs instead of buying their skills and then sending them home gradually. Africanisation' is the word for this process elsewhere. Control of our affairs in all of Ireland lies more than ever since 1921 outside the hands of the Irish people.

40|$|Australia is endeavouring {{to expand}} the mix of power resources, and is {{investing}} heavily {{in the development of}} renewable generation methods such as concentrated solar thermal power. In these systems, the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> and turbine need to maintain high efficiency under non-ideal conditions away from the design point. Literature shows that there is a clear relationship between the selection of fluids, the design of the operating cycle, the fluctuation in operating conditions and changes in <b>power</b> <b>block</b> performance. It is thus important for innovative <b>power</b> <b>block</b> designs to consider the performance of the system as a whole rather than by component, mainly turbine design, cycle development and economic analysis. However, there are few works that consider the coupling of multidisciplinary design and robust design to turbine-fluid selection and economic analysis for realistic systems. Furthermore, existing methodologies for robust optimisation often do not consider the effects of high-density gas properties on the performance of the <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> It is also critical that a power generation system produces ideal economic outcomes that meet a number of key performance indicators including levelised cost of electricity. Therefore, this paper develops a preliminary multidisciplinary design and robust design applied to turbine-fluid selection and economic analysis of a solar-thermal <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> In this work, an Organic Rankine Cycle using novel working fluids for a solar thermal power system is developed. Integrating robust optimisation into the development of the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> is key to push efficiency further and guarantee <b>power</b> <b>block</b> feasibility when running at non-ideal conditions. A preliminary multidisciplinary optimisation is applied to design the complete <b>power</b> <b>block</b> concept such that the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> operates at peak performance across multiple analysis approaches. When using a multidisciplinary design approach, it is possible to perform robust optimisation on the whole <b>power</b> <b>block</b> where the target is on the economic outcomes rather than traditional targets such as efficiency, specific power generation capacity or size...|$|R

Research of the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> equipment heat state in the presence and absence of external heat insulation of the converted gas-turbine engine case was performed by computational fluid dynamics methods. Based on the maximum permissible gas-turbine engine case temperature under the conditions of fire- and explosion safety, thickness of heat-insulating mats on the different gas-turbine engine case parts was calculated. Simulation results have shown essential decrease of the temperatures of the gasturbine engine case external surface and low-sized <b>power</b> <b>block</b> equipment under low reduction of turbine efficiency and gas-turbine engine power due to additional heat expansion of the case.

40|$|Organic Rankine cycle (ORC), {{powered by}} line-focusing concentrating solar {{collectors}} (parabolic trough collector and linear Fresnel reflector), is a promising option for modular scale. ORC based <b>power</b> <b>block,</b> with dry working fluids, offers higher design and part-load efficiencies compared to steam Rankine cycle (SRC) in small-medium scale, with temperature sources up to 400 degrees C. However, {{the cost of}} ORC <b>power</b> <b>block</b> is higher compared to the SRC <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> Similarly, parabolic trough collector (PTC) system has higher optical efficiency and higher cost compared to linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) system. The thermodynamic efficiencies and <b>power</b> <b>block</b> costs also vary with working fluids of the Rankine cycle. In this paper, thermo-economic comparisons of organic Rankine and steam Rankine cycles powered by line focusing concentrating solar collectors are reported. A simple selection methodology, based on thermoeconomic analysis, and a comparison diagram for working fluids of power generating cycles are also proposed. Concentrating solar power plants with any collector technology and any power generating cycle can be compared using the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The Puretic {{power block}} line was {{introduced}} in the 1950s and was the key factor in the mechanization of purse seining.
