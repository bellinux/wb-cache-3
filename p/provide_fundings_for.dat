Therefore SeaDataNet is a standardized system for managing the large and diverse data sets collected by the oceanographic fleets and the automatic observation systems. Additional objectives consist in creating product with aggregated data such as climatological descriptions. This European funded project has started in 2004, the project is currently in its second phase with <b>fundings</b> <b>for</b> 2012 to 2016. Most of the datasets are free of access, but some are restricted to institutes. In term of harmonization SeaDataNet has chosen standards, vocabularies, tools {{that are used in}} the different NODC(National Oceanographic Data Center). For example they use Ocean Data View to validate or visualize datasets, they also use DIVA software to perform objective analysis. Datasets are covering the years 1800 up to 2012.

In Poland, the first to organise this campaign was the Hospice in Kraków in 1998, and in 2003, Father Eugeniusz Dutkiewicz Hospice SAC in Gdańsk joined the action. Each year, around 4 October, thousands of people plant daffodils (at hospitals, schools, government buildings, etc.) {{as a symbol of}} solidarity with cancer patients. In spring, when the flowers are in bloom, begins the action aiming to gather funds for providing hospice care. The volunteers, dressed in yellow T-shirts, collect money for the hospice on streets, in parks, in front of churches and shopping malls. A daffodil flower - the symbol of hope - is given out in thanks for contributions. The fund-raising is accompanied by various artistic happenings (e.g. concerts). In addition to gaining monetary <b>fundings</b> <b>for</b> the hospices, Fields of Hope is also aimed at promoting the idea of hospice care, informing the society of its role and activity, as well as sensitising people to the needs of terminally ill patients.|$|R
