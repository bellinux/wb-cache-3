5|$|The Una-class {{submarine}} (also {{known as}} Type 911) was {{a class of}} six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (English: Special objects shipyard) during the 1980s. They were designed {{with the purpose of}} laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines. Due to their mission <b>profile</b> <b>that</b> called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected, they lacked torpedo armament and a generator for battery recharging.|$|E
5|$|On a whim, Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), a young {{reporter}} for the Washington Herald who is stuck covering trivial “human interest” stories, pays a late-night visit to Frank at his home. She offers to be Frank’s undercover mouthpiece in the press {{in exchange for the}} elevated <b>profile</b> <b>that</b> she would gain from breaking substantive stories. Meanwhile, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll), a young, inexperienced congressman from Philadelphia, is arrested for drunk driving. Stamper finds out about the arrest and immediately contacts the D.C. police commissioner, offering Underwood’s support for his mayoral campaign in exchange for releasing Russo and completely covering up the incident. Russo is picked up from jail by his secretary and romantic partner, Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly). He lies to her, telling her that he was alone when he was arrested when, in fact, there was a prostitute (Rachel Brosnahan) in the car.|$|E
5|$|William D. Haywood {{was born}} in 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. His father, a former Pony Express rider, died of {{pneumonia}} when Haywood was three years old. His maternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in the Orange Free State in 1820. At age nine, he injured his right eye while whittling a slingshot with a knife, permanently blinding his right eye. Haywood never had his damaged eye replaced with a glass eye; when photographed, he would turn his head to show his left <b>profile.</b> <b>That</b> same year, he began working in the mines, never having received much formal education. After brief stints as a cowboy and a homesteader, he returned to mining in 1896. High-profile {{events such as the}} gradual demise of the Molly Maguires, the Haymarket Massacre in 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894 fostered Haywood's interest in the labor movement.|$|E

In 2010, three independent laboratories in Sweden, Norway, and England retested the original biological samples stored at Santiago de Compostela-institute in Spain and the Forensic institute in Norway, material that had been reported dispatched by Norwegian authorities. All laboratories reported the same result. The samples had positive DNA-profile from Jan Helge Andersen, but no match from Kristiansen.|$|E

25|$|Cooling air is airflow that is {{injected}} through small {{holes in the}} liner to generate a layer (film) of cool air to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of cooling air has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as cooling air. There are several different methods of injecting this cooling air, and the method can influence the temperature <b>profile</b> <b>that</b> the liner is exposed to (see Liner, above).|$|E
25|$|The Rouse profile characterizes {{sediment}} concentrations {{because the}} Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling {{under the weight}} of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration <b>profile</b> <b>that</b> provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.|$|E

25|$|It {{was first}} {{recorded}} in Italy around Venice under the synonym Bordò in 1855. The grape {{was introduced to}} the Swiss, from Bordeaux, sometime in the 19th century and was recorded in the Swiss canton of Ticino between 1905 and 1910. In the 1990s, Merlot saw an upswing of popularity in the United States. Red wine consumption, in general, increased in the US following the airing of the 60 Minutes report on the French Paradox and the potential health benefits of wine and, possibly, the chemical resveratrol. The popularity of Merlot stemmed in part from the relative ease in pronouncing the name of the wine as well as its softer, fruity <b>profile</b> <b>that</b> made it more approachable to some wine drinkers.|$|E
