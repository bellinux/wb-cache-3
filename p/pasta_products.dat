25|$|In the 1st century AD {{writings}} of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) were fine sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century Athenaeus of Naucratis provides {{a recipe for}} lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil. An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, a possible ancestor of modern-day lasagna. However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape. The first concrete information concerning <b>pasta</b> <b>products</b> in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century.|$|E

2500|$|Another major {{component}} of durum wheat is protein which plays {{a large role in}} pasta dough rheology. [...] Gluten proteins, which include monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenin, make up the major protein component of durum wheat (about 7580%). As more water is added and shear stress is applied, gluten proteins take on an elastic characteristic and begin to form strands and sheets. The gluten matrix that results during forming of the dough becomes irreversibly associated during drying as the moisture content is lowered to form the dried <b>pasta</b> <b>product.</b>|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{appreciation}} for food environmental attributes has recently gained in importance. The health-related attributes have received less {{attention in the}} literature, if organic farming products are excluded. We measure the consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for a traditional Italian <b>product,</b> <b>pasta,</b> when environmental and healthy attributes are added to it in turn. Relying on the prospect theory and on the bundling/unbundling debate, attributes cannot be perceived by consumers in absolute values. Accordingly, we assess if {{the way in which}} attributes are presented to consumers influences their WTP by comparing an “unbundling” approach—informing consumers of all product attributes and then subtracting one of them, to a “bundling” approach, progressively adding further attributes to the product’s description. To do this, we administered a questionnaire to a sample of households in North-Central Italy. WTP is elicited using an attribute based referenda format, slightly modified in accordance with our research objectives. The results show that Italian consumers, with the exception of specific subgroups, tend to prefer a traditional <b>pasta</b> <b>product,</b> probably because of both their taste preferences and eating habits. Some evidence emerged of an endowment effect, consumers valuing environmental attributes more when they feel themselves entitled to them...|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the rate of relaxation of semolina pasta on moisture content and temperature and how it affects shrinkage during drying {{has not yet been}} determined. The purpose of this research was to develop an equation that relates moisture content and temperature in order to obtain a master curve for creep of the product. When found, this equation could help to optimize the drying process and increase the quality of the final <b>pasta</b> <b>product.</b> Semolina flour mixed with water and propionic acid to create a 35 % wet basis product was extruded on a C. W. Brabender 2523 to obtain a flat, thin <b>pasta.</b> This <b>product</b> was dried in desiccators calibrated at different relative humidities (53. 2 %, 82. 3 %, 96. 4 %) and temperatures (40 OC, 80 OC) and then run through creep testing with a DMA and Texture Analyzer. Creep testing related the rate of relaxation to the relative humidity, moisture content, and temperature. The pasta that was tested at higher stresses tended to strain more. Also, higher moisture content pastas and pastas dried at higher temperatures tended to strain more. These results will be used in ongoing research relating the creep of semolina pasta to the rate of shrinkage of the product. Eventually, data such as this for other bio products will be collected and analyzed which can lead to better quality products and higher efficiency processes...|$|R

Arabs adapted noodles for long journeys in the 5th century, the first written record of dry pasta. The 9th-century Arab physician Isho bar Ali defines itriyya, the Arabic cognate of the Greek word, as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking. Muhammad al-Idrisi wrote in 1154 that itriyya was manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily. Itriya was also known by the Aramaic speakers under the Persian sphere and during the Islamic rule referred to a small soup noodle prepared by twisting bits of kneaded dough into shape.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} {{determinants}} of consumer demand for mozzarella cheese. Eighty-two consumers recruited in Potenza (Italy) received a questionnaire {{consisting of two}} sections: the first part concerned socio-demographic characteristics and consumers’ habits; the second section aimed at attaining specific information about the consumption of <b>pasta</b> filata <b>products</b> (e. g. frequency of purchase and consumption and place of purchase). In this section consumers also had to express their beliefs about items affecting purchasing and consuming <b>pasta</b> filata <b>products</b> (e. g. appearance, colour, ethical aspects, brand name, geographic origin, etc.) using a 7 -point scale: from 1 (unimportant) to 7 (very important). Consumers participating to the questionnaires were equally distributed for gender, mostly comprised {{in a range of}} 20 - 30 years of age (57 %), they were partially involved in purchasing food and meal preparation and 63 % had a university degree. Most of the respondents preferred a 150 g round size to 50 g and 20 g round sizes and 70 g braided size. They largely purchased these products at supermarkets. In order to identify the different items affecting purchasing and consumption of <b>pasta</b> filata <b>products,</b> the value of least significance difference (LSD) was calculated (significance level set at 95 %). Thus variables were grouped into four significantly different groups (Table 1) : the first group showing the highest consumers’ scores included taste/flavour, raw material origin, absence of preservatives, and texture, thus confirming the fundamental role played by sensory and safety dimensions in affecting consumer choices. In the second group, animal welfare was a central aspect affecting consumer decision and indicating their ethical involvement. In this group were also listed healthiness, colour, production area and nutritional characteristics. In the third cluster items related to appearance, dietetic features, ethical aspects (e. g. sustainability of the production chain), rearing system, animal diet and the place of purchase were all grouped. Conversely, packaging and brand were the least important for this sample of consumers. These results may help producers identifying the most important characteristics of mozzarella affecting consumer choice...|$|R
