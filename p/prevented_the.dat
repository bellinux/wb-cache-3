5|$|Financial {{problems}} with the defense budget in 1964 <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> substantial sums required from being allocated. Continuing financial short-falls <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> proposed effort from getting off the ground. This, {{as well as a}} serious accident in 1969 which caused a partial meltdown in the small Lucens pilot reactor, strengthened opposition against the Swiss nuclear program.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{marriage}} bars can {{be classified}} as <b>the</b> “hire bar” <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> hiring of married women, and <b>the</b> “retain bar” <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> retention of married workers.|$|R
5|$|As {{public concern}} over the {{accident}} grew while information and education was limited, misconceptions arose {{about the nature of}} radiation hazards. Residents near a Buddhist temple protested and <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> cremation of one of the victims, believing that the body could spread radiation, despite assurances by the OAEP to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic {{failure at}} the highest levels of {{government}} <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Reagan himself, he recalls the East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> citizens from experiencing the speech at all. The fact that West German police acted {{in a similar way}} has however seldom been noted in accounts such as these.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to build a canal from Machar via Adar to the White Nile to increase the volume of water flowing to Northern Sudan and Egypt, which apparently could be done without major environmental impact, but political instability has <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> project from starting.|$|E
5|$|Kennecott Copper Corporation, as of 1988, {{planned to}} dig an open-pit copper mine in a basin {{approximately}} one mile east of Image Lake. However, protests by various advocacy groups, such as The Mountaineers, <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> plan from developing further.|$|E
5|$|Königsberg and {{her sisters}} were {{designed}} to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in Germany's colonial empire. This {{was a result of}} budgetary constraints that <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> Kaiserliche Marine from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles.|$|E

50|$|Many pouch {{laminators}} {{require the}} use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the laminator. This helps <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> hot glue, some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up the rollers. <b>The</b> carrier <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> rollers from getting sticky, which helps to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> lamination pouch from wrapping around the rollers inside the laminator.|$|R
25|$|By way of analogy, {{think of}} a car with several minor faults. Each is not {{sufficient}} alone to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> car from running, but in combination, the faults combine to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> car from functioning.|$|R
5|$|Money Inc. made a {{surprise}} one-night return at Raw Family Reunion on October 9, 2006. They joined Arn Anderson and Rowdy Roddy Piper to assist Ric Flair, who was facing Mitch.

5|$|The United States {{ultimately}} {{ratified the}} U.N.'s Genocide Convention in 1986. The Convention was signed with reservations, which <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> law being enacted if it contradicted the Constitution.

50|$|MSCs {{can promote}} neuroprotection in the CNS of {{patients}} with MS which may <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> progression of the disease to chronic disability. MSCs contribute to neuroprotection through several different mechanisms. These mechanisms include inhibiting apoptosis which will <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> death of healthy cells and prevent gliosis which will <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> formation of a glial scar. They can also stimulate local progenitor cells to produce replacement cells that can assist in rebuilding the myelin sheath.|$|R
5|$|The {{result of}} the raid was disputed. Collier claimed the action was {{successful}} in destroying military stores for an attack on Fort Cumberland (although such stores had not been delivered to Machias), while the defenders claimed that they had successfully <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> capture of Machias and driven off the British.|$|E
5|$|This {{contract}} {{was completed in}} 1993, after which budgetary restraints <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> awarding of further contracts. As a result, aside from the interchange at Highway417 and some overpasses, construction activity on Highway416 came to a standstill for two years.|$|E
5|$|World War II in Europe {{began on}} 1 September 1939, with Nazi Germany's {{invasion}} of Poland. Two days later, the UK and France {{declared war on}} Germany. Poland's geographical location, however, <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> Allies from intervening directly. Four weeks into the attack, the Germans had successfully occupied Poland.|$|E
50|$|McEvoy {{played a}} key role in the {{unsuccessful}} effort to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> closure of Saint Mary's Hospital in New Westminster in 2004.

5000|$|During {{periods of}} war and bubonic plague, villages were often burned down, so to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> {{collapse}} of the upper floors, ground floors were built of stone and upper floors built in half-timberings to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> spread of fire.|$|R
5|$|A Japanese raiding party {{destroyed}} the bridge over Tuliahan River; Chase's security {{was not good}} enough. This <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> {{main body of the}} 1st Cavalry Division from linking up with Chase's force in Manila. Supplies were dispatched through the 37th Infantry Division's zone until engineers could build a new bridge. For his advance on Manila, Chase was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He was also awarded the Purple Heart for the burns to his hands.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs {{were made to the}} tower, and it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E
5|$|After the war, many Presbyterian leaders {{felt the}} need to adopt a new {{organizational}} structure. The Synod of New York and Philadelphia was intended to be an annual gathering of the members of all presbyteries and one elder from every congregation. Over half the members, however, were frequently absent due to long travel distances, and this <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> Synod from functioning effectively.|$|E
30|$|Disruption of the intactness of pachymeninges can <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> {{external}} pressure from getting transduced through the CSF {{space to the}} paravascular space and finally to the ECM.

50|$|In addition, {{because the}} colloid is {{relatively}} impervious to water, a slurry wall can <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> seepage of groundwater, which {{is useful in}} <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> further spread of groundwater that has been contaminated by toxic material such as industrial waste.|$|R
50|$|This erosion <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> {{accretion}} {{of these}} outer layers around the protostar at {{the centre of}} the core; and this, in turn, <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> protostar from becoming a fully fledged star.
