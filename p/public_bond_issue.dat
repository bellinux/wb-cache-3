The results suggest no effect for firms with a public debt rating and offsetting effects for firms without a public debt rating.

40|$|We analyze one {{frequently}} used clause in <b>public</b> <b>bonds</b> called covenant defeasance. Covenant defeasance allows the bond issuer {{to remove all}} of the bond's covenants by placing the remaining outstanding payments with a trustee in an escrow account to be paid out on schedule. Bond covenants are predominantly noncontingent, action-limiting covenants. By giving the issuer an option to remove covenants, noncontingent control rights can be made state-contingent even when no interim signals are available. We provide a theoretical justi cation for covenant defeasance and show empirically that such a clause allows {{for the inclusion of}} more covenants in <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues.</b> In line with the model's prediction, our empirical analysis documents a 13 - 25 basis points premium for defeasible bonds.

40|$|Amalgamation offers {{municipalities}} {{an incentive}} to free ride when they can subrogate the load to a new municipality after amalgamation. Previous literature has clarified opportunistic behavior in local <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues.</b> However, if the municipality {{does not have a}} leeway in policy decision making, it cannot adopt free-ride behavior. Although the Japanese long-term care insurance system has been so designed that the municipality does not have discretion in its working, doubts have been raised on this score. This study empirically considers this issue by examining municipality behavior before amalgamation. Difference-in-difference regression confirms a free-ride effect in the eligibility assessments for long-term care by the Japanese municipality. These results mean that the Japanese long-term care insurance system is not managed in accordance with the institutional design...|$|R
40|$|El presente {{document}}o presenta la propuesta para estructurar los Warrants en el mercado público de valores colombiano, aquí se dan a conocer tanto las ventajas como las desventajas que pueden representar el uso de Warrants como mecanismo de financiación de las empresas inscritas en la Bolsa de Valores de Colombia; Lo anterior, con base a la experiencia que se ha logrado en los mercados de países como España y México, los cuales ya cuentan con una trayectoria a {{lo largo de}} varias décadas con este instrumento financiero. Para el caso de Colombia, se propone la estructuración de Warrants como endulzante de una emisión de bonos de forma que sea una alternativa mucho más viable para determinado tipo de empresas que por asuntos restrictivos, les es muy costoso participar activamente en la emisión de papeles y otros títulos valores como acciones. This document gives {{a proposal}} to structure Warrants in the public Colombian stock market, here are published advantages and disadvantages that could represent the Warrants usage as finanting instrument for companies listed in the Colombia Stock Exchange; therefore, based in the experience achieved for both financial markets {{in countries such as}} Spain and Mexico, which have a noted development along the decades with this financial instrument. For Colombia, is proposed the launch of Warrants structure as sweetener for bonds issue, so that, it is converted in a more feasible alternative for such companies with strong restrictions, that could not participate in active way in the use of bonds or other stocks or shares. In this way, an application has been developed to simulate a Warrants issue which inputs are the necessary parameters for the mathematical model that has the instrument valuation to determinate the financing cost. Besides, through the Warrants implementation is possible to get other financial ratios, useful for the companies to form their instrument based in the liquidity or cash flow. In this thesis, three cases have been simulated as examples, which are real companies, and data that belong to target companies which main feature is the low trading volume. As results for this analysis, the main factors that affect the value and issue fundamentals are shown. Finally, it’s identified the legal framework in Colombia applicable for issue and structure procedures for new derivative products, the requirements and valuation methods for the risks and the instrument itself, they are cited from the Colombian Financial Superintendence Authority. In the same way, the taxation policy is a prominent aspect to define the appropriate framework around a future <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> attached to Warrants...|$|E
40|$|Agency theory {{posits that}} debt-like {{compensation}} (such as defined-benefit pensions and other deferred compensation) aligns managerial interests {{more closely with}} those of debtholders and reduces the agency cost of debt. Consistent with theory, we find that a higher CEO relative leverage, defined as {{the ratio of the}} CEO's inside leverage (debt-to-equity compensation) to corporate leverage, is associated with lower cost of debt financing and fewer restrictive covenants, for a sample of private loans originated during 2006 - 2008. These findings persist after accounting for the endogeneity of CEO relative leverage, and are more pronounced for firms with higher default risk. Additional analysis on a sample of new <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> also shows a negative relation between CEO relative leverage and bond yield spread. Overall, the evidence supports the notion that debtholders recognize the incentive effects of executive debt-like compensation and adjust the terms of corporate debt contracts accordingly...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine whether}} state laws impact {{the use of}} debt {{covenants}} by using a sample of U. S. <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> from 1987 to 2004. We consider variation in state laws {{with respect to the}} minimum asset-to-debt ratio necessary for a payout and with respect to antitakeover statutes. We find that firms incorporated in states with stricter restrictions on distributions are less likely to include debt covenants that constrain payouts, limit additional debt, or restrict the sale of assets. Thus, state payout restrictions appear to be a substitute for the use of these debt covenants. On the other hand, firms incorporated in states with stronger antitakeover statutes are somewhat more likely to use debt covenants. This finding is consistent with the notion that firms with antitakeover protection are more likely to suffer from agency problems and, thus, are more likely to use debt covenants to minimize agency costs.
