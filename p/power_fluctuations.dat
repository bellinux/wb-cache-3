25|$|Subsequent to the {{discovery}} of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments have been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the NASA Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite that orbited in 1989–1996 and which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out cosmic strings as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested cosmic inflation was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the BOOMERanG experiment reported that the highest <b>power</b> <b>fluctuations</b> occur at scales of approximately one degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the universe is flat. A number of ground-based interferometers provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the Very Small Array, Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|Spontaneous {{activity}} is brain {{activity in the}} absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses. [...] The term ongoing brain {{activity is}} used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a stimulus or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form evoked potentials/evoked fields, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be noise if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis. [...] Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as alpha waves, are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of <b>power</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a noise process. In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the default network. The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.|$|E

The rings are shown being drained of their power (which Arisia interprets as a deliberate display of how the same could be done to green power rings). More importantly, the delegates also discover that a number of female Sinestro Corps members have also been collected after the war and are imprisoned in violet crystals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the wind}} <b>power</b> <b>fluctuation</b> {{is divided into}} three categories. For the purpose of {{balancing}} all kinds of wind <b>power</b> <b>fluctuation</b> to enhance the penetration levels of wind power, we propose an active-parallel hybrid energy storage system (APHESS). The APHESS is composed of a battery, a supercapacitor, and two charge-discharge controllers. By combining the battery with the supercapacitor, the APHESS obtains the enhanced energy storage performance. Therefore, the investment cost can be reduced. By the reasonable design on the operation mode of APHESS, the APHESS can interchange power precisely with the wind power system. Furthermore, the battery and supercapacitor can suppress separately different kinds of wind <b>power</b> <b>fluctuation</b> to make their own energy storage properties fully utilized. The APHESS can be widely used in wind farm for the real-time regulation on wind power...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of thermostatically {{controlled}} loads, active <b>power</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and peak demand growth within an autonomous micro-grid become serious problems. This paper tries to suppress <b>power</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and shave peak demand for a micro-grid through optimizing domestic electric water heaters (controllable load). In this paper, domestic electric water heater models are first built to optimize power flow within a single water heater. Subsequently, the Monte Carlo method is proposed to simulate power consumption of a cluster of domestic electric water heaters. After that, the temperature state priority list method is presented to suppress power flow and shave peak demand for a given micro-grid. Optimization results show that the proposed temperature state priority list method can reduce peak demand by 12. 5 %. However, it has a wider active <b>power</b> <b>fluctuation</b> range and needs a longer reaction time compared with the simplified temperature state priority list method. In addition, the optimization results show that by increasing the number of controllable loads participating in load scheduling, active <b>power</b> <b>fluctuation</b> can be reduced and the maximum active power of the given micro-grid can be cut. However, to achieve this, about 1. 2 % of extra electrical energy needs to be generated by the external grid...|$|R
