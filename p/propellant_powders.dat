50|$|As {{the speed}} of {{technological}} advances accelerated in civilian applications, so too warfare became more industralised. The newly invented machine gun and repeating rifle redefined firepower on the battlefield, and, in part, explains the high casualty rates of the American Civil War. The next breakthrough was the conversion of artillery parks from the muzzle loading guns, to the quicker loading breech loading guns with recoiling barrel that allowed quicker aimed fire and use of a shield. The widespread introduction of low smoke (smokeless) <b>propellant</b> <b>powders</b> since the 1880s also allowed for a great improvement of artillery ranges.|$|E

To improve temperature stability, in particular cold brittle behaviour, at least one organic titanate from the group of monoalkoxyl, chelate, quaternery, neoalkoxyl or coordinated titanates and/or at least one organic ziroconate from the group of neoalkoxyl zirconates are added to the <b>propellant</b> <b>powder</b> at a ratio of <= 2 %, preferably <= 0. 5 %.

50|$|In 1854 a new Colonial Magazine was {{constructed}} {{to the north}} of the existing magazine, which became known as the Queen's Magazine. This was a building of much lighter construction, and was intended for the storage of civilian explosives belonging to the colonial government and local merchants. In 1864 the police station was converted into a laboratory for the preparation of cartridges, requiring the building of a bridge over the cut. The water police were moved to Kirribilli. In the 1870s magazines were built on the east side of the island to house the new explosive dynamite.

The developed methodologies were applied to the analysis of unburned propellant and OGSR from spent ammunition cartridges and fabrics subjected to firearm discharges. Throughout the study a total of 16 ammunition types where investigated. Work carried out on the suitability of various SPME fibre types showed that 65 μm PDMS/DVB was the most appropriate type for extracting the compounds of interest.

40|$|Gun {{propellants}} mainly {{consist of}} ingredients like nitrocellulose and plasticizers. An appropriate plasticizer forms {{together with the}} nitrocellulose a gel. This process of gelation may be supported using a good solvent for nitrocellulose during the manufacturing process. In order to have an insight {{in the structure of}} gun propellants and to evaluate the gelation activity of different plasticizers polarized light microscopic and scanning electron microscopy investigations of different gun <b>propellant</b> <b>powders</b> were performed at Fraunhofer-ICT. In this paper the results of these investigations are shown. Polarized light microscopy enables to structural investigations of different materials, such as propellants. There is a significantly clear image of specific features, which appear in their maximum interference colours. The magnification lies in the region of 1 to 1000 µm. Crystal distribution and homogeneity of the propellant can be investigated. Especially the degree of crystallinity of nitrocellulose in gun propellants can be qualitatively described.

Sensors I, II and III display near-Nernstian response for 1. 0 × 10 − 5 – 1. 0 × 10 − 2, 3. 1 × 10 − 5 – 1. 0 × 10 − 2 and 3. 1 × 10 − 6 – 1. 0 × 10 − 2 molL− 1 ClO 4 − with lower detection limits of 6. 1 × 10 − 6, 6. 9 × 10 − 6 and 1. 2 × 10 − 6 molL− 1, and anionic calibration slopes of 50. 9 ± 0. 4, 48. 4 ± 0. 4 and 57. 7 ± 0. 3 mV decade− 1, respectively. Methods for determining perchlorate using these sensors offer many attractive advantages including simplicity, flexibility, cost effectiveness, wide linear dynamic response range (0. 1 – 1000 ppm), {{low detection limit}} (< 1. 2 × 10 − 6 molL− 1 ≡ 0. 1 ppm), small sample test volume (100 μL), safety, short response time (< 20 s), long life span (~ 8 weeks), and extended wide working pH range (4. 5 – 8. 0).

Indium-porphyrin based membrane sensor (sensor III) is used as a detector in a wall-jet flow injection set-up to enable accurate flow injection analysis (FIA) of perchlorate in some fireworks without interferences from the associated reducing agents (sulfur and charcoal), binders (dextrin, lactose), coloring agents (calcium, strontium, copper, iron, sodium), color brighten (linseed oil) and regulators (aluminum flakes) which are commonly used in the formulations.

A small piece of paper with writing on it can be stored inside. Given that ammunition can be found everywhere in a combat zone, it is very easy to hide or discard such items because they blend in easily.

50|$|Rimfire is {{a method}} of {{ignition}} for metallic firearm cartridges {{as well as the}} cartridges themselves. It is called rimfire because the firing pin of a gun strikes and crushes the base's rim to ignite the primer. The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the <b>propellant</b> <b>powder</b> and the projectile (bullet). Once the rim of the cartridge has been struck and the bullet discharged, the cartridge cannot be reloaded, because the head has been deformed by the firing pin impact. While many other different cartridge priming methods have been tried since the 19th century, only rimfire technology and centerfire technology survive today in significant use.|$|R

The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb. Like Thin Man, it was a gun-type fission weapon, but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235, whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239. Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium (the [...] "bullet") onto a solid cylinder of the same material (the [...] "target") {{by means of a}} charge of nitrocellulose <b>propellant</b> <b>powder.</b> It contained [...] of enriched uranium, of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission.

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of direct impingement {{is that the}} breech of the firearm's firing mechanism becomes fouled more quickly due to being exposed to the propellants of the cartridge. This is caused by solids from the high-temperature gas condensing on the bolt face and primary operating mechanism. The combustion gases contain vaporized metals, carbon, and impurities in a gaseous state until they contact cooler operating parts. The deposits increase friction on the bolt's camming system leading to malfunctions, so that thorough and frequent cleaning is required to ensure reliability. The amount of fouling depends upon the rifle's design {{as well as the}} type of <b>propellant</b> <b>powder</b> used. For example, the French MAS 44 and MAS 49 series of rifles was known to have been successfully operated for years with corrosive-primed ammunition using ordinary field cleaning expedients such as gasoline (as solvent) and straight-grade motor oil (as lubricant)..|$|R
5000|$|Historically, the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle was {{the first}} {{military}} firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition.

Poudre B was three times as powerful as black powder, for the same weight, and left virtually no residues of combustion. At about the same time, in 1882, a captain (later colonel) Eduard Rubin (1846-1920) (Swiss Army) had invented the first full-metal-jacket (FMJ) rifle bullets. Wrapping a protective copper jacket around the lead core of a bullet was also a transformative event in firearm history since, from then on, bullets could be fired at very high velocities without melting inside a rifle's barrel. Eduard Rubin was soon followed by Hebler, also in Switzerland, who created the first steel jacketed rifle bullets.|$|R
