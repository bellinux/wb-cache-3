500|$|Heavy metal {{is usually}} based on riffs created with three main {{harmonic}} traits: modal scale <b>progressions,</b> tritone and chromatic <b>progressions,</b> {{and the use}} of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes. Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord <b>progressions</b> such as the Aeolian <b>progressions</b> I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian <b>progressions</b> implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord <b>progressions.</b> In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses [...] "pentatonic and blues-derived features".|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} when {{the set of}} primitive geodesic lengths on a Riemannian manifold have arbitrarily long arithmetic <b>progressions.</b> We prove that {{in the space of}} negatively curved metrics, a metric having such arithmetic <b>progressions</b> is quite rare. We introduce almost arithmetic <b>progressions,</b> a coarsification of arithmetic <b>progressions,</b> and prove that every negatively curved, closed Riemannian manifold has arbitrarily long almost arithmetic <b>progressions</b> in its primitive length spectrum. We also prove that every noncompact arithmetic hyperbolic 2 - or 3 -manifold has arbitrarily long arithmetic <b>progressions</b> in its primitive length spectrum. We end with a conjectural characterization of arithmeticity.

40|$|Zoltán Kodály’s String Quartet No. 1 in C Minor {{is one of}} his {{earliest}} compositions. Kodály composed this as a tonal work, emulating the style used by nineteenth century composers. Kodály creates highly polyphonic textures and a complex harmonic language within the C minor tonality. Although this piece is considered tonal, Kodály deviates from the prototypical norms of tonal composition. As in most tonal music, harmonic <b>progressions</b> tend to support the overall tonal syntax. This includes chords, chord <b>progressions,</b> and key areas. The goal of this thesis is to categorize harmonic <b>progressions</b> in the first movement of Kodály’s String Quartet. In order for harmonic <b>progressions</b> to take place {{at the level of the}} chord, harmonic function must be present. I will break down the function of each chord by using Daniel Harrison’s scale degree theory from his book Harmonic Function in Chromatic Music. Some harmonic <b>progressions</b> follow a prototypical model that was utilized in common practice music. There are also chords in harmonic <b>progressions</b> that have an altered function—yet are still considered harmonic—which I will call “quasi-harmonic. ” Lastly, some <b>progressions</b> are purely linear, and therefore the function is discerned on the macro level...|$|R

Brown and Bunton sing the first lines of the first verse; the <b>progression</b> then changes to Bm7–E–Dmaj7–C♯7 during the last part of the verse, which is sung by Chisholm. After the chorus, the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, with Halliwell, Beckham, and Chisholm singing the second verse. The <b>progression</b> changes to Bm7–C♯m7–Gmaj9–F♯7(♯9) as Chisholm sings the bridge, while the rest of the group adds the high harmony.
