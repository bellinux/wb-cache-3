It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses <b>plasma</b> <b>gas</b> to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster.

40|$|Due to the {{ecological}} and economic restrictions, which are increasingly {{imposed on the}} textile industry, the development of environmentally friendly and economic processes is required. In wool processes such as printing, dyeing and anti-felting finishing, the wool surface morphology plays an important role. A number of investigations revealed that low temperature plasma (LTP) provided an alternative way, as an environmentally friendly method, for improving the wool surface morphology when compared with conventional wet chemical processes such as chlorination. The LTP-treated wool showed better performance in the dyeability and anti-felting tendency. Previous studies indicated that the surface chemical composition varied {{with the nature of}} <b>plasma</b> <b>gases</b> used and also the treatments durations. However, the surface morphological changes in relation to the <b>plasma</b> <b>gases</b> used and treatment duration were seldom reported. Therefore, this study was aimed to report this issue. In this study, wool fibre was treated with LTP under the influence of different non-polymerising <b>plasma</b> <b>gases</b> namely: 100 % oxygen, 100 % nitrogen and a 25 % hydrogen/ 75 % nitrogen gas mixture.

50|$|In an ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antenna, a <b>gas</b> is ionized {{to create}} a <b>plasma.</b> Unlike <b>gases,</b> <b>plasmas</b> have very high {{electrical}} conductivity so {{it is possible for}} radio frequency signals to travel through them so that they act as a driven element (such as a dipole antenna) to radiate radio waves, or to receive them. Alternatively the plasma {{can be used as a}} reflector or a lens to guide and focus radio waves from another source.|$|R
50|$|Early {{practical}} {{examples of}} the technology used discharge tubes to contain the plasma and {{are referred to as}} ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antennas. Ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antennas can be turned on and off and are good for stealth and resistance to electronic warfare and cyber attacks. Ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antennas can be nested such that the higher frequency plasma antennas are placed inside lower frequency plasma antennas. Higher frequency ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antenna arrays can transmit and receive through lower frequency ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antenna arrays. This means that the ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antennas can be co-located and ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antenna arrays can be stacked. Ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antennas can eliminate or reduce co-site interference. Smart ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antennas use plasma physics to shape and steer the antenna beams without the need of phased arrays. Satellite signals can be steered and/or focused in the reflective or refractive modes using banks of plasma tubes making unique ionized <b>gas</b> satellite <b>plasma</b> antennas. The thermal noise of ionized <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> antennas is less than in the corresponding metal antennas at the higher frequencies. Solid state plasma antennas (also known as plasma silicon antennas) with steerable directional functionality that can be manufactured using standard silicon chip fabrication techniques are now also in development. Plasma silicon antennas are candidates for use in WiGig (the planned enhancement to Wi-Fi), and have other potential applications, for example in reducing the cost of vehicle-mounted radar collision avoidance systems.|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric Pressure-Plasma Activated Bonding {{enables the}} {{possibility}} to ignite plasma at specific local areas or the whole surface of the substrate. Between the two electrodes <b>plasma</b> <b>gas</b> is ignited via alternating voltage.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the {{ignition}} of plasma under low pressure conditions (<300 torr) is almost spontaneous, once the r.f. power {{imposed on the}} coil achieves a certain threshold value (depending on the torch configuration, gas flow rate etc.). The state of <b>plasma</b> <b>gas</b> (usually argon) will swiftly transit from glow-discharge to arc-break and create a stable induction plasma. For the case of atmospheric ambient pressure conditions, ignition is often accomplished {{with the aid of}} a Tesla coil, which produces high-frequency, high-voltage electric sparks that induce local arc-break inside the torch and stimulate a cascade of ionization of <b>plasma</b> <b>gas,</b> ultimately resulting in a stable plasma.|$|E
5000|$|Further, the {{electrons}} {{are not able}} to leave the electrode within the positive half wave of applied voltage, so the negative electrode is charged up to 1000 V (bias voltage).

With the aim of developing this technique, we analyzed the virucidal effect of N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> on influenza virus and its influence on the viral components. We treated influenza virus particles with inert N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> (1. 5 [*]kpps; kilo pulses per second) produced by a short high-voltage pulse generated from a static induction thyristor power supply. A bioassay using chicken embryonated eggs demonstrated that N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> inactivated influenza virus in allantoic fluid within 5 [*]min. Immunochromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Coomassie brilliant blue staining showed that N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> treatment of influenza A and B viruses in nasal aspirates and allantoic fluids as well as purified influenza A and B viruses induced degradation of viral proteins including nucleoprotein. Analysis using the polymerase chain reaction suggested that N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> treatment induced changes in the viral RNA genome. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that aggregation and fusion of influenza viruses were induced by N 2 <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> treatment.

Although Park’s group and others have worked on the inactivation of lipopolysaccharide using a different technology for producing <b>gas</b> <b>plasma</b> (Park et al. 2007; Shintani et al. 2007), there are no reports showing the inactivation of Stx using <b>gas</b> <b>plasma.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>plasma,</b> <b>gas</b> atoms {{are excited}} to higher energy states and also ionized.

50|$|Balance of the {{chemical}} reactions on the substrate surface depends on the <b>plasma</b> <b>gas</b> composition, velocity of the gas flow, {{as well as the}} temperature. The effect of the latter two factors depends on the probability of the reaction. Here one distinguishes two regimes. In a diffusion regime, with a high reaction probability, the speed of the reaction depends on the velocity of the gas flow, but does not depend on the gas temperature. In the other, kinetic regime, with a low reaction probability, the speed of the reaction depends strongly on the gas temperature according to the Arrhenius equation.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the {{selection}} of <b>plasma</b> <b>gases</b> in an induction plasma processing is first determined by the processing chemistry, i.e., if the processing requiring a reductive or oxidative, or other environment.

50|$|Plasma {{techniques}} are especially useful {{because they can}} deposit ultra thin (a few nm), adherent, conformal coatings. Glow discharge plasma is created by filling a vacuum with a low-pressure gas (ex. argon, ammonia, or oxygen). The gas is then excited using microwaves or current which ionizes it. The ionized gas is then thrown onto a surface at a high velocity where the energy produced physically and chemically changes the surface. After the changes occur, the ionized <b>plasma</b> <b>gas</b> is able to react with the surface to make it ready for protein adhesion.

Unlike oxy-fuel cutting, the PAC process can be applied to cutting metals which form refractory oxides such as stainless steel, cast iron, aluminum, and other non-ferrous alloys.
