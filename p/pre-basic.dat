25|$|There are {{a number}} of other subspecies, some of which may have arisen because of partial {{geographical}} isolation, such as the resident British form, the pied wagtail M. a. yarrellii, which now also breeds in adjacent areas of the neighbouring European mainland. The pied wagtail, named for naturalist William Yarrell, exchanges the grey colour of the nominate form with black (or very dark grey in females), but is otherwise identical in its behaviour. Other subspecies, the validity of some of which is questionable, differ in the colour of the wings, back, and head, or other features. Some races show sexual dimorphism during the breeding season. As many as six subspecies may be present in the wintering ground in India or Southeast Asia and here they can be difficult to distinguish. Phylogenetic studies using mtDNA suggest that some morphological features have evolved more than once, including the back and chin colour. Breeding M. a. yarrellii look much like the nominate race except for the black back, and M. a. alboides of the Himalayas differs from the Central Asian M. a. personata only by its black back. M. a. personata has been recorded breeding in the Siddar Valley of Kashmir of the Western Himalayas. It has also been noted that both back and chin change colour during the <b>pre-basic</b> moult; all black-throated subspecies develop white chins and throats in winter and some black-backed birds are grey-backed in winter.|$|E

These data demonstrated that: (1) Godwits conducted overlapping pre-alternate and pre-supplemental moults; (2) <b>pre-basic</b> and pre-breeding moults were scheduled differently in relation to southbound and northbound migration respectively; (3) northern and southern Alaskan breeding Godwits of each sex were distinguishable by plumage differences throughout the non-breeding season; and (4) males and northern breeders achieved more extensive breeding plumage by spending longer in pre-breeding moult in New Zealand, rather than through faster moult rates or greater investment in moult during migratory stopover in Asia. The existence of a ventral pre-supplemental moult implies that contemporary selection for red breeding plumage overrides older selection for barred alternate plumage. Our use of individual-based data revealed a continuum of annual moult strategies within the population, which may reflect individual differences in any combination of sex, size, migration distance or breeding location.

40|$|Scarcity of {{good quality}} seed is major {{obstacle}} to expanded potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in sub-saharan Africa (SSA). Constraints in availability and supply of seed potato are partly attributable to challenges in production of <b>pre-basic</b> which is an intermediary step necessary in production of seed tubers in the seed potato value chain. Aeroponic minutuber production is a relatively recent technology {{that has the potential}} to break the seed potato bottleneck in many SSA countries due to several advantages that it holds especially those related to high multiplication rates; typically (1 : 50 - 100) that arise from sequential harvesting. There are, however, a number of potential challenges which, if not addressed, can contribute to non attainment of the projected increases in seed availability and not only mess up the 3 generation (3 G) revolution strategy of boosting seed tuber production in SSA but also jeopardize the adoption of the technology. Besides problems associated with failure of electricity supply and management of nutrition, the Achilles‘ heel of aeroponic minituber production is probably the large variation in physiological age of resulting tubers due to sequential harvesting that takes place over several months during the production cycle. In the absence of cold storage facilities which are few and beyond the reach of many <b>pre-basic</b> seed potato growers in many SSA countries, harvested minitubers can either be at dormant, apical dominance, multiple sprouting or senile stage when they are required for planting with significant impacts on subsequent yields. This paper discusses the problems associated with physiological age in seed tuber systems based on aeroponic minitubers and proposes some approaches that may overcome these challenges to ensure that the promise of aeroponic minituber production is realized. The proposed approaches include the strategic application of dormancy inhibiting and dormancy promoting substances at various stages of aeroponic minituber production combined with the use of low cost storage systems such as the diffused light storage technology depending on the dormancy period of the variety (ies) being grown.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The Kittlitz's murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris) is {{a species}} of {{conservation}} concern over the entirety of its known range, which spans coastal Alaska and northeastern Russia. Concerns {{about the status of}} the species have been raised due to evidence of population declines in key breeding areas, low reproductive output, and perceived threats to adult survival. A general lack of information related to vital rates and natural history for this species has hampered efforts to address potential threats and drivers of population decline. This thesis addresses the hypothesis that foraging conditions and nutritional stress {{may be related to the}} observed low reproductive output and apparent population declines. I used stable isotope analysis of Kittlitz's murrelet feathers and blood to assess foraging habits during four separate periods across the annual cycle. I also used stable isotope signatures (δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C) in feathers from museum specimens collected in southeastern Alaska during 1907 – 1984 to investigate potential long-term trends in food habits and foraging ecology. I found that δ¹⁵N progressively increased by 5 ‰ between the vernal pre-alternate molt and the autumnal <b>pre-basic</b> molt, equivalent to an increase of 1. 5 trophic levels for assimilated prey, whereas seasonal patterns in δ¹³C suggest shifts in foraging habitat between breeding and non-breeding periods. These results indicate that the pre-breeding diet was comprised primarily of low trophic level prey from offshore habitats, such as macrozooplankton and/or larval fish. During the summer breeding season, Kittlitz's murrelets gradually switched to consuming higher proportions of planktivorous fish from nearshore habitats. By the post-breeding period, during the <b>pre-basic</b> molt, the diet was comprised almost exclusively of higher trophic level prey, presumably forage fish, from offshore habitats. Based on stable isotope signatures of murrelet feathers from museum specimens, these seasonal patterns were evident during the past century (1907 - 2009). δ¹³C in feathers grown during pre- and post-breeding (pre-alternate and <b>pre-basic</b> molts, respectively) became significantly more depleted over the last century, however, suggesting either a gradual change in diet and/or foraging habitat or a long-term shift in the isotopic composition of prey. I investigated potential energy constraints on reproduction in Kittlitz's murrelets by constructing a bioenergetics model to estimate energy budgets for breeding adult Kittlitz's murrelets under different scenarios of prey energy content and commuting distance between foraging areas and nest sites. Estimated field metabolic rate (FMR) of breeding Kittlitz's murrelets during the chick-rearing period exceeded the hypothetical maximum sustainable working capacity (MSWC; 4 times basal metabolic rate [BMR]) under empirically derived scenarios of prey energy content and commuting distance. This suggests that, under conditions of low energy content in available prey and/or long commuting distances to inland nest sites, Kittlitz's murrelets would be required to expend energy at a rate that, if maintained over an extended period, could be detrimental to subsequent adult survival and overall fitness. In addition, energy expenditure rates at the high end of the estimated range may exceed the rate at which food energy can be assimilated by adult murrelets. Metabolism of fat reserves, as indicated by mass loss during the breeding season, may be a partial, although limited, solution to periods of high energy demand for breeding adults. This thesis research is the first to indicate that Kittlitz's murrelets rely on distinctly different prey resources during different periods of the annual cycle. The previously unappreciated seasonal complexity of Kittlitz's murrelet foraging ecology offers a new perspective on potential factors limiting survival and reproduction in this species of conservation concern. In addition, my research suggests an adaptive explanation for the low breeding frequency and low reproductive output of Kittlitz's murrelets that is related to the exceptionally high energy expenditure rates required to raise young at nest sites as much as 70 km inland from the coast and up to 2, 500 m above sea level. Because of their high level of reproductive effort, Kittlitz's murrelets may be more dependent on the high availability of high-lipid marine prey than other seabirds...|$|E
40|$|Across avian systems, plumage {{ornamentation}} {{is often}} considered {{a signal of}} individual fitness, condition, sex, or status, and varies due to genetics or environmental sources. In species with structural coloration, plumage variation results from differences {{in the amount of}} energy allocated to feather growth during molt, presenting a unique opportunity to study the link between individual quality and ornamentation. In cooperative breeding species, such as the Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the role of structural color as a signal is particularly important because helpers may delay breeding for one to several years and competition for space is high. Florida Scrub-Jay juveniles are sexually dimorphic in the ultraviolet range, and plumage color predicts social dominance and condition, but not adult reproductive fitness. Little is known about the consistency of ultraviolet reflectance across molts, and I tested the following questions: 1) does plumage color change across molts within individuals; 2) how do environmental variables and stress affect structural color; and 3) does adult color or change in color predict reproductive fitness? I measured relative change in color within individuals by comparing their juvenile and first set of adult feathers after <b>pre-basic</b> molt. I used several measures of nutritional condition, social dynamics, habitat quality, and parasite infection to model color, and I experimentally administered corticosterone during <b>pre-basic</b> molt {{to examine the effects of}} increased stress on color. Plumage reflectance was compared with breeding status to investigate the role of color in breeding space acquisition. Plumage reflectance was significantly different within individuals across molts, but juvenile and adult color were correlated. Adults were significantly less bright than juveniles, with higher proportions of UV chroma and hues shifted toward UV wavelengths. Variation in feather color was best explained by sex, mass, parasite infection, and an interaction between area of oak scrub and group size. Juvenile feather color was also strongly associated with mother ID, but this was not the case for adults even though adult color was correlated with juvenile color. Adult chroma was reduced in birds treated with corticosterone, and hues were shifted toward longer wavelengths. No measure of adult color predicted acquisition of breeding space, but change in brightness and hue were significant predictors of acquisition for females, where breeders tended to experience greater reductions in brightness and shifts toward UV hues compared to helpers. This may be due to sex-specific differences in reproductive strategies in Florida Scrub-Jays. Females tend to disperse farther distances and breed earlier than males, potentially expending more energy foraying and searching for breeding space, which could reduce brightness if it is linked with condition. These results suggest that sexual selection is not a dominant factor in plumage ornamentation for Florida Scrub-Jays, and understanding the interaction between plumage color, personality, and reproductive fitness should be a priority for future research...|$|E

Correlation of exercises for sense of space, muscular sense, sense of time took from 15 to 25 % of total time of training. During 5 seconds’ work quantity of repetitions was from 8 to 12 - 15 times. Rest pauses between exercises were from 1 to 1 - 2 minutes. The offered methodic facilitated improvement of coordination fitness indicators of taekwondo athletes: keeping of static balance with open eyes - by 5. 08 % and with closed eyes - by 5. 63 %; Romberg’s test on left foot - by 11, 4 % and on tight - by 8. 22 %; response of choice - by 15. 9 %; high jump from the spot - by 11. 39 %; shuttle run - by 5. 8 %. Conclusions: {{in the process of}} perfection of taekwondo athletes coordination it is necessary to solve the following tasks: master more and more complex coordination structures of motor tasks; master quick re-switching of motor functioning, depending on change of situation; improve accuracy of required motor actions; develop stability of space orientation...|$|E
40|$|Both field {{relationships}} and geochemical characteristics indicate two suites of plagiogranitic and related rocks coexisting {{in the higher}} parts of the Karmoy ophiolite of western Norway. The plutonic zone of this ophiolite can be subdivided into three complexes; the East-Karmoy Igneous Complex, the Visnes High Level Complex and the Veavagen Igneous Complex and plagiogranitic rocks are well developed {{in the first two}} of these. Within the East-Karmoy Igneous Complex, plagiogranites are associated with high temperature, <b>pre-basic</b> dyke, shear zones. Rare earth element modelling indicates that these plagiogranites were derived by anatexis of amphibolite (hydrated diabase) assuming a starting material consisting of 40 % hornblende and 60 % plagioclase and that batch melting occurred within the stability field of hornblende. In comparison, plagiogranite occurs in a number of bodies in {{the upper part of the}} Visnes High Level Complex and forms a sandwich horizon together with biotite diorites and epidosites between a roof assemblage of dykes, microgabbros and magnetite gabbros, and a floor assemblage of layered and non-layered gabbros. The R. E. E. modelling of the petrogenesis of this series of plagiogranites indicates that they were derived by filter pressing of a differentiated interstitial liquid to the vari-textured gabbros, although the distribution of highly hygromagmatophile elements such as K, Rb, Ba, etc. cannot be explained satisfactorily by this model alone. Depletion in these elements appears to be an autometasomatic effect. © 1984 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
