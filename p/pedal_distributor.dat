50|$|Björn {{was asked}} by his BJFE <b>pedal</b> <b>distributor,</b> Harri Koski, to {{consider}} designing amplifiers. Björn was fairly busy building and designing pedals for the BJFE line, {{and did not have}} the time to also build amplifiers. It was suggested a new company be created where Björn could design the effects and amplifiers, but they would be constructed and distributed under the name Mad Professor Amplification. These are pedals and amplifiers designed by Björn but not hand built by him.|$|E
