40|$|AbstractVaccination with virus-like {{particles}} (VLP), comprising both L 1 and L 2 {{of human}} papillomavirus (HPV) genital types 6, 16, and 18, induces predominantly type-specific neutralizing antibodies. L 2 polypeptide vaccines protect animals against experimental challenge with homologous papillomavirus and cross-reactive epitopes {{are present in}} HPV L 2. To assess L 2 -specific cross-neutralization of HPV genotypes, sheep were immunized with purified, bacterially expressed HPV 6, 16, or 18 L 2. In addition to neutralizing the homologous HPV type in vitro, antisera to each HPV L 2 also cross-neutralized both heterologous HPV types. This suggests that unlike VLP-based prophylactic HPV vaccines, an L 2 <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> may provide broad-spectrum protection...|$|E
40|$|Complete Freud adjuvant, {{aluminum}} gel, and liposomes {{were compared}} {{for their ability}} to enhance the immunogenicity of an intact 22 -nm HBsAg particle vaccine and an HBsAg-derived <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> in guinea pigs. Both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated. The greatest immune response was obtained with complete Freund adjuvant, regardless of the antigen preparation. Aluminum gel appeared to be a better adjuvant for 22 -nm HBsAg particles, but the liposomes rendered polypeptide preparations more immunogenic. The possibility that various proportions were entrapped in aqueous compartments instead of being inserted into the lipid bilayers of liposomes might account for this difference. The development of both humoral and cellular immunity was dependent upon the use of an adjuvant, because aqueous preparations had poor immunogenicity...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{immunology}} {{research in}} Wuhan Union Hospital began in 1991. Anti-heart antibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy and acute viral myocarditis {{began to be}} reported from 1993. It was found that a new autoantibody against L-type calcium channel results in ventricular tachycardia and sudden death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Through the Intervention Study of Diltiazem in Dilated Cardiomyopathy, diltiazem was verified to reduce mortality and the chronic heart failure hospitalization rate significantly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The autoantibodies against angiotensin II receptor type 1 and α 1 -adrenoceptor {{were associated with the}} increased recurrence of and death from stroke in hypertensive patients. Through many clinical and experimental studies, the functional imbalance of T-cell subsets was suggested to mediate myocardial injury and chronic heart failure, which provided a new theoretical basis for immunoregulation therapy for heart failure. The first antihypertensive <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> (ATRQβ- 001) was invented. In addition to these achievements, there will be more research on cardiovascular immunology in Wuhan Union Hospital in the future...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{vaccines}} against {{viral hepatitis}} B has proceeded along four main lines. (1) Human plasma-derived vaccines are safe, effective {{and are now}} in general use. (2) Subunit <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> formulated in micelles have reached the stage of clinical trials. (3) Recombinant DNA vaccines have been produced in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, notably in yeast. The yeast-derived recombinant vaccines have proved safe and effective in extensive clinical trials, eliciting antibodies which in quantity and specificity are equal to those elicited by plasma-derived vaccine. DNA recombinant has also been applied {{to the development of}} hybrid and vaccinia virus vaccines which are capable of immunological ”priming”, and other hybrid virus vaccines are under development. (4) Finally, chemical synthesis has succeeded in producing small peptides which include specific epitopes eliciting antibody responses in experimental animals. Such chemically synthesized preparations offer a prospect of ultimately producing multivalent synthetic vaccines against several viruses, bacteria and protozoa...|$|R
40|$|Current L 1 virus-like {{particle}} (VLP) vaccines provide type-restricted protection against a small {{subset of the}} human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes associated with cervical cancer, necessitating continued cytologic screening of vaccinees. Cervical cancer is most problematic in countries that lack the resources for screening or highly multivalent HPV VLP vaccines, suggesting {{the need for a}} low-cost, broadly protective vaccinogen. Here, N-terminal L 2 polypeptides comprising residues 1 to 88 or 11 to 200 derived from HPV 16, bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV 1), or cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) were produced in bacteria. Rabbits were immunized with these N-terminal L 2 polypeptides and concurrently challenged with CRPV and rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV). Vaccination with either N-terminal L 2 polypeptides of CRPV effectively protected rabbits from CRPV challenge but not from papillomas induced by cutaneous challenge with CRPV genomic DNA. Furthermore, papillomas induced by CRPV genomic DNA deficient for L 2 expression grew {{at the same rate as}} those induced by wild-type CRPV genomic DNA, further suggesting that the L 2 <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> lack therapeutic activity. Neutralizing serum antibody titers of > 15 correlated with protection (P < 0. 001), a finding consistent with neutralizing antibody-mediated protection. Surprisingly, a remarkable degree of protection against heterologous papillomavirus types was observed after vaccination with N-terminal L 2 polypeptides. Notably, vaccination with HPV 16 L 2 11 - 200 protected against cutaneous and mucosal challenge with CRPV and ROPV, respectively, papillomaviruses that are evolutionarily divergent from HPV 16. Further, vaccination with HPV 16 L 2 11 - 200 generates broadly cross-neutralizing serum antibody, suggesting the potential of L 2 as a second-generation preventive HPV vaccine antigen...|$|R
40|$|This Memorandum {{considers}} {{the use of}} veterinary vaccines {{for the prevention of}} Rift Valley fever (RVF) and for its control during outbreaks. Veterinary vaccines are the first line of defence against RVF. Existing live and inactivated vaccines have been used extensively in Africa but further development of both is warranted. The live virus vaccine may cause abortion and its potential for reversion to virulence has not been adequately investigated. It should be used only in enzootic and epizootic areas. The inactivated vaccines are effective and safe, but they are more expensive and at least 2 doses must be given. They are currently produced only in Egypt and South Africa. Diagnosis of RVF is made by isolation of virus or demonstration of an elevated serum antibody titre. Reference laboratories are available to assist in the diagnosis. In the event of an outbreak of RVF, the appropriate international authorities should be notified and immunization of livestock should be carried out according to the guidelines described herein. Movement of animals should be controlled during epizootics. Guidelines for action for neighbouring countries are also given. The immunization policies recommended for sub-Saharan Africa differ from those for areas beyond the enzootic range, where use of killed vaccine only is recommended. The enzootic and epizootic areas in East Africa are characterized according to their ecology. The description serves as a predictive guide for other parts of Africa and can aid in setting immunization policy. Recommended WHO specifications are given for the inactivated RVF vaccine, including description of substrates, seed virus, potency, and safety testing. Future research needs include experiments on potency, thermal stability, adjuvants, immunity, virus markers, and genetic stability. Longer-term vaccine development envisages reassortant vaccines, gene cloning to produce recombinant DNA products, and synthetic <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{established}} that the purified polypeptides derived from the 22 -nm particles associated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) produce both humoral and cellular immunity against HBsAg in guinea pigs. Therefore, the two major polypeptides with molecular weights of 22, 000 and 25, 000 (P 22 and P 25, respectively) were isolated, adsorbed to an alum adjuvant, and used to immunize four nonimmune chimpanzees. A vigorous anti-HBs response was observed in all four animals after one inoculation of an alum-adsorbed <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> containing 40 micrograms of protein. After one to two booster inoculations, anti-HBs switched from being predominantly immunoglobulin M to the immunoglobin G class, indicating the establishment of immunological memory. Challenge of the vaccinated chimpanzees with 30, 000 chimpanzee infectious doses of hepatitis B virus provided evidence for the efficacy of this vaccine. None of the four animals developed serological markers associated with an active hepatitis B infection, and no biochemical or histopathological changes of hepatitis were observed. A nonvaccinated control chimpanzee that was inoculated with the same hepatitis B virus material developed hepatitis B infection, confirming infectivity of the challenge inoculum...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} (HIV) {{infection is}} a leading global health problem that causes approximately one million deaths each year. Although antiretroviral therapy can slow down the disease progression and {{improve the quality of}} life of infected individuals, it cannot eradicate the virus. A successful vaccine is one of the most cost-effective alternatives to control the incidence and mortality of HIV infection. CD 4 + T cells play a key role in orchestrating other forms of human immune responses, therefore, an HIV vaccine that includes a component capable of eliciting CD 4 + T cell responses is highly desirable. To this end, we have previously designed a <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine</b> comprised of multiple CD 4 + T cell epitopes. In the current study, we tested the immunogenicity of this vaccine in mouse models by using IFN-γELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining assays. We found that several epitopes in this vaccine elicited CD 4 + T cell immune responses in both congenic mice and human HLA-A 2 /DRB 1 transgenic mice. These new epitopes may be further tested for their ability to augment immune responses elicited by other forms of HIV vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Zhicheng Zhang, Fang Li, Tiansheng Sun, Dajiang Ren, Xiumei Liu PLA Institute of Orthopedics, Beijing Army General Hospital, Beijing, People&# 39;s Republic of China Background: Many {{previous}} {{studies have focused on}} the effects of IN- 1, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes Nogo (a neurite growth inhibitory protein), on neurologic regeneration in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, safety problems and the short half-life of the exogenous antibody are still problematic. In the present study, the NogoA polypeptide was used as an antigen to make a therapeutic NogoA vaccine. Rats were immunized with this vaccine and were able to secrete the polyclonal antibody before SCI. The antibody can block NogoA within the injured spinal cord when the antibody gains access to the spinal cord due to a compromised blood–spinal cord barrier. Olfactory ensheathing glial cell transplantation has been used in a spinal cord contusion model to promote the recovery of SCI. The present study was designed to verify the efficacy and safety of NogoA <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine,</b> the effects of immunotherapy with this vaccine, and the synergistic effects of the vaccine and olfactory ensheathing glial cells in repair of SCI. Methods: A 13 -polypeptide fragment of NogoA was synthesized. This fragment was then coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin to improve the immunogenicity of the <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Immunization via injection into the abdominal cavity was performed in rats before SCI. The serum antibody level and ability of the vaccine to bind with Nogo were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The safety of the vaccine was evaluated according to the incidence and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Olfactory ensheathing glia cells were obtained, purified, and subsequently implanted into a Wistar rat model of thoracic spinal cord contusion injury. The rats were divided into four groups, ie, an SCI model group, an olfactory ensheathing glia group, a vaccine group, and a combined treatment group. Animal behavior, histopathology, and axonal regeneration were compared between the four treatment groups. Results: The antibody against the polypeptide was detected in rat serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was not found in the immunized rats. Three months after injury, Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores and nerve fiber counts in biotinylated dextran amine nerve tracing studies were significantly better in the combined treatment group than in the other groups. Conclusion: The polypeptide NogoA vaccine can stimulate the humoral immune system to produce antibodies against the NogoA polypeptide. The binding reaction between the antibody and antigen was shown in ex vivo experiments. No evidence was found to suggest a relationship between NogoA vaccination and increased risk of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The combined strategy of olfactory ensheathing glial cell implantation and NogoA vaccination may promote regeneration of axons and functional recovery in the spinal cord contusion injury model. This study may provide a new strategy for combining modalities to enhance axonal regeneration and a better balance of the CNS microenvironment after SCI.

40|$|ABSTRACT − Over the years, {{nanoparticle}} {{drug delivery}} systems have demonstrated versatile potentials in biological, medical and pharmaceutical applications. In {{the pharmaceutical industry}} nanotechnology research has mainly focused on providing controlled drug release, targeting their delivery to specific organs, and developing parenteral formulations for poorly water soluble drugs to improve their bioavailability. Achievement in polymer industry has generated numerous poly-mers applicable to designing nanoparticles. From viewpoints of product development, a nanocarrier material should meet requirements for biodegradability, biocompatibility, availability, and regulatory approval crieteria. Albumin is indeed a mate-rial that fulfills such requirements. Also, the commercialization of a first albumin-bound paclitaxel nanoparticle product (AbraxaneTM) has sparked renewed interests {{in the application of}} albumin in the development of nanoparticle formulations. This paper reviews the intrinsic properties of albumin, its suitability as a nanocarrier material, and albumin-based parenteral formulation approaches. Particularly discussed in detail are albumin-based particulate injectables such as AbraxaneTM. Infor-mation on key roles of albumin in the nab ™ technology and representative manufacturing processes of albumin particulate products are provided. It is likely that albumin-based particulate technology would extend its applications in delivering drugs, <b>polypeptides,</b> proteins, <b>vaccines,</b> nucleic acids, and genes.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the antimetastatic effect of multiple antigenic <b>polypeptide</b> (MAP) <b>vaccine</b> based on B-cell epitopes of heparanase (HPSE) on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo. Methods: The antiserum against B-cell epitopes of HPSE was isolated, purified and characterized after immunizing white-hair-black-eye (WHBY) rabbit with freshly synthesized MAP vaccine. Tumor-bearing murine models of orthotopic implants using HCC- 97 H cell line were built in BALB/c nude mice. Anti-MAP polyclonal antibodies induced by MAP vaccine were administrated to the models. The impact on metastasis was assessed, the expressions of VEGF/bFGF in hepatoma tissues and in murine sera were evaluated, and the micro-vessel density (MVD) was counted as well. In addition, the possible impairments of the HPSE MAP vaccine on certain HPSE positive normal organs and blood cells were investigated. Results: The antiserum was harvested, purified and identified. The antibodies induced by MAP vaccine could specifically react with the dominant epitopes of both precursor protein and large subunit monomer of HPSE, markedly decrease HPSE activity, suppress the expressions of both VEGF and bFGF, and reduce the MVD. Pulmonary metastasis was also attenuated significantly by the anti-MAP polyclonal antibodies. In addition, no obvious impairment could be observed in certain HPSE positive organs and cells. Conclusion: MAP vaccine based on B-cell epitopes of HPSE is capable of alleviating HCC metastasis in vivo, mainly throug...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{treatment}} of arthritis has undergone a dramatic change since biological agents targeting specific mediators of the disease process have been introduced. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists {{have been shown to}} reduce signs and symptoms of disease and to retard the development of tissue damage in the majority of patients. This thesis focuses on clinical, immunological and biochemical aspects of treatment with TNF antagonists in patients with arthritis. In particular, the studies examine: (i) the feasibility of a structured protocol with central data handling for the prospective monitoring treatment efficacy and tolerability of new treatments in clinical practice, (ii) whether serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) change during treatment with TNF antagonists in a way that corroborates a tissue protective effects of these agents in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), (iii) how different anti-rheumatic treatments modulate the immune response induced by polysaccharide or <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccines</b> in patients with RA and (iv) potential predictors of infusion reactions during treatment with infliximab. All the patients who participated in the studies were monitored according to a standardised clinical protocol of the South Swedish Arthritis Treatment Group (SSATG) developed at the Department of Rheumatology in Lund. We found that such a protocol could be used for monitoring newly introduced anti-rheumatic treatments both at a university department and at other rheumatology units. The performance of TNF antagonists regarding efficacy and safety complied with results of previously published clinical trials. Serum levels of COMP were measured in RA patients treated with infliximab and etanercept during the initial 6 months of treatment. Serum COMP levels decreased in patients with and without a clinical response, suggesting a damage retarding effect of TNF antagonist treatment. Altogether, 149 patients with RA participated in studies of the immune response to pneumococcal or influenza vaccination. Patients treated with TNF antagonists and controls showed similar responses to pneumococcal vaccine, whereas methotrexate treated patients showed reduced response to this vaccine regardless of concomitant treatment with TNF antagonists. In contrast, RA patients treated with methotrexate without TNF antagonists had significantly better immune response to influenza vaccination than those receiving TNF antagonists alone or in combination with methotrexate and/or other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. Possible predictors of infliximab related infusion reactions were studied in a cohort of 213 patients with RA and 76 patients with spondylarthropaties. Infliximab without methotrexate and positive baseline ANA (antinuclear antibodies) were independent risk factors for developing infusion reactions in RA but not in spondylarthropaties. In conclusion, a structured protocol with central data handling is feasible in clinical practice for documenting the efficacy of and adverse events associated with drugs used for the {{treatment of}} arthritis. Serum COMP {{has the potential to be}} a useful marker for evaluating tissue effects of novel treatment modalities in RA. Methotrexate treatment in RA reduces antibody response to pneumococcal vaccine, suggesting that RA patients should be vaccinated before the initiation of his treatment. The immune response to influenza vaccination is sufficiently good to warrant vaccination of all RA patients, regardless of treatment. Positive ANA at initiation of infliximab treatment and the use of infliximab as monotherapy is associated with increased risk of infusion reactions in RA...|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} a public health concern as it {{represents}} the second {{cause of cancer death}} in women worldwide. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the etiologic agents, and HPV E 6 and/or E 7 oncogene-specific therapeutic vaccines are under development to treat HPV-related lesions in women. Whether the use of mucosal routes of immunization may be preferable for inducing cell-mediated immune responses able to eradicate genital tumors is still debated because of the uniqueness of the female genital mucosa (GM) and the limited experimentation. Here, we compared the protective activity resulting from immunization of mice via intranasal (i. n.), intravaginal (IVAG) or subcutaneous (s. c.) routes with an adjuvanted HPV type 16 E 7 <b>polypeptide</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Our data show that s. c. and i. n. immunizations elicited similar frequencies and avidity of TetE 71 CD 81 and E 7 -specific Interferon-gamma-secreting cells in the GM, whereas slightly lower immune responses were induced by IVAG immunization. In a novel orthotopic murine model, both s. c. and i. n. immunizations allowed for complete long-term protection against genital E 7 -expressing tumor challenge. However, only s. c. immunization induced complete regression of already established genital tumors. This suggests that the higher E 7 -specific systemic response observed after s. c. immunization may contribute to the regression of growing genital tumors, whereas local immune responses may be sufficient to impede genital challenges. Thus, our data show that for an efficiently adjuvanted protein-based vaccine, parenteral vaccination route is superior to mucosal vaccination route for inducing regression of established genital tumors in a murine model of HPV-associated genital cancer...|$|E
40|$|The circumsporozoite (CS) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} surface protein of the Plasmodium sporozoite, and is also present early in the liver stage of the infection. Following successful protective experiments in mice and monkeys, the synthetic 102 -mer malaria <b>vaccine</b> <b>polypeptide</b> representing the C-terminal region of the CS of Plasmodium falciparum was tested in a clinical trial with healthy human volunteers. This vaccine induced strong CD 8 (+), CD 4 (+) T lymphocyte and antibody responses specific for the immunizing peptide. CD 8 (+) T lymphocyte responses elicited in HLA-A* 0201 volunteers recognized two well-defined cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes within the CS. Here, we show that both monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells (LCL) can present a cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope contained within the 102 -mer synthetic peptide. Paraformaldehyde and low temperature inhibited presentation, indicating that cellular processing was required. Using specific inhibitors, we show that, in both cell types, processing requires the proteasome and the MHC class I pathway, while the endosomal compartment appears to be critical only for the presentation by Mo-DC. Antigen uptake is associated with actin polymerization in both cell types. These in vitro results demonstrate the likely pathway of antigen presentation achieved via vaccination with this synthetic peptide...|$|R

Whole-cell, killed, and live-attenuated oral cholera vaccines are in use. We and others have focused on the development of a subunit cholera vaccine that features standardized epitopes from various V. cholerae macromolecules that are known to induce protective antibody responses. TcpA protein is assembled into toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), a type IVb pilus required for V. cholerae colonization, and thus is a strong candidate for a cholera subunit <b>vaccine.</b> <b>Polypeptides</b> (24 to 26 amino acids) in TcpA that can induce protective antibody responses have been reported, but further characterization of their amino acid targets relative to tertiary or quaternary TCP structures has not been done. We report a refinement of the TcpA sequences that can induce protective antibody. One sequence, TcpA 15 (residues 170 to 183), induces antibodies that bind linear TcpA in a Western blot as well as weakly bind soluble TcpA in solution. These antibodies bind assembled pili at high density and provide 80 to 100 % protection in the infant mouse protection assay. This is in sharp contrast to other anti-TcpA peptide sera (TcpA 11, TcpA 13, and TcpA 17) that bind very strongly in Western blot and solution assays yet do not provide protection or effectively bind TCP, as evidenced by immunoelectron microscopy. The sequences of TcpA 15 that induce protective antibody were localized on a model of assembled TCP. These sequences are centered on a site that is predicted to be important for TCP structure...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study, we {{demonstrated}} the immunogenic properties {{of a new}} malaria <b>vaccine</b> <b>polypeptide</b> based on a 19 kDa C-terminal fragment of the merozoite surface protein- 1 (MSP 1 (19)) from Plasmodium vivax and an innate immunity agonist, the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin (FliC). Herein, we tested whether the same strategy, based on the MSP 1 (19) component of the deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, could also generate a fusion polypeptide with enhanced immunogenicity. The His(6) FliC-MSP 1 (19) fusion protein was expressed from a recombinant Escherichia coil and showed preserved in vitro TLR 5 -binding activity. In contrast to animals injected with His(6) MSP 1 (19), mice subcutaneously immunised with the recombinant His 6 FliC-MSP 1 (19) developed strong MSP 1 (19) -specific systemic antibody responses with a prevailing IgG 1 subclass. Incorporation of other adjuvants, such as CpG ODN 1826, complete and incomplete Freund`s adjuvants or Quil-A, improved the IgG responses after the second, but not the third, immunising dose. It also resulted in a more balanced IgG subclass response, as evaluated by the IgG 1 /IgG 2 c ratio, and higher cell-mediated immune response, {{as determined by the}} detection of antigen-specific interferon-gamma secretion by immune spleen cells. MSP(19) -specific antibodies recognised not only the recombinant protein, but also the native protein expressed on the surface of P. falciparum parasites. Finally, sera from rabbits immunised with the fusion protein alone inhibited the in vitro growth of three different P. falciparum strains. In summary, these results extend our previous observations and further demonstrate that fusion of the innate immunity agonist FliC to Plasmodium antigens is a promising alternative to improve their immunogenicity.
