With a complex business structure to unravel, some commentators expect it may take years for the company's collapse to be fully resolved. By April 2010, timber company Gunns had taken over as the responsible entity running most of Great Southern's <b>pulpwood</b> schemes, but the land on which they were being grown was yet to be sold.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, <b>pulpwood</b> processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E
25|$|About 25% of {{produced}} {{oxalic acid}} {{is used as}} a mordant in dyeing processes. It is used in bleaches, especially for <b>pulpwood.</b> It is also used in baking powder and as a third reagent in silica analysis instruments.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{conservation}} efforts, {{most of the}} forests along the North Shore are now protected from deforestation, essentially ending the lumber industry. Duluth had only one remaining lumber mill by 1925, but it still receives shipments of <b>pulpwood</b> which are used in its paper mills.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} that {{is currently}} found in the hilltop {{is the result of}} intense human activity for over 2000 years, and the human farming and forestry practices. In the modern period, eucalypts have been planted in <b>pulpwood</b> plantations, which PÃ³voa de Varzim City Hall has been trying to eradicate and attempting to replace it with native flora that research proved to have existed in the area. Carbon analysis found in archaeological layers of Cividade de Terroso allowed the identification of twenty native species of trees and shrubs.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>pulpwood</b> {{and timber}} has been {{harvested}} {{from the community}} especially since the Mersey Pulp Mill was built in 1929 in Liverpool, Nova Scotia (Bowater, 2007). Red Spruce, Black Spruce and Balsam Fir {{are the most common}} species harvested after it matures in approximately 30 to 40 years. In most cases, the shallow layers of topsoil and grey clay layers beneath the forest do not support a tree's long term growth or promote good drainage in the local area. The community is rich in shale which when blasted and crushed provides various grades of road and building materials.|$|E
25|$|Eucalyptus was {{introduced}} from Australia {{to the rest}} of the world following the Cook expedition in 1770. Collected by Sir Joseph Banks, botanist on the expedition, it was subsequently introduced to many parts of the world, notably California, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, Morocco, Portugal, South Africa, Uganda, Palestine, Galicia and Chile. On the order of 250 species are under cultivation in California. In Portugal and also Spain, eucalypts have been planted in plantations for the production of <b>pulpwood.</b> Eucalyptus are the basis for several industries, such as sawmilling, pulp, charcoal and others. Several species have become invasive and are causing major problems for local ecosystems, mainly due to the absence of wildlife corridors and rotations management.|$|E
25|$|The Sundarbans {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economy of the southwestern region of Bangladesh as well as in the national economy. It is the single largest source of forest produce in the country. The forest provides raw materials for wood-based industries. In addition to traditional forest produce like timber, fuelwood, <b>pulpwood</b> etc., large-scale harvest of non-wood forest products such as thatching materials, honey, beeswax, fish, crustacean and mollusc resources of the forest takes place regularly. The vegetated tidal lands of the Sundarbans function as an essential habitat, produces nutrients and purifies water. The forest also traps nutrient and sediment, acts as a storm barrier, shore stabiliser and energy storage unit. Last but not the least, the Sunderbans provides an aesthetic attraction for local and foreign tourists.|$|E
25|$|Eucalypts {{have many}} uses which {{have made them}} {{economically}} important trees, and have become a cash crop in poor areas such as Timbuktu, Africa and the Peruvian Andes, despite concerns that the trees are invasive in some countries like South Africa. Best-known are perhaps the varieties karri and yellow box. Due to their fast growth, the foremost benefit of these trees is their wood. They can be chopped off at the root and grow back again. They provide many desirable characteristics for use as ornament, timber, firewood and <b>pulpwood.</b> It is also used {{in a number of}} industries, from fence posts and charcoal to cellulose extraction for biofuels. Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks and to reduce erosion.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that of itself Florida Maple is not {{employed}} as a commercial timber species, it is used with associated commercial species when the products are <b>pulpwood,</b> sawtimber, or wood veneer stock. It is considered a hard maple and as high quality individuals are suitable for producing furniture, flooring, paneling, and shoe lasts. However, its relative scarcity, small size, and fairly poor shape generally confine its use to only factory and box lumber, and even this is only an occasional occurrence. It has, however, been experiencing growing popularity as an ornamental or shade tree, especially in the southern United States due to its high heat resistance. It is also a source of maple syrup, though again its size and rarity limit its use in this regard, {{especially in light of}} the Sugar Maple's established popularity within the business.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{traffic was}} sawn timber and firewood, with many sawmills located {{adjacent}} to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and Beech Forest, and a third train each way to Gellibrand. The Crowes branch saw a single mixed train daily. The arrival of the Great Depression and competition from motor vehicles saw traffic decline {{to a point where}} only one train each way operated over the line three days a week. Increased wartime loadings saw traffic increase to two trains each way daily, however this improvement was only temporary. By the time the railway closed, the timetable listed only one train each way a week, and most of the traffic was <b>pulpwood.</b>|$|E
500|$|At various points, {{the road}} {{commissions}} in Dickinson, Menominee and Delta counties {{tried to give}} the roadway back to the state for maintenance. Menominee County made the request in 1974 and 1982, both times rejected because the road did not carry enough traffic to be a state highway. The road was a maintenance issue for the counties because of its relative isolation and high truck traffic carrying <b>pulpwood</b> to the paper mill in Escanaba and potatoes from farms near Felch. The roadway was in a relative state of disrepair in 1982, and the counties wanted the state to fix it. Menominee County estimated that it would cost $500,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for their [...] stretch, while Dickinson estimated that it would cost $1million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for their [...]|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} (sf) had been {{published}} before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. [...] After 1931, when Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories was launched, no new science fiction magazines appeared for several years. [...] In 1934 a science fiction comic strip following the adventures of superhero Flash Gordon appeared in newspapers and quickly became popular. [...] In 1936 the strip spawned a movie serial in thirteen parts, also titled Flash Gordon. Late that year Harold Hersey, an experienced pulp magazine editor and publisher, decided to launch three new magazines based on comics. [...] The first two were titled Dan Dunn Detective Magazine and Tailspin Tommy Air Adventure Magazine; these were launched in September and October 1936 respectively. [...] The third was Flash Gordon Strange Adventures Magazine, which saw a single issue, dated December 1936; it was copyrighted by both Hersey and King Features, the syndicate that owned the copyright to Flash Gordon. [...] Dan Dunn and Tailspin Tommy produced one more issue each before Hersey closed down the venture. [...] It is not known why only one issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine appeared; poor sales figures from the other magazines may have been responsible, or Hersey may simply {{have run out of}} money, or possibly King Features, the owner of the copyright to Flash Gordon, only granted rights to Hersey for one issue, and withdrew from the venture after the first issue appeared. [...] Sf historian Everett Bleiler notes that Hersey did not mention the venture in his autobiographical <b>Pulpwood</b> Editor, published a year later, and adds that [...] "given Hersey's usual attempts to glorify himself and to gild his failures, this silence suggests a fiasco larger than usual".|$|E

2500|$|Eucalyptus is {{the most}} common short fibre source for <b>pulpwood</b> to make pulp. Eucalyptus globulus (in {{temperate}} climates) and the hybrid of Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis (in tropical climates) are the most used varieties in papermaking. [...] The fibre length of Eucalyptus is relatively short and uniform with low coarseness compared with other hardwoods commonly used as <b>pulpwood.</b> The fibres are slender, yet relatively thick walled. This gives uniform paper formation and high opacity that are important for all types of fine papers. The low coarseness is important for high quality coated papers. [...] Eucalyptus is suitable for many tissue papers as the short and slender fibres gives a high number of fibres per gram and low coarseness contributes to softness.|$|E
2500|$|After the storm, Governor Carroll Campbell {{said that}} the storm {{destroyed}} enough timber in South Carolina to [...] "frame a home for every family {{in the state of}} West Virginia". An immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for <b>pulpwood</b> before they deteriorated {{to the point where they}} could not be used. Still standing timber that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies, so they were also downgraded into <b>pulpwood,</b> leading to such a drop in <b>pulpwood</b> prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased. In South Carolina, which bore the brunt of the storm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was slow in responding. United States Senator from South Carolina Fritz Hollings referred to the agency as [...] "a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses" [...] during a speech on the floor of the United States Senate. An investigation was launched, which led to some reforms in FEMA procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during Hurricane Andrew, the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the United States. However, FEMA was criticized severely in 2005 for its similarly insufficient response to Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, numbers NG49, NG50 and NG58 to NG60, were used almost {{exclusively}} on the narrow gauge lines in Natal. Some of these routes had curves of [...] radius and gradients of up to 3 in 100 (3%), but the Garratts were well suited to hauling the diverse freight traffic of <b>pulpwood,</b> sugar cane and bananas.|$|E
2500|$|The wood of Nyssa sylvatica is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and {{difficult}} to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making mauls, pulleys, wheel hubs, agricultural rollers, bowls, and paving blocks. [...] The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, <b>pulpwood,</b> and firewood. Since the wood is very tough, resistant to wear, {{it has been used}} for shuttles in weaving.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Avontuur line {{stretches}} from Port Elizabeth to Avontuur through the Langkloof. The narrow gauge track enabled the trains {{to pick up}} fruit virtually directly from the Langkloof fruit farms and ship it directly, without reloading, to the ripening warehouses, distributors and ships at Port Elizabeth. The route {{became known as the}} Apple Express after the main crop it transported. The line also carried <b>pulpwood</b> as well as limestone to supply the cement factories which were located on the route.|$|E
2500|$|When {{grown for}} sawing timber, pine {{plantations}} can be harvested after 30 years, with some stands {{being allowed to}} grow up to 50 (as the wood value increases more quickly as the trees age). Imperfect trees (such as those with bent trunks or forks, smaller trees, or diseased trees) are removed in a [...] "thinning" [...] operation every five to ten years. Thinning allows the best trees to grow much faster, because it prevents weaker trees from competing for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Young trees removed during thinning are used for <b>pulpwood,</b> while most older ones are good enough for saw timber.|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{the plans}} {{had called for}} a single paper machine with an annual {{production}} capacity of [...] In the midst of construction the issue of building a second machine was raised. There was an overproduction of chemical pulp and this could be bought cheaply and easily. An additional [...] of <b>pulpwood</b> would be needed; this could be secured from JÃ¤mtland. There was a certain political opposition, especially in the Conservative Party, with concerns that {{it would lead to}} an overdemand for lumber. The second machine, PM2, received political approval, and was approved by the annual meeting on 10 April 1964. The extra NOK75 in funding was secured through issuing additional shares, bringing the share equity to NOK64 million. The rest was borrowed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928 Oxford Paper Company began {{shipping}} <b>pulpwood</b> from Barnjum {{to their}} mill in Rumford Falls. The receivers operated extra winter trains to Barnjum, and {{were encouraged to}} resume full year service over the former P commencing 20 May 1929. The last steam train left Rangeley in May 1931 and railcar service over the former P north of Phillips ended {{in the autumn of}} 1931. [...] Following a precedent set three years earlier on the Kennebec Central Railroad, Maxey suspended all train and railcar service when the last mills shipping their products via the SR transferred their business to highway trucking firms. Two SR highway trucks began carrying express shipments on 8 July 1932, and no trains operated over any part of the railroad through the following winter.|$|E
2500|$|This {{resulted}} in Nordenfjelske entering negotiations with Ranheim in 1969 about mering the two companies. A primary concern was to concentrate the purchasing of lumber in Central Norway. This caused Nordenfjelske to also start negotiating an acquisition with Van Severen, the largest sawmill in the region, situated in Namsos. Although {{there was a}} slight opposition from the authorities, 97 percent of Van Severen was bought in late 1970, followed by a take-over of Ranheim on 1 July 1971. A Swedish subsidiary was established on 1 May 1970 with responsibility for procuring <b>pulpwood</b> from Sweden. Within a few years imports reached [...] The acquisitions {{resulted in}} Nordenfjelske becoming a concern, where the factor at Fiborgtangen merely was the largest mill. The group took the name Norske Skogindustrier ("Norwegian Forest Industries") and started trading as Norske Skog on 28 April 1972. The mill at Fiborgtangen was oftentimes referred to as Nordenfjelske.|$|E
2500|$|In post-glacial times Northeastern Minnesota {{was covered}} by forest broken only by these {{interconnected}} lakes and wetlands. [...] Much of the area has been little changed by human activity, as there are substantial forest and wilderness preserves, most notably the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and Voyageurs National Park. [...] In {{the remainder of the}} region, lakes provide recreation, forests are managed for <b>pulpwood,</b> and the underlying bedrock is mined for valuable ores deposited in Precambrian times. [...] While copper and nickel ores have been mined, the principal metallic mineral is iron. [...] Three of Minnesota's four iron ranges are in the region, including the Mesabi Range, which has supplied over 90% of the state's historic output, including most of the natural ores pure enough to be fed directly into furnaces.

2500|$|In the {{carpentry}} industry, {{the timber}} {{is referred to}} as satin walnut [...] {{and is one of the}} most important materials for plywood manufacturers. It is used for furniture, interior trim, railroad ties, cigar boxes, crates, flooring, barrels, woodenware, and wood pulp. It is also used for veneer for plywood. The wood is very compact and fine-grained, the heartwood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, veneer, plywood, slack cooperage, fuel, and <b>pulpwood.</b> The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, cabinets for radios, televisions, and phonographs, interior trim, and millwork. The veneer and plywood, (typically backed with some other kind of wood which shrinks and warps less) are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork. [...] It was formerly used in the interior finish of railroad sleeping cars. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes substituted for ebony for such uses as inexpensive picture frames.|$|E

2500|$|Wayagamack was {{successful}} until the Great Depression when the paper market collapsed. The island property {{was taken over}} by Consolidated Paper Corporation Limited in 1931, but they showed little interest in it and put it up for sale. Offers came from Canadian, American, British, French and Belgian parties. In July 1937, an offer was received from a consortium of Dutch and German capitalists who intended to build a sulphite mill and wanted a steady supply of <b>pulpwood</b> and access to Canadian capital. In the autumn of that year, a team of German surveyors travelled to the island to examine its timber and export potential. When this story broke in the Montreal Gazette of 2 December 1937, it caused an immediate controversy since the story claimed that the survey team was really made up of Adolf Hitler's agents and that most were naval, military and fortifications experts. Despite the substantial offer, the promise of thousands of new jobs, and {{the fact that there were}} no legal methods to block the sale, the suspicions remained. A committee was set up to investigate the affair but concluded that [...] "there was no evidence to indicate that the project has other than a commercial purpose".
