25|$|Knife-edge {{diffraction}} is the <b>propagation</b> <b>mode</b> where {{radio waves}} are bent around sharp edges. For example, this mode {{is used to}} send radio signals over a mountain range when a line-of-sight path is not available. However, the angle cannot be too sharp or the signal will not diffract. The diffraction mode requires increased signal strength, so higher power or better antennas will be needed than for an equivalent line-of-sight path.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{scattering}} {{is purely}} a microwave <b>propagation</b> <b>mode</b> and is best observed around 10GHz, but extends {{down to a}} few gigahertz—the limit being {{the size of the}} scattering particle size vs. wavelength. This mode scatters signals mostly forwards and backwards when using horizontal polarization and side-scattering with vertical polarization. Forward-scattering typically yields propagation ranges of 800km. Scattering from snowflakes and ice pellets also occurs, but scattering from ice without watery surface is less effective. The most common application for this phenomenon is microwave rain radar, but rain scatter propagation can be a nuisance causing unwanted signals to intermittently propagate where they are not anticipated or desired. Similar reflections may also occur from insects though at lower altitudes and shorter range. Rain also causes attenuation of point-to-point and satellite microwave links. Attenuation values up to 30dB have been observed on 30GHz during heavy tropical rain.|$|E

Sporadic-E at mid-latitudes occurs mostly during summer season, from May to August in the northern hemisphere and from November to February in the southern hemisphere. There is no single cause for this mysterious <b>propagation</b> <b>mode.</b> The reflection takes place in a thin sheet of ionisation around 90km height. The ionisation patches drift westwards at speeds of few hundred km per hour. There is a weak periodicity noted during the season and typically Es is observed on 1 to 3 successive days and remains absent for a few days to reoccur again. Es do not occur during small hours; the events usually begin at dawn, and there is a peak in the afternoon and a second peak in the evening. Es propagation is usually gone by local midnight.|$|E

40|$|When drought {{occurs in}} plants, {{acoustic}} emission (AE) signals can be detected, {{but the actual}} causes of these signals are still unknown. By analyzing the waveforms of the measured signals, it should, however, be possible to trace {{the characteristics of the}} AE source and get information about the underlying physiological processes. A problem encountered during this analysis is that the waveform changes significantly from source to sensor and lack of knowledge on wave propagation impedes research progress made in this field. We used finite element modeling and the well-known pencil lead break source to investigate wave propagation in a branch. A cylindrical rod of polyvinyl chloride was first used to identify the theoretical <b>propagation</b> <b>modes.</b> Two wave <b>propagation</b> <b>modes</b> could be distinguished and we used the finite element model to interpret their behavior in terms of source position for both the PVC rod and a wooden rod.
