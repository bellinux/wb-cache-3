50|$|The Gun Tunnel is an {{intermediate}} altitude hypersonic wind tunnel {{that can be}} configured to produce hypersonic flows at roughly 30 to 40 km altitude. This uses a piston for isentropic compression. The hypersonic facility at IISC Bangalore, India has a high enthalpy gun tunnel, which can produce Schlieren imaging and produce up to 8 mega joules of energy. Using a piston can be very tricky due to reflecting of shocks. At the facility, they use alluminium diaphragm to produce shocks and <b>paper</b> <b>diaphragm</b> to avoid shocks and pass through the hypersonic chamber. The pressure used is significantly higher like 30 times the atmosphere.|$|E

In this <b>paper,</b> the <b>diaphragm’s</b> Mechanical {{property}} of Hot-film {{air flow sensor}} is studied {{on the base of}} proposition of double-sided convection heat air flow sensor. This diaphragm consists of barrier layer, support layer and passivation layer. For Hot-film air flow sensor, the Diaphragm’s Mechanical property is mainly up to the support layer, and the support layer is composed of Si 3 N 4. In this research, four types of air flow sensors with different thickness of the support layer is prepared and tested at different air flow velocity. On the same time, the stress analysis of the sensor diaphragm is simulated at the flow rate of 5 m/s by the finite element software. A conclusion can be drawn that the thickness of support layer can not be less than 1000 nm, when the air flow velocity is more than 5 m/s...|$|R
40|$|A wooden roof {{strengthening}} technique {{aimed at}} transforming the roof pitches into anti-seismic shear resisting diaphragms {{is presented in}} this <b>paper.</b> Shear <b>diaphragms</b> gather and transfer the seismic loads to the shear resisting walls. Diaphragms are built {{on top of the}} existing structures without significantly modifying the roof overall layout. The proposed strengthening technique is mainly reversible, minimally impairing the building integrity, and can be easily applied for the construction of anti-seismic wooden roofs in new buildings. A simplified design approach is presented, which allows to identify the static role of each element. An analytical method for the estimate of the box structure displacements, as well as a short digression on the displacement control requirements is also illustrated. The diaphragm technique was recently applied for the anti-seismic retrofit of some monumental buildings in Italy. A few case studies, as well as the basic design criteria for applying this technique are presented in this paper...|$|R

The actuation method of the diaphragm relies on the electrostatic coupling between the diaphragm and the output Inter Digital Transducer (IDT) of the SAW device. In this paper, the theory governing the SAW device based novel actuation mechanism, is elaborated using the parallel plate approximation in electrostatic actuation. To validate the theoretical model, a Finite Element Model (FEM) is developed using ANSYS simulation tools and presented. Different design methods are considered to enhance the deflection of the diaphragm for a low input voltage. As such, inclusion of corrugations around a flat square-shaped diaphragm and selection of different bio-compatible materials for various sections of the diaphragm are analysed at the simulation level.

Design of fiber optic based differential pressure sensor (FODPS) using intensity modulation technique is reported in this <b>paper.</b> A corrugated <b>diaphragm</b> based differential pressure sensor with a fiber optic probe to record this deformation/displacement of the diaphragm is designed, optimized and fabricated. In FODPS, diaphragm act as a reflector. A flexible disc of plastic is used as a diaphragm to convert the measuring pressure to the deflection of diaphragm. Concentric corrugations are designed to linearise the deflections according to pressure. Reference and measuring pressures are applied to control and experimental headspaces respectively. As the pressure changes in the experimental head space, the diaphragm is deform and displaces, and distance between fiber tip and plane of diaphragm changes and thus resultant reading is proportional to the differential pressure.

5000|$|Experimentations began {{immediately}} and the firm’s reputation was aided by its owners contribution to his chosen field. Starting in 1897, Upendrakishore wrote {{a number of}} articles in the best-known British printing journal of the time, Penrose Annual, based on his researches. Their titles, though technical, are self-explanatory: ‘Focussing the Screen’ (1897), ‘The Theory of the Half-Tone Dot’ (1898),‘The Half-Tone Theory Graphically Explained’ (1899), ‘Automatic Adjustment of the Half-Tone Screen’ (1901), ‘Diffraction in Half-Tone’ (1902-3), ‘More About the Half-Tone Theory’ (1903-4), ‘The 60° Cross-Line Screen’ (1905-6), ‘Multiple Stops’ (1911-12). Upendrakishore’s <b>papers</b> about the <b>diaphragm</b> systems, his invention of the sixty-degree screen, his original methods of colour reproduction, his studies in diffraction and his contributions towards standardising half-tone camera work were all intimately connected with {{the progress of the}} photographic method of reproducing illustrations. While Siddhartha Ghosh [...] in his essay on Sukumar Ray’s Abol Tabol tells us that Upendrakishore patented a gadget known as the ‘automatic screen adjustment indicator’ which was sold as an optional accessory to the Penrose company’s process camera, Andrew Robinson quotes a Penrose Annual issue in which its London editor explains a lack of articles by Mr. U. Ray as an outcome of ill health and further informs the printing trade that U. Ray had anticipated by some years the important screen just patented by someone in Britain’ and that ‘unable to prove his theory in Calcutta for lack of resources, Upendrakisore had appealed to his colleagues in Britain for help and one of them had plagiarised his ideas.|$|R
