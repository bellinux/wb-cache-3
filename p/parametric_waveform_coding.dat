40|$|Abstract – Voice {{production}} models {{are used for}} speech compression thus reducing the encoding data rates and storage space for speech signaling processing. The legacy voice production model consists of a vocal source model and a vocal tract model. This paper presents a simpler voice production model adapted to <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> of speech: the Mathieu Waveform Coder (MWC) model. The MWC model yields weighted basis functions to <b>waveform</b> <b>code</b> the speech signal. Each Mathieu basis function represents an infinite series of sinusoids rather than a single sinusoidal spectral line. The research motivation is to determine if <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> speech using an elliptical membrane model (i. e., the Mathieu basis functions) is more efficient than coding speech using a circular membrane model (i. e., the sine basis functions).

Moreover we develop a new iterative motion compensation method which can also control a bit-rate flexibly and can successively improve quality of reconstructed images, and combine it with the above matching pursuits seamlessly and adaptively. In other words, motion compensation and matching pursuits are carried out alternatively and repeatedly to attain higher coding performance within a limited coding rate.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of audio signals into perceptually meaningful modulation components is highly desirable {{for the development}} of new audio effects {{on the one hand and}} as a building block for future efficient audio compression algorithms on the other hand. In the past, there has always been a distinction between <b>parametric</b> <b>coding</b> methods and <b>waveform</b> coding: While <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> methods scale easily up to transparency (provided the necessary bit rate is available), parametric coding schemes are subjected to the limitations of the underlying source models. Otherwise, parametric methods usually offer a wealth of manipulation possibilities which can be exploited for application of audio effects, while <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> is strictly limited to the best as possible reproduction of the original signal.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{traditional}} <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> and 3 -D model-based coding are not competing alternatives {{but should be}} combined to support and complement each other. Both approaches are combined such that the generality of <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> and the efficiency of 3 -D model-based coding are available where needed. The combination is achieved by providing the block-based video coder with a second reference frame for prediction which is synthesized by the model-based coder. Since the coding gain {{of this approach is}} directly related to the quality of the synthetic frame, we have extended the model-aided coder to cope with illumination changes and multiple objects. Remaining model failures and objects that are not known at the decoder are handled by standard block-based motion-compensated prediction.

40|$|AbstractSpeech coding {{has been}} {{major issue in}} the area of digital speech processing. Speech coding is the process of {{transforming}} the speech signal in a more compressed form, which can then be transmitted with few numbers of binary digits. It is not possible to access unlimited bandwidth of a channel each time we send a signal across it which leads to code and compress speech signals. Speech compression is applied in long distance communication, high-class speech storage, and message encryption. Speech coding is a lossy type of coding and hence the output signal does not exactly sound like the input.

30|$|Speech coding is {{a process}} to {{transform}} a digitized speech signal into a bit-efficient representation that keeps reasonable speech quality so as to facilitate speech transmission over a band-limited channel or speech storage in a memory-limited media. In general, speech coding techniques can be classified into three categories, including <b>waveform</b> <b>coding,</b> <b>parametric</b> coding, and hybrid <b>coding.</b> The <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> technique attempts to maintain the waveform shape of the original speech signal in sample level without any knowledge about the speech generation process. Famous standard speech coders of this category are G. 711 A-law and μ-law Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) coders [1], and G. 726 and G. 727 Adaptive Differential PCM coders [2]. Generally, a waveform coder works well at a high bit rate of 32  kbps or above. The parametric coding technique represents a speech signal by parameters of a speech-generating model. Among various speech-generating models, the most successful one is the linear predictive coding (LPC) model that assumes speech signal is the output of an all-pole model (autoregressive model) fed with an excitation input signal. The parameters of the all-pole filter conceptually represent the vocal tract shape that is highly correlated with the spectral envelope of the speech, while the excitation signal uses a quasiperiodic impulse train to represent information of fundamental frequency (or F 0) for voiced speech, pseudorandom noise for unvoiced speech, {{or a combination of}} the two (i.e., mixed excitation). Coders of this type encode speech signal in a frame-based processing manner and could operate at low bit rates ranging from 2 to 5  kbps. Differing from <b>waveform</b> coders, <b>parametric</b> coders make no attempt to preserve the original waveform shape but to keep the perceptual quality of the reconstructed speech. Famous standard LPC-based speech coders are FS 1015 LPC of LPC- 10 e algorithm [3, 4] and MELP (mixed excitation linear prediction) [5]. The hybrid coding technique tries to combine the advantages of both <b>waveform</b> <b>coding</b> and <b>parametric</b> coding. Coders of this type are similar to parametric coders in utilizing speech-generating models, but also similar to waveform coders in keeping encoded speech waveforms close to the original ones by more detailed modeling of the excitation signal. They generally adopt the code-excited linear prediction (CELP) algorithm [6] to minimize perceptually weighted error. Representative standard hybrid coders are FS 1016 CELP [7, 8], ITU-T G. 728 LD-CELP [9], ETSI AMR-ACELP [10], etc. A hybrid coder generally operates at a medium bit rate of 5 to 15  kbps.|$|R
