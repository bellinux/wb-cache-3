Although the majority held that Starkey's interpretation was more likely, in 1973 subsequent excavations vindicated her opinion.|$|E

5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts {{to put out a}}n unforced <b>preceding</b> runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to put out a forced <b>preceding</b> runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to put out an unforced <b>preceding</b> runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required to determine whether the batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to put out a <b>preceding</b> runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E
