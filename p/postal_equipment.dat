50|$|Newport {{is home to}} the Postal Museum, {{possibly}} the largest private collection of vintage <b>postal</b> <b>equipment</b> and post boxes in the world.|$|E
50|$|Current {{space in}} the museum allows {{approximately}} only 750 items of <b>postal</b> <b>equipment</b> and postal history to be displayed from an inventory of over 1,250 items. Some of the items are shown on the organization’s website.|$|E

50|$|EPPML (Extensible Postal Product Model and Language) is a {{conceptual}} {{model for the}} interactions between parties of a postal communication system. Examples of such parties are mailers, posts, mail aggregators, providers of <b>postal</b> services and <b>equipment</b> and recipients. They create, publish, consume and deliver postal products.|$|R
5000|$|The Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition (CEDAR) is a {{research}} laboratory at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. The center was established with funding from the United States Postal Service and National Institute of Justice. [...] CEDAR was formalized by the United States Postal Service by Postmaster General Anthony Frank in 1991.The primary goal of CEDAR was to conduct research and development for developing software useful for the automation of <b>postal</b> sorting <b>equipment.</b> Work at CEDAR, with Sargur Srihari as principal investigator, led to the first handwritten address interpretation system in the world. CEDAR-FOX, the first system for automatic comparison of handwriting {{for the purpose of}} forensic analysis, was developed at CEDAR.|$|R
50|$|A dummy stamp is a stamp-like label {{which is}} not valid for postal use. Dummy stamps are a form of cinderella stamp and the two {{principal}} types are test or training stamps, used to test <b>postal</b> <b>equipment</b> or train postal workers, and printer's sample stamps created to promote or demonstrate the printing capabilities of a stamp printer.|$|E
50|$|Jasper {{has been}} known as Coon Creek settlement, and as Midway (a name that at times {{included}} the Dublin community just across the Barton County line) for its position between county-seats Carthage and Lamar, but in the late 19th century it was renamed Jasper to reuse the <b>postal</b> <b>equipment</b> of a previous Jasper that existed southeast of Carthage.|$|E
50|$|Further {{development}} of the postal service followed the path of mechanization and automation of mail processing, improving the organization of its transportation and delivery. For this the old <b>postal</b> <b>equipment</b> was modernized and developing the production of its brand new designs - mail processing and handling machines and equipment for container transport, means of mechanization and post inventory, as well as equipment for customer service.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, an {{association}} with charity status was formed. The organisation’s full name, “association {{for the promotion}} of public mobile and immobile data exchange” (Verein zur Förderung des öffentlichen bewegten und unbewegten Datenverkehrs), and the acronym FoeBuD were conceived as a parody of the language used by the telecommunications operator, Deutsche Bundespost, which was then the state authority and monopolist for telephone and <b>postal</b> communications. Telecommunications <b>equipment</b> was heavily regulated on the German network, and the devices that were available often had names and acronyms that appeared bureaucratic and cumbersome. As FoeBuD’s activities and reputation spread outside the hacker scene and the historic background has largely been lost, the name was often perceived as just obscure.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, {{the first}} National Postal Museum (NPM) was established, {{in part due}} to the Phillips Collection of Victorian philately being donated to the nation by Reginald M. Phillips. The museum was opened by the Queen on 19 February 1969, at King Edward Building near St Paul's Cathedral in London. A {{collection}} of <b>postal</b> <b>equipment,</b> uniforms, vehicles and much more was developed over the years; far more than could be displayed in the small museum.|$|E
50|$|In {{subsequent}} years, {{the network}} of communication enterprises was significantly expanded, especially in rural areas. In the cities a network of liaison offices, post offices and subordinate communication centres was established, combining postal, telegraph and telephone services into a single entity, with offices typically located {{in the same building}} and under single management. A huge network of mailboxes was established, installed not only in cities but also in rural areas, stations, railway sidings and at highway intersections. Further development of the postal service followed the path of mechanization and automation of mail processing, improving the organization of its transportation and delivery. For this the old <b>postal</b> <b>equipment</b> was modernized, along with development of mechanized mail processing and handling machines and equipment for container transport and postal inventory, as well as equipment for customer service.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} equipment scheduling problem under disruptions in United States Postal Service mail processing and distribution centers. These facilities contain a large variety {{of equipment and}} employ a non-homogeneous workforce that work on shifts of various lengths and start times. The scheduling of equipment (the determination of the configuration and usage of equipment to match mail arrivals) and the scheduling of workforce (the determination of the optimal size and composition of the workforce, their days off / lunch assignments, and overtime usage) to meet processing service commitment with a constantly changing demand {{are some of the}} most challenging problems. Over the years, there have been many research studies that focused on solution of the <b>postal</b> <b>equipment</b> and staff scheduling problems. A comprehensive review of these studies is conducted. In the most general sense, each of the equipment and staff schedule problems can be decomposed temporally so and hierarchical analytic approaches have been adopted. Along the time axis, these studies can be classified into strategic, tactical and operational levels. This thesis focuses on the operational equipment scheduling problem or equipment scheduling under disruptions and addresses the adjustment of production plans and workforce schedules through the use of overtime and flexible employees in the face of disruptions such as demand fluctuation and absenteeism that happen on a daily basis and may significantly change demand and the size of workforce. This problem is modeled as a large-scale integer program, which contains equipment scheduling, shift scheduling and overtime management, and break assignment modules. Comprehensive experiments have been designed to investigate the effects of the use of overtime, the control of absenteeism, and the importance of integrating equipment and workforce scheduling simultaneously. The model integrates seamlessly with other research studies and provides the necessary tools to manage the resources in a facility on a routine basis. To improve computational time, an efficient LP based decomposition algorithm has been developed. The algorithm uses linear programming solutions as target solutions to construct a local search process to examine neighboring integer solutions. The heuristic was first proposed for the equipment scheduling under disruptions and then extended to the staff scheduling problem where multiple diverse initial solutions were generated to cover the solution landscape. These heuristics were computational efficient and were able to quickly obtains high-quality feasible solutions and delivers final solutions on par with the state of the art branch and bound algorithm in the solution of integer programs...|$|E
