5|$|With Jesse Beams {{from the}} University of Virginia, Lawrence {{continued}} {{to research the}} <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> They showed that photoelectrons appeared within 2 x 10−9 seconds of the photons striking the photoelectric surface—close to the limit of measurement at the time. Reducing the emission time by switching the light source on and off rapidly made the spectrum of energy emitted broader, in conformance with Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom.

5|$|However, {{attempting}} to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved troublesome.

In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
40|$|Real time {{electrochemical}} impedance spectroscopy {{data were}} acquired for a tungsten target during proton irradiation in the Weapons Neutron Research Facility at LANSCE. These impedance spectra were generated prior to irradiation and during irradiation beam currents of 50, 151, 350, and 484 nA. The data {{shows that the}} charge transfer resistance (inversely proportional to metal dissolution rate) and the resistance associated with an adsorbed intermediate decrease with increasing beam current. These observations are consistent with three possible proton beam effects: 1) an increase in surface temperature of the tungsten target, 2) <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> and, 3) radiation induced corrosion. Energy deposition and thermal hydraulic calculations predict that the surface temperature of the tungsten target was less than 31 oC at the maximum beam current. This temperature is too low to fully account for observed changes. Moreover, substantial changes were observed at beam currents as low as 50 and 151 nA. <b>Photoelectric</b> <b>effects,</b> which may have arisen from fluorescence of the cell or solution, are usually associated with increased resistance to corrosion. Here, a decrease in corrosion resistance with increasing beam current was observed.

40|$|We discuss optical {{absorption}} in topological insulators and study possible <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> theoretically. We found that absorption of circularly polarized electromagnetic waves in two-dimensional topological insulators results in electric current in the conducting 1 D edge channels, {{the direction of}} the current being determined by the light polarization. We suggest two ways of inducing such a current: due to magnetic dipole electron transitions stimulated by irradiation of frequency below the bulk energy gap, and due to electric dipole transitions in the bulk at frequencies larger than the energy gap with subsequent capture of the photogenerated carriers on conducting edge states. ...|$|R
