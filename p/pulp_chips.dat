Crop substitution is one strategy for reducing smoke from field burning. The objective of the project was to evaluate the potential for hybrid poplar as an alternative crop for poorly drained agricultural soils in the Willamette Valley. The evaluation focused on the potential yield of poplar on agricultural soils commonly used for annual ryegrass production, and on an economic analysis of poplar grown for <b>pulp</b> <b>chips</b> in the valley.

40|$|The {{chipping}} {{operation is}} an important component of harvesting systems producing biomass and <b>pulp</b> <b>chips.</b> This paper aimed to develop a valid model to predict the productivity of chipping as part of these operations. Over a number of years more than 200 different time studies were conducted on chipping operations in Italy and Australia. Multiple regressions and backward stepwise data analysis methods were applied to develop a productivity prediction equation, considering the following variables: machine power (kW), piece size (m 3), crew size, harvesting method, species, tree part, wood condition, wood lay-out, chipping type, propulsion, feeding method, point of chipping, season, location of chip discharge, country (Italy or Australia) and type of operation (biomass chip operation or pulp chip operation). The final productivity model included machine power, average piece size, location of chip discharge and type of operation as significant variables. The internal validation test was conducted using five witness samples from Italy and Australia, which confirmed the validity at α = 0. 05. Additional international case studies from North America, South America, and central and northern Europe were used to test the accuracy of the model, in which 15 studies confirmed the model’s validity and two failed to pass the test...|$|E
40|$|Roadside {{chipping}} is {{a common}} harvesting system in Australian plantations, which utilizes a mobile chipper stationed at the field edge to produce high-quality <b>pulp</b> <b>chips</b> for export. The studied harvesting system included a feller-buncher, two grapple skidders, a flail-debarker and a disc chipper. The study goals were to determine machine productivity, operation costs, fuel consumption, chip quality and measure the amount of slash left in the field after harvesting. The average productivity for feller buncher and skidder were about 97. 26 GMt/PMH 0 and 60. 22 GMt/PMH 0, respectively. The productivity of flail and chipper averaged at 57. 80 GMt/ PMH 0 and 58. 18 GMt/PMH 0 in this case study. The transportation productivity averaged about 57. 34 GMt/PMH 0. Time studies and regression analysis were used to model machine productivity. Tree size had {{significant impact on the}} feller-buncher productivity, while skidding distance was a significant variable affecting skidding productivity. Operation costs were evaluated using the ALPACA (Australian logging productivity and cost appraisal) model. This paper offers valuable information about the impact of different factors on feller-buncher and skidder productivity. Application of two skidders resulted in high total operating cost. Extracting whole trees to roadside yielded a very small amount of remaining slash distributed on the site...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} batch kraft pulp digester is developed that predicts, ~ priori, the lignin content distribution, the carbohydrate content distribution, and the effective alkali concentration distribution within <b>pulp</b> <b>chips</b> {{as a function of}} cooking time. From this information the kappa number, yield, screen rejects, and kappa number distribution of the pulp are calculated. The model also predicts the bulk phase effective alkali concentration as a function of cooking time. Input to the model are the initial hydroxyl concentration and sulfide concentration, the chip-thickness distribution, the temperature history of the cook, and the chemical composition and density of the species of wood to be pulped. Model predictions are compared with data from pulping experiments in which the reaction rates are kinetically controlled and with experiments in which the diffusion rate restricts the overall reaction rates. In both cases the comparison is good. Model results show that the normalized second moment of the lignin content is a better predictor of rejects than the fiber liberation point. Results also show that in indirect heated batch digesters the inter-chip mass transfer resistence is negligible. The pulping model is coupled with an optimization scheme to find the optimum pulping conditions. One result of the optimization is that an increase in productivity of 19 %can be obtained by optimization of the effective alkali concentration in a kraft cook. The effect of digester temperature gradients on the lignin content distribution of a pulp is shown to be significant, but the effect on screen rejects is negligible. Stratifying the chip by thickness to take advantage of temperature gradients is found to narrow the lignin content distribution, but has no effect on the screen rejects of a cook. ...|$|E

40|$|Structural lumber {{products}} are traditionally manufactured from softwoods. However, with shrinking supplies of softwood lumber and abundant supplies of hardwood lumber, {{there is increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} hard-woods for structural applications.

This paper presents some results on developing accelerated kiln schedules for drying hard maple 2 by 6 s for structural uses. INTROOUCTION In the grading practice of hardwood dimension lumber, about 30 to 50 percent are visually determined as “low-grade ” lumber, which generally has low value. Currently there are limited options for using this low-grade hardwood material. The two primary options are <b>pulp</b> <b>chip</b> (valued at about $ 100 /MBF) and pallets (valued at about $ 250 /MBF).

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} of recovering sawlogs from pulp-size poplar plantations. Under recent short-rotation high-density management practice, only 1. 2 percent of the trees reach the minimum size and form requirements for timber production. Separating the sawlogs from the primary <b>pulp</b> <b>chip</b> harvest is technically feasible and requires four additional tasks: selection and marking, separation while forwarding, merchandising, and loading. It also allows saving the cost of delimbing-debarking-chipping. At present, separation costs $ 42 per green ton, which makes separation profitable. What’s more, {{there is a potential}} for halving this figure if the harvesting system is improved according to the findings of the study. The most expensive task is marking and selection, which is performed manually; at present this work accounts for 72 percent of the separation cost. Furthermore, a more flexible merchandising strategy may be needed. Limiting sawlog production to one fixed length means making poor use of the potential yield of the trees; since separation cost decreases with sawlog yield, increasing sawlog recovery provides a substantial economic benefit. Despite its marginal character, the recovery of sawlogs from pulpwood plantations can become economically viable and help differentiate production so as to exploit a wider range of market opportunities. In this context, optimizing the harvesting system is crucial to reaching the appropriate cost and quality goals. © Forest Products Society 2008...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new technology based on a mild chemical pretreatment process prior to mechanical <b>pulping.</b> <b>Chips</b> are treated with a dilute solution of oxalic acid (OA) for only 10 minute at 130 °C, in a typical example. The properties of the pulp produced by this OA process are quite different from those obtained via conventional chemical pretreatments, providing a much more valuable pulp, and at higher yields. Refining results obtained at the Andritz Pilot Plant in Springfield, Ohio show an outstanding combination of strength improvements, energy savings, and shive and triglycerides reduction, with only a modest loss in brightness. Under suitable conditions the light scattering coefficient of the oxalic-treated treated chips was fully recovered without losing the above benefits. Maintaining light scattering coefficient with this treatment is of great interest, particularly to those mills producing lightweight coated paper (LWC). Refining results are presented here, along with {{an evaluation of the}} process economics for a LWC example case. Based on strength improvements (kraft replacement in the final furnish) and energy savings, the production cost savings are substantial. For the LWC example, at least $ 9 million/year net savings before license fees can be realized in an operation producing 372 t/d of OA mechanical pulp for 600 t/d of blended LWC furnish. Based on this strong economic potential, several mechanical pulp mills have expressed interest in conducting in-mill evaluations. Planning for mill trials is currently underway...|$|R
40|$|The basic densities and {{tracheid}} {{lengths of}} the wood of nine 52 -year-old radiata pine trees from the same site in Kaingaroa Forest were measured and related to kraft pulp and handsheet properties. From each tree core wood (wood billet containing 15 growth layers) and slabwood (outer 20 growth layers of a wood billet containing 40 growth layers) samples were <b>chipped</b> and <b>pulped</b> to kappa numbers of 27 ± 2. An additional 7 samples were taken at 5 internode intervals (5 growth layers) from the 10 th to the 40 th internodes of 3 trees with average basic densities. Each internode sample {{from each of the}} 3 trees was combined on equal oven-dry basis, and kraft pulps were prepared. Wood basic densities, chip basic densities, and wood tracheid lengths for each of the 25 samples were compared with weighted average pulp fibre lengths, pulp fibre cross-sectional dimensions, fibre wall thickness: fibre diameter ratios, and pulp fibre coarseness. For all 25 <b>pulps,</b> <b>chip</b> basic density was found to be the wood property most closely related to pulp and handsheet qualities. About 80 % of the variation in handsheet tear, burst, and density properties were accounted for by variations in chip basic density. Inclusion of pulp fibre length in the regression analyses increased this variation accountability by 5 - 10 %. Of the pulp properties measured, the wall thickness: fibre diameter ratio was most closely correlated with chip basic density and therefore with the selected handsheet characteristics.

Rice and rubber were traditionally the principal exports of Cambodia, but exports fell sharply after the onset of the civil War, which put most of the rubber plantations out of operation. By the 1990 s, however, rubber plantings had been undertaken as part of a national recovery program, and rubber and rice were again being exported. The fishing industry has also somehow been revived, but some food shortages continue. From this period, the largest source of export income has been timber, until the Cambodian government set up a “log export” ban in 1995. With a rather limited national environment supporting the development of an internationally competitive wood processing industry, this industry sector has not benefited from this ban. Wood material exports have continued under a limited processed form, i. e. squared logs and thick boards. Up to now, no development of any wood <b>pulp</b> or <b>chipping</b> industry has been impossible in Cambodia. Additionally, in 2002, any logging activity has been suspended for any forest companies, until the approval of their new forest concessions. Some forest companies which had old logs (harvested before 2001) were still authorized to process them. Further, in 2003, a large portion of the territory (about 24 %) was declared as protected area. The industrial growth of the country is now mainly sustained by the garment and tourism sectors.

40|$|Background: Paper mill {{residuals}} differ {{depending on}} the process and associated chemicals needed to create the paper for the intended use. Finch Paper, LLC operates a paper mill in Glens Falls, New York. Finch starts with logs and produces high quality printing paper. They use the ammonium bisulfite pulping process to produce <b>pulp</b> from wood <b>chips.</b> The wastewater treatment system treats about 16 to 20 million gallons of wastewater a day. This process generates around 190 cubic yards of Waste Water Treatment Residual (WWTR) per day. Most chemical pulp mills in the United States use the Kraft process to make pulp. That process uses sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide to make <b>pulp</b> from <b>chips.</b> As a result, Kraft WWTR contains {{a fair amount of}} sodium and sulfur. Finch’s process gives off a fair amount of nitrogen and sulfur. This indicates that the WWTR could have value as a fertilizer or as a valuable ingredient in compost.

Alternatives derived from the intersection of two product strategies (pulpwood and chips, or chips only) with two pulpwood processing methods (manual or mechanized).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} impact of {{hemicellulose}} extraction in eucalyptus wood, through alkaline leaching (NaOH) of wood chips, on the subsequent kraft process (with varying sulphidity) and the quality of the <b>pulp.</b> The <b>chips</b> were initially saturated with water and treated with a NaOH solution in a liquor to wood ratio of 6 : 1 m 3 /t. The reaction times (3, 8, 14 and 16 hours), temperatures (70, 84 and 90 °C) and NaOH concentrations (60, 80, 90, 120 and 156 g/L) were assessed in atmospheric conditions. In the pressurized treatments (300 kPa), the reaction times, temperature and NaOH concentrations assessed were, respectively: 30, 60 and 120 minutes, 100 °C and 100, 150 and 200 g/L. The optimal alkaline leaching condition was determined taking into account the hemicellulose concentrations remaining in the chips and the gravimetrical yield. Chips not subjected to alkaline treatment (control) and leached with NaOH in optimum conditions were kraft cooked until kappa number 17 – 18. The results indicate that alkaline leaching of chips is not efficient in extracting hemicelluloses in the wood studied. The highest extraction of 4 -O-methyl-glucuronoxylan acetate reached 42 % in very severe conditions (100 °C, 60 minutes, 200 g/L of NaOH and 300 kPa pressure). The pulp yield of the leached chips was approximately 7 % lower than that of the non-leached chips (control) ...|$|R
40|$|Mixed {{hardwood}} chips {{were treated}} with lignin-degrading fungi to study the effect of fungal pretreatment on bleaching characteristics of kraft <b>pulp.</b> Pretreated wood <b>chips</b> were subjected to reduced active alkali doses in comparison to untreated chips. Comparable results were obtained for pretreated chips with reduced alkali dose as was obtained with higher dose of alkali in case of untreated chips. Fungal treatment made the process more energy-efficient, and 4. 8 % less chlorine was consumed {{in comparison to the}} control process. Pretreatment with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora was responsible for reduction of 4. 7 % in lignin contents, 14. 3 % permanganate number, and overall reduction of 15. 5 kg/T of Cl 2 consumption. The pollution load in terms of COD and BOD at the CD stage was reduced by 32. 6 % and 41. 5 % respectively, whereas 12 % reduction in AOX compounds was observed in effluent of pretreated pulp...|$|R
40|$|Commercial bamboo chips were {{evaluated}} {{as raw material}} for dissolving <b>pulp</b> production. The <b>chips</b> were auto-hydrolyzed (AH) and subsequently cooked by the NaOH/AQ process and bleached to full brightness with the O-CCE-D-(EP) -D-P sequence. The term CCE designates a cold caustic extraction stage. The bamboo chip chemistry (22. 4 % lignin, 19. 5 % xylans, 49. 3 % cellulose, 16. 8 % total extractives, and 1. 5 % ash) was apparently unfavorable; however high quality dissolving pulp was produced using the aforementioned technologies, even when compared to results obtained with traditional eucalypt commercial wood <b>chips.</b> The <b>pulp</b> showed high brightness (92. 4 % ISO) and α-cellulose content (94. 9 %). Its contents of hemicelluloses, extractives and ash were within acceptable levels for a dissolving pulp aimed at viscose rayon production. Thus, the bamboo chip furnish investigated {{can be regarded as}} a viable raw material for dissolving pulp production...|$|R
40|$|Terentang wood (Campnosperma auriculata Hook. f) is {{relatively}} low in specific gravity (0. 3), hence its utilization as pulp by chemi-mechanical {{is an alternative}} process. Energy consumption was reduced by applying lignin degrading fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) as pretreatment in the chemi-mechanical process. This paper examines the effects of P. chrysosporium incubation periods into chemical components and energy refining consumption of terentang wood. Four percent of NaOH {{was used in the}} chemi-mechanical process, and incubation periods studied were 0 (control), 3, 4 and 5 weeks. Results showed that P. chrysosporium significantly affected the weight loss, chemical properties, and refining energy consumption of terentang wood <b>pulping</b> process. Wood <b>chip</b> weight loss was about 15. 95 - 21. 31 % and alpha-cellulose raised up to 6. 77 %. Five weeks incubation time decreased lignin content up to 22. 97 % and saved the refining energy up to 22. 7 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} fungal {{pretreatment}} of Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) wood chips {{on the performance}} of treated pulps was studied. The chips were pretreated with P. chrysosporium BKM- 1767 fungus at 1, 2, and 4 weeks using an inoculation temperature and relative humidity of 39 oC and 65 %, respectively with two pulping times (80 and 90 min) and three sodium sulfite charges (14, 18, and 22 %). The cooking temperature of 165 °C, and liquor-to-wood ratio of 7 : 1 were kept constant. Beating energy consumption showed a maximum savings of 43 % for four-week treatment of wood chips with the fungus. The screen yield of the unbleached CMP ranged between 76 and 84 % depending on the chip inoculation time and cooking conditions. A decreasing trend in screen yield of the <b>pulp</b> after <b>chips</b> incubation could be explained by the enzyme action on the lignin or polysaccharides. Pulp strengths including tensile, burst, tear, and fold declined with an increase in chip treatment time. Applying 3 % H 2 O 2, 4. 2 % NaOH, 3 % NaSiO 3, and 0. 3 % DTPA for 1 hour in two similar stages and 2 weeks fungal pretreatment of chips showed the best optical properties of bleached pulp. After a two-stage H 2 O 2 -bleaching sequence, the maximal brightness value for the control and biopulps were 54. 8 % and 56. 2 %, respectively. Overall, two-week treatment showed the better performance of P. chrysosporium on Hornbeam chips...|$|R
3000|$|... 137 Cs determination: The <b>chip,</b> <b>pulp</b> powder, black liquor, and {{supernatant}} {{were placed}} in plastic containers (Ø 56  mm × H 35  mm; PP-U 9, Sekiya Rika), and the 137 Cs activities were measured using a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (GC 3520, Canberra; GEM- 30195 -P, Seiko EG&G Ortec). Standard 137 CsCl solutions (Japan Radioisotope Association) diluted with 133 CsCl were used as standard sources for the HPGe detector. Measurements were continued for 80, 000  s or until a counting error of less than 5 % of the 137 Cs peak was achieved. The radioactive concentration of 137 Cs (Bq/kg dry weight) was calculated based on the gamma ray spectrum using the Gamma Explorer software (Canberra Japan KK, Tokyo). The activities were corrected for decay back to the sampling date. The 137 Cs activity for the precipitation was calculated from {{the difference between the}} 137 Cs activities in the corresponding black liquor and supernatant.|$|R
40|$|In Thailand, Eucalyptus urophylla was {{introduced}} {{with the main}} purpose of supplying raw material for <b>pulp</b> and <b>chip</b> wood production. The demand for genetically improved seed is increasing to support high productivity plantation establishment. One of the tree improvement activities established to meet the high demand for improved seed was a second generation progeny test at Lad Krating Plantation, Thailand to provide the best material for the successful plantation program. The aim of the current study was to compare growth variation of the first and second generation of Eucalyptus urophylla progeny that could provide information on suitable families for improved quality seed. The progeny test comprised the best 45 half-sib families selected from 80 half-sib families of the first-generation progeny test. The design of the progeny test was a randomized and complete block design (16 trees/plot ×  45 plots/block ×  9 blocks), with 4 rows of 4 trees at a spacing of 2  m ×  1  m. Growth was assessed at age 3  yr. The average height and diameter at breast height over bark (DBH), was 13. 72  m, and 8. 75  cm, respectively. There were highly significant (p <  0. 01) differences among provenances and families in both height and DBH. The individual heritability values for height and DBH were 0. 48 and 0. 60, respectively. The family heritability values for height and DBH were 0. 98 and 0. 99, respectively. These 45 half-sib families proved to be genetically superior ensuring higher productivity and contributing {{to the success of the}} Forest Industry Organization plantation at Lad Krating...|$|R
