50|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>asymbolia,</b> {{also called}} pain dissociation, is a {{condition}} in which pain is experienced without unpleasantness. This usually results from injury to the brain, lobotomy, cingulotomy or morphine analgesia. Preexisting lesions of the insula may abolish the aversive quality of painful stimuli while preserving the location and intensity aspects. Typically, patients report that they have pain but are not bothered by it; they recognize the sensation of pain but are mostly or completely immune to suffering from it.|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} {{of this paper}} is a rare {{syndrome}} in human pain experience, known as the <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia.</b> The first thing that will be considered in this paper is the nature of <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia.</b> I will try to examine and prove professor Grahek's claim that <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia</b> differs from other dissociation syndromes in human pain experience. Also, the special attention will be given to Grahek's claim that typical cases of indifference to pain are not the cases of radical or total indifference to pain. Finally, it will be shown how <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia</b> can be used against some famous arguments in the philosophy of mind. Namely, {{it can be used to}} undermine both the subjectivist and the objectivist conceptions of pain. More specifically, it can be used to disprove the functionalist interpretation of pain and the perceptual or representational model of pain. Also, <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia</b> can be used against the subjectivist view, according to which the sensation of pain is to be considered as the essential component of pain...|$|E
40|$|Pain asymbolics feel pain, but {{act as if}} {{they are}} {{indifferent}} to it. Nikola Grahek argues that such patients present a clear counterexample to motivationalism about pain. I argue that Grahek has mischaracterized <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia.</b> Properly understood, asymbolics have lost a general capacity to care about their bodily integrity. Asymbolics' indifference to pain thus does not show something about the intrinsic nature of pain; it shows something about the relationship between pains and subjects, and how that relationship might break down. I explore the consequences of such a view for both motivationalism and the categorization of <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia</b> as a syndrome, arguing for a close link between asymbolia and various forms of depersonalization. 24 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Words such as 'consciousness' and 'self' {{actually}} encompass {{a number}} of distinct phenomena that are loosely lumped together. The study of neurological syndromes allows us to explore the neural mechanisms that might underlie different aspects of self, such as body image and emotional responses to sensory stimuli, and perhaps even laughter and humour. Mapping the 'functional logic' of the many different attributes of human nature on to specific neural circuits in the brain offers the best hope of understanding how the activity of neurons gives rise to conscious experience. We consider three neurological syndromes (phantom limbs, Capgras delusion and <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia)</b> to illustrate this idea...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>asymbolia</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{caused by}} brain damage, usually in adulthood. Asymbolics feel pain but appear indifferent to it, and indifferent also to visual and verbal threats. How should we make sense of this? Nikola Grahek thinks asymbolics’ pains are abnormal, lacking a component that make normal pains unpleasant and motivating. Colin Klein thinks that what is abnormal is not asymbolics’ pains, but asymbolics: they have a psychological deficit making them unresponsive to unpleasant pain. I argue that an illuminating account requires elements of both views. Asymbolic pains are indeed abnormal, but they are abnormal because asymbolics are. I agree with Klein that asymbolics are incapable of caring about their bodily integrity; but I argue against him that, if this is to explain not only their indifference to visual and verbal threat, but also their indifference to pain, we must do the following: (i) take asymbolics’ lack of bodily care not as an alternative to, but as an explanation of their pains’ missing a component, and (ii) claim that the missing component consists in evaluative content. Asymbolia, I conclude, reveals not only that unpleasant pain is composite, but that its ‘hedomotive component’ is evaluative...|$|E
40|$|Background: People {{vary greatly}} in their {{response}} to painful stimuli, from those with a low pain threshold to those with indifference to pain. However, insensitivity to pain is a rare disorder, characterized {{by the lack of}} usual subjective and objective responses to noxious stimuli. Patients who have congenital indifference to pain sustain painless injuries beginning in infancy, but have sensory responses that are otherwise normal on examination. Perception of passive movement, joint position, and vibration is normal in these patients, as are tactile thresholds and light touch perception. Case report: A twelve-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital for a painless deformity, degeneration in both knees and a neglected femoral neck fracture that was inappropriately painless. Further examination revealed normal sensory responses, perception of passive movement, joint position, vibration tactile thresholds and light touch perception. Spinal cord and brain MRI were normal as was the electromyography and nerve conduction velocity (EMG/NCV) examination. There was no positive family history for this disorder. Conclusion: The deficits present in the different pain insensitivity syndromes provide insight into the complex anatomical and physiological nature of pain perception. Reports on <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia,</b> in which pain is perceived but does not cause suffering, and related cortical conditions illustrate that there can be losses that independently involve either the sensory-discriminative component or the affective-motivational component of pain perception, thus highlighting their different anatomical localization. The paucity of experience with this entity and the resultant diagnostic problems, the severity of the associated disabling arthropathy and underscore the importance of this case report of indifference to pain...|$|E
40|$|Pain {{associated}} with hemiplegia {{has been considered}} mainly {{in the context of}} the thalamic syndrome. Since the original observations by Dejerine ' and Roussy, ' many cases have been reported and all textbooks of neurology carry a description of it. The cardinal points have been the presence, on the side opposite the lesion, of spontaneous pain and an over-reaction to sensory stimuli. Most of the cases have included a loss or reduction of perception of touch, pin prick, thermal, and proprioceptive modalities, but Head 5 pointed out that this diminution may be extremely slight and discoverable only by finer methods of examination. Despite its establishment as a classical entity and the ease of diagnosis, a number of puzzling features remain. First there is the paradox of an overreaction to stimuli in an area of diminished sensibility. Roussy localized the syndrome to a lesion in the lateral thalamic nucleus on the basis of autopsy studies, and French neurologists, in general, have attributed the hyperreaction to irritation of the thalamic paths. Head considered that this feature was the result of the release of control of higher, i. e., cortical, centers. The specificity of the syndrome as "thalamic " has been questioned by the quoting of cases with central pain in more cephalad lesions. " 2 Further, it is a fact that most patients with hemiplegia and lesions involving the thalamus or cortico-thalamic pathway do not complain of pain in the affected extremities. Although a clinical entity, the thalamic syndrome is of neurophysiological interest because until comparatively recently our knowledge of the thalamus and its functions was based on such clinical and histological studies. The present paper is a reinterpretation on the basis of recent work on the organization of the thalamic nuclei, particularly in reference to the nonspecific projection systems, and to the development of understanding of such alterations in symbolic organization of perceptual modalities as anosognosia, inattention, and <b>pain</b> <b>asymbolia...</b>|$|E
