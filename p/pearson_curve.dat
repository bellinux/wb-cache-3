40|$|This is {{the second}} of two papers {{concerned}} with fitting Pearson curves to Monte Carlo simulations of implants into amorphous targets. In the first paper [Solid-St. Electron. 35, 1151 (1992) ] it was shown that accurate <b>Pearson</b> <b>curve</b> fitting to projected range profiles is possible when implant profiles are available for which optimised moments can be generated. In the present paper we extend the fitting to simulations of two-dimensional rest distributions. Comparisons are made between <b>Pearson</b> <b>curve</b> fits and the original high-resolution implant profiles, in two-dimensions, for the ions B and As implanted into amorphous silicon. The profiles were derived from Monte Carlo simulations, each of one million ion trajectories. Fit coefficients are provided that allow the regeneration of the moment surfaces for the depth and implantation energy dependent lateral straggle and lateral kurtosis for the ions B, P, As and Sb implanted, with energies in the range 25 - 300 keV, into targets of amorphous silicon, silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. The depth-dependent lateral distribution is then constructed using symmetrical Pearson curves driven by analytical formulae for the moment surfaces. The two-dimensional rest distribution is then reconstructed from the product of this depth-dependent lateral distribution and the projected range distribution derived in the first paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} density functions of net-proton multiplicity distributions are constructed from the Beam Energy Scan {{results of the}} STAR experiment using the <b>Pearson</b> <b>curve</b> method for two different transverse momentum windows. The $ 6 ^{th}$ and $ 8 ^{th}$ order cumulants of net-proton multiplicity distributions are estimated from the constructed {{probability density}} functions. The beam energy dependence of $C_{ 6 }/C_{ 2 }$ and $C_{ 8 }/C_{ 2 }$ {{are found to be}} sensitive to the acceptance window. This method provides a unique opportunity to study the O(4) criticality near the chiral crossover transition and estimating the higher-order cumulants. In general, it is useful to determine the probability density function uniquely of a frequency data if the first four cumulants are known. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, text modifie...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{percentage}} points for Neyman's goodness-of-fit statistics of order {{two for the}} uniform distribution. Recent work has suggested that this statistic is powerful against {{a wide range of}} alterna-tives. The statistic is a combination of the sample mean and sample variance of the observations. The percentage points have been found by fitting Pearson curves, following the work of F. N. David (1939) who gave the first four moments of the Neyman statistic. We then turn our attention to another situation concerned with sampling from a uniform distribution. Deken (1980) has produced exact distributions and moments for the largest gaps (spacings) and stretches (higher order spacings) among points uniformly distributed on a unit interval. An approximation to the distribution is also suggested by Deken. We develop the <b>Pearson</b> <b>curve</b> fit for the distri-bution of this maximum statistic and find it is excellent over the range of values and somewhat better than the approximation in the lower tail region. The test statistic developed by Deken is powerful against alternatives t...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} whereby ion implantation profiles in amorphous materials may be accurately represented by <b>Pearson</b> frequency distribution <b>curves.</b> The type of Pearson distribution {{to be used}} depends upon the implantation conditions but it is shown that the three main types, I, IV and VI, together with the transition types II, III, V, VII and the Gaussian are all suitable representations. Previous attempts to fit <b>Pearson</b> <b>curves</b> to implantation profiles have often failed due to semi-infinite moments being used instead of infinite moments. This approximation is only valid when the surface concentration of implanted ions is negligibly small...|$|R
40|$|In this, {{the first}} of two papers, the problem of {{constructing}} ion implantation profiles in one and two dimensions from depth-independent spatial moments is discussed. Comparisons are made between <b>Pearson</b> and Johnson <b>curves,</b> constructed from moments produced by a transport equation solver, and profiles obtained directly from Monte Carte simulations. A set of such comparisons, using consistent input quantities, is performed over a range of ion-target mass ratios and energies. For projected range distributions of the ions B, P and As into a-Si, a single Johnson type (S-B) describes the implants over the energy range 1 keV to 1 MeV. The description using <b>Pearson</b> <b>curves</b> requires two types (I and VI). Also, taking the Monte Carlo data as a reference, the Johnson curves are equivalent, if not superior, to the <b>Pearson</b> <b>curves</b> in terms of fit accuracy. For lateral distributions of the same ion types over the same energy range it is shown that if the depth-dependent lateral kurtosis is less than 3. 0, then the Pearson type II (bounded), Johnson type S-B (bounded) and the modified Gaussian (unbounded) curves prove acceptable representations. If the depth-dependent lateral kurtosis is greater than 3. 0 then the Pearson type VII (unbounded) and Johnson type S-U (unbounded) curves are good representations...|$|R
40|$|Three {{topics in}} the {{analysis}} of microarray genomic data are discussed and improved statistical methods are developed in each case. A statistical test with higher power is developed for detecting periodicity in microarray time series data. Periodicity in short series, with non-Fourier frequencies, is detected through a <b>Pearson</b> <b>curve</b> calibrated to the null distribution obtained by computer simulation. Unlike other traditional methods, this approach is applicable even in the presence of missing values or unequal time intervals. The usefulness of the new method is demonstrated on simulated series as well as actual microarray time series. The second topic develops a new method for detection of changes in DNA or gene copy number. Regions for DNA copy number aberrations in chromosomal material are detected using maximum overlapping discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). It is shown how repeated application of MODWT to a series can be used to confirm the presence of change points. Application to simulated as well as array CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) data confirms the excellent performance of this method. In the third topic, it is shown that an improved class predictor for tissue samples in microarray experiments is developed by incorporating nearest neighbour covariates (NNC). It is demonstrated that this method reduces the mis-classification errors in both simulated and actual microarray data...|$|E

Application of {{methods of the}} applied mathematics can significantly increase efficiency of its solution. In the present work the problem of pneumonia prognosis is solved by pattern recognition on the example of acute poisoning by psychotropic and hypnotic drugs. It is established, that the reliable prognosis can be made, when values of only two parameters of the blood formula are known. 2 -D approximations of conditional data distributions of these parameters are constructed {{on the basis of}} two approaches: approximation by 2 -D normal distribution and approximation by <b>Pearson</b> <b>curves</b> product constructed in orthogonal coordinates related to a direction of data correlation minimum.

By considering the structure of moments and using the method of transformations, various series representations for the exact density of W, a constant multiple of $ nabla sp 2 $, are derived. Gamma type approximations and <b>Pearson</b> <b>curves</b> approximation to the exact density of W are discussed. Some numerical computations are given to compare the accuracy of each method.

This study is presents same applications of Pearson family’s of distributions, and give the new extended, which extends the classical Pearson family. Various properties of this new family are investigated and then exploited to derive several related results, especially characterizations, in probability.

The analysis of experimental data {{in terms of the}} choice of the method of approximation was done. A approximating dependence is based on the solution of Pearson differential equations. The advantages of the proposed method for the type of approximation of the experimental data obtained. An algorithm for constructing a mathematical model describing the relaxation spectrum and mass distribution of the fat globules in the milk and milk products was implemented. As a result, a family of <b>Pearson</b> approximation <b>curves</b> of the experimental data shows the ability to qualitatively correctly describe the change in the distribution of the fat phase in the process of homogenization.

40|$|The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) is {{frequently}} used in medical studies {{to assess the}} efficiency of a diagnostic test. There exists two different ways to model the curve theoretically: direct and indirect. The direct method consists of constructing the curve based on the observed data. This method is less appealing in that the curve obtained is not easily interpretable. In the indirect method, a distribution is assumed for both the diseased and non-diseased patients. The normal distribution {{has been used to}} model both types of patients owing to the ease of its manipulation. In this thesis, we propose the use of the Pearsonian system of distributions in order to select the distribution for the diseased and non-diseased patients.

For a multivariate stationary time series, the covariance matrix of the one-step ahead prediction error and its determinant, called the innovation generalized variance, play important roles in theory and methods of time series analysis. In the univariate case extensive work has been done on the estimation of this important parameter. However, the problem, for the most part, has remained unexplored in the multivariate case. This dissertation has the goal of extending univariate estimation procedures to multivariate time series and pointing out structural differences and difficulties that exist in dealing with the latter case. Our estimator of innovation generalized variance is based on a multivariate analogue of the Szego-Kolmogorov formula, where the integral is replaced by a Riemann sum and the unknown spectrum by an appropriate estimator. While in the univariate case one has the option of using either the periodogram or a smoothed density estimator, in the multivariate case one must use the latter since the periodogram matrix is always of rank one and its determinant is zero. Also in the multivariate case the question of distinctness of eigenvalues of the spectral density matrix comes {{to play a role in}} determining the asymptotic behavior of the estimator. When the spectral density matrix has distinct eigenvalues, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. The small sample behavior of the estimator is assessed through simulation and by application to two real data sets. The role of data taper in reducing bias of the estimator is investigated through simulation of several multivariate models. Finally, an interesting application of the <b>Pearson</b> family of <b>curves</b> in approximating the small sample distribution of the estimator is presented, which gives a measure of departure of small sample distribution of the estimator from a normal distribution as a function of the sample size...|$|R
