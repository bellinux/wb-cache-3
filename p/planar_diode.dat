40|$|The {{classical}} {{static analysis}} of the infinite <b>planar</b> <b>diode</b> has been extended to include the effects of finite transverse beam size. Simple expressions have been found for the increase in maximum stable current density over that of an infinite stream for finite cylindrical and strip streams flowing between plates of infinite diodes. The results are also given in terms of stream perveance. The effect of a nonuniform distribution of current across the stream is shown to be relatively small. Experimental values of maximum stable current agree with those obtained from the analysis.

For length-to-width ratios L/D less than 0. 25 the tube is adequately described by the results for the infinite <b>planar</b> <b>diode</b> and for L/D greater than 4, the infinitely-long drift tube theory suffices.

40|$|The Child-Langmuir law {{relates the}} voltage applied across a <b>planar</b> <b>diode</b> to the {{saturation}} value J_CL of current density {{that can be}} transmitted through it in case the injection velocity of electrons into the diode is zero. The Child-Langmuir current density J_CL is, at the same time, (i) the maximum current density that can be transmitted through a <b>planar</b> <b>diode,</b> (ii) the current density below which the flow is steady and unidirectional in the long time limit and (iii) the average transmitted current density for any value of injected current density above J_CL. Existing generalizations of Child-Langmuir law to non-zero velocities of injection {{are based on the}} characteristics (i) and (ii) of J_CL. This paper generalizes the law to non-zero velocities of injection based on the characteristic (iii) by deriving an analytical expression for the saturation value of current density. The analytical expression for the saturation current density is found to be well supported by numerical computations. A reason behind preferring the saturation property of the Child-Langmuir current density as the basis for its generalization is the importance of that property in numerical simulations of high current diode devices.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of THz <b>planar</b> Schottky <b>diodes,</b> focusing on analyses of the geometry-dependent parasitics and the diode chip thermal management. Moving towards higher operating frequencies, the electromagnetic couplings pose significant limitations on the diode performance. In this work, {{a model of the}} loss at high frequencies for <b>planar</b> <b>diodes</b> is de-veloped, specifically the ohmic losses in the cathode buffer mesa is analysed. As a result, the eddy current, skin and proximity effects have been identified as im-portant loss mechanisms in the buffer mesa. This provides an explanation to the strong frequency dependency of the series resistance, which is not explainable using conventional diode series resistance models. Due to the current crowding effect, the upper boundary of the buffer-layer thickness is approximately one skin depth at the operating frequency, whereas the lower boundary is limited by the spreading resistance at DC. In addition to the ohmic loss, the parasitic capacitance and inductance in...|$|R
