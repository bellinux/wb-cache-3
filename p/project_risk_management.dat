40|$|Construction {{industry}} has {{for many years}} developed a very bad reputation for coping with project schedule, cost, quality and safety. Not only does construction industry deliver expensive buildings late, it contributes to disproportionate numbers of work-related injuries and fatalities as well. <b>Project</b> safety <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> is acknowledged {{as one of the}} techniques that can be implemented on construction projects to enhance performance of the construction contractors in South Africa. This research report investigates the use of <b>project</b> safety <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> by contractors, and evaluates the relationship that exists between <b>project</b> safety <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> and <b>project</b> parameters relative to schedule, cost, quality and safety in the construction industry in South Africa. The research report adopted empirical study in order to achieve the objectives. An in depth literature review was carried out in order to identify safety project management processes that can be used by construction contractors. To establish how <b>project</b> safety <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> is currently being implemented in the South African construction industry and its importance to projects parameters, a research question was developed based on the information from literature review. The research questionnaire was sent out to 101 construction contractors in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Fifty eight (58) contractors completed the questionnaire. The study has established that positive relationship exists between <b>projects</b> safety <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> and <b>project</b> parameters in the construction industry in South Africa. This study recommends that construction contractors in South Africa should proactively implement <b>project</b> safety <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> processes in order to improve projects performance.

40|$|In the {{construction}} industry, <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> concept {{is a less}} popular technique. There are three main stages in the systematic approach to <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> in construction industry. These stages include: a) risk response; b) risk analysis and evaluation; and c) risk identification. The high risk related to construction business affects each of its participants; while operational analysis and management of construction related risks remain an enormous task to practitioners of the industry. This paper tends towards reviewing the existing literature on construction <b>project</b> <b>risk</b> <b>managements</b> in developing countries specifically on <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> process. The literature lacks ample <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> process approach capable of capturing risk impact on diverse project objectives. This literature review aims at discovering the frequently used techniques in risk identification and analysis.

50|$|Construction projects, {{like all}} complex activities, involve many {{partners}} with different objectives, who {{are subjected to}} many risks in an uncertain environment. In practice, different project stakeholders have different understanding and perception of project risks. Each one identifies and analyzes the project risks regarding his objectives, risk attitude and special perspective to project risks without relying on a common and shared methodology. This is why in most of construction projects, discussing the project risks and making risk based decisions are of common difficulties which may also cause to disputes between project parties. Also, the <b>project</b> <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> is a scalable activity and should be commensurate with the size, level of available information {{and complexity of the}} project under consideration. Furthermore, this process is iterative, since in each phase of the project, new information is available and some predicted risks events occur while others will not, new unpredicted risk events may occur or may be identified, and the characteristics of those already identified may change. Thus, an iterative risk management should be carried out at all stages of the project life cycle. As consequence, the <b>project</b> <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> process has to be tailored for each particular case and project.|$|E
