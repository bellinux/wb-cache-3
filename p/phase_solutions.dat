40|$|Graduate School. This thesis {{presents}} an open source {{implementation of a}} cavitation model and assesses the effec-tiveness of the solver with previous work on several validation cases. The free computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package OpenFOAM is used to first validate single <b>phase</b> <b>solutions</b> on a flat plate, hemispherical headform, and a NACA 0012 airfoil. Motivated by {{the need for a}} simulation tool that is free to the public yet still reliable, verification and validation are essential if a main-stream shift is to be made from the costly licensing fees of commercial codes to free open source software. After analyzing forces, convergence history, various finite volume schemes, grid studies, and turbulence models for simple, single-phase cases, the results are used as a baseline for more complicated cases such as two-phase cavitating hemispherical headforms and NACA hydrofoils. The CFD results show good agreement with the experimental data for both single phase and cav-itating flows.

Since manual data selection is always questionable because it involves some subjective assessment of the waveform quality, a fully automated screening is used here.
