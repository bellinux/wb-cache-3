There were places he took me to--you wouldn't believe!--for often he could only have left me with servants.

The IOC Evaluating Committee favoured the location of all alpine events in one venue, Jasná, which had already hosted World Cup and several international competitions and was located 60 minutes from the Main Olympic Village. The experience of the Slovak Republic in providing high profile event security was rated as moderate, but the country itself hadn't experienced unusual security problems.

40|$|To {{understand}} the importance of Performance Management (PM) we can start from the answers to the question: What distinguishes the “best” companies from the rest? Many writers and consultants are using the term “performance management” as a substitution for the traditional appraisal system. Performance management is the process of creating a work environment or setting in which people are enabled to perform {{to the best of their}} abilities. Performance management is a whole work system that begins when a job is defined as needed and it ends when an employee leaves your organization. Within such a system, feedback to each staff member occurs regularly. Individual performance objectives are measurable and based on prioritized goals that support the accomplishment of the overall goals of the total organization. The vibrancy and performance of the organization is ensured because it focuses on developmental <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> for each staff member. performance management, organizational culture, people growth...|$|E
40|$|The Nile {{provides}} freshwater {{not only}} for domestic and industrial use, but also for irrigated agriculture, hydropower dams and the vast fisheries resource of the lakes of Central Africa. The Nile River Basin covers the whole Nile Basin {{and is based on}} the results of three major research projects supported by the Challenge Program on Water and Food (CPWF). It provides unique and up-to-date insights on agriculture, water resources, governance, poverty, productivity, upstream-downstream linkages, innovations, future plans and their implications. Specifically, the book elaborates the history and the major current and future challenges and opportunities of the Nile river basin. It analyzes the basin characteristics using statistical data and modern tools such as remote sensing and geographic information systems. Population distribution, poverty and vulnerability linked to production system and water access are assessed at the international basin scale, and the hydrology of the region is also analysed. This text provides in-depth scientific model adaptation results for hydrology, sediments, benefit sharing, and payment for environmental services based on detailed scientific and experimental work of the Blue Nile Basin. Production systems as they relate to crops, livestock, fisheries and wetlands are analyzed for the whole Blue and White Nile basin including their constraints. Policy, institutional and technological interventions that increase productivity of agriculture and use of water are also assessed. Water demand modeling, scenario analysis, and tradeoffs that inform future <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> are included to provide a unique, comprehensive coverage of the subject.

Work to date will be discussed and future <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> will be highlighted. The LMM is a microscope facility designed to allow scientists to process, manipulate, and characterize colloidal samples in micro-gravity where the absence of gravitational settling and particle jamming enables scientists to study such things as:a. The role that disordered and ordered-packing of spheres play in the phase diagram and equation of state of hard sphere systems,b. crystal nucleation and growth, growth instabilities, and the glass transition, c. gelation and phase separation of colloid polymer mixtures,d. crystallization of colloidal binary alloys,e. competition between crystallization and phase separation,f. effects of anisotropy and specific interactions on packing, aggregation, frustration and crystallization,g. effects of specific reversible and irreversible interactions mediated {{in the first case}} by hybridization of complementary DNA strands attached to separate colloidal particles,h. Lock and key interactions between colloids with dimples and spheres which match {{the size and shape of}} the dimples,i. finding the phase diagrams of isotropic and interacting particles,j. new techniques for complex self-assembly including scenarios for self-replication, k. critical Casimir forces,l. biology (real and model systems) in microgravity,m. etc. By adding additional microscopy capabilities to the existing LMM, NASA will increase the tools available for scientists that fly experiments on the ISS enabling scientists to observe directly what is happening at the particle level. Presently, theories are needed to bridge the gap between what is being observed (at a macroscopic level when photographing samples) with what is happening at a particle (or microscopic) level. What is happening at a microscopic level will be directly accessible with the availability of the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) on ISS. To meet these goals, the ACE experiment is being built-up in stages, with the availability of confocal microscopy being the ultimate objective.

In addition, the project attempted to address the lack of alignment between annual program processes and subsequent decisions made about the future of programs, particularly in profile planning processes. A revised Program Annual Report process was developed that aimed to achieve simplicity and alignment while re-engaging program leaders and heads of schools with the quality agenda. A concerted effort was made to develop a process that improved on previously poor vertical communication inherent in program quality assurance.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{entrepreneurship}} and especially during start up, much {{emphasis is placed on}} the business plan with regard to entrepreneurship education and training, funding from external investors, business <b>plan</b> competitions <b>and</b> government development agencies in the Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME) sector. In many earlier studies of well-known entrepreneurship educators, the formulation of a business plan was identified as being the most important feature of any entrepreneurship programme or course. However, the relevance of a business plan has been a topic of intense and unresolved debates in more recent literature. This paper contributes to the literature with regard to the value a business plan adds to potential entrepreneurs.  Furthermore it increases the understanding of how a detailed business plan (such as the approved business plan template of the University of Pretoria approved business plan) can enable a potential entrepreneur to assess opportunities. The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of business <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> the methods of assessing opportunities, in order to reveal similarities between the business <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> assessment. Based on descriptive statistics and inferential statistics such as ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, the findings support the hypotheses that potential entrepreneurs distinguish between ideas <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>and</b> develop <b>opportunities</b> through the formulation of a detailed business plan. The pertinent academic and practical significance of this paper is that it highlights statistically significant differences proving that a detailed business plan is a tool that enables potential entrepreneurs to assess opportunities. From a practical point of view, this should help potential entrepreneurs to establish more viable business ventures; however, this would have to be statistically tested in further research. Finally, the study re-establishes the importance and purpose of a business plan in {{the field of}} entrepreneurship...|$|R
