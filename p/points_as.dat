5|$|Elective safeties {{are more}} common in Canadian football, where they can result in better field {{position}} than a punt. The 2010 Edmonton Eskimos surrendered a Canadian Football League (CFL)-record 14 safeties, a factor that led CFL reporter Jim Mullin to suggest increasing {{the value of the}} safety touch from two to three <b>points</b> <b>as</b> a deterrent.|$|E

During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting <b>points</b> <b>as</b> low as 530°C, which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E

5|$|After {{recording}} 18 points (eight {{goals and}} ten assists) over 27 {{games with the}} Barons, Brulé was recalled by the Oilers on January 9, 2012, in lieu of injured forwards Nugent-Hopkins and Jordan Eberle. In order to join the team, however, he needed to clear re-entry waivers and he was consequently claimed by the Phoenix Coyotes the following day. Brulé debuted with the Coyotes on January 12, playing 14 minutes in a 3–2 shootout loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Two games later, he recorded his first two <b>points</b> <b>as</b> a Coyote, a goal and an assist, in a 6–1 win against the Colorado Avalanche.|$|E
5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{forced a}} punt {{on the first}} Razorback {{possession}} of the second quarter, Drake extended the Alabama lead to 21–0 with his 46-yard touchdown run. Arkansas responded on their next possession with their longest drive of the game. However, {{they were unable to}} score any <b>points</b> <b>as</b> Deion Belue blocked a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal that preserved the shutout. On the next possession, Alabama closed the first half with a 30-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Amari Cooper that made the halftime score 28–0.|$|E

5|$|Bolton were relegated on goal {{difference}} {{at the end}} of the 1997–98 Premiership campaign. They finished on the same number of <b>points</b> <b>as</b> Everton, whom they faced in the first competitive match at the newly built Reebok Stadium. The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour would have kept them up. The following season they reached the 1999 Division One play-off Final but lost 2–0 to Watford.|$|E

5|$|Drafted 134th {{overall in}} the 2004 WHL Bantam Draft, Blum played his first season with the Vancouver Giants of the WHL in 2005–06, {{recording}} 24 <b>points</b> <b>as</b> a rookie. He added 8 points in the post-season, helping the Giants to a President's Cup as WHL champions and a berth in the 2006 Memorial Cup in Moncton, where they finished third. The following season, in 2006–07, Blum improved to 51 <b>points</b> <b>as</b> the Giants prepared to defend their WHL title as 2007 Memorial Cup hosts. With a league-high +37 plus-minus, he earned the WHL Plus-Minus Award. Blum also participated in the CHL Top Prospects Game along with teammates Tyson Sexsmith, Michal Repik and Spencer Machacek. The Giants met the Medicine Hat Tigers in the WHL finals, where they were defeated in seven games. Then, facing the Tigers in the Memorial Cup final Blum and the Giants captured the franchise's first Canadian Hockey League (CHL) title by a 3–1 score. That off-season, going into the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, Blum was ranked 17th among North American skaters by NHL Central Scouting. He would be selected 23rd overall by the Nashville Predators, becoming the first California-born-and-raised player to be drafted in the first round.|$|E

5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of <b>points</b> <b>as</b> input, and create a hierarchy of clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
