5|$|Yojimbo (The Bodyguard), Kurosawa Production's second film, {{centers on}} a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two {{opposing}} violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the Western, {{while at the same}} time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring Tatsuya Nakadai in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative <b>photography</b> <b>by</b> Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot Rashomon) and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its blackly comic tone were also widely imitated abroad. Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawa's behalf and prevailing.|$|E

25|$|By the 1830s the Westminster {{system of}} {{government}} (or cabinet government) had emerged; the Prime Minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet {{and the head of}} government in the United Kingdom. The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication (inexpensive newspapers, radio, television and the internet), and <b>photography.</b> <b>By</b> the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-à-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet.|$|E
