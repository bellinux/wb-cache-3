5|$|In basketball, {{points are}} {{accumulated}} through free throws or field goals. The National Basketball Association's (NBA) scoring title is {{awarded to the}} <b>player</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest points per game average in a given season. The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1968–69 season, after which points per game {{was used to determine}} the leader instead. Players who earned scoring titles before the 1979–80 season did not record any two point field goals because the three-point line was first implemented in the NBA during that season. To qualify for the scoring title, the player must appear in at least 70games (out of 82) or have at least 1,400points. These have been the entry criteria since the 1974–75 season.|$|E
