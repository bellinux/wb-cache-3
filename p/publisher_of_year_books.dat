50|$|In 1968, his {{edition of}} Red Shadows by Howard {{featuring}} color plates by Jeff Jones sold out {{so quickly that}} Grant was forced to print a second edition. It was a turning point. Howard was beginning to sell in hardcover as the Conan books became bestsellers in paperback and comic book form. More importantly, Grant {{saw that there was}} a market for attractively done books, even at higher prices. Fans had become disenchanted with cheaply produced and poorly packaged hardcovers as issued by the major <b>publishers.</b> After <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> without illustrations, done on the cheapest pulp paper available, science fiction collectors were looking for something better. grant recognised this desire and offered books with interior illustrations, some even featuring tipped-in color plates, as well as good bindings and fine paper. It was the start of a trend.|$|R
