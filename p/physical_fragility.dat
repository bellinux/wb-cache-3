Many routing protocols take single-node failure recovery into account, but it is difficult for these protocols to recover the routing after large-scale failures. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol, referred to as ARF (Adaptive routing protocol for fast Recovery from large-scale Failure), to recover a network quickly after failures over large areas. ARF detects failures by counting the packet losses from parent nodes, and upon failure detection, it decreases the routing interval to notify the neighbor nodes of the failure. Our experimental results indicate that ARF could provide recovery from large-area failures quickly with less packets and energy consumption than previous protocols...|$|E

40|$|The {{hill and}} {{mountain}} landscape of western Ireland {{is an area}} of high scenic value as well as contributing to the livelihood of local farmers mainly through extensive grazing. Measures that were intended to support lamb prices led to increased ewe numbers. Public concern attributed this increase to an apparent deterioration in the status of the semi-natural vegetation and to an increase in the rate of soil erosion. In the absence of an existing databank, Teagasc undertook a research programme to quantify the impact of hill sheep on the semi-natural vegetation, the progress of soil erosion and changes in certain weather elements e. g. ‘driving rain’. A detailed database of the physical background (physiography and soils) of the Teagasc hill sheep farm, Leenaun, was compiled {{on the basis of a}} grid, 100 m x 100 m. Changes in the frequency of vegetation on the unimproved hill were monitored, 1995 - 2002, by point quadrat. Ten permanent exclosures representing the main vegetation types and a controlled grazing experiment on the upper steep slope were established. Sequential aerial photography (1973 / 7 - 1996 / 8) for selected sites in western counties and wind and rain data (1957 - 2000) for five western synoptic stations were obtained. The classification of the peatland and heathland habitats was considered. Analysis of data highlighted a range of issues among which were the <b>physical</b> complexity and <b>fragility</b> of the landscape, the sustainability of the hill sheep system on the Teagasc hill sheep farm, the beneficial effects of controlled grazing, the progressive erosion of hill soils and an increase in high intensity levels of ‘driving rain’.

This necessitates research {{on the use of}} organic wastes that are cheap, readily available and environmentally friendly as fertilizers. One of the ways of improving soil fertility is by maintaining its organic matter. This is possible through the use of organic sources of fertilizer. Research has shown that organic based fertilizers are less leached into ground water than the chemical fertilizer (Sridhar and Adeoye 2003). Organomineral fertilizer appears to be reliable organic source of nitrogen needed for growing watermelon. Organomineral fertilizer is a low-input technology of improving the nutrient status of tropical soils for sustainable crop production. They combine the attributes of both organic and inorganic fertilizers (Ayeni 2008). Studies by Adeoye et al. (2008); Fagbola and Ogungbe (2007); Ojeniyi et al.

The design combined elements of reversal and changing criterion designs for all three infants. The package was applied across feeding devices (nipple, cup, spoon), situations (liquid, pureed foods), and persons (trainer, primary nurses, mothers). The number of swallows or ounces per feeding (from 0 to 8 ounces) {{and the number of}} feeding sessions per day (from one to five) were progressively increased.

Preservation at home clearly appears as a real challenge of public health. The adaptation of housing constitutes an actual opportunity for the help to the preservation at home. The aging is accompanied by the appearance of gradual <b>physical</b> and psychological <b>fragilities.</b> The objective of our study has been to identify the physical and mental specificities of the elderly to take into account for an adequate adaptation of the housing environment. Declining abilities with age may be severe handicaps. The main options available to recover the person's living initial conditions focus on the development of suitable prostheses and several adaptations of home or furniture equipments. For the elderly people, the functional abilities reduction concerns mainly the sensory capabilities, the capacity of thermoregulation, the motor capabilities with a high risk of falling, the capacity of arousal and alertness. In our study, all these capabilities are taken into account in detail to derive specific and useful parameters to be applied for home environment adaptation.

Using a multi-method system, the investigation starts by defining the theoretical basis of the subject, which is divided into conceptual, institutional and legislative modules. Following {{a detailed description of the}} methodological structure, the study areas are characterized and the changes in their physical, biological and anthropic components, in the period between 2000 and 2012, are interpreted. Next, the environmental vulnerability of the study areas is assessed based on an analysis of <b>physical</b> susceptibility, biological <b>fragility</b> and anthropic pressure as well as an interpretation of the connectivity networks among forest fragments. With a view to improving the basis for planning and management of conservation units within the urban management process, the compatibility between the results obtained and the proposed zoning for the protected areas studied is analyzed. The main findings are that, at the regional level, environmental vulnerability in both conservation units is homogeneously distributed among the classes. In the surrounding areas, low levels of physical susceptibility and biological fragility are identified, associated to high levels of anthropic pressure, resulting in reduced vulnerability. The specific areas, in each protected area, have high physical susceptibility. However, reduced biological fragility and higher anthropic pressure are observed in Iguaçu Environmental Protection Area, resulting in lower vulnerability than in Po Fluvial Park. It could be inferred, from the comparative analysis of the proposed zoning, the data on environmental vulnerability and the shape of the connectivity networks, that the conditions of Po Fluvial Park are more coherent. In the Brazilian case, inconsistencies in the Service Sector are observed, as a result of the high percentage of areas with high vulnerability and connectivity. Of note is the absence of any areas with these characteristics in the Transition and Sports Sectors. Interpretation of the changes in the landscape that took place between the years 2000 and 2012 indicates greater stability in the case of the Italian park. More significant changes are observed in the Transition and Services Sectors of Iguaçu Environmental Protection Area, reflecting deficiencies in the management of these spaces. Therefore, the hypothesis that abiotic, biotic and human conditions are essential for the protection of the conservation units is confirmed. Furthermore, it is concluded that assessment of environmental vulnerability and connectivity networks are effective tools to support decision making, both inside protected areas as well as in the surrounding areas with a view to conserving biological diversity and protecting natural landscapes in the urban environmen...|$|R

Not all playspaces are the same however. Adventure playgrounds can be sites that operate from different aesthetics, architectures and pedagogic agendas.

H 577 P LMS 2017 Hexviii, 149 pages :illustrationsEmerging and re-emerging {{epidemic}} diseases pose an on-going {{threat to}} global public health security. Recent examples of epidemics, including {{the outbreak of}} Ebola virus disease, cholera and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused physical and psychological pain of millions of people. Epidemic outbreaks are also very common {{in the aftermath of}} natural disasters and bioterrorist actions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 's Twelfth General Programme of Work, the improvement of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery activities is set as one of the WHO's five strategic imperatives. In response to a large-scale epidemic, satisfying medical needs is crucial to the success of humanitarian-oriented operations and management. However, it differs from the general business logistics problems in many ways. This research underscores the importance of humanitarian medical allocation, and aims to explore a novel approach for improving humanitarian allocation of medical reliefs for response to unconventional large-scale epidemics, and draw managerial insights for health care practice. Several methods are adopted, including stochastic dynamic programming, linear programming, epidemic diffusion models and game theory. This inter-disciplinary research would contribute to the decision analysis of humanitarian medical allocation. Specifically, three sub-topics are conducted focusing on humanitarian medical allocation in one area, allocation in multiple areas and allocation with cross-sector cooperation, respectively. (1) In the sub-research of humanitarian medical allocation in one area, this research proposes a model of time-varying allocation of emergency medical relief for response to large-scale epidemics. Based on the trend of epidemic disease spreading, a stochastic dynamic programming model is developed to optimize the temporal allocation policy of emergency medical relief in each time period. This new formulation is closer to the real logistics practice during epidemic outbreaks than the traditional ones. Additionally, this research obtains a general form of the optimal medical allocation decision in each time period and further develops a case study based on real data to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. According to the above analytical and numerical studies, some properties are provided and their implementations for policy makers are discussed. (2) In the sub-research of humanitarian medical allocation in multiple areas, we present a novel model of emergency medical logistics for quick response to public health emergencies. The proposed methodology consists of two recursive mechanisms: (i) the time-varying forecasting of medical relief demand and (ii) relief distribution. The medical demand associated with each epidemic area is forecast according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. A linear programming approach is then applied to facilitate distribution decision-making. Both the physical and psychological situations of those affected are considered. The modified SEIR model contributes to forecasting by considering not only physical factors, such as the differences in the infection conditions of survivors and the spatial interaction relationships among epidemic areas, but also the psychological demand of exposed and undiagnosed individuals. In the distribution model, psychological fragility is formulated and discussed in detail, unlike previous studies. The relationship between emergency medical logistics and the psychological effects on affected people is highlighted as well. Numerical studies are conducted. Results show that the consideration of survivor psychology significantly reduces the psychological fragility of affected people, but it barely influences <b>physical</b> <b>fragility.</b> (3) Typically, humanitarian logistics engages a large number and variety of sectors, including central governments, local governments, the military, international organizations and private companies. Modern information technologies provide potential opportunities to share information among different sectors, and to work together to pursue effective and efficient relief operations. However, each of these sectors may have different missions and capacities. In this sub-research of cross-sector cooperation in allocation, a series of cross-sector decision models are developed to discuss different types of cooperation and information sharing between public and private sectors. The basic model, which consists of a public sector (usually the government) and a private sector, is formulated to obtain the optimal decisions of the two sectors. Then this research presents three more cooperation mechanisms: semi-cooperation with a private leader, semi-cooperation with a government leader, and full cooperation. The optimal solutions of these four models are provided and compared. By solving and comparing their optimal solutions, this sub-research makes the first step to understand the differences among these four mechanisms. The results illustrate that full cooperation is not always the best choice, while semi-cooperation with information sharing would also achieve potential advantages, even if two sectors made their own decisions separately.
