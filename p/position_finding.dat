25|$|In {{his prime}} Simpson {{was known for}} his {{technical}} correctness. At slightly below average height, his noted ability to bat for long periods was attributed to his high fitness and concentration levels. He had a wide array of shots, in particular off the back foot. Along with Bill Lawry, he formed an opening partnership that was {{regarded as one of the}} finest in Test history. Simpson was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Simpson's stance was easy and his style attractive, the result of a change of technique in the late 1950s when he turned from playing too square-on to side-on. Simpson found that it made all the difference to him in dealing effectively with the in-dipper and going-away balls. Standing 179cm and 13stone, Simpson was most effective as an attacking batsman. Simpson was best known for his straight-drive and powerfully hit square-cut, as well as an on-drive taken from his toes. He rarely played the hook shot, regarding it as risky, and used the pull shot in moderation. Early in his career, Simpson had a square-on stance but converted to a more side on <b>position,</b> <b>finding</b> it easier to deal with swing bowling.|$|E

Analysis of 55 organizations from two networks supports the role of  network motive congruence for internally oriented motives, such as concerning economies of scales and joint research and development motives. However, motive congruence appears not as important in matters of externally oriented motives, such as entering new markets or sustaining existing market <b>positions.</b> <b>Findings</b> indicate that entrepreneurial orientation can moderate the relationship between network motive congruence and networking performance.
