5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used the <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability {{could be used}} if the spoofer knew the <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> registered to their victim's account. Within {{a few weeks of}} this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E

5|$|Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{had become}} {{suspicious}} {{as to whether}} Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent text messages to a <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that {{the owner of the}} <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.|$|E

During the torture with Le Chiffre, Vesper made a deal: the money in exchange for Bond's life. Bond discovers a text message left for him by Vesper with White's name and <b>phone</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1995, a 60th Anniversary edition was {{released}} in a gold box. In late 1998, Hasbro announced a campaign to add an all-new token to U.S. standard edition sets of Monopoly. Voters were allowed to select from a biplane, a piggy bank, and a sack of money — with votes being tallied through a special website, via a toll-free <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> and at FAO Schwarz stores.|$|E
30|$|Some scam campaigns still lack {{organization}} {{and do not}} always exhibit very clearly separated patterns, as illustrated by two campaigns depicted in Figures 8 c and 8 d. Both seem to use fewer email addresses but many different <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> are changing over time. The first one is an international campaign that started with Chinese <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> (top-left part), then moved to UK-based anonymous proxy numbers (top-right part), and ended with Dutch-based <b>phone</b> <b>numbers.</b> Almost all analyzed features changed over time, except a single from address. Interestingly, most of the <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> were regularly switched over time.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> {{in the rest of}} the country, as <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> outside Pyongyang and Rason are not able to be dialled from {{overseas}} and are hence not advertised in any overseas publications.|$|R
50|$|The Brazilian {{telephone}} {{numbering plan}} uses a two-digit area code plus eight-digit local <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> for landlines and nine digits for mobile lines. Public utility services use short <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> (usually three digits), always starting with 1.|$|R
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) has one task: sign routine documents. Unfortunately, it's a month {{where three}} {{separate}} sets of paperwork are due {{at the same}} time, so Michael mulishly ignores his workload. To procrastinate, Michael makes Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) update emergency contact information of the staff. When Michael gets Ryan's cell <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> he constantly prank calls Ryan with crude impersonations of Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson, and Saddam Hussein.|$|E
5|$|News anchor Brian Williams, of NBC Nightly News, guest-starred {{as himself}} in this episode. In a scene with Tracy and Jack at a club, Tracy reveals to Jack {{that he has}} been giving out his <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> to {{different}} women, though it is not his real number, which results in Williams receiving the calls.|$|E
5|$|On November 24, 2014, Anonymous {{shut down}} the Cleveland city website and posted a video after Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old boy armed only with a BB gun, {{was shot to death}} by a police officer in a Cleveland park. Anonymous also used BeenVerified to uncover <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> and address of a {{policeman}} involved in the shooting.|$|E

40|$|Internet and {{telephones}} {{are part}} of everyone’s modern life. Unfortunately, also several criminal activities rely on these technologies to reach their victims. While the use and importance of the network has been largely studied, previous work overlooked the role that <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> can play into understanding online threats. In this work we aim at determining if leveraging <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> analysis can improve {{our understanding of the}} underground markets, illegal computer activities, or cyber-crime in general. This knowledge could then be adopted by several defensive mechanisms, including blacklists or advanced spam heuristics. In our study we collected <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> from various public or private sources and we designed a framework for mining, analyzing, enriching and, finally, correlating <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> to malicious activities. Our results show that, in scam activities, <b>phones</b> <b>numbers</b> remain often more stable over time than email addresses. Finally, using a combination o...|$|R

5|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. The {{remaining}} members then {{spent the next}} few months looking for another drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band Good Riddance found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> to Principe, and after listening to Transistor Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the airport}} bar, Brian gets very drunk and, when Stewie comes to {{retrieve}} him, their plane tickets are stolen. They {{stop at a}} rundown motel, where Stewie tries calling home, but fails because he believes his <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> is 867-5309. The next day, they have to escape and hotwire a car because their credit card was rejected. To get home, Stewie and Brian masquerade as crop dusters to steal a plane, which they immediately destroy.|$|E
5|$|Berry {{first saw}} {{baseball}} player David Justice on TV playing in an MTV celebrity baseball game in February 1992. When {{a reporter from}} Justice's hometown of Cincinnati told her that Justice was a fan, Berry gave her <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> to the reporter to give to Justice. Berry married Justice shortly after midnight on January 1, 1993. Following their separation in February 1996, Berry stated publicly {{that she was so}} depressed that she considered taking her own life. Berry and Justice were officially divorced on June 24, 1997.|$|E
5000|$|Three <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> were {{provided}} as standard. Two for the analogue ports {{and one for}} use by ISDN equipment.

50|$|The {{model number}} {{indicated}} the maximum <b>number</b> of <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> {{that could be}} downloaded to the watch. For example, the model 150 could store a maximum of 150 <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> if nothing else was stored. Available storage was shared by <b>phone</b> <b>numbers,</b> appointments, anniversaries, lists, wristapps and watch sounds. These models lacked timers or chronographs, but a simple chronograph could be added as an external application {{also known as a}} wristapp. The wristapps also included a notepad capable of storing forty words.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{operators}} {{may also}} charge more for {{calls to the}} islands and these calls are usually excluded from calling plans.

5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien had to take his <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Due to an error, the <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> that was printed {{was that of}} the Continental Air Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 2011, The Guardian {{reported}} that Mills {{had met with}} officers from the London Metropolitan Police who showed her evidence, seized from private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, which could {{form the basis of}} a claim against the News of the World for breach of privacy over alleged phone hacking. Mills's name and private mobile <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> were listed in Mulcaire's notes along with those of her friends and associates. Mills later alleged that a journalist working for the Mirror Group had admitted to her in 2001 that he had hacked her phone.|$|E

5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
