5|$|Clash {{has stated}} that {{although}} children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo, African-American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him. He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was <b>pertinent</b> to his work, and that it came through in his performances.|$|E
5|$|One major {{limitation}} to {{a forensic}} investigation {{is the use}} of encryption; this disrupts initial examination where <b>pertinent</b> evidence might be located using keywords. Laws to compel individuals to disclose encryption keys are still relatively new and controversial.|$|E
5|$|The Expert Group of the World Health Organization {{considered}} {{developmental toxicity}} {{as the most}} <b>pertinent</b> risk of dioxins to human beings. Because people are usually exposed simultaneously {{to a number of}} dioxin-like chemicals, a more detailed account is given at dioxins and dioxin-like compounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Espanyol {{started a}} counter-petition against autonomy, which {{at that time}} had become a <b>pertinent</b> issue. Later on, an Espanyol {{supporter}} group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.|$|E
5|$|In late 1994, {{following}} the 1994 Congressional elections which switched Congress from Democratic to Republican control, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania Republican William Clinger, launched {{an investigation into}} the White House Travel Office firings. In October 1995, the committee began hearings on the matter; Clinger soon accused the White House of withholding <b>pertinent</b> documents and sought subpoenas to compel witnesses to appear.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels are}} {{displayed}} in an overworld with a branching, tree structure. The player must pursue multiple branches to further the story. Optional, side-story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles. The story is told through chains of emails, which are unlocked by completing puzzles. The player assumes {{the role of an}} American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked emails are <b>pertinent</b> to national security. The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is <b>pertinent</b> to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{only two}} Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the Saint Louis des Français church for the French {{population}} and the St. Peter and Paul church for the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the existing buildings were too small. Following the submission of a petition to the Governor-General of Moscow, the local council voted for a new church in 1894. Construction of a new church was permitted with several conditions, including two <b>pertinent</b> to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and was not to be located in the vicinity of any Orthodox sacred sites.|$|E
5|$|Baldorioty de Castro {{proposed}} that geometry classes {{be included in}} the curriculum of elementary schools in Puerto Rico, which was accepted by the <b>pertinent</b> authority. On January 2, 1858, the Economic Society unanimously named him the Secretary of the Studies Commission. On June 4, 1860, the organization named him spokesman of a commission to promote conservation of the island's natural resources. Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, serving for five years until 1865. On September 17, 1864, he was certified as an applied mechanics professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five dollars a month.|$|E
5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as <b>pertinent</b> or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{recruited}} John Jay and James Madison {{to write}} a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as The Federalist Papers, and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five). Hamilton supervised the entire project, enlisted the participants, wrote {{the majority of the}} essays, and oversaw the publication. During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise. Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most <b>pertinent</b> to him: the executive and judicial branches, with some aspects of the Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation The papers first appeared in The Independent Journal on October 27, 1787.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly <b>pertinent</b> where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with <b>pertinent</b> information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Oliver North and John Poindexter {{were indicted}} on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, {{was found guilty}} by a jury of three felony counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents <b>pertinent</b> to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran–Contra Scandal.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most <b>pertinent</b> questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|Subject matter. First, the {{justiciability}} of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of decision-making power. This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all <b>pertinent</b> facts might be presented before the court.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish janissaries {{military}} corps {{had included}} since the 14th century bands called mehter or mehterân which, {{like many other}} earlier military bands in Asia featured {{a high proportion of}} drums, cymbals, and gongs, along with trumpets and shawms. The high level of noise was <b>pertinent</b> to their function of playing on the battlefield to inspire the soldiers. The focus in these bands was on percussion. A full mehterân could include several bass drums, multiple pairs of cymbals, small kettledrums, triangles, tambourines, and one or more Turkish crescents.|$|E
5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid <b>pertinent</b> documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E
5|$|Wacław Jędrzejewicz, in Piłsudski: A Life for Poland, {{describes}} Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected {{all available}} <b>pertinent</b> information, then {{took his time}} weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and all night. He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant. Though Piłsudski was popular {{with much of the}} Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), as a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.|$|E

25|$|The Nixon {{administration}} {{struggled to}} decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all <b>pertinent</b> information should be released. Whether to release unedited profanity and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary Ron Ziegler preferred using an edited version where “expletive deleted” would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced {{the release of the}} transcripts {{in a speech to the}} nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio <b>pertinent</b> to national security information could be redacted from the released tapes.|$|E

25|$|After a 60 Minutes/Washington Post {{investigation}} in November 2007, two years later, the Bureau agreed to identify, review, and release all <b>pertinent</b> cases, and notify prosecutors about {{cases in which}} faulty testimony was given.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{proceeded}} {{to consider whether}} Vellama still retained standing given that the Hougang by-election had already been held— a <b>pertinent</b> change in circumstances that affected the very basis of her application.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a {{continuance}} may {{be granted}} {{in a criminal}} case if there is good reason documents <b>pertinent</b> to the case could not be produced at the time of trial. For example, a continuance should be granted for failure to produce a transcript of testimony given at a previous trial. In general, it is reversible error to proceed with a criminal trial {{in the absence of a}} previous trial transcript, when such contains <b>pertinent</b> information that should have been considered in the new trial. In these cases, a continuance is the usual remedy. The trial judge or magistrate is the one who issues the continuance.|$|E
25|$|In {{positive}} inducible operons, activator proteins {{are normally}} unable to bind to the <b>pertinent</b> DNA. When an inducer is {{bound by the}} activator protein, it undergoes a change in conformation {{so that it can}} bind to the DNA and activate transcription.|$|E
25|$|In {{positive}} repressible operons, the activator proteins {{are normally}} {{bound to the}} <b>pertinent</b> DNA segment. However, when an inhibitor is bound by the activator, it is prevented from binding the DNA. This stops activation and transcription of the system.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Clinic {{discovered}} it had mistakenly overcharged funders for laboratory expenses. After {{an internal investigation}} confirmed the error, WWC immediately stopped billing for these services and notified all <b>pertinent</b> funders. This change further impacted revenue.|$|E
