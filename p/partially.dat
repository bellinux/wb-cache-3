5|$|The Federal Statistical Office classifies the {{citizens}} by immigrant background. Regarding the immigrant background, 22.5% of the country's residents, {{or more than}} 18.6 million people, were of immigrant or <b>partially</b> immigrant descent in 2016 (including persons descending or <b>partially</b> descending from ethnic German repatriates).

5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only <b>partially</b> preserved, {{and the fact that the}} vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a <b>partially</b> grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E
5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is <b>partially</b> double-stranded and <b>partially</b> single-stranded.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Norway {{entered a}} {{cooperation}} with the United States, {{which resulted in the}} construction of the Norwegian Space Centre at Andøya. In 1964, ESRO was established as a Western European reaction to the rapidly developing Soviet and American space programs. Norway chose to only join as an observer, <b>partially</b> because of the close {{cooperation with the}} US and <b>partially</b> because of the cost. However, Norwegian space research scientists participated in ESRO programs.|$|E

Empty bottles of the {{prescription}} drug Carisoprodol and a <b>partially</b> consumed bottle of alcohol were found nearby. He had recently received divorce papers from his wife. His death, caused by choking on his own vomit, was officially ruled a suicide. He was buried in China Grove in Rowan County, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma {{is placed}} in the South by the United States Census Bureau, but lies fully or <b>partially</b> in the Midwest, Southwest, and Southern {{cultural}} regions by varying definitions, and <b>partially</b> in the Upland South and Great Plains by definitions of abstract geographical-cultural regions. Oklahomans have a high rate of English, Scotch-Irish, German, and Native American ancestry, with 25 different native languages spoken.|$|E
5|$|Plasma and ionised gases have unique {{properties}} and display behaviors unlike {{those of the}} other states, and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation. Based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density, <b>partially</b> ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of <b>partially</b> ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>partially</b> competitive inhibition {{is similar to}} that of non-competitive, except that the EIS complex has catalytic activity, which may be lower or even higher (<b>partially</b> competitive activation) than that of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex. This inhibition typically displays a lower Vmax, but an unaffected Km value.|$|E
5|$|The poem is {{referenced}} and <b>partially</b> recited in the BBC {{television series}} 'The Ascent of Man'.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} <b>partially</b> {{canceled}} {{due to a}} player's strike that closed the MLB for 223 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{tomb of the}} princess: {{dating to}} c. 1800 BC, it is the oldest and {{smallest}} of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained {{the remains of a}} young woman, hence the naming. The dormos has steps, <b>partially</b> cut in the bedrock and <b>partially</b> paved with stones, leading to the chamber, which was achieved through the enlargement of a natural cave. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{activity}} is determined <b>partially</b> by genetic factors. Polymorphisms in two genes (VKORC1 and CYP2C9) play a particularly {{large role in}} response to warfarin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact {{stipulated that}} any country, with the {{exception}} of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, <b>partially</b> to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, <b>partially</b> to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{compound}} {{leaves of}} flowering plants are <b>partially</b> homologous both to leaves and shoots, because their development {{has evolved from}} a genetic mosaic of leaf and shoot development.|$|E
5|$|Diverging {{winds aloft}} ahead of these troughs cause {{atmospheric}} lift within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion <b>partially</b> counteracts {{the force of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the <b>partially</b> gravel {{surfaced}} highway {{was designated}} as the Chapleau Route of the Trans-Canada Highway, despite being only a spur in the network at that time.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, however, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of interest in World War I memorials. This was driven <b>partially</b> by a sequence of academic works on {{the social and cultural}} character of the conflict, aided by a sequence of artistic exhibits of some of more famous designers in the 1980s, and <b>partially</b> by generational change in many countries. As the generation who had lived and fought during the war died off, explaining the context of the memorials became more important. In France, veteran groups had begun to build memorial museums alongside the major monuments and battlefields from the late 1930s onwards.|$|E
