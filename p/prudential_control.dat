40|$|Abstract—Period {{that has}} led to the latest crisis has {{unequivocally}} shown that global financial market has managed risks in an inadequate way and that capital was allocated wrongly which has led to big disturbances in all markets. Extremely high financial leverage in case of financial intermediaries was a result of their significant dealing with the activity of investment banking, business that was prohibited for banks during the big global crisis. Starting from that fact, in this paper it is pointed to the role of Central Bank in the preservation of financial stability, protection against the existing, as well as the future, potential, global economicfinancial crisis. In recent years, in leading economic policies the attitude that low and stable inflation is necessary and almost sufficient condition for financial stability and economic growth is prevailing. This attitude has essentially influenced the role of Central Bank in leading monetary policy. In the creation of the new financial and monetary system, Central Bank has a key role in preservation of financial stability, particularly from the aspect of applying <b>prudential</b> <b>control,</b> regulation and supervision of banks. Efficient struggle against global financial crises requires harmonization of goals and control over various instruments and close cooperation between Central Banks within <b>prudential</b> <b>control</b> and supervision of banks, not only in national, but also in global plan.

As Tobin (1996) observed “The interest that occasionally arose (for his transactions tax proposal) came from journalists and financial pundits.

The primary objective for supervision and regulation in industrial countries remains the maintenance of financial stability.

This article draws together insights from economic sociology, history and democratic theory to engage in further discussion about the proper role of central banks in democratic society. We stress some related themes. Our brief history of central banks aims to show how these banks have always been embedded in economic and political coalitions and conflicts, therefore qualifying the term independence; our study also aims to show that in satisficing between conflicting tasks, central banks need to maintain a balance between cognitive competences and normative expectations. Independence is better understood as a form of dependence on the coalition of interests that supported the financial climate prevailing before the global crisis of 2008, one of low wage-price inflation, high borrowing and debt, and loss of <b>prudential</b> <b>control.</b> We argue that independence amounts to a form of re-privatisation of central banks, and that they are increasingly suborned to the pressures of financial markets. At the same time, asset price inflation has sacrificed growth and employment and therefore prolongs the crisis.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of Basel II as a regulatory framework in the Australian context of banking reform. More specifically, the thesis draws {{on a range of}} economic theories to establish a distinction between risk and uncertainty, explain both the causes and consequences of financial instability, and investigate the structure of, and policy responses to major financial crises. In this context, the thesis investigates the congruence between Basel II framework and the attributes of Responsive and Smart Regulation. While the thesis argues that Basel II can be regarded as a good example of 'smart' regulation, it highlights areas of weakness and potential danger. In particular, it raises concerns about procedures of risk-management that are based on internal modelling using the Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach, as required under Basel II. It examines ways in which techniques of quantitative analysis can be enhanced to accommodate uncertainty through the use of robust techniques that account for time-varying uncertainty premia. However, within an environment characterised by increasing financial instability, the parameters that determine deep structures of self-similarity in the stochastic processes of different assets, will themselves be shifting so that the relevant asymptotic densities become more fat-tailed and negatively skewed. This thesis applies the Universal Pragmatics methodology developed by Jurgen Habermas for interpreting both relevant documents and the responses of interviewees. The validity claims highlighted in Habermasian discourse analysis are adopted as benchmark for normative evaluations of interviewee responses. This methodology is applied to transcripts of semi-structured interviews that have been designed to extract relevant information from both risk managers in the banking sector and supervisors from the regulatory authorities in Australia. The research findings arising from an analysis of interviews show the superiority of Basel II in contrast to Basel I, and also supports the determination of those aspects of Basel II that are more or less effective. This process highlights a range of problematic issues arising from Basel II, in regard to risk management and supervisory practices, which need to be addressed by policy-makers, supervisors, and bank practitioners in the future. In particular, the thesis concludes that a more effective <b>prudential</b> <b>control</b> of the entire financial market and an improved system of corporate governance in the banking sector, are important complements to Basel II for the purpose of stabilising financial markets and obtaining sustainable economic growth in the Australian economy. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{economic}} history of the prudential regulation of banks in Australia between the crash of 1893 and the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008. It applies two theoretical frameworks in order to characterise the institutions of prudential regulation and identify the sources of regulatory change over the period studied. The institutional possibility frontier is used to characterise regulatory regimes. Three common models of political economy &ndash; public interest, public choice, and ideas &ndash; are used to identify the causes of changes in those regimes. The thesis uses unexamined and underused archival sources to refine and expand our understanding of regulatory change in the period studied. As policymakers {{in the wake of}} the GFC conceive of new approaches to prudential regulation of banks, it is important to understand where and how prudential regulation has been adopted in the past. Yet no general study of the history of prudential regulation of banks in Australia exists. This thesis is an attempt to provide that study. Prudential regulation in the period covered has swung between extremes: first, from a laissez faire approach to regulatory control, where regulation was both light and poorly administered, to a system of financial repression, where prudential regulation was both heavy and thorough. As the Australian financial market has been opened to foreign entrants and global competition since the 1980 s, prudential regulation has been expanded, formalised, and internationalised. Prudential regulation of banking offers a window into broader changes in the way Australian governments have controlled economic activity. The thesis makes a number of significant contributions to knowledge. First, it finds that, contrary to later claims by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Curtin government established a bank deposit guarantee in 1945, and was understood to have done so by the parliament and the Commonwealth Bank, which was to administer the guarantee. Second, it offers a new history of the origins of the deregulation movement in Australia, by situating the Fraser government&rsquo;s 1979 Campbell committee inquiry into financial regulation in the context of a building society crisis and a contest between two visions of Australia&rsquo;s economic future. Third, it offers the first account of Australia&rsquo;s rapid adoption of the international Basel Capital Accords in 1988. Fourth, it provides a new interpretation of the development of prudential regulation after the introduction of foreign banks in 1985, which helps identifies the ideological drivers and economic pressures that led to the (re) creation in 2008 of the Australian bank deposit guarantee scheme by the Rudd government. The thesis also develops a new theoretical approach to analysing changes in political economy. The &lsquo;subjective political economy&rsquo; framework aims to integrate diverse ideological viewpoints and motivations into an institutional model of regulatory control. By characterising institutional choices as a trade-off between subjective costs, the thesis shows how changing ideas about the purposes, possibilities, and risks of <b>prudential</b> <b>control</b> drove regulatory changes. Furthermore, the framework provides a way to understand institutional innovation as changing perceived costs places pressure on the institutional choices available. The thesis finds that the history of prudential regulation of banking in Australia was driven by changing perceptions of the relationship between the state and the economy and the responsibilities of governments to bank depositors. Australians have long seen the relationship between banking and the state as a window to understand political economy more generally. By bringing the Basel adoption and prudential regulatory changes to the front of any account of the period of financial regulatory reform, we can see how the reform movement of the 1980 s was characterised less by &lsquo;deregulation&rsquo; and more by regulatory evolution and expansion. A reassessment of the changes in prudential regulation since the crisis of 1893 should inform our understanding of the trajectories and development of Australia&rsquo;s regulatory state...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the new economics of <b>prudential</b> capital <b>controls</b> in emerging economies. This literature is based on the notion that there are externalities associated with financial crises because individual market participants do not internalize their contribution to aggregate financial instability. We describe financial crises as situations in which an emerging economy loses access to international financial markets and experiences a feedback loop in which declining aggregate demand, falling exchange rates and asset prices, and deteriorating balance sheets mutually reinforce each other—a common phenomenon in recent emerging market crises. Individual market participants take aggregate prices and financial conditions as given and do not internalize their contribution to financial instability when they choose their actions. As a result they impose externalities in the form of greater financial instability on each other, and the private financing decisions of individuals are distorted toward excessive risk-taking. <b>Prudential</b> capital <b>controls</b> can induce private agents to internalize their externalities and thereby increase macroeconomic stability and enhance welfare. ...|$|R

This paper argues that the origins of the current crisis can be found in two interrelated elements that have been operating since the decade of the seventies: the financial liberalization policies implemented in developed and developing economies, and the economic policy based on the new consensus in macroeconomics. This new macroeconomic policy was focused on the monetary policy, with the downgrading of fiscal policy, and in the use as a main instrument of the continuous changes in the interest rates in order to control inflation rates. As a result, a huge and unprecedented liquidity and household borrowing has been generated in the main world economies, mainly in the USA and the United Kingdom, that is in the origin on the current crisis. financial liberalisation, crisis, economic growth. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{economic}} {{functions of}} the insurance sector are to cover financial risk and to mobilize long-term savings. The sector can also {{play an important role}} in developing the private sector and modernizing the securities market. But to play its economic and financial roles, the insurance sector must operate within a framework of stable, liberal regulation that provides incentives for efficiency, allows companies to innovate, and creates a contestable market with relatively free entry and exit. In most developing countries, regulation has deviated greatly from this ideal. Often dominated by state-owned companies, the insurance industry in many developing countries features: (a) strict controls on new entry; (b) prohibitions against majority ownership by foreign companies; (c) fixed premiums (especially for compulsory lines); (d) prior approval of tariff changes and new products; (e) high local retention ratios (which discourage reinsurance from overseas companies); (f) insurance reserves used as a captive source of funding for public deficits; and (g) weak <b>prudential</b> <b>controls</b> and inadequate monitoring of solvency. In recent years there has been a growing trend away from direct controls on premiums, products, and investments, and toward more monitoring of the solvency of companies, through more effective supervision and clear <b>prudential</b> <b>controls.</b> The author argues that Tunisia's insurance sector has been hampered by restrictive regulations, by the country's low incomes (which limit long-term savings capabilities), and by it pay-as-you-go social pension system. Tunisia's life insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance industry also suffers from structural problems. Worst of all, prudential regulations and standards are unequally applied, and some companies are still operating with insufficient capital(in a few cases, with greatly negative equity). What is needed? Capital-deficient companies need to be restructured and recapitalized, state-owned companies need to be privatized, and the market needs to be opened up to majority foreign-owned firms. Supervision must be strengthened and corrective measures applied more equitably and forcefully. The social pension system must be radically reformed, to include one fully funded pillar that will generate long-term savings and transform the prospects for life insurance business.

Three criteria for evaluating financial regulation and structure are discussed: (1) stability, (2) efficiency, and (3) fairness. As a result of massive losses suffered by financial institutions, stability is a significant concern. It can be enhanced by increasing capital requirements and strengthening financial supervision. In developing countries there is growing concentration and a spread of universal banking, suggesting economies of both scale and scope. Available evidence suggests that concentrated banking systems tend to have lower margins and operating costs as well as higher profits. However, large banks tend to be inefficient. Their size is the result of controls and restrictions on competition and entry rather than superior efficiency. Protecting users of financial systems from abusive behavior by the financial institutions, creating equality in the competition between banking institutions, and tackling the problems caused by potential conflicts of interest is the"fairness"issue. There are tradeoffs between these three criteria for evaluating financial regulation and structure. The answers must be sought on a country-by-country basis.

Within this new framework, we show that when exchange rate policy is costless, {{there is no need}} for capital controls. However, if exchange rate policy entails efficiency costs, capital controls become part of the optimal policy mix. When exchange rate policy is costly, the optimal mix combines <b>prudential</b> capital <b>controls</b> in tranquil times with policies that limit exchange rate depreciation in crisis times. The optimal mix yields more borrowing, fewer and less severe financial crises, and much higher welfare than with capital controls alone...|$|R
40|$|A growing {{theoretical}} literature advocates {{the use of}} <b>prudential</b> capital <b>controls,</b> that is, the {{tightening of}} restrictions on net capital inflows during booms and the relaxation thereof during recessions. We examine the behavior of capital controls in {{a large number of}} countries over the period 1995 - 2011. We find that capital controls are remarkably acyclical. Boom-bust episodes in output, the current account, or the real exchange rate are associated with virtually no systematic movements in capital controls. These results are robust to controlling for the level of development, external indebtedness, the exchange-rate regime, or the great contraction of 2007 - 2009...|$|R
5000|$|The pro-capital flow {{arguments}} were not reviewed and critiqued until the Great Recession {{in the late}} 2000s. Emerging markets experienced strong capital inflows in the boom stage of a business cycle whereas they witnessed huge flow reverse and financial collapse in the bust period. This boom and bust cycles in international capital flows imposed significant welfare costs. Then the theoretical underpinnings of the Great Recession crisis mechanism give a role for the <b>prudential</b> capital <b>controls</b> as an intervention to adjust the market imperfections in order to mitigate the systemic boom-bust cycle effects brought by the international capital flows ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis, a new policy paradigm has emerged in which old-fashioned policies such as capital controls and other government distortions have become part of the standard policy tool kit (so called macro- prudential policies). On the wave of this seemingly unanimous policy consensus, a new strand of theoretical literature contends that capital controls are welfare enhancing and can be justified rigorously because of second-best considerations. Within the same theoretical framework adopted in this fast-growing literature, this paper shows that a credible commitment to support the exchange rate in crisis times always welfare-dominates <b>prudential</b> capital <b>controls,</b> as it can achieve unconstrained allocation. ...|$|R
50|$|To {{curb the}} {{amplification}} mechanism, mitigating the pecuniary externality {{that results in}} the excessive risk-taking and excessive capital inflow for an open economy is the key, As proved by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986), {{in the presence of}} pecuniary externality and market incompleteness, some policy intervention that aims to reduce the pecuniary externality problem could achieve larger social benefits while incur only small social cost. This justifies the role for external intervention. In the case of excessive external borrowing problem in the open economy, the <b>prudential</b> capital <b>controls</b> are the desired regulations that kick in to induce private agents to internalize the externality and to reduce the excessive risk-taking exposures.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a welfare case for <b>prudential</b> <b>controls</b> on capital ows to emerging markets {{as a form}} of Pigouvian taxation that aims to reduce the externalities associated with the deleveraging cycle. We argue that restricting capital in ows during boom times reduces the potential out ows during busts. This mitigates the feedback cycle during such deleveraging episodes, when tightening nancial constraints on borrowers and collapsing prices of collateral assets mutually reinforce each other. As a result, macroeconomic volatility is smoothed and welfare is unambiguously increased. A number of emerging market economies have recently imposed or considered imposing controls on capital in ows in the face of erce capital ow bonanzas (see e. g. Financial Times, 2009). For example, Brazil imposed a 2 % levy on on foreign investments in Brazilian stocks and xed-income securities on Oct. 24, 2009 after experiencing a 36 % appreciation of its currency earlier during the year, and Taiwan followed suit with a similar measure in November. 1 However, while policymakers around the world are clearly concerned about the effects of volatility in capital ows, the theoretic welfare case for such intervention has been less clear. The existing literature has studied how capital ow volatility can trigger feedback cycles that work through the depreciation of the real exchange rate. See e. g. Javier Bianchi (2010) and Anton Korinek (2009, 2010). This paper contributes to the debate by providing a theoretic welfare rationale for the taxation of capital ows based on a more general mechanism that involves asset price de ation...|$|R
40|$|Most {{central banks}} oblige {{depository}} institutions to hold minimum reserves against their liabilities, predominantly {{in the form}} of balances at the central bank. The role of these reserve requirements has evolved significantly over time. The overlay of changing purposes and practices has the result that it is not always fully clear what the current purpose of reserve requirements is, and this necessarily complicates thinking about how a reserve regime should be structured. This paper describes three main purposes for reserve requirements – <b>prudential,</b> monetary <b>control</b> and liquidity management – and suggests best practice for the structure of a reserves regime. Finally, the paper illustrates current practices using a 2010 IMF survey of 121 central banks...|$|R
