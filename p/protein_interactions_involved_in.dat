40|$|The innate {{immune system}} enables {{cellular}} response to infectious agents, and protein interactions are essential for this response. However, the <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> cellular response to pathogens are not completely understood. Clarifying {{the manner in which}} proteins bind and respond to infectious agents is necessary for development of potential therapeutics or preventative measures. Fluorescent probes and fluorescent microscopy are used to aid in the visualization of these components, but proteins associated with or spanning the cellular membrane are on the nanometer scale, smaller than some microscopes can image, which makes it difficult to accurately localize the proteins of interest. To further the understanding of protein dynamics, a higher resolution form of optical microscopy had to be developed that allowed for multi-component cellular imaging without the need for harsher fixatives like those required for electron microscopy. To this end, optical super resolution techniques rely on the blinking attributes of fluorophores currently utilized in protein labeling in conjunction with specialized post processing to enable sub-diffraction limit v localization. These techniques allow the visualization of protein dynamics on the scale in which they occur. It is through these methods that we clarify the <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> response to the extracellular stimuli provided by a variety of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), known stimulants of the {{innate immune system}}. It has been shown that LPS-induced TLR 4 dimerization and clustering correlate to an appropriate innate immune response. Imaging the degree of TLR 4 clustering after exposure to different gram negative LPS can further the understanding of TLR 4 pathway dynamics. By studying the internalization of TLR 4, it can be determined whether cells have had adequate time to react and form clusters as a result of being exposed to LPS. These experiments will focus on imaging the LPS from E. coli as well as of Y. pestis 21 C on several microscopes. Sandia National LaboratoriesElectrical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Inference methods {{applied to}} {{biological}} networks {{suffer from a}} main criticism: as the latter reflect associations measured under static conditions, {{an evaluation of the}} underlying modular organization can be biologically meaningful only if the dynamics can also be taken into consideration. The same limitation is present in protein interactome networks. Given the substantial uncertainty characterizing protein interactions, we identify at least three aspects that must be considered for inference purposes: 1. Coverage, which for most organisms is only partial; 2. Stochasticity, affecting both the high-throughput experimental and the computational settings from which the interactions are determined, and leading to suboptimal measurement accuracy; 3. Information variety, due to the heterogeneity of technological and biological sources generating the data. Consequently, advances in inference methods require adequate treatment of both system uncertainty and dynamical aspects.

First, we introduce MS methods for the study of intact protein complexes in the gas phase. Next, pull-down methods for affinity-based analysis of protein-protein and protein-immobilized ligand interactions are discussed. Presently, this field of research is often called interactomics or interaction proteomics. A slightly different approach that will be discussed, chemical proteomics, allows one to analyze selectivity profiles of ligands for multiple drug targets and off-targets.

40|$|The perijunctional {{actomyosin}} ring {{contributes to}} myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) -dependent tight junction regulation. However, the specific <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> this process are unknown. To test {{the hypothesis that}} molecular remodeling contributes to barrier regulation, tight junction protein dynamic behavior was assessed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). MLCK inhibition increased barrier function and stabilized ZO- 1 at the tight junction but did not affect claudin- 1, occludin, or actin exchange in vitro. Pharmacologic MLCK inhibition also blocked in vivo ZO- 1 exchange in wild-type, but not long MLCK−/−, mice. Conversely, ZO- 1 exchange was accelerated in transgenic mice expressing constitutively active MLCK. In vitro, ZO- 1 lacking the actin binding region (ABR) was not stabilized by MLCK inhibition, either in {{the presence or absence}} of endogenous ZO- 1. Moreover, the free ABR interfered with full-length ZO- 1 exchange and reduced basal barrier function. The free ABR also prevented increases in barrier function following MLCK inhibition in a manner that required endogenous ZO- 1 expression. In silico modeling of the FRAP data suggests that tight junction-associated ZO- 1 exists in three pools, two of which exchange with cytosolic ZO- 1. Transport of the ABR-anchored exchangeable pool is regulated by MLCK. These data demonstrate a critical role for the ZO- 1 ABR in barrier function and suggest that MLCK-dependent ZO- 1 exchange is essential to this mechanism of barrier regulation...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: An {{important}} aspect of infectious disease research involves understanding the differences and commonalities in the infection mechanisms underlying various diseases. Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of host–pathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach {{is based on a}} formalism from machine learning called ‘multitask learning’, which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A ‘task’ in our scenario is the set of host–pathogen <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i. e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host–pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a task-based regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex–Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host–pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights. ...|$|E

Here we followed a systems biology approach in an effort to construct the networks and pathways of <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> formation of the accumulation blastema in regenerating axolotl limbs. Results: We used the human orthologs of proteins previously identified by our research team as bait to identify the transcription factor (TF) pathways and networks that regulate blastema formation in amputated axolotl limbs. The five most connected factors, c-Myc, SP 1, HNF 4 A, ESR 1 and p 53 regulate ~ 50 % of the proteins in our data. Among these, c-Myc and SP 1 regulate 36. 2 % of the proteins. c-Myc was the most highly connected TF (71 targets). Network analysis showed that TGF-b 1 and fibronectin (FN) lead to the activation of these TFs. We found that other TFs known to be involved in epigenetic reprogramming, such as Klf 4, Oct 4, and Lin 28 are also connected to c-Myc and SP 1.

We have characterized in detail the intrinsically disordered properties of Myc- 1 - 88, where hierarchical phosphorylation of S 62 and T 58 regulates activation and destruction of the Myc protein. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift analysis, relaxation measurements and NOE analysis, we show that although Myc occupies a very heterogeneous conformational space, we find transiently structured regions in residues 22 - 33 and in the Myc homology box I (MBI; residues 45 - 65); both these regions are conserved in {{other members of the}} Myc family. Binding of Bin 1 to Myc- 1 - 88 as assayed by NMR and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed primary binding to the S 62 region in a dynamically disordered and multivalent complex, accompanied by population shifts leading to altered intramolecular conformational dynamics. These findings expand the increasingly recognized concept of intrinsically disordered regions mediating transient interactions to Myc, a key transcriptional regulator of major medical importance, and have important implications for further understanding its multifaceted role in gene regulation.

Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry provides a novel way to analyse protein complexes. In this thesis, we examine an integrated workflow that combines chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry with genetic fragmentation technique to accurately locate the minimal binding domains responsible for protein interactions. We show that chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry can efficiently guide the design of truncation or deletion mutants, however, not all the cross-links we found are within the minimal binding domain. Furthermore, our data indicate that chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry-based prediction of protein interaction domains might work better for folded protein domains than for protein regions predicted to be intrinsically disordered. We apply chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry in studying the interaction between the flavoprotein monooxygenase MICAL 3 and the centralspindlin component MKLP 1 during cytokinesis. We show that MKLP 1 interacts with and recruits MICAL 3 to the midbody. We propose that during cytokinesis, MICAL 3 acts as a protein-binding hub, which promotes maturation of the intercellular bridge and abscission.

Although clearly important {{at the point of}} membrane fusion, the precise structural and functional requirements for the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of SNAREs in bringing about neurosecretion remain largely unknown. Here, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approach to study SNARE <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involving</b> TMDs <b>in</b> vivo. VAMP 2 molecules were found to dimerise through their TMDs in intact cells. Dimerisation was abolished when replacing a glycine residue in the centre of the TMD with residues of increasing molecular volume. However, such mutations still were fully competent in bringing about membrane-fusion events, suggesting that dimerisation of the VAMP 2 TMDs does not have an important functional role. By contrast, a series of deletion or insertion mutants in the C-terminal half of the TMD were largely deficient in supporting neurosecretion, whereas mutations in the N-terminal half did not display severe secretory deficits. Thus, structural length requirements, largely confined to the C-terminal half of the VAMP 2 TMD, seem to be essential for SNARE-mediated membrane-fusion events in cells. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Dysregulation of apoptosis is associated with many pathologic conditions and may even be central in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Whilst too little apoptosis may result in cancer, autoimmune or other chronic inflammatory diseases, too much apoptosis is <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> stroke-induced neuronal damage and neurodegenerative disorders. Apoptosis research is rapidly proceeding {{making it difficult to}} keep track of the constant stream of newly identified <b>proteins</b> and molecular <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> cell death regulation.

40|$|Motivation: New bioimaging {{techniques}} {{have recently been}} proposed to visualize the colocation or interaction of several proteins within individual cells, displaying the heterogeneity of neighbouring cells within the same tissue specimen. Such techniques could {{hold the key to}} understanding complex biological systems such as the <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> cancer. However, {{there is a need for}} new algorithmic approaches that analyze the large amounts of multi-tag bioimage data from cancerous and normal tissue specimens to begin to infer protein networks and unravel the cellular heterogeneity at a molecular level. Results: The proposed approach analyzes cell phenotypes in normal and cancerous colon tissue imaged using the robotically controlled Toponome Imaging System microscope. It involves segmenting the 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole- labelled image into cells and determining the cell phenotypes according to their protein-protein dependence profile. These were analyzed using two new measures, Difference in Sums of Weighted cO-dependence/Anti-co-dependence profiles (DiSWOP and DiSWAP) for overall co-expression and anti-co-expression, respectively. These novel quantities were extracted using 11 Toponome Imaging System image stacks from either cancerous or normal human colorectal specimens. This approach enables one to easily identify protein pairs that have significantly higher/lower co-expression levels in cancerous tissue samples when compared with normal colon tissue. V.

40|$|Nucleic acid {{polymers}} (NAPs) {{utilize the}} sequence-independent properties of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-ONs) to target <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> viral replication. NAPs are broadly active against a {{diverse range of}} enveloped viruses that use type I entry mechanisms. The antiviral activity of NAPs against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was assessed in vitro in duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) -infected primary duck hepatocytes (PDH). NAPs efficiently entered PDH {{in the absence of}} any transfection agent and displayed antiviral activity at concentrations of 0. 01 to 10 μM, measured by their ability to prevent the intracellular accumulation of DHBV surface antigen, which was independent of their nucleotide sequence and was specifically dependent on phosphorothioation. Higher levels of antiviral activity were observed with NAPs 40 nucleotides in length or longer. The fully degenerate NAP (REP 2006) was active during DHBV infection or when added 12 h after infection. In contrast, an acidic-pH-sensitive NAP (REP 2031) that was broadly active against other viruses displayed antiviral activity when present during DHBV infection but no activity when added 12 h after infection, suggesting that NAPs exert their postentry effect in an acidic environment unique to DHBV infection. Both REP 2006 and REP 2031 displayed negligible cytotoxicity in PDH at concentrations of up to 10 μM, as assessed using an XTT [2, 3 -bis-(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium- 5 -carboxanilide] cytotoxicity assay. The antiviral activity of NAPs against DHBV in vitro was strictly dependent on their amphipathic character, suggesting that NAPs interact with amphipathic target(s) that are important for DHBV entry and postentry mechanisms required for infection.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the assembly of pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The channels are a heterooligomeric complex of pore-forming Kir 6. 2 subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR 1) subunits. SUR 1 belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins and has two nucleotide binding domains (NBD 1 and NBD 2) and 17 putative transmembrane (TM) sequences. Previously we showed that co-expression in a baculovirus expression system of two parts of SUR 1 divided at Pro 1042 between TM 12 and 13 leads to restoration of glibenclamide binding activity, whereas expression of either individual N- or C-terminal domain alone gave no glibenclamide binding activity [M. V. Mikhailov and S. J. H. Ashcroft (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 3360 – 3364]. Here we show that the two half-molecules formed by division of SUR 1 between NBD 1 and TM 12 or between TM 13 and 14 also self-assemble to give glibenclamide binding activity. However, deletion of NBD 1 from the N-part of SUR 1 abolished SUR 1 assembly, indicating a critical role for NBD 1 in SUR 1 assembly. We found that differences in glibenclamide binding activity obtained after co-expression of different half-molecules are attributable to different amounts of binding sites, but the binding affinities remained nearly the same. Simultaneous expression of Kir 6. 2 resulted in enhanced glibenclamide binding activity only when the N-half of SUR 1 included TM 12. We conclude that TM 12 and 13 are not essential for SUR 1 assembly whereas TM 12 takes part in SUR 1 Kir 6. 2 interaction. This interaction is specific for Kir 6. 2 because no enhancement of glibenclamide binding was observed when half-molecules were expressed together with Kir 4. 1. We propose a model of KATP channel organisation based on these data...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{dopamine}} receptor-G protein {{coupling in}} the development of striatal dopamine receptor supersensitivity was studied in rats with a 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) -induced unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway. This coupling was assessed by the measurement of dopamine agonist-induced guanosine 5 '-O-(gamma[35 S]thio) triphosphate ([35 S]GTP-gammaS) binding in striatal membranes, at different periods of time (1 - 5 weeks) following the microinjection of the neurotoxin. From the first to the fifth week following the lesion, basal and dopamine-stimulated [35 S]GTPgammaS-specific binding were found to be enhanced in the denervated striata as compared to their control counterpart. D 2 dopamine receptors were clearly demonstrated to be <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> this supersensitivity, as assessed by measuring N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) -, quinpirole- and bromocriptine-induced [35 S]GTPgammaS-specific binding. The involvement of D 1 dopamine receptors was indirectly studied by the combination of dopamine with a saturating concentration of the selective and potent D 2 antagonist domperidone. In these conditions, the remaining response to dopamine was also found to be significantly increased following the lesion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in addition to D 2 dopamine receptor upregulation, modulation of dopamine receptor-G <b>protein</b> <b>interaction</b> is <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the hypersensitivity accompanying striatal dopamine depletion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{morphological}} transformation involving {{loss of adhesion}} between myelin lamellae and {{formation of}} myelin vesicles {{has been described as}} a mechanism for demyelination in multiple sclerosis and marmoset experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> are <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining normal myelin structure, we describe here how lipids contribute to myelin stability and how lipid changes in EAE, including increases in lipid polyunsaturation and negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS), promote demyelination. Three physico-chemical techniques were used to identify these changes: (1) Langmuir monolayer isotherms indicated that EAE white matter lipids were significantly more ‘expanded’ (fluid) than controls. (2) NMR spectroscopy indicated that EAE myelin lipids were more polyunsaturated than controls. (3) High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an evaporative light scattering detector indicated increased PS in EAE compared to controls, while sphingomyelin (SM), sulfatides and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were decreased. We present a physical model considering electrostatic, van der Waals and undulation forces to quantify the effect of these changes on myelin adhesion at the extracellular interface. Taken together, the isotherm, NMR, HPLC and modeling results support a mechanism for autoimmune demyelination whereby the composition of myelin lipids is altered in a manner that increases myelin fluidity, decreases myelin adhesion, increases membrane curvature, and promotes vesiculation...|$|R
40|$|Telomere {{length is}} {{controlled}} {{in part by}} cis-acting negative regulators that limit telomere extension by telomerase. In budding yeast, the major telomere length regulator scRap 1 binds to telomeric DNA and acts to inhibit telomere elongation in cis. Because the human Rap 1 ortholog hRap 1 does not bind to telomeric DNA directly but is recruited to telomeres by TRF 2, we examined its role in telomere length control. The data are consistent with hRap 1 being a negative regulator of telomere length, indicating functional conservation. Deletion mapping confirmed that hRap 1 is tethered to telomeres through interaction of its C terminus with TRF 2. The telomere length phenotypes of hRap 1 deletion mutants implicated both the BRCT and Myb domain as <b>protein</b> <b>interaction</b> domains <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> telomere length regulation. By contrast, scRap 1 binds to telomeres with its Myb domains and uses its C terminus to recruit the telomere length regulators Rif 1 and Rif 2. Together, our data show that although the role of Rap 1 at telomeres has been largely conserved, the domains of Rap 1 have undergone extensive functional changes during eukaryotic evolution. Surprisingly, hRap 1 alleles lacking the BRCT domain diminished the heterogeneity of human telomeres, indicating that hRap 1 also {{plays a role in}} the regulation of telomere length distribution...|$|R
