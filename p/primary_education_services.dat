Thus, BRAC boat schools appear to bring blessings for children in accessing their basic right of education to enlighten the society. The impact of boat schools in education is examined to create positive socio-economic changes. However, this study highlights a brief analysis of the context based on diverse stakeholders and their perspectives to contribute in the theoretical endeavor of social innovation in educational context.

40|$|The Planning Commission’s {{premise that}} the growth in India has {{bypassed}} the weaker sections due to their ineffective access to the basic services like primary education needs to be tested against the evidence. Traditionally identified weaker section on social criteria (SC and ST population) {{seems to have a}} similar or relatively better access to the primary education. However, there is no direct evidence available for the weaker section on the economic criteria or the population living below poverty line (BPL). The present paper attempts to provide an empirical evidence for the premise of the Planning Commission from the household survey of BPL families in five states of India including the survey of primary schools for the same states and localities. Our findings suggest {{that there is a problem}} of access of the poor (BPL) households to the <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> <b>services</b> in rural areas. Primary enrolment ratios among the children of poor households are considerably lower than the respective state average and also the aggregate enrolment ratio of the country. Our findings also reveal that the incentives such as mid-day meals, free textbooks and cash subsidies given by government schools to the poor children do actually reach them. The problem of insufficient effective access of the poor to primary education still persists. It calls for a change in the policy level thinking. Qualitative aspects like school infrastructural deficiencies and functioning of teachers having a direct bearing on the quality and access of education in the rural areas need urgent attention. ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} belief in {{development}} policy circles that participation by local communities in basic service delivery can promote development outcomes. A central plank of public policy for improving <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> <b>services</b> in India is the participation of village education committees (VECs), consisting of village government leaders, parents, and teachers. The authors report findings from a survey {{in the state of}} Uttar Pradesh, of public schools, households, and VEC members, on the status of education services and the extent of community participation inthe public delivery of education services. They find that parents do not know that a VEC exists, sometimes even when {{they are supposed to be}} members of it; VEC members are unaware of even key roles they are empowered to play in education services; and public participation in improving education is negligible, and correspondingly, people's ranking of education on a list of village priorities is low. Large numbers of children in the villages have not acquired basic competency in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Yet parents, teachers, and VEC members seem not to be fully aware of the scale of the problem, and seem not to have given much thought to the role of public agencies in improving outcomes. Learning failures coexist with public apathy to improving it through public action. Can local participation be sparked through grassroots campaigns that inform communities about the VEC and its role in local service delivery? Can such local participation actually affect learning outcomes, and can any impact be sustained? The authors describe information and advocacy campaigns that have been experimentally implemented to address some of the problems with local participation, and future research plans to evaluate their impact.

The analysis of data employed percentage, the mean and standard deviation. The results are as follows: 1. There are 4 factors of the guidelines on mentoring internal supervision for schools. They are: preparation of mentoring supervision, with 12 indicators; management of mentoring supervision, with 12 indicators; operation of mentoring supervision, with 14 indicators; and evaluation of mentoring supervision, with 10 indicators, all {{of which had been}} evaluated by the experts as, on the whole, very suitable. 2. The current state of the mentoring internal supervision for schools, on the whole and factor by factor, was in the moderate level in every factor. Meanwhile, the desirable state of mentoring internal supervision for schools, on the whole, was in the high level. When considered factor by factor, the factor with the highest mean is management of mentoring supervision. The factor with the lowest mean is evaluation of mentoring supervision. 3. Regarding the guidelines on the operation of mentoring internal supervision for the schools under Roi-Et Office of <b>Primary</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Service</b> Area 2, they have the suitability and feasibility, on the whole, in the high level on every factor. The guidelines are concluded and listed as follows: the operation of the mentoring internal supervision should have a support system organized in order to monitor the relationship of the supervision process between the mentor and the mentee; a handbook of mentoring internal supervision which contains the main substances of the matters under supervision should be written and be used as part of the work and as a reference; an orientation should be organized for mentors and mentees to get acquainted; the evaluation of the internal supervision should cover the process, the product and working factors; there should be achievement evaluation of the project by considering teacher development and the learning achievement of the students; a network system of mentoring internal supervision should be built in order that personnel of the school as well as personnel of different schools can study together which will induce good collaboration; there should be production of media, tools, equipment and documents used in internal supervision; The activities of mentoring internal supervision should be arranged in steps, comprising: meeting before the semester begins, giving advice, focus group discussion, classroom-visit supervision, teaching observation and self-assessment, monitoring in order to give advice, support, and listen to opinions and suggestions from the teachers; provide opportunities for the teachers to take part in setting the policy of the school; and there should be conclusion of the operation for further improvements; feedbacks should be used in the improvement and the work should be publicized and admired as an example in the school. ...|$|R

40|$|Uganda {{introduced}} the decentralization policy in 1997 under the Local Government Act of 1997 {{that has since}} undergone four amendments. The policy inherently decentralized service delivery institutions and their governance {{in order to improve}} access to services for the rural poor. Based on an analysis of available literature, the paper documents the state of knowledge regarding rural service provision in Uganda under decentralization and identifies knowledge gaps for further investigation. Its focus is on education, health, and agricultural advisory services, as well as the management of natural resources in Uganda. Although enlightening, a review of the broader decentralization literature {{is beyond the scope of}} this work. The analysis revealed that results in terms of attaining the objectives of decentralization are mixed. While as anticipated generally decentralization resulted in greater participation and control over service delivery and governance by local communities, local governments are still grappling with a range of challenges, namely, inadequate local financial resources and over-reliance on conditional central government grants; inability to attract and retain sufficient trained and experienced staff; corruption, nepotism, and elite capture. With regard to the specific services, while universal primary education (UPE) policy under the decentralization framework is credited with a dramatic increase in primary school enrollment, public <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> <b>services</b> are still dogged by concerns over financing, equity, quality, and the need for curriculum reform. Some studies show that there has been no improvement in health services with many health status indicators either stagnating or worsening. In general, decentralization of education and health services has not resulted in greater participation of the ordinary people and accountability of service providers to the community. Regarding agricultural extension and advisory services, except for areas serviced by NGOs, the majority of the country does not readily access extension services, because districts have been unable to prioritize the operational expenses. However, there is some evidence that the devolution of responsibility for natural resource management (NRM) has contributed to greater compliance with some NRM requirements in some areas while in other areas forest conditions have declined following decentralization. Generally, evidence on whether decentralization has improved service delivery in Uganda is still inconclusive, and more research is needed.

The study found that <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>education</b> were absolutely progressive across households, absolute progressive for female and just progressive for male <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> spending, while secondary education spending is just progressive across both sexes. Among other policies, strict implementation of the compulsory free basic education as stated in the National Policy on Education was recommended...|$|R

40|$|This study considers, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of the Local Education Authority Officers working there, how one English Shire County, Trentshire', promotes equality in its <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> <b>service.</b> Set in the wake of the Macpherson Report, it investigates the pressures for local government of implementing a social justice agenda alongside other initiatives in an existing framework of neo-liberal legislation promoting effectiveness, `performativity' and school improvement. It is not concerned with pedagogic practice, but considers how LEA administrators promote equality and diversity while working in a context where LEAs have lost most of their former power but are still expected to take a leadership role, where relationships with school Heads and governors are frequently uneasy and where parents increasingly insist on their individual 'rights'. A Trentshire' LEA Officer myself, I argue that, although the power of LEAs in relation to schools has diminished, individual officers retain a key role in promoting equality. I research from the 'inside', and adopt a critical theory perspective shaped by my personal desire for a just society free from inequalities of race, gender or disability. Arguing that policy implementation is complex, messy and dynamic, involving social action by real people, I reject a positivist strategy based on quantitative outcomes analysis, claiming that insight into the views and behaviours of key players is a stronger basis for researching policy. My principal evidence comes from interviews with colleague LEA Officers whose day-to-day role brings them into contact with schools and parents, and I also use evidence from meeting notes to critically consider the actions taken by 'Trentshire' Officers in three separate scenarios. My findings reveal 'Trentshire' Officers' personal commitment and their pragmatic determination to solve dilemmas and make policies 'work' in spite of political and structural tensions inherent in their roles and the conceptual tensions within the equality and diversity agendas; they are required to uphold weak 'equal treatment' procedures grounded in neo-liberal legislation whilst increasingly delivering a social inclusion / diversity agenda based on postmodern conceptions of difference. They use their discretion to develop working definitions of equality and to adopt their own ad hoc 'first-order' strategies for change, and as the LEA's role extends into partnership with public sector and voluntary agencies, have a wider opportunity to contribute positively to the promotion of social justice. My study concludes with brief thoughts on building strategies to make equality a reality in 'Trentshire'...|$|R
