30|$|The {{precision}} of predictability {{is likely to}} depend on the quality and amount of historical ground truth data. Thus, in (Lin et al. 2017), the authors proposed an artificial model of fire <b>propagation</b> among <b>houses</b> to establish the limits of model predictability. The authors use simulations of CARP model to generate data with arbitrary lengths (from 100 to 6400 time steps) and arbitrary number of variants of model execution. The authors use these variants as alternative historical ground truth data. They measure the prediction precision between variants at different length of alternative historical data, and study how the prediction precision changes over time. The authors conclude that the average relative error of parameter recovery decays according to the power law of the size of historical data and ultimately tends to zero when the length of historical data tends to infinity. These results demonstrate that the asymptotic normality of MLE holds also in the presence of latent Poisson processes.|$|R

To this end, panel data and time series methodologies are adopted as a means of providing a contextual framework on the extant relationship. The panel methodological framework explores the interaction between economic fundamentals and financial variables while the use of time series methodologies developed by Phillips et al.

In particular, the short-run dynamic panel framework provides a robust exploratory platform thus, shedding light on the determinants of property prices (i. e. real gross domestic product, bank credit growth, long-term bond yields and real effective exchange rate) whilst the bubble detection methodologies provide evidence of the impact of credit-driven economies on the <b>propagation</b> of <b>housing</b> booms which can serve as warning signals of the potential formation of housing bubbles...|$|R

We present firstly the exploratory technique itself, and secondly an overview of patterns found in the dataset. A broadly scoped metamodel is created which points towards fruitful avenues for further investigation {{and understanding of the}} driving forces behind price <b>propagation</b> in the <b>housing</b> market. At the core of this model is an 8850 × 8850 cross-correlation matrix representing price linkage between different areas, which is analyzed by a custom regression engine. Hence this is the first study to unify both local and regional house-price modelling, and the first to look for a quantitative explanation of the structure of any house-price interaction matrix on a large scale. Findings corroborate existing research on the ripple effect and spatial volatility, and point towards mechanisms through which these might arise, as a combination of local interaction and market segmentation broken by lifecycle migration patterns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Methods of <b>Propagation</b> <b>House</b> plants may be propagated asexually, in which all new plants will be identical, in most cases, to the parent plant, or sexually, where the new plants will not necessarily be identical to the parent plants.

40|$|The {{potential}} to use micropropagation protocols {{in combination with}} a nursery production system via stool beds is attractive. Somatic embryogenesis protocols would amplify high value control-pollinated seed and organogenesis of the resulting mature somatic embryos (SE) would provide {{a large number of}} uniform shoots for initial production of stool beds. SE material held in liquid nitrogen could then be used to provide a supply of juvenile stool beds over a number of years. Successful results have been obtained with initiation and proliferation of Douglas-fir embryogenic cultures at Scion. These protocols have been developed using modified Pinus radiata media and methods and provide Scion with protocols for the micropropagation of Douglas-fir. Mature somatic embryos (from 5 cell lines) had their bases removed and were placed on Pinus radiata organogenic media (LPch) to establish shoot cultures. Shoots were sub-cultured every 4 - 6 weeks, transferring to jars when elongated. Whenever possible, stem segments were isolated from the elongated shoots and transferred to petri dishes for multiplication. Multiplication data was collected for 30 weeks. Thirty organogenic shoots from each of the five SE cell lines were used to test four different pre-rooting treatments. Shoots were transferred to the nursery <b>propagation</b> <b>house</b> after 11 days. The results of these pre-rooting treatments on the ability of the shoots to produce roots will be presented and future work discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rhizoctonia so/ani is the causative {{agent of}} wirestem on Brassica crops. R. so/ani is a species complex {{comprising}} genetically. distinct groups known as anastomosis groups (AGs). Knowledge of which AGs {{are responsible for}} disease is necessary to formulate appropriate management strategies. Important knowledge about the specific AGs responsible for disease in UK Brassica crops and where in the production chain the fungus became associated with plants was lacking. A survey of UK. f 3 rassica o/eracea crops was completed to. establish which anastomosis groups of Rhizoctonia so/ani were associated with module raised plants. No R. so/ani was recovered from plants collected directly from UK propagators. R. so/ani was identified from asymptomatic stem bases collected from field crops using classical mycology, suggesting field inoculum is important. Such data suggests UK <b>propagation</b> <b>houses</b> have high standards of hygiene and future research should concentrate on elucidating the field biology of R. so/ani. The pathogenicity of the recoveredi. isolates was demonstrated {{across a range of}} crops, including B. o/eracea. However, the isolates were not pathogenic to monocotyledonous species suggesting these may act as effective break crops. Sequence data were generated from ribosomal and ~-tubulin regions and the anastomosis groups of the R. so/ani isolates identified using parsimony and Bayesian based phylogenetic methods. Both methods suggested the majority of isolates recovered from the stem bases of UK B. o/eracea plants belonged to AG 2 - 1 and {{all but one of the}} remaining isolates belonged to AG 4 HGii. These data are consistent with research from the USA, however this is the first report for UK crops. AG determination using nucleotide sequence information proved more successful and less time consuming than classical mycological approaches. AG 2 - 1 formed three distinct clusters in all analyses suggesting this' subgroup is genetically diverse, a conclusion supported by the problems encountered when investigating AGs using classical mycology. The monophyly of genera Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus were investigated using constrained analyses, however no firm conclusions could be drawn to accept or reject this hypothesis. Protocols were devel~edto' deteet AG 'and Ã‚Â·spedfic sub~groups in plant and Ã‚Â·soil samples using real-time peR. Soil testing suggested AG 2 - 1 was more frequently detected in samples collected from the upper 10 cm of fields used for B. oleracea production. Such information is consistent with other research and suggests the growth of R. solani may be limited by lack of air filled pores within soil matrixes. The molecular methods were used to investigate the spatial and temporal association of R. solani with field grown B. oleracea plants. The molecular protocols confirmed that R. solani AG 2 - 1 became rapidly associated with a large number of B. oleracea plants. The principle arguments for such an association hinged on identifying the dominant behaviour expressed by the fungus. Rapid colonisation of the root system and stem base would benefit saprophytic behaviour of R. solani as the fu. ngus could capitalise when the crop lifecycle was complete. As a pathogen the benefits of early colonisation are clear and perhaps the reason for low disease levels can be explained by the absence of suitable environmental conditions for disease to progress. A third hypothesis could be that R. solani may form mycorrhizal associations with B. oleracea crops. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} {{electromagnetic fields}} (RF-EMF) {{in our daily}} life are caused by numerous sources such as fixed site transmitters (e. g. mobile phone base stations) or indoor devices (e. g. cordless phones). The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a prediction model which can be used to predict mean RF-EMF exposure from different sources for a large study population in epidemiological research. We collected personal RF-EMF exposure measurements of 166 volunteers from Basel, Switzerland, by means of portable exposure meters, which were carried during one week. For a validation study we repeated exposure measurements of 31 study participants 21 weeks after the measurements of the first week on average. These second measurements were not used for the model development. We used two data sources as exposure predictors: 1) a questionnaire on potentially exposure relevant characteristics and behaviors and 2) modeled RF-EMF from fixed site transmitters (mobile phone base stations, broadcast transmitters) at the participants' place of residence using a geospatial propagation model. Relevant exposure predictors, which were identified by means of multiple regression analysis, were the modeled RF-EMF at the participants' home from the <b>propagation</b> model, <b>housing</b> characteristics, ownership of communication devices (wireless LAN, mobile and cordless phones) and behavioral aspects such as amount of time spent in public transports. The proportion of variance explained (R 2) by the final model was 0. 52. The analysis of the agreement between calculated and measured RF-EMF showed a sensitivity of 0. 56 and a specificity of 0. 95 (cut-off: 90 th percentile). In the validation study, the sensitivity and specificity of the model were 0. 67 and 0. 96, respectively. We could demonstrate that it is feasible to model personal RF-EMF exposure. Most importantly, our validation study suggests that the model can be used to assess average exposure over several months...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{and noise}} caused by gear {{dynamics}} at the meshing teeth propagate through power transmission components {{to the surrounding}} environment. This study is devoted to developing computational tools to investigate the vibro-acoustic propagation of gear dynamics through a gearbox using different bearings. Detailed finite element/contact mechanics and boundary element models of the gear/bearing/housing system are established to compute the system vibration and noise propagation. Both vibration and acoustic models are validated by experiments including the vibration modal testing and sound field measurements. The effectiveness of each bearing type to disrupt vibration <b>propagation</b> is speed-dependent. <b>Housing</b> {{plays an important role}} in noise radiation. It, however, has limited effects on gear dynamics. Bearings are critical components in drivetrains. Accurate modeling of rolling element bearings is essential to assess vibration and noise of drivetrain systems. This study also seeks to fully describe the vibro-acoustic propagation of gear dynamics through a power-transmission system using rolling element and fluid film wave bearings. Fluid film wave bearings, which have higher damping than rolling element bearings, could offer an energy dissipation mechanism that reduces the gearbox noise. The effectiveness of each bearing type to disrupt vibration propagation in explored using multi-body computational models. These models include gears, shafts, rolling element and fluid film wave bearings, and the housing. Radiated noise is mapped from the gearbox surface to surrounding environment. The effectiveness of rolling element and fluid film wave bearings in breaking the vibro-acoustic propagation path from the gear to the housing is investigated...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{offers some}} {{theoretical}} {{contributions to the}} literature on large heterogeneous panel data models. It also demonstrates their practical use in empirical research, {{in the field of}} housing in macroeconomics, and for the analysis of the determinants of sovereign credit spreads. The first chapter provides the motivation for the research presented in this thesis. In the second chapter, we investigate the causes and the finite-sample consequences of negative definite covariance matrices in Swamy type random coefficient models. Monte Carlo experiments reveal that the negative definiteness problem is less severe when the degree of coefficient dispersion is substantial, and the precision of the regression disturbances is high. The sample size also plays a crucial role. We then evaluate the direct consequences of relying on the asymptotic properties of the estimator of the random coefficient covariance for hypothesis tests. A solution to the aforementioned problem is proposed in the third chapter. In particular, we propose to implement the EM algorithm to compute restricted maximum likelihood estimates of both the average effects and the unit-specific coefficients {{as well as of the}} variance components in a wide class of heterogeneous panel data models. Compared to existing methods, our approach leads to unbiased and more efficient estimation of the variance components of the model without running into the problem of negative definite covariance matrices typically encountered in random coefficient models. This in turn leads to more accurate estimated standard errors and hypothesis tests. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed estimator has relatively good finite sample properties. In evaluating the merits of our estimator, we also provide an overview of the sampling and Bayesian methods commonly used to estimate heterogeneous panel data. A novel approach to investigate heterogeneity of the sensitivity of sovereign spreads to government debt is presented. In a final chapter, we use a structural Bayesian (stochastic search variable selection) vector autoregressive model to investigate the heterogeneous impact of housing demand shocks on the macro-economy and the role of house prices in the monetary policy transmission, across euro area countries. A novel set of identification restrictions, which combines zero and sign restrictions, is proposed. By exploiting the cross-sectional dimension of our data, we explore the differences in the <b>propagation</b> channels of <b>house</b> prices and monetary policy and the challenges they pose in the process of real and nominal convergence in the Eurozone. Among the main results, we find a comparatively stronger housing wealth effect on consumption in Ireland and Spain. We provide new evidence in support of the financial accelerator hypothesis, showing that house prices play an important role in the availability of loans. A significant and highly heterogeneous effect of monetary policy on house price dynamics is also documented...|$|R
