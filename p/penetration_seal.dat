50|$|A NRC {{bulletin}} {{explained the}} circumstances of the fire.The fire started in the cable spreading room at a cable penetration through the wall between the cable spreading room and the reactor building for Unit 1. A slight differential pressure is maintained (by design) across this wall, with the higher pressure being on the cable spreading room side. The <b>penetration</b> <b>seal</b> originally present had been breached to install additional cables required by a design modification. Site personnel were resealing the penetration after cable installation and were checking the airflow through a temporary seal with a candle flame prior to installing the permanent sealing material. The temporary sealing material was highly combustible, and caught fire. Efforts were made by the workers to extinguish the fire at its origin, but they apparently did not recognize that the fire, {{under the influence of the}} draft through the penetration, was spreading on the reactor building side of the wall. The extent of the fire in the cable spreading room was limited to a few feet from the penetration; however, the presence of the fire on the other side of the wall from the point of ignition was not recognized until significant damage to cables related to the control of Units 1 and 2 had occurred.|$|E

30|$|The {{next step}} in the method is to {{determine}} the hazards/threats that could pose a risk that the protection objectives are not met for the specified assets and associated support systems. This is referred to as an exposure analysis, sometimes called hazard identification. A hazard is a condition or physical situation with a potential to cause harm (SFPE 2006). A physical hazard might be flammable liquids or combustibles, but if a hazard relates to a person or group it will normally be defined in terms of state of knowledge, attitude or belief that is characterized as human action within an event (Nilsson et al. 2012). Sometimes the physical hazard might be separated from the asset, e.g. by physical separation, fire compartmentation or by active fire protection systems etc. Therefore it is essential to evaluate how the asset is protected from any hazards. To facilitate this, the asset evaluation form {{can be used as a}} checklist, see Table  5. The checklist contains an evaluation of the construction, i.e. is it fire rated, are <b>penetrations</b> <b>sealed</b> etc. Further it contains an evaluation of the occupancy and the associated hazards that comes as a natural consequence of the occupancy, the protection and security features are also evaluated. Hence, the asset evaluation form addresses the identified issue with for example maintenance of fire separation not being adequate and other potential deficiencies in construction features as well as evaluation of security features mitigating the exposures.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAphids produce {{two types}} of saliva that mediate their {{interactions}} with plants.

The injection of 50  ng of double stranded RNA completely disrupted sheath formation, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Aphid behavior was monitored using the electrical penetration graph technique, revealing that disrupted sheath formation prevented efficient long-term feeding from sieve tubes, with a silencing effect on reproduction but not survival. We propose that <b>sealing</b> the stylet <b>penetration</b> site in the sieve tube plasma membrane is part of a two-step mechanism to suppress sieve-tube occlusion by preventing calcium influx into the sieve tube lumen.

40|$|Abstract—A {{thin-film}} encapsulation process, featuring low-temperature steps, {{hermetic sealing}} (preliminary), and RF-compatible shell, is reported. Uniquely attractive {{as compared with}} the existing MEMS packaging approaches is its capability to monolithically package metal microstructures inside a microcavity on chip in one continuous surface-micromachining process. The key for this process is a technique to fabricate a large freestanding porous membrane on chip by postdeposition anodization of thin-film aluminum at room temperature. The porous-alumina mem-brane allows for the diffusion of gas or liquid etchants through the nanopores to etch away the sacrificial material underneath, freeing the movable microstructures encapsulated inside the cav-ity. To seal the package, a thin film is deposited over the alu-mina shell whose nanoscale pores of a high aspect ratio (> 30) do not allow any detectable <b>penetration</b> of the <b>sealing</b> mater-ial.

In command of more than 600 Allied Men-O'-War, ships and large landing craft responsible for the safe sea borne movements of the Allied FIFTH Army to the Gulf of Salerno, Admiral Hewitt brought them skillfully through mined approach courses and developed a sea frontier length of approximately fifty miles despite limited maneuvering space. As the second wave of our landing boats reached the shore, strong German armored elements, deployed along selected beaches, launched heavy counterattacks. They raked the sands where our troops were trying to dig in, tanks rolled out of the valley and charged; hostile artillery continually shelled ships in the anchorage; enemy air forces attacked with high and low-level bombings, dive-bombing and strafing, and with radio-controlled and rocket-glider bombs. The entire operation was in jeopardy. Aware of the narrow margin of success, Admiral Hewitt went ashore. He made a personal reconnaissance of the situation and learned of the peril in flat coastal plains where Allied formations were enveloped in two small detached areas pounded by artillery fire from rugged high ground inland, and requested immediate air and sea reinforcements. With his Flagship marked for destruction by the German Command and pursued as a vital target, he shifted his Flag to a less important unit.

The preliminary design of the dome was completed using membrane shell analysis. Due to the configuration of the test setup, the dome will experience some flexural stresses and stress concentrations in addition to membrane stresses. Also, a potential buckling condition exists for the dome due to external pressure during the leak testing of the cryos- tat facility lines. Thus, a finite element analysis was conducted to assess the overall strength and stability of the dome for each required test condition. Based on these results, additional plies of composite reinforcement material were applied to local regions on the dome to alleviate stress concentrations and limit deflections. The dome design includes a circular opening in the center for the installation of a polar boss, which introduces a geo- metric discontinuity that causes high stresses in the region near the hole. To attenuate these high stresses, a reinforcement system was designed using analytical and finite element analyses. The development of a low leakage polar boss system is also investiga- ted...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Forty premolars {{were randomly assigned}} to 4 groups (I and II: air abrasion; III and IV: turbine) and class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces. Conditioning approaches were: groups I/III - 37 % phosphoric acid; groups II/IV - self-priming etchant (Tyrian-SPE). Cavities were restored with One Step Plus/Filtek Z 250. After finishing, specimens were thermocycled, immersed in 50 % silver nitrate, and serially sectioned. Microleakage at the occlusal and cervical interfaces was measured in mm and calculated by a software. Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: Marginal seal provided by air abrasion was similar to high-speed handpiece, except for group I. There was SIGNIFICANT difference between enamel and dentin/cementum margins for to group I and II: air abrasion. The etch-and-rinse adhesive system promoted a better marginal seal.

Six sections of each tooth were prepared for SEM. Sealant penetration was observed at 30 x magnification and the unfilled space at the bottom of the groove at 500 x. Sealant penetration in relation to the absolute depth of occlusal grooves was recorded and the unfilled space beneath the sealant was expressed through its greatest diameter. Results were statistically analyzed using χ 2 test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in penetration ability and the unfilled space between tested materials or teeth groups. The average depth of penetration for glass ionomer was 83 % and for resin-based sealant 81 % of fissure depth. Mean diameters of the unfilled space beneath the sealants were 95 μm (glass ionomer) and 93 μm (resin-based sealant). Shallower <b>penetration</b> of both <b>sealing</b> materials was observed in deep pits and fissures with greater diameter of unfilled space (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on results of the present study it can be concluded that penetration of contemporary fissure sealants largely depends on occlusal tooth anatomy...|$|R
40|$|The {{geological}} {{storage of}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a well-studied technology, {{and a number of}} demonstration projects around the world have proven its feasibility and challenges. Storage conformance and seal integrity are among the most important aspects, as they determine risk of leakage as well as limits for storage capacity and injectivity. Furthermore, providing evidence for safe storage is critical for improving public acceptance. Most caprocks are composed of clays as dominant mineral type which can typically be illite, kaolinite, chlorite or smectite. A number of recent studies addressed the interaction between CO 2 and these different clays and it was shown that clay minerals adsorb considerable quantities of CO 2. For smectite this uptake can lead to volumetric expansion followed by the generation of swelling pressures. On the one hand CO 2 adsorption traps CO 2, on the other hand swelling pressures can potentially change local stress regimes and in unfavourable situations shear-type failure is assumed to occur. For storage in a reservoir having high clay contents the CO 2 uptake can add to storage capacity which is widely underestimated so far. Smectite-rich seals in direct contact with a dry CO 2 plume at the interface to the reservoir might dehydrate leading to dehydration cracks. Such dehydration cracks can provide pathways for CO 2 ingress and further accelerate dewatering and <b>penetration</b> of the <b>seal</b> by supercritical CO 2. At the same time, swelling may also lead to the closure of fractures or the reduction of fracture apertures, thereby improving seal integrity. The goal of this communication is to theoretically evaluate and discuss these scenarios in greater detail in terms of phenomenological mechanisms, but also in terms of potential risks or benefits for carbon storage...|$|R
