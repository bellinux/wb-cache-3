The <b>pack</b> of <b>cards</b> that is a <b>pack</b> of <b>cards.</b> And the <b>pack</b> of <b>cards</b> that isn't a <b>pack</b> of <b>cards.</b> The hat {{that looks like a}} gentleman's hat.

I can take rabbits out of it, {{goldfish}} out of it, snakes out of it. Only I mustn't take my own head out of it. I suppose I'm a lower animal than a rabbit or a snake. Anyhow they can get out of the conjurer's hat; and I can't. I am a conjurer and nothing else but a conjurer. Unless I could show I was something else, and that would be worse.|$|R

I examined the loose <b>pack,</b> <b>card</b> by card. No writing, no mark of any kind, was visible on any one of them. Assisted by a library ladder which stood against the book-case, I looked next into the two china bowls. Both were perfectly empty. Was there anything more to examine {{on that side of the}} room? In the two corners there were two little chairs of inlaid wood, with red silk cushions. I turned them up and looked under the cushions, and still I made no discoveries. When I had put the chairs back in their places my search on one side of the room was complete. So far I had found nothing.|$|R
