50|$|Roof-prisms designs {{create an}} {{instrument}} that is narrower and more compact than Porro prisms. There is also a difference in image brightness. Porro-prism binoculars will inherently produce a brighter image than roof-prism binoculars of the same magnification, objective size, and optical quality, because the roof-prism design employs silvered surfaces that reduce light transmission by 12% to 15%. Roof-prisms designs also require tighter tolerances for alignment of their optical elements (collimation). This adds to their expense since the design requires them to use fixed elements {{that need to be}} set at a high degree of collimation at the factory. Porro <b>prisms</b> <b>binoculars</b> occasionally need their prism sets to be re-aligned to bring them into collimation. The fixed alignment in roof-prism designs means the binoculars normally will not need re-collimation.|$|R
50|$|Binoculars have a {{long history}} of {{military}} use. Galilean designs were widely used up to the end of the 19th century when they gave way to porro <b>prism</b> types. <b>Binoculars</b> constructed for general military use tend to be more rugged than their civilian counterparts. They generally avoid fragile center focus arrangements in favor of independent focus, which also makes for easier, more effective weatherproofing. Prism sets in military binoculars may have redundant aluminized coatings on their prism sets to guarantee they don't lose their reflective qualities if they get wet.|$|R
50|$|Porro's name is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the prism system which he invented around 1850 and which is used in the construction of Porro <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars.</b>|$|E
50|$|Binoculars {{using either}} a Schmidt-Pechan roof prism or an Abbe-Koenig roof prism benefit from phase coatings. Porro <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars</b> do not split beams and {{therefore}} they do not require any phase coatings.|$|E
50|$|In 1909 {{he joined}} the {{telescope}} division of Carl Zeiss, in Jena, Germany. He began to run the division in 1918. During his years there, he focused mainly on improving submarine periscopes {{as well as the}} scopes on shotguns, <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars,</b> and guns on naval vessels.|$|E
50|$|Most {{telescope}} designs {{produce an}} inverted image at the focal plane; these {{are referred to}} as inverting telescopes. In fact, the image is both turned upside down and reversed left to right, so that altogether it is rotated by 180 degrees from the object orientation. In astronomical telescopes the rotated view is normally not corrected, since it does not affect how the telescope is used. However, a mirror diagonal is often used to place the eyepiece in a more convenient viewing location, and in that case the image is erect, but still reversed left to right. In terrestrial telescopes such as spotting scopes, monoculars and <b>binoculars,</b> <b>prisms</b> (e.g., Porro prisms) or a relay lens between objective and eyepiece are used to correct the image orientation. There are telescope designs that do not present an inverted image such as the Galilean refractor and the Gregorian reflector. These {{are referred to as}} erecting telescopes.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, {{the firm}} became W. Watson & Sons Ltd. On 10 August 1938, Charles Henry Watson died. In 1912, the company {{employed}} their equipment and demonstrated {{the utilization of}} alternating current electricity to enhance the growth of plants in a nursery near London. In 1929, an advertisement in the British Industries Fair Catalogue announced an Optical, Scientific and Photographic Exhibit. The exhibition featured manufacturers of microscopes for medical, industrial, and educational purposes and for the amateur, <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars,</b> astronomical and portable telescopes, photographic lenses and cameras, surveying and measuring instruments, photometers, and scientific apparatus of every description. The W. Watson & Son company exhibited in the Scientific Section at Stand No. N.24. In 1947, the firm was a Listed Exhibitor at the British Industries Fair. The Fair featured manufacturers of microscopes for all purposes and auxiliary optical and mechanical accessories. The company offered photometers, telescopes, <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars,</b> photographic lenses of all types, and optical elements in every form. W. Watson & Son exhibited in the Olympia Room, Ground Floor at Stand No. A.1020.|$|E
50|$|Binoculars using roof prisms {{may have}} {{appeared}} {{as early as}} the 1870s in a design by Achille Victor Emile Daubresse. Most roof <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars</b> use either the Abbe-Koenig prism (named after Ernst Karl Abbe and Albert Koenig and patented by Carl Zeiss in 1905) or the Schmidt-Pechan prism (invented in 1899) designs to erect the image and fold the optical path. They have objective lenses that are approximately in line with the eyepieces.|$|E
5000|$|In aprismatic {{binoculars}} with Keplerian optics (which {{were sometimes}} called [...] "twin telescopes") each tube has {{one or two}} additional lenses (relay lens) between the objective and the ocular. These lenses are used to erect the image. The binoculars with erecting lenses have a serious disadvantage: their length is too long. Such binoculars were popular in the 1800s (for example, G.& S. Merz models), but became obsolete shortly after the Karl Zeiss company introduced improved <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars</b> in the 1890s.|$|E
50|$|Working with Abbe and Otto Schott in Jena {{and with}} Leopold Dippel in Darmstadt, Czapski was {{involved}} in the design and fabrication of new microscope optical systems from the moment he started work in Jena. He subsequently worked on the technical implementation of a binocular microscope based on ideas put forward by the American biologist Horatio S. Greenough. As the company expanded, so too did its range of products: Zeiss started producing photographic objectives in 1890, optical measuring instruments in 1892/93, <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars</b> in 1893/94 (a development based on significant input from Czapski), astronomical instruments in 1897 and image measuring devices in 1901.|$|E
50|$|The company {{grew out}} of {{binocular}} production by the forerunner of Carl Zeiss AG before World War Two. In 1952 {{a part of the}} company VEB Carl Zeiss Jena was established in Eisfeld in what was then East Germany. Starting from tasks as supplier of parts and pre-assembling products for the Zeiss factories in Jena the company continuously developed over the following years to become a producer of precision-engineered optical consumer goods and industrial products. Besides that VEB Carl Zeiss Jena produced military optics for the armed forces of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) like the NVA DF 7x40 and NVA EDF 7x40 roof <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars.</b>|$|E
50|$|Porro <b>prism</b> <b>binoculars</b> {{are named}} after Italian {{optician}} Ignazio Porro who patented this image erecting system in 1854, which was later refined by makers like the Carl Zeiss {{company in the}} 1890s. Binoculars of this type use a Porro prism in a double prism Z-shaped configuration to erect the image. This feature results in binoculars that are wide, with objective lenses that are well separated but offset from the eyepieces. Porro prism designs have {{the added benefit of}} folding the optical path so that the physical length of the binoculars is less than the focal length of the objective and wider spacing of the objectives gives a better sensation of depth. Thus, the size of binoculars is reduced.|$|E
