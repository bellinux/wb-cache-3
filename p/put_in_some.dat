25|$|Inclusion of {{plasticizers}} {{tends to}} lower Tg and increase polymer flexibility. Plasticizers are generally small molecules that are chemically {{similar to the}} polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and reduced interchain interactions. A {{good example of the}} action of plasticizers is related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. An uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no plasticizers in it, because it needs to remain strong and heat-resistant. Plasticized PVC is used in clothing for a flexible quality. Plasticizers are also <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.|$|E

A major overhaul by coach Brian Garvey saw a number of new signings being made, including youngsters Paul Trimboli, David Healy, Kimon Taliadoros and Harry Micheil.

It rained before the Woodward and the track was sloppy, which Riva Ridge could not handle, so Secretariat was entered in his place. Secretariat led into the straight but was overtaken by the Allen Jerkens-trained four-year-old Prove Out, who pulled clear to win by [...] lengths. Prove Out ran the race of his life that day: his time was the second-fastest mile-and-a-half on the dirt in Belmont history despite the sloppy conditions.

Joe Juba of Game Informer said that the changes to Final Fantasy XIIIs battle system made it his favorite Final Fantasy battle system, and that the gameplay was [...] "phenomenal". Ryan Clements of IGN felt that the gameplay was an improvement over XIIIs, fixing many of its problems. Parish stated that XIII-2 was an inversion of XIII in that the gameplay took precedence over the story. He described the battle system as [...] "a joy" [...] {{and said that the}} game was [...] "never not fun". VanOrd agreed that the combat was fun, though he found it to be too easy. The Edge review, which was harsher on the game than most others, also found it to be too easy, which combined with what they saw as poor subquests and a lack of effort <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> regions made the gameplay uninteresting.|$|E

500|$|Vaughn said he {{shot the}} film {{in a way it}} resembled the {{productions}} of the 1960s, with [...] "very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang", and using the anamorphic format [...] "to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the James Bond films". The director had to hire five cinematographers - with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did [...] "forty-five percent, fifty-five percent" [...] of the film - and four assistant directors to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, [...] "keeping with the '60s vibe, we <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> old school elements such as lens flare and chromatic aberration and edge fringing." [...] The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that [...] "could be done with traditional optical".
