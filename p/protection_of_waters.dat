40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the legal {{regulation}} of territorial protection of water in terms of quantity, which is contained in the Water Act. I am only focusing on the Protected Areas of Natural Water Accumulation and Surface Water Accumulation Protected Areas as they have significant potential to reduce the effects of drought.

The legal regulation of the territorial <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> in terms of quantity is discussed in connection with other laws. The aim of this work is to answer the question whether the legal regulation of territorial <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> in terms of quantity in the Water Act is sufficient to enable the Czech Republic to adapt adequately to the ongoing climate change, that ultimately causes the loss of water. The first part of the thesis deals with sources of legal regulation of territorial protection of water in terms of quantity, further includes the systematics of the Water Act and the Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Czech Republic (Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic). The second part analyses the Protected Areas of Natural Water Accumulation, prohibitions therein contained prohibitions, exemption from prohibitions and damage compensation.

40|$|The {{results of}} the water {{stabilization}} treatment studies to feed the cooling water circulation systems by ion exchange method are reported. The processes of the water softener on strongly and weakly acidic cation resins {{in the presence of}} copper ions are studied. The relation of the water purification efficiency from copper and its softening depending on the form of the ion-exchanger and water consumption was determined. It is shown that the use of weakly acidic cation resin in the acid form provides nearly complete decarbonization of water by partial acidification. The use of ion exchangers in salt form allowsto neutralize the waterwith effective mitigation and clean-up of the copper ions. The processes of cation resin regeneration by acidic and saline solutions were analyzed. It is shown that the make-up cooling systems by softened water will introduce stagnant circulation cooling system that will provide reliable <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> from pollution by power plan wastewater copper ions. ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ???????????????? ????????? ???? ??? ???????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????. ??????? ???????? ????????? ???? ?? ??????- ? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????? ????. ?????????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ???? ?? ???? ? ?? ????????? ? ??????????? ?? ????? ?????? ? ??????? ????. ????????, ??? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ???? ??? ????????? ?? ???????????. ?????????? ??????? ? ? ??????? ????? ????????? ?????????????? ???? ??? ??????????? ?? ????????? ? ??????? ?? ????? ????. ??????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ???????? ??????????. ????????, ??? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????????, ??? ????????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ?? ??????????? ?????? ???? ?? ??????? ??? ??????????????...|$|E

A choice experiment was applied to evaluate the benefits, as perceived by inhabitants, of the implementation of policies aiming to reduce the concentration of nitrates in groundwater, preserve the riverscape by maintaining a minimum water flow and increasing hedges and woods along the Serio River in central northern Italy. Findings suggested that people were particularly concerned about groundwater quality, probably because it is strongly linked to human health. Nevertheless, it was interesting to observe that people expressed a high willingness to pay for actions that affect the riverscape as a whole (such as the minimum water flow maintenance plus reforestation). This is probably due to the close connection between the riverscape and the functions of the river area for recreation, health purposes, and biodiversity preservation...|$|E
40|$|The EU Nitrates Directive is of a prime {{importance}} {{in respect of}} sustaining the natural resources for the reduction and prevention of nitrate pollution resulting from agricultural activities, and it constitutes {{an integral part of}} the EU Water Framework Directive. Accepted by the European Council in 1991, the directive entered into force being published in Official Gazette in 2004 in Turkey as “Regulation on the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Waters</b> against Pollution Caused by Nitrates from Agricultural Sources. ” As of this date, works on harmonization have been intensely continued. The works brought together multiple organizations that are notable in terms of waterworks and ensured informatory exchange through the contributions of the EU member states. Approaching to the finalization of its harmonization process, Turkey will proclaim its country either a “border to border nitrate-sensitive zone” or “nitrate vulnerable zone” in order to issue the secondary legislations required by the Nitrates Directive in accordance with these approaches. This paper covers the current works conducted with regard to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive and it has been prepared aiming at inviting attentions to the current and possible complications in the implementation process. ...|$|E
40|$|This section defines {{impaired}} waters, outlines designated beneficial {{uses for}} surface waters, and summarizes {{the water quality}} standards {{that are necessary to}} support those uses. In addition, this section summarizes current water quality data available for East Canyon Reservoir and provides an assessment of the support status of beneficial uses. 3. 1 BENEFICIAL USES AND IMPAIRED WATERS The main purpose of the CWA is the improvement and protection of water quality through the restoration and maintenance of the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> under the CWA consists of three main components: designating beneficial uses, establishing water quality criteria to protect those uses, and antidegradation policies and procedures. Under section 303 (d) of the CWA, each state must submit a list to the EPA identifying waters throughout the state that are not achieving water quality standards in spite of the application of technology-based controls in NPDES permits. The waters identified on the 303 (d) list are known as impaired waters. The State of Utah designates beneficial uses to all of the surface waters in the state according to the classes outlined in Table 3. 1.
