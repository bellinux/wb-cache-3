50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Russia have developed a deep cooperation designed to assure the security of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. While a number of steps have been taken to consolidate and improve the security of Russia’s strategic nuclear arms, particularly under the Cooperative Threat Reduction <b>program,</b> <b>concern</b> remains over the security of the Russian tactical nuclear weapons arsenal. In particular, a serious debate has arisen over the status of what are known as “suitcase nuclear weapons,” very small Soviet-era nuclear devices. This debate is all the more relevant when one considers the potential destruction that could occur should such a device {{fall into the hands of}} an organization like al-Qaeda. The term suitcase nuke is generally used to describe any type of small, man-portable nuclear device although there is serious debate as to the validity of the term itself. In a worst case analysis, a suitcase nuke would be small enough to be hand-carried into a major population or leadership center (downtown Manhattan or Capitol Hill, for example) undetected and then detonated. Although, by most accounts, the yield of such a device is likely far less than ten kilotons, its combined effects may have the potential to kill tens of thousands, if not more. There is a great deal of confusion over just how many of these suitcase devices exist or if they even exist at all. By some accounts, the Soviet Union built hundreds of these devices, of which several dozen are missing. Based on other reports, suitcase nukes were never built in large numbers or were never deployed. There is no definitive open source information on the number, location, security, or status of these suitcase nuclear bombs. Barring full disclosure from official government sources, one can only look back on the statements made up to this point and attempt to understand the range of possible truths about suitcase nukes. In any event, the uncertainty of the situation should remain a source of concern, particularly in light of the interest of terrorist networks in weapons of mass destruction.|$|E

Since 16 sandhill cranes (G. canadensIs) had been mistakenly shot prior to the <b>program,</b> <b>concern</b> was that whooping cranes might also be shot. The Bosque Snow Goose Hunter Training Program was initiated in 1977, consisting of a 1 -hour slide/tape presentatIon and a 10 -minute bird identification test. Modifications to hunt procedures and the requirement of all hunters to attend the hunter training program resulted in zero shooting incidents regarding whooping cranes in a 12 -year period.

40|$|Aspect-oriented advice {{increases}} {{the number of}} places one must consider during reasoning, since advice may affect all method calls and field accesses. MAO, a new variant of AspectJ, demonstrates how to simplify reasoning by allowing programmers, if they choose, to declare limits on the control and heap effects of advice. Heap effects, such as assignment to object fields, are specified using concern domains [...] declared partitions of the heap. By declaring the concern domains affected by methods and advice, programmers can separate objects owned by the base program and by various aspects. When desired, programmers can also use such concern domain annotations to check that advice cannot interfere with the base program or with other aspects. Besides allowing programmers to declare how concerns interact in a <b>program,</b> <b>concern</b> domains also support a simple kind of semantic pointcut. These features make reasoning about control and heap effects easier...|$|E

The following are used to evaluate results: individual and group talks, specific observation scales, and video recordings of some meetings. In common with other authors, the observations lead one to think that controlled physical activities would be a useful element for integrating into an eating disorders cure project...|$|E
40|$|Assessment {{of science}} process {{skills in the}} {{elementary}} school is essential to a hands-on science <b>program.</b> <b>Concern</b> arises with the realization that there are few performance assessment instruments of science process skills, and most of the available instruments do not have documented reliability and validity standards. This study examines {{the reliability and validity of}} a set of science performance assessment instruments through the application of currently available statistical methods. The Performance Assessment of Science Skills (PASS) tests, which were formulated by S. M. Johnson as an alternative assessment of science process skills {{in the elementary school}} grades, are the subject of investigation. Third-grade students completed PASS instruments which measured the process skills of observation, binary classification, and measurement, and fifth-grade students completed PASS instruments which measured the science process skills of prediction, designing a controlled experiment, and hierarchicalclassification. Reliability and validity for the PASS instruments focused on alternate form reliability, internal reliability, inter-rater reliability and construct validity. This study revealed that statistical reliability and validity can be documented for some alternative assessments of science process skills. Department of BiologyThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Iraq’s biological weapons <b>program,</b> <b>concern</b> regarding the threat of biological warfare has increased (1). Anthrax immunizations; increased nuclear, biological, and chemical defense training; improved detection systems and protective gear; and increased vigilance have been instituted to protect the military. However, the military {{is not the only}} population at risk for biological attack. To effectively counter the potentially devastating effects of an attack, we need to understand the basic epidemiologic principles of biological agents used as weapons. A biological agent is commonly portrayed as a genetically engineered organism resistant to all known vaccines and drugs, highly contagious, and able to harm thousands of people. However, alleged attacks by the Aum Shinrikyo did not result in a single illness from a biological agent (2), and the successful 1984 contamination of salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon, by a religious cult involved a common salmonella strain that was not lethal or contagious and was susceptible to antibiotics (3). Therefore, our level of suspicion and diligence in identifying and reacting to a biological attack must remain high, since the attack may not follow an expected pattern. Furthermore, a small outbreak of illness could be an early warning of a more serious attack, and recognition and prompt institution of preventive measures (such as effective vaccines and antibiotics) could save thousands of lives. To facilitate the rapid identification of a bioterrorist attack, all health-care providers and public health personnel should have basic epidemiologic skills and knowledge of what to expect in such a setting...|$|E
40|$|Submission to the Friends of Fondren Library Graduate Research Awards, 2017. This {{paper was}} {{originally}} prepared for Course ARCH 646 (Fall 2016) : History and Theory of Architecture III, given by Professor Scott Colman, Department of Architecture. This paper studies the “Club of the New Social Type” by Ivan Leonidov in 1928, a research study project for {{a prototype of}} workers’ club. As a project in the early stage of Leonidov’s career, it embodies various sources of influences upon the architect from Suprematism to Constructivism. The extremity in the abstraction of forms, specific consideration of programs and the social ambition of Soviet avant-garde present themselves in three different dimensions. Therefore, the paper aims to analyze the relationships of the three aspects to investigate the motivation and thinking {{in the process of}} translating a brief into a project. Through the close reading of the drawings against the historical context, the paper characterizes the project as socialism and representational utopia. The first part of the paper would discuss the socialist aspect of the “Club of the New Social Type”. I will argue that the project demonstrates Leonidov’s interest in collective rather than individual not only spatially, but also in term of mass behavior and <b>program</b> <b>concern.</b> In the second part, the arguments will be organized on the representation technique in the drawings which renders the project in a utopian aesthetic. It reveals the ambition that the club would function as a prototype for the society and be adopted universally. Throughout the paper, the project would be constantly situated in the genealogy of architectural history for a comparison of ideas...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an outcome and impact {{evaluation}} of Concern Worldwide (CW) community feeding <b>program.</b> <b>Concern</b> Worldwide conducted a community feeding program in Nyanga District in 2012. It {{was responding to}} the National Food Report (2011) issued by the government on the food shortages in Nyanga District. The feeding program supported Nyanga communities with nutritional supplements and food provisions to households. The goal of Concern Worldwide was {{to address the problems}} of hunger, household food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty which were affecting people in Nyanga. Four evaluation questions about program outcomes were used as a framework for the evaluation and included: How feasible are livelihood feeding schemes as methods of providing food safety net?; How are short-term emergency programmes converted into long term benefits for communities?; What are the interventions available in the program to ensure fulfilment of goals and community empowerment?; What lessons can be derived from the projects {{that can be used in}} future by Concern Worldwide and other NGOs involved in emergency and other developmental projects? For the purposes of the study three data sources were consulted. These included program documents, CW officials and beneficiaries. Data collection methods used included face to face interviews and both closed and open ended questionnaires. The qualitative data was analysed through content analysis and presented graphically and descriptively. The findings showed that the community feeding program made some impact through food provisions and agriculture inputs to the beneficiaries which was highly regarded and appreciated. It also managed to provide training on drought resistant crop farming and management of harvests. Monitoring and evaluation of the feeding program was identified as a critical tool in creating efficiency and accountability of the program. Although training was provided to all the beneficiaries, not all were directly involved in the daily routine activities of the program a goal that is not achievable in the context of community feeding program...|$|E
