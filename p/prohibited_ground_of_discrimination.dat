5000|$|Solomon Islands is {{currently}} reforming its Constitution. In {{the first draft}} of 2009 of the new Constitution of the proposed Federal Democratic Republic of Solomon Islands, [...] "sexual orientation" [...] was explicitly and newly included as a <b>prohibited</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> In the 2011 draft and the 2013 draft, {{there was no mention of}} [...] "sexual orientation". In the latest second 2014 draft (published on 6 May 2014), it became explicitly stated that [...] "sexual orientation" [...] is not a <b>prohibited</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> This Constitutional allowance of discrimination on the basis of [...] "sexual orientation" [...] is contradicting international human rights. There is mounting concern about this, and the executive director of a LGBT rights organization has mentioned that they consider to involve a special expert of the United Nations to intervene in pending legislation. If one reads the latest draft of the upcoming Constitution literally, it even allows for the advocacy of hatred (and incitement to cause harm) on the basis of sexual orientation. That newly drafted Constitution is expected to factually replace the existing Constitution by late 2016.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{dismissal}} of his appeal Mossop declared the decision a success as it opened up a national debate on gay rights. A subsequent Supreme Court case to consider discrimination against gay persons, Egan v.

5000|$|On the {{question}} of whether there was {{discrimination on the basis of}} [...] "family status", the court found that there was no grounds for Mossop's claim because Parliament intentionally excluded sexual orientation from the list <b>of</b> <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Since the intent was clear, both the Federal Court and Tribunal were bound to apply the law.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that section 28 of the Constitution marked the {{importance}} specifically given {{to the protection of}} the rights of children, which included not only those rights expressly conferred by section 28, but also all the other constitutional rights which, appropriately construed, were conferred upon children. Children could therefore not, any more than adults, be subjected to unfair <b>discrimination</b> in breach <b>of</b> section 9(3). Two <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> were relevant in this case, the first relating to sex, and the other to birth.|$|R
5000|$|The law amends the Canadian Human Rights Act {{by adding}} [...] "gender {{identity}} or expression" [...] as a <b>prohibited</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> [...] That makes {{it illegal to}} deny services, employment, accommodation and similar benefits to individuals based on their gender identity or gender expression within a federal regulated industry. A person who denies benefits because of the gender identity or gender expression of another person could be liable to provide monetary reimbursement. This prohibition would only apply to matters within federal jurisdiction.|$|E

5000|$|In 1985, Brian Mossop, a gay {{man from}} Toronto, sought {{bereavement}} leave from his employer, the Canadian federal government's Translation Bureau, to attend the funeral of his same-sex partner's father. His partner is journalist and activist Ken Popert. His employer denied him leave under the collective agreement {{on the grounds that}} Popert was not [...] "immediate family". Mossop took his employer before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Sexual orientation was not a <b>prohibited</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> at that time, so he argued that he had been discriminated against {{on the basis of his}} [...] "family status", under section 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} reading for the Statutes Amendment Bill (No 4) in April 2014, Louisa Wall {{submitted}} a Supplementary Order Paper requesting an amendment of s21(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1993 to include gender {{identity as a}} <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Whilst it has been accepted by the government for several years that transgender people are already protected under the prohibition on sexual discrimination, Louisa Wall argued that the minor change would be a technical one to confirm and clarify this.

40|$|This article {{considers}} two {{debates that}} are currently raging among scholars of political and legal theory. The first debate, among political theorists, focuses on the correct way for the politically progressive to imagine the problems of justice—as centered on problems of material distribution (the distributive paradigm), cultural recognition, or some complex combination of the two. The second debate, among scholars of antidiscrimination law, turns {{on the relationship between}} the <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in those laws and the social groups found in most nation-states characterized by an increasing degree of social heterogeneity along a number of dimensions—race, religion, ethnicity, gender, and so on. In this article, I take up both of these debates in a specific institutional setting: the interpretation and application of anti-discrimination laws in the context of employment. My claim is that anti-discrimination laws are best understood as measures that effectuate the distributive paradigm’s commitment to justice for individuals. But at the same time, those laws enumerate <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> (e. g. race, sex, religion and national origin) that define social groups, the unit of analysis for the politics of recognition. My concern is that difficulties with anti-discrimination laws identified by critics from the left inhere in legal regimes that are justified by one way of imagining the problems of justice (the distributive paradigm), but which rely on social entities that carry normative force in another (the paradigm of recognition) ...|$|R
5000|$|McClung {{presided over}} the provincial appeal in Vriend v. Alberta, {{overturning}} the trial court's judgment in favour of Delwin Vriend, who had lost his job at a religious college because of his sexual orientation. In a manner uncharacteristic of its criticism of lower court decisions, however, The Supreme Court of Canada excoriated Justice McClung's reasoning {{for the kind of}} [...] "neutral difference" [...] approach argued unsuccessfully by the BC Government in its Eldridge decision.

5000|$|On 7 March 2013, Mathias Reynard, {{member of}} the Social Democratic Party, {{introduced}} in the Swiss Parliament a bill to outlaw all [...] "discrimination and incitement of hatred" [...] (discrimination et incitation à la haine), {{on the basis of}} [...] "race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation". On 11 March 2015, the National Council approved the bill. It was passed 103-73. The Committee of Legal Affairs of the Council of States allowed the bill to proceed on 23 April 2015.

50|$|The bill is {{intended}} to protect individuals from discrimination within the sphere of federal jurisdiction and from being the targets of hate propaganda, {{as a consequence of}} their gender identity or their gender expression. The bill adds “gender identity or expression” to the list <b>of</b> <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code. It also adds that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on a person’s gender identity or expression constitutes an aggravating circumstance for a court to consider when imposing a criminal sentence.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, the House of Commons passed {{at third}} reading NDP MP Bill Siksay's Bill C-389, {{to amend the}} federal Canadian Human Rights Act to include gender {{identity}} and gender expression as <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> under Canadian federal anti-discrimination laws, at third reading, but it died on the order paper in the Senate when Parliament was dissolved. The bill was reintroduced as Bill C-279 in the subsequent Parliament and passed second reading on June 6, 2012. June 2012 also saw the addition of gender identity and gender expression to the Ontario Human Rights Code and of gender identity to the Manitoba Human Rights Code.|$|R
50|$|Claimants or courts {{may have}} {{difficulty}} choosing the right comparator group. For example, to assess whether a government’s act had consequences in terms of equality of treatment, the claimant {{would need to be}} situated in a group that would then be compared to another group that is being treated differently. For example, in the case of Vriend v. Alberta, the claim was that the exclusion of ‘sexual orientation’ as a <b>prohibited</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the Alberta Individual Rights Protection Act amounted to discrimination. To understand if this omission treated homosexuals differently from other vulnerable groups, they would need to be compared to just such groups. However, if the claim is that the failure to include homosexuals perpetuated oppression against them, then the relevant comparator group might be dominant social groups that oppress homosexuals.|$|E
5000|$|The Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms {{is unique}} among Canadian (and North American) human rights {{documents}} {{in that it}} covers not only the fundamental (civil and political) human rights, but also {{a number of important}} social and economic rights. The protections contained in the charter are inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination included in the Quebec charter is extensive; a total of fourteen prohibited grounds are enumerated, including race, colour, ethnic or national origin, sex, pregnancy and age. [...] "Social condition" [...] has been a <b>prohibited</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> since the charter came into force. Discrimination based on sexual orientation has been prohibited since 1977; with that change, Quebec became the first jurisdiction larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination. In 2016, gender identity or expression was added to the Quebec Charter.|$|E
5000|$|In Gauthier v. Canadian Armed Forces, {{three women}} brought claims before a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal {{alleging that the}} Canadian Armed Forces had refused them {{employment}} {{on the basis of}} their gender, and that this was inconsistent with the Human Rights Act. The Canadian Armed Forces conceded that their policies were discriminatory, but relied on section 15(1)(a) to argue that they should be granted an exception based on a bona fide occupational requirement. They claimed that including women in certain specialized roles could undermine “operational effectiveness” and pose too much risk. [...] Isabelle Gauthier, a claimant working for the reserves, was refused a request to transfer location, because her desired location had already reached its 10% female quota. Following the complaint, the Canadian Armed Forces modified their policy to allocate reserve force positions based on susceptibility to combat or operational duty rather than gender. The Tribunal ordered the Canadian Armed Forces pay to the complainant $1,000 for suffering and loss of dignity in being refused employment, and $5,481 for lost wages.Marie-Claude Gauthier, a second claimant, was qualified to be a marine engineering technician, but was not permitted entry since the trade was not open to women. She relied on sections 5a and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which forbid denying a service and depriving employment opportunities on the basis of a <b>prohibited</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The tribunal ordered that the marine engineering technician program be open to women who meet the required educational level and have enrolled in the CAF.|$|E
30|$|The {{essence of}} the Canadian Human Rights Act (Minister of Justice, n.d.) is to ensure all {{individuals}} have equal and fair opportunities to establish their lives without being prevented in doing so by discriminatory practices (Canadian Human Rights Act, Sec. 1). The Canadian Human Rights Act (Sec. 3) continues to describe the <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> as race, ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, family status, sexual orientation, colour, marital status, or disability. For the purposes of our discussion {{it is important to}} note that age is included as one <b>of</b> the <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> for <b>discrimination.</b> As a result, confidentiality of minors cannot be simply dismissed due to age alone. The health care practitioner must recognize that children have basic rights and should consider maintaining confidentiality under specific circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the more}} {{significant}} {{pieces of legislation}} adopted in the first session was the governments response to Carter v Canada (Attorney General). Bill C-14 inserted the term [...] "medical assistance in dying" [...] into the Criminal Code, and made provisions for adult Canadians {{to engage in the}} practice. Introduced by the Minister of Justice, Bill C-14 was passed with a free vote for both Liberal and Conservative party members. The Minister of Justice also introduced Bill C-16 which added [...] "gender identity or expression" [...] to the list <b>of</b> <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code - only 40 members opposed the bill, all from the Conservative Party who were granted a free vote.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled on}} May 25, 1995. The court ruled against Egan {{on the issue}} of spousal benefits, finding that the {{restriction}} of such benefits to heterosexual couples was a justified infringement because the core purpose of such benefits was to provide financial support to women who had spent their lives raising children rather than in paid employment — however, they ruled unanimously to include sexual orientation as a <b>prohibited</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The latter ruling was seen as a significant victory for LGBT rights in Canada despite the loss on the benefits issue itself, setting the stage for later successes in the courts; it came to be cited as a key precedent in important later court decisions such as M. v. H., Vriend v. Alberta, Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada, and Halpern v. Canada.|$|R
