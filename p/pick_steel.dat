40|$|The steel {{industry}} {{is responsible for}} nearly 9 % of anthropogenic energy utilization in the world. It is urgent to reduce the total energy utilization of {{steel industry}} under the huge pressures on reducing energy consumption and CO 2 emission. Meanwhile, the steel manufacturing is a typical continuous-discrete process with multiprocedures, multiobjects, multiconstraints, and multimachines coupled, which makes energy management rather difficult. In order to study the energy flow within the real steel production process, this paper presents a new modeling and optimization method for the process based on Hybrid Petri Nets (HPN) in consideration of the situation above. Firstly, we introduce the detailed description of HPN. Then the real steel production process from one typical integrated steel plant is transformed into Hybrid Petri Net model as a case. Furthermore, we obtain a series of constraints of our optimization model from this model. In consideration of the real process situation, we <b>pick</b> the <b>steel</b> production, energy efficiency and self-made gas surplus as the main optimized goals in this paper. Afterwards, a fuzzy linear programming method is conducted to obtain the multiobjective optimization results. Finally, some measures are suggested to improve this low efficiency and high whole cost process structure...|$|R

Sean Chen was initially announced as the artist, but due to scheduling problems, Ed Benes took over the art duties. Steel finds himself {{the only person who}} can defend Metropolis from an attack by Doomsday. During the battle, Doomsday inexplicably develops metallic armor and the power of flight, countering Steel's own abilities. Steel attempts to immobilise Doomsday with nanites, but he quickly overcomes them, and badly beats him. Doomsday then <b>picks</b> up <b>Steel's</b> prone form and flies off with him. When Steel awakens to find himself in a dimensional prison with Superboy, Supergirl, the Eradicator, and Hank Henshaw all of whom have been captured by Doomsday, he speculates that Henshaw was included in the group to keep them divided and prevent them working together to find a way of escaping. Their subsequent exploration of their prison reveals that they were actually captured by clones of Doomsday created by Lex Luthor to distract Earth's heroes while he sought the power of the Black Power Ring, each Doomsday clone designed to eliminate the Superman it was sent after.|$|R

40|$|In hot steel {{rolling the}} {{continuous}} exposure of metal to air produces {{a layer of}} oxide scale {{on the surface of}} the steel. This layer of scale separates the work roll from the metal substrate. Its behavior and features affect the roll bite tribology and final quality of the product. This study aims to characterize the oxide scale features and improve our understanding of the behavior of oxide scale during hot rolling. Oxide scale surface topography features and the morphology of scale layers were analyzed by SEM, X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and AFM. The kinetics of growth of the layer of scale of low-carbon steel and a mild-steel were carried out on a Gleeble- 3500 Thermal Mechanical Simulation System to simulate a hot finishing strip mill. An investigation of scale growth on an as-supplied surface proved that the growth of the original 21 μm layer of scale decreased as the steel oxidized further. The effects of hot rolling on the surface roughness and oxide layers such as reduction, roll speed, and entry temperature, were investigated to identify any significant parameters. Hot rolling experiments were carried out on a HILLE- 100 experimental rolling mill. Five lubricating modes were used in the rolling tests to examine the deformation behavior of the oxide scale layer and changes to its surface roughness, these included dry rolling and water, oil/water emulsions and pure oil. The effects of the original ground sample surface roughness in analyzing the outcome of surface features after hot rolling was also taken into account. The surface profiles of the scale layer and the <b>picked</b> <b>steel</b> surface, where the scale were removed with an inhibitor-added hydrochloric acid, were analyzed. The temperature and reduction showed a significant change, i. e., the lower the temperature the greater the reduction and less surface roughness. On the other hand, rolling speed had a limited effect on surface roughness. The surface roughness of the original sample affects the product profiles when reduction is smaller than 35 % and also, the effect of lubrication depends on reduction. The effect of the thickness of the oxide scale on the roughness of the pickled surface is affected by lubrication. In this present study, the deformation behavior of oxide scale was investigated on two types of scale, the primary at 330 - 512 μm in thickness and the secondary at 41 - 80 μm in thickness. After rolling, it was observed that the thickness of secondary scale layer reduces more than the primary scale layer, while in turn the latter reduces more than the metal substrates. AFM images and SEM results demonstrate that the secondary oxide scale layer is a little ductile. Crack developments in both primary and secondary scale were discussed according to reduction and stalled rolling, respectively. It was found in the present study that fresh metal extruded up the cracks in the secondary oxide scale but were unable to touch the roll surface. An index γ was introduced to describe the secondary oxide scale expansion property due to hot rolling. An inverse calculation of the coefficient of friction found no significant effect on the coefficient of friction from the thickness of the secondary oxide scale layers at the exit of the roll bite. Two empirical equations that correlate the coefficient of friction μ with the reduction ε (%), roll speed v (m/s) and absolute temperature T have been obtained...|$|R

Of the 44 samples analysed 26 carried Fusarium verticillioides, 11 F. subglutinans, two F. graminearum and five carried fungi different from Fusarium. The pathogenicity of ten isolates, seven of F. verticillioides and three of F. subglutinans, were tested. Per isolate 30 ears of the susceptible cultivar Mishca were inoculated by pricking a steel pin, dipped into a spore suspension, through the husks in {{the central part of}} the ear 14 days after mid-silk. Ears inoculated with sterile water and ears without any treatment, natural infection, served as controls. The disease severity (DS) of the ears ranged from 14 to 58 % ear rot, the range being similar for both species. The DS of the water control, 19 %, was much higher than that of the natural control of 2 %. Five strains gave a DS of over 40 %, significantly higher than the water control. The DS of the others were similar to the water control. In a series of experiments the effect of various methods of applying Fusarium spores through the husks into young ears were compared. All tested methods resulted in DSs significantly higher than those of the two controls. Inoculation with tooth <b>picks</b> and <b>steel</b> pins dipped in a spore suspension gave similar ear rot percentages. Inoculations at 7 to 14 days after mid-silk produced the highest DS¿s. There was no significant effect of spore concentration on the DS. Cultivars differed considerably, the range being from around 20 % to over 50 %. Surprisingly, only wounding the husks, the sterile water control, resulted in a fairly high DS, much higher than that of the natural control. As the ranking order of the cultivars after wounding only and after inoculation did not seem to be different from the ranking order of the natural control it is suggested to use in areas with high inoculum pressures like the Andes only wounding by means of a steel pin for screening for resistance to maize ear rot...|$|R
40|$|Korngården AB is {{the biggest}} hop {{producer}} in Sweden. They {{are located in the}} south of the country and their farm currently consists of 5000 m 2. Korngården AB is a newly founded company and is just starting up its business. The next step forward in their development is investing in a hop harvester. Therefore, in this thesis a first draft for a portable hop harvester is presented. The goal of this project was to design a machine that can be easily transported between hop farms in the vicinity and harvest 50 – 100 bines per hour. Starting up this project a study of hop harvesting solutions was made. To give this project a target I was provided with a specification of user demands by Korngården AB. During the concept generation different solutions were developed {{and with the help of}} a Pugh matrix the solutions was compared against each other. The chosen concept was 3 -D modeled in the CAD program SolidWorks. During this process a number of companies was contacted to get an idea of what this hop harvester would cost to produce. This turned in to the cost estimate which was one of the goals of this thesis. From the 3 -d models assembly drawings was created. The result of this thesis is a hop harvester that strips the bines using <b>steel</b> <b>picking</b> fingers that hits the cones and leaves of the bine. The cones and leaves are then separated using a series of tilted rubber bands. When exiting the striping section the bine will be chopped into smaller pieces using a wood chipper. At the moment the cost estimate shows that the hop harvester would cost around 200 000 sek to produce which is 25 000 sek more than what Korngården AB specified in their specification of user demands.

50|$|The WWF Intercontinental Championship match {{began with}} Ken Shamrock using kicks and leg sweeps to keep Mankind at a {{distance}} before morphing an arm bar into a fireman's carry takedown. Shamrock's technical style was shortly overturned by the bruiser style of Mankind, who pushed him into corners delivering punches until, reversing an Irish whip, Mankind applied the mandible claw which Shamrock quickly leapt out from, recuperating outside the ring. When Shamrock entered the ring, Mankind caught him into a full nelson chickenwing submission, from which he tried to apply the mandible claw from behind. As Shamrock escaped back outside the ring, Mankind followed him and threw him into the steel steps. He then <b>picked</b> up a <b>steel</b> chair but as he went to strike down Shamrock, he was kicked in the midsection and Shamrock struck Mankind with the chair instead - the referee did not disqualify Shamrock for it. As the two re-entered the ring, Shamrock tried to submit Mankind with a shoulder lock to which Mankind responded by biting his opponent to escape. Despite this, Shamrock still managed a side belly to belly suplex {{but to no avail}} as Mankind pummeled the champion in the corner, finishing with a jumping elbow drop into the Tree of Woe positioned Shamrock. Again the match fell outside of the ring, with Shamrock powerslamming a running Mankind against the steel steps.

40|$|Lube pump gears of an Aircraft Mounted Accessory Gearbox (AMAGB) {{were found}} to have cracks on the face and gear root areas after {{completion}} of 290 h of flight trials and 1000 h of endurance test respectively. After a preliminary investigation, the subject gears were forwarded to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. The gears were provided in cut-pieces. Dye penetrant inspection (DPI) carried out showed presence of cracks in gears AGB 02 1008 and AGB 02 1009. The DPI signatures were very feeble indicating that the cracks were very tight. Subsequent examination of the gears in scanning electron microscope revealed presence of one crack in gear AGB 02 1008 and six cracks in gear AGB 02 1009. However, no cracks could be identified on the available portion of gear AGB 02 1013. A few representative cracks observed in gear AGB 02 1009 were pulled open for further study. All these cracks {{were found to}} be very shallow and they were found to be confined only to the carburized layer. Macroscopic examination of the crack surface gave no evidence of corrosion, fatigue marks or rapid ductile failure. Based on these, the crack generation either by fatigue mechanism or stress corrosion cracking (SCC) was ruled out. Electron fractographic study, however, showed typical brittle, intergranular mode of crack propagation, suggestive of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) failure. Investigation revealed that the gears were given phosphating treatment. In view of the hydrogen embrittlement as the cause of crack generation, the question arises whether or not the phosphating treatment had been performed as per standard practice. It is reported that the phosphating treatment involved electrolytic processes. Therefore, the possibility of hydrogen embrittlement is inherent in this case. In the event of not performing baking operation after phosphating treatment, failure by hydrogen embrittlement is inevitable. Metallurgical examination showed that neither the chemical composition of the steel nor the hardness profile of the gears conformed to the specification. The gear material was found to contain high amount of MnS inclusions. The effective case depth and the core hardness were found to be more than the specifications in all gears. In addition, the surface of the gears was found to have asperities resulting during the phosphating treatment. In summary, the gears in question have failed by HE. The <b>steel</b> <b>picked</b> up hydrogen during phosphating treatment. The susceptibility to HE was further increased due to high hardness in the material, stress concentrations in the hard carburized layer, and more importantly, presence of MnS in the microstructure. ...|$|R
