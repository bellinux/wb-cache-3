60|$|The {{problem of}} the Deductive Method is, to find the law of an effect, from {{the laws of the}} {{different}} tendencies of which it is the joint result. The first requisite, therefore, is to know the laws of those tendencies; the law of each of the concurrent causes: and this supposes a previous process of observation or experiment upon each cause separately; or else a <b>previous</b> <b>deduction,</b> which also must depend for its ultimate premises on observation or experiment. Thus, if the subject be social or historical phenomena, the premises of the Deductive Method must be the laws of the causes which determine that class of phenomena; and those causes are human actions, together with the general outward circumstances under the influence of which mankind are placed, and which constitute man’s position on the earth. The Deductive Method, applied to social phenomena, must begin, therefore, by investigating, or must suppose to have been already investigated, the laws of human action, and those properties of outward things by which the actions of human beings in society are determined. Some of these general truths will naturally be obtained by observation and experiment, others by deduction: the more complex laws of human action, for example, may be deduced from the simpler ones; but the simple or elementary laws will always, and necessarily, have been obtained by a directly inductive process.|$|E
60|$|Whatever {{may be the}} {{efficacy}} of this method, it is, as we long ago remarked, not a method of pure observation and experiment; it concludes, not from a comparison of instances, but from the comparison of an instance with {{the result of a}} <b>previous</b> <b>deduction.</b> Applied to social phenomena, it presupposes that the causes from which part of the effect proceeded are already known; and as we have shown that these can not have been known by specific experience, they must have been learned by deduction from principles of human nature; experience being called in only as a supplementary resource, to determine the causes which produced an unexplained residue. But if the principles of human nature may be had recourse to for the establishment of some political truths, they may for all. If it be admissible to say, England must have prospered by reason of the prohibitory system, because after allowing for all the other tendencies which have been operating, there is a portion of prosperity still to be accounted for; it must be admissible to go to the same source for the effect of the prohibitory system, and examine what account the laws of human motives and actions will enable us to give of its tendencies. Nor, in fact, will the experimental argument amount to any thing, except in verification of a conclusion drawn from those general laws. For we may subtract the effect of one, two, three, or four causes, but we shall never succeed in subtracting the effect of all causes except one; while it would be a curious instance of the dangers of too much caution if, to avoid depending on a priori reasoning concerning the effect of a single cause, we should oblige ourselves to depend on as many separate a priori reasonings as there are causes operating concurrently with that particular cause in some given instance.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} orthogonal polynomials {{are given}} as the polynomial solutions Pn(x) of the differential equationσ(x) y″(x) +τ(x) y′(x) +λny(x) = 0,where σ(x) {{turns out to}} be a polynomial of at most second degree and τ(x) is a polynomial of first degree. In a similar way, the classical discrete orthogonal polynomials are the polynomial solutions of the difference equationσ(x) Δ∇y(x) +τ(x) Δy(x) +λny(x) = 0,where Δy(x) =y(x+ 1) −y(x) and ∇y(x) =y(x) −y(x− 1) denote the forward and backward difference operators, respectively. Finally, the classical q-orthogonal polynomials of the Hahn tableau are the polynomial solutions of the q-difference equationσ(x) DqD 1 /qy(x) +τ(x) Dqy(x) +λq,ny(x) = 0,whereDqf(x) =f(qx) −f(x) (q− 1) x,q≠ 1,denotes the q-difference operator. We show by a purely algebraic deduction — without using the orthogonality of the families considered — that a structure formula of the typeσ(x) D 1 /qPn(x) =αnPn+ 1 (x) +βnPn(x) +γnPn− 1 (x) (n∈N≔{ 1, 2, 3,…}) is valid. Moreover, our approach does not only prove this assertion, but generates the form of this structure formula. A similar argument applies to the discrete and continuous cases and yieldsσ(x) ∇Pn(x) =αnPn+ 1 (x) +βnPn(x) +γnPn− 1 (x) (n∈N) andσ(x) Pn′(x) =αnPn+ 1 (x) +βnPn(x) +γnPn− 1 (x) (n∈N). Whereas the latter formulas are well-known, their <b>previous</b> <b>deduction</b> used the orthogonality property. Hence our approach is also of interest in these cases...|$|E

Comencem presentant els organismes emissors de normes al llarg del temps i analitzant la totalitat d’aquestes. Així, hem pogut deduir una estructura general de les mateixes, que serveix de patró per a la seva interpretació i que permet elaborar-ne una fitxa individualitzada -incloses com annex-. A continuació, hem estructurat l’activitat econòmica seguint un enfocament dinàmic, el qual permet definir els diferents processos d’actuació de l’empresa en la seva activitat. De la concurrència dels dos {{elements}} anteriors, n’ha resultat la part final de l’estudi, que facilita la interpretació i aplicació de les Normes Internacionals d’Informació Financera, en el registre de les operacions empresarials, sense entrar en casuístiques determinades. The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to find a}} method that facilitates the quick and safe access to each one of the International Accounting Standards, as well as to systematize the accounting treatment of the various operations of the company and so, establish the guidelines for the International Accounting Standards application to each of these operations. First of all, we present the main accounting standards-setters over time and analyse all the accounting rules. Based on these analyses, we give support to the hypothesis of the existence of a general underlying structure, common to all the accounting rules; and that this structure {{could be used as a}} common pattern in their interpretation. Due to the <b>previous</b> <b>deduction</b> we could elaborate individual tabs for each of the accounting standards -included in the annex-. Moreover, we have structured the economic activity following a dynamic approach that has allowed us to define the various strategic actions undertaken by a company to develop its activity. The join analysis of the two elements mentioned above is presented in the final part of the thesis. The objective of this analysis is to enable the interpretation and application of the International Financial Reporting Standards in the registration of the companies’ operations in their accounting statements, without going into specific cases...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} paper it was {{demonstrated that the}} summer-flowering gladiolus contained thirteen kids of anthocyanins which were derived from kinds anthocyanidins combined with three patterns of glycosylation. The present investigation was undertaken to uncover the anthocyanin constitution of the early-flowering gladiolus. The results obtained were summarized as follows; 1. Twelve kinds of anthocyanins were identified. They were pelargonidin- 3 -glucoside, pelargonidin- 3 -rhamnosylglucoside, pelargonidin- 3, 5 -diglucoside, pelargonidin- 3 -rhamnosylglucoside- 5 -glucoside, malvidin- 3 -glucoside, malvidin- 3 -rhamanosylglucoside, malvidin- 3, 5 -diglucoside, malvidin- 3 -rhamnosylglucoside- 5 -glucoside, petuidin- 3 -glucoside, petunidin- 3 -rhamnosylglucoside, petunidin- 3, 5 -diglucoside and petunidin- 3 -rhamnosylglucoside- 5 -glucoside. 2. Of these twelve anthocyanins, eight were in common {{with those of the}} summer-flowering strain and the remaining four were identified {{for the first time in}} this investigation. These newly identified were pelargonidin- 3 -glucoside, malvidin- 3 -glucoside, petunidin- 3 -glucoside and petunidin- 3 -rhamnosvlglucoside. 3. In {{the previous}} paper it was deduced that the 3 -glucoside might be the key intermediate toward the more highly glycosylated anthocyanin in the pigment biosynthesis. In this experiment the 3 -glucoside was disclosed to be actually present, thus supporting the <b>previous</b> <b>deduction.</b> And this presence of fourth pattern of glycosylation may extend the number of anthocyanins potentially occurring in this genus from eighteen to twenty-four. 4. The early-flowering gladiolus had essentially the same antocyanin constitution as the summer-flowering one, except for tha presence of 3 -glucoside and much smaller amount of malvidin. This fact was interpreted to indicate that the pigmentation in the early-flowering strain is controlled by the similar but somewhat recessive genetic system as against that in the summer-flowering stain. 5. Concerning the mode of hydroxulation of anthocyanin some unusual features were encountered, i. e. the distribution pattern of anthocyanin in gladilus was different from such plants as Streptocarpus hybridus and Lathyrus odoratus whose anthocyanin constitution is determined through epistatic genetic system which prevents the co-occurrence of anthocyanins having different level of hydroxylation, and also different from such plants as Primula sinensis ans Impatiens balsomina whose anthocyanin in each individual is almost exclusively composed of delphinidin (malvidin) and/or pelargonidin. The more detailed feature will be presented in forthcoming paper...|$|E

40|$|Photolysis of deca-bromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209) was {{investigated}} in tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, isopropanol, acetone, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide. Noticeable differences of the photolytic rates and quantum yields {{were found in the}} diverse solvents. Different to the <b>previous</b> <b>deductions,</b> hydrogen donating efficiency and electron donating efficiency of solvents were not the decisive factors for the photolytic rate in this study, which was proved by the fast photolysis of BDE- 209 in CCl(4), a solvent without hydrogen and difficult to donate electrons. Besides hydrogen addition process, intermolecular polymerization might occur during the photolysis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to understand the molecular properties of BDE- 209 in different solvents. The lowest singlet vertical excitation energy (E(ex)) and the average formal charge on Br (q(Br) (+)) of BDE- 209, reflecting the difficulty for the excitation of BDE- 209 and for the departing of Br atom, respectively, were changed by the reaction fields formed by the different solvents. E(ex) and q(Br) (+) linearly correlated with the photolytic activity (log k). This study is helpful to better understand the photolytic behavior of BDE- 209 in different media. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Field {{desorption}} {{mass spectrometry}} {{was shown to}} be a valid technique for determining the molecular weights of hemins and hemin esters, as well as of porphyrins. The observed base peaks of ligand-free protoheme IX, protoheme IX dimethyl ester, and protoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester correspond well to the molecular weights of these compounds and the base peak for hemato-porphyrin corresponds to the molecular weight of this porphyrin minus two molecules of water. The technique was employed to confirm the molecular weights of heme a, heme a dimethyl ester, and acetyl heme a dimethyl ester. Heme a dimethyl ester was prepared by reaction of heine a with trimethyloxo-nium tetrafluoroborate and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The isolated product was converted to the acetylated erivative by reaction with acetic anhydride and was subsequently purified by high-pressure liquid chroma-tography. A field desorption spectrum of heme a shows a base peak at 582 which is in agreement with <b>previous</b> <b>deductions</b> of the structure of this pros-thetic group.

40|$|The {{proto-oncogene}} c-myc {{may play}} a role in controlling the growth and division of normal cells, and abnormalities of the gene have been implicated in the genesis of a substantial variety of human tumors. To facilitate further study of these issues, we developed antisera that permit the identification and isolation of the protein encoded by the human and other mammalian versions of c-myc. We found that c-myc(human) gives rise to at least two phosphoproteins with apparent molecular weights of 62, 000 [pp 62 c-myc(human), the major product] and 66, 000 [pp 66 c-myc(human), produced in smaller quantities and possibly a modified version of the Mr 62, 000 protein]. Both proteins have relatively short half-lives of approximately equal to 30 min. Mouse c-myc encodes similar proteins with molecular weights of 64, 000 and 66, 000. The use of cells transformed by DNA-mediated gene transfer sustained <b>previous</b> <b>deductions</b> that the entire coding domain of c-myc(human) is contained in the second and third exons of the gene and resolved previous ambiguities by showing that analogous exons specify the entire protein product of c-myc(chicken). Tumor cells containing amplification of c-myc(human) produce relatively large amounts of pp 62 /pp 66 c-myc(human). By contrast, translocations of c-myc found in cells derived from Burkitt lymphoma appear merely to sustain expression of c-myc(human) at levels found also in nontumorigenic lymphoblastoid cells, rather than to increase expression of the gene to manifestly abnormal levels...|$|R

To our knowledge, however, there exist no rigorous error analysis on these methods.

Here we map Māori oral traditions (pūrākau) that relate experience with extreme environmental disturbance (in particular, tsunamis) around the A/NZ coast, compare the findings with geo-archaeological evidence, and discuss the scientific benefits {{to be gained by}} considering pūrākau as legitimate perspectives on history. Not surprisingly, there are both differences and complementarities between traditional Māori narratives and the available geo-archaeological evidence on extreme coastal disturbances.

40|$|Abstract only availableIn {{an attempt}} to boost {{business}} investment, the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act gave business owners an income tax deduction of up to $ 100, 000 {{of the purchase price}} of any vehicle greater than 6, 000 pounds used for business purposes. This is a 200 % increase from the <b>previous</b> maximum <b>deduction</b> allowed. This paper estimates the effects of this tax break on the demand for heavy vehicles and attempts to address the efficiency of the policy in terms of both increased business investment and costs imposed by heavier vehicles. The extent to which the policy is successful in increasing business investment depends heavily on whether or not the tax break generated new purchases of heavy vehicles. Policy effectiveness is undermined when business owners already planning to buy a vehicle substitute heavier vehicles covered under the tax break for lighter vehicles not covered under the tax break. Moderate evidence is found of an increase in demand for heavier vehicles. Weak evidence for substitution effects of heavier vehicles covered under the tax break for lighter vehicles not covered by the tax break is found. The overall evidence suggests a slight increase in the demand for larger vehicles, implying minimal both environmental costs and business investment. This counters most arguments of both the automakers who supported the tax break and environmental activists who criticized it. MU Undergraduate Research Scholars Progra...|$|R
