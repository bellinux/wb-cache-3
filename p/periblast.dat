40|$|The yolk of teleost eggs becomes {{covered with}} a syncytial <b>periblast</b> during {{embryonic}} development. Nutrients must be transported through the <b>periblast</b> before they are available to the embryo. Tranmission electron micrographs of thin sections and of freeze-fractured replicas show a number of features at the yolk-periblast junction which may be correlated with yolk transport. These features include vesicle formation and exchange, channelization and interdigitation...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{movements}} in Fundulus blastoderms during gastrulation were studied utilizing timelapse cinemicrography and electron microscopy. Time-lapse films reveal that ceils of the enveloping layer undulate and sometimes separate briefly but remain {{together in a}} cohesive layer. During epiboly, the marginal enveloping layer cells move over the <b>periblast</b> as it expands over the yolk sphere. Movement {{occurs as a result}} of ruffled membrane activity of the free borders of the marginal ceils. Deep blastomeres become increasingly active during blastula and gastrula stages. Lobopodia project from the blastomeres in blastulae and adhere to other cells in gastrulae, giving the cells traction for movement. Contact specializations are formed by the lateral adjacent plasma membranes of enveloping layer cells. An apical junction is characterized by an intercellular gap of 60 - 75 A. Below this contact, the plasma membranes are separated by 120 A or more. In mid-gastrulae, cytoplasmic fibrils occur adjacent to some apical junctions, and small desmosomes appear below the apical junction. Septate desmosomes also appear at this time. A junction with an intercellular gap of 60 A occurs between marginal enveloping layer cells and <b>periblast.</b> Contacts between deep blastomeres become numerous in gastrulae and consist of contacts at the crests of surface undulations, short areas of contact in which the plasma membranes are 60 or 120 A apart, and long regions characterized by a 200 -A intercellular gap. Lobopodia contact other blastomeres only in gastrulae. These junctions contain a 200 -A intercellular space. Some deep blastomeres are in contact with the tips of <b>periblast</b> microvilli. The mechanism of epiboly in Fundulus is discussed and reevaluated in terms of these observations. The enveloping layer is adherent to the margin of the <b>periblast</b> and moves over it as a coherent cellular sheet. <b>Periblast</b> epiboly involves a controlled flow of cytoplasm from the thicker <b>periblast</b> into the thinner yolk cytoplasmic layer with which it is continuous. Deep cells move by adhering to each other, to the inner surface of the enveloping layer, and to the <b>periblast...</b>|$|E
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of cleavage, blastula, and gastrula stages of Fundulus heteroclitus was investigated. Cleavage blastomeres arc relatively unspccialized, containing few or poorly developcd organelles. Beginning in blastula stages, signs of differentiation were noted, including {{development of the}} cndoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and appearance of a primary nucleolus and polyribosomcs. More extensive structural specializations occur in gastrula stages, including further development of the endoplasmic reticulum and appearance of a granular component in the nucleolus. These changes are associated with cell differentiation and an increascd capacity for protein synthesis, and may bc preparatory to subsequent histogenesis. The <b>periblast</b> is a continuous syncytial cytoplasmic laycr located between the blastodisc and yolk and is formed during late cleavage by incomplete division of the cytoplasm of the blastodisc. Cytoplasmic projections extend from the <b>periblast</b> (and from the basal region of cleavage blastomercs prior to formation of the <b>periblast)</b> into the yolk and function in uptake of yolk material {{in the absence of}} pinocytosis. Yolk material appears to be digested by the <b>periblast</b> and transferred into the segmentation cavity where it is available to the blastomeres. Protein granules, lipid droplets, glycogen, crystalline arrays, and multivesicular bodies are related to food storage and utilization by blastomeres. The yolk gel layer enclosing the yolk sphere was found to be a thin layer of cytoplasm continuous with the margin of the <b>periblast</b> and is renamed the yolk cytoplasmic layer.

40|$|This {{survey was}} {{performed}} to characterize the embryogenesis of Prochilodus lineatus. Seven stages of embryo development were identified – zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, larval and hatching – {{after a period of}} incubation of 22 h (24 ◦C) or 14 h (28 ◦C). The following cleavage pattern was identified: the first plane was vertical (2 blastomeres); the second was vertical and perpendicular to the first (4 blastomeres); the third was vertical and parallel to the first (4 × 2); the fourth cleavage was vertical and parallel to the second (4 × 4); the fifth was vertical and parallel to the first (4 × 8); and the sixth cleavage was horizontal (64 blastomeres). At the blastula stage (3. 0 – 4. 0 h (24 ◦C); 1. 66 – 2. 0 h (28 ◦C)) irregular spaces were detected and <b>periblast</b> structuring was initiated. At the gastrula stage (4. 0 – 8. 0 h (24 ◦C); 3. 0 – 6. 0 h (28 ◦C)) the epiboly, convergence and cell movements, as well as the formation of embryonic layers, had begun. The segmentation stage (10. 0 – 15. 0 h (24 ◦C); 7. 0 – 10. 0 h (28 ◦C)) was characterized by a rudimentary formation of organs and systems (somites, optic vesicle and intestinal delimitation). The embryo at the larval stage (16. 0 – 21. 0 h (24 ◦C); 11. 0 – 13. 0 h (28 ◦C)) showed a free tail, more than 25 somites, anoptic vesicle anda ready-to-hatch larval shape. Theblastomeres at cleavage stage had disorganized nuclei indicating high mitotic activity. At gastrula, the blastomeres and the <b>periblast</b> had euchromatic nuclei and a large number of mitochondria and vesicles. The yolk was organized into globose sacs, which were dispersed into small pieces prior to absorption...|$|E

Histo-physiological events {{during the}} European hake, Merluccius merluccius larvae {{development}} are showed. During lecitotrophic phase (0 - 5 dph), {{the mouth and}} the anus were closed. Larvae 4 dph present well different iated and pigmented eyes and the notochord, trunk and dorsal part of the digestive tract was spotted with melanophores. When mouth opening and endogenous and first exogenous feeding coexisted (from 6 dph), most systems, organs and tissues (digestive, liver, exocrine pancreas, eyes, swim bladder), were sufficiently well differentiated, {{and it may be}} compatible with an adequate growth and development from this time onwards. The yolk-sac assures, via <b>periblast</b> or yolk syncytial layer, the nutritive supply of the larvae during organogenesis, morphogenesis and growth. At 10 dph, remaining yolk-sac and functional liver are connect ed; stomach gastric glands are not differentiated, but lipid absorption in anterior intestine and pinocytotic up take and posterior intracellular protein digestion within posterior intestine are detected. Swimbladder and visual activity (cones and rods)) are well developed and enough functional in hake larvae 10 dph. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{blastoderm}} (fertilized ovum) and unfertilized {{germinal disc}} (UGD) of fresh laid eggs and eggs stored prior to incubation exhibit subtle but definable morphological variations. Such variations {{may lead to}} difficulty when attempting to determine true flock fertility based on {{the appearance of the}} blastoderm/UGD. The objectives of this study were to define and categorize such morphological variations and to determine whether sperm influence the frequency distribution of the different categories. Eleven categories of blastoderms were defined based on the relative density and appearance of the area alba, area pellucida, area opaca, and the <b>periblast.</b> The majority of the blastoderms were included in the first four categories. Unfertilized germinal discs were divided into six categories and were best differentiated from the blasto-derms by the presence of vacuoles around its central dense area. They were also discernible from blastoderms based on their overall denser appearance. Differences in the frequency distribution of some of the UGD categories between virgin and inseminated hens {{may be due to the}} effect that supernumary sperm may have on the organization of the UGD (no fertilization but supernumary sperm present) or blastoderm (fertilized but failed to develop). It is recommended that before starting true fertility determinations during fresh egg breakouts, one should study the appearance of the UGD from virgin hens and then the blastoderm from inseminated hens. One then will learn to appreciate the subtle differences in shape and density of the blastoderm/UGD structural components...|$|E
