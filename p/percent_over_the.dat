5|$|From {{fewer than}} 6,120 white {{settlers}} in 1850, Minnesota's official population grew to over 1.7million by 1900. Each {{of the next}} six decades saw a 15 percent increase in population, reaching 3.4million in 1960. Growth then slowed, rising 11 percent to 3.8million in 1970, and an average of 9 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next three decades to 4.9million in the 2000 Census.|$|E

CBO cited the ACA's expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives to work, so repealing the ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more hours of labor.|$|E
5|$|The 2016 Canadian census {{enumerated}} a {{total population}} of 35,151,728, an increase of around 5.0 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 2011 figure. Between 2011 and May 2016, Canada's population grew by 1.7million people with immigrants accounting for two-thirds of the increase. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth. The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.|$|E

In late October 2012, New Zealand carbon prices dropped to about $NZ1 a tonne for {{some types of}} credits. On 10 December 2012, the NZU spot price was $2.70 and it had {{declined}} by 72 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 2012 year.

5|$|ExactTarget {{went public}} in March 2012 and raised $161.5 million in funding on the New York Stock Exchange. In late 2012, it {{acquired}} a marketing automation vendor, Pardot, for $96 million, and the developers of a product recommendation engine, iGoDigital, for $21 million. In 2012, its revenues grew 40 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> preceding year. The following June, ExactTarget was acquired by salesforce.com for $2.5 billion. A few months later, salesforce.com said it was laying off 200 staff due to overlaps after the ExactTarget acquisition. That September at the ExactTarget Connections conference, salesforce.com said it was integrating ExactTarget into a new division called Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2016, Bevin {{delivered}} a budget {{address to the}} General Assembly detailing his two-year budget proposal. The proposal cut the allocation for most state agencies by 9 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> upcoming biennium, {{with most of the}} savings being redirected into the state pension system, which was among the worst funded in the nation. Public elementary and secondary education were spared from the cuts, as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal. Public colleges and universities were not exempt from the cuts, and Bevin called for a gradual move to performance-based funding for higher education, with all higher education funding tied to performance by 2020.|$|E

5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen {{at any time and}} carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Emerald Bowl {{began with}} a 1:35p.m. PST kickoff time in SBC Park. Because the field had been {{converted}} from the baseball diamond typically used by the San Francisco Giants, both teams shared the same sideline during the game. Rainy conditions caused the field's natural grass surface to become muddier as the game progressed. Although 30,563 tickets were sold, an increase of 19 percent from the 2003 game, official in-stadium attendance was listed at 28,856, an increase of 28 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> previous year. Despite New Mexico's closer proximity to the bowl site, Midshipmen fans comprised {{a large portion of}} the crowd; Navy directly sold 18,000 tickets prior to the game and was given credit for 22,000. The game aired live on ESPN2, with Eric Collins and Andre Ware serving as announcers. With a Nielsen rating of 2.04, the game was watched by over four million households, approximately 65 percent more viewers than the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Act left range {{management}} policy unresolved in many respects, {{although it did}} specify that BLM and the Forest Service consult with state wildlife agencies. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting). In November 1971, the BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountain herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountain range {{was said to have}} increased by 17 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 1968 level, but there was strong disagreement over whether the population had actually increased.|$|E

Suavemente and American merengue singer Manny Manuel's album, Es Mi Tiempo, increased US tropical-music sales by 27 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> previous year. On November 28, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified Suavemente gold for shipments of 500,000 copies, the first merengue record certified gold. The album was certified gold in Chile, platinum in Venezuela, and platinum in Central America. During the 1998 Christmas season, Suavemente was among the top-selling Latin albums in the United States. On February 20, 1999, Sony Discos president Oscar Llord {{expressed an interest in}} promoting Suavemente in Latin America and Europe since he believed that the album would sell over one million copies. In May, it sold 1,500,000 copies worldwide. By June 2007 Suavemente had sold 800,000 copies in the US, and by 2012 the album had sold an additional 64,000 copies in the US.|$|E
5|$|The two {{chambers}} {{announced that}} their negotiations had reached an impasse {{just days before}} the constitutionally mandated end of the session on April 15, but Bevin insisted he would not call a special legislative session for them to continue negotiations. Just before 3:00a.m. on April 14, negotiators announced they had reached a compromise that would cut public universities' budgets by 4.5 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> biennium instead of the 9 percent requested by Bevin and implement a performance-based funding model in 2017. The money would be reallocated to contribute over $1 billion toward the state pension system's liabilities, which exceeded $30 billion. Republicans agreed to fund a Democratic proposal for a scholarship program providing free community college tuition for qualified students, relented on their demands to stop state funding for Planned Parenthood, and spared the state's prevailing wage guidelines. Bevin signed the budget, but used his line-item veto to strip funding for the scholarship program {{in the first year of}} the biennium, saying the guidelines were poorly written and should be revised before implementing the program in 2017. Because of the constitutional prohibition against the legislative session extending past April 15, the General Assembly was unable to override the veto.|$|E

This 30 mpg combined rating compares with the 20 mpg combined rating of the non-hybrid RX model. The powertrain is linked to an instrument panel Eco light indicator, which enables drivers to monitor their fuel efficiency as it correlates with accelerator modulation.|$|E
