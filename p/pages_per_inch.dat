5000|$|Traditionally, book {{papers are}} off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to {{minimise}} the show-through of text {{from one side}} of the page to the other, and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Typically, books papers are light-weight papers 60 to 90 g/m² and often specified by their caliper/substance ratios (volume basis). For example, a bulky 80 g/m² paper may have a caliper of 120 micrometres (0.12 mm) which would be Volume 15 (120×10/80), whereas a low bulk 80 g/m² may have a caliper of 88 micrometres, giving a volume 11. This volume basis then allows the calculation of a book's PPI (printed <b>pages</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> which is an important factor for the design of book jackets and the binding of the finished book.|$|E
50|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> varies on the pattern to be woven and {{the thickness of the}} thread. Plain weaves generally use half the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> whereas denser weaves like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two thirds of the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Finer threads require more threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than thick ones, and thus result in a higher number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Western {{red cedar}} log has an R value of 1.25 <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> In comparison, {{concrete}} is [...]13 <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> stone masonry [...]08 <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> common brick [...]20 <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and fiberglass insulation 3.16 <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> The longer the logs (and thicker the wall), {{the better the}} insulation qualities. A common 16” cordwood wall for moderate climates comprises 6 in of perlite or vermiculite insulation between mortar joints.|$|R
5000|$|Points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (25 mm): The {{most common}} {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than there are teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (e.g., a saw with 14 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 13 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a saw with 10 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 9 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the saw cut easier.|$|R
5000|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (EPI or e.p.i.) is {{the number}} of warp threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of woven fabric. In general, the higher the ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> the finer the fabric is. The current fashion is to wear T-shirts with a higher thread count, such as soft and {{comfortable}} [...] "30 single" [...] tee shirt that has 30 threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> as contrasted to the standard T-shirt with an 18 thread count <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} quotient of square-inch {{analysis is}} item profit <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> {{according to the}} formula item gross profit (dollars) / offer area (square inches) = item profit <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b> Secondary calculations include unit volume <b>per</b> square <b>inch,</b> item revenue <b>per</b> square <b>inch,</b> gross profit and revenue per offer and <b>per</b> <b>page.</b> The elementary mathematical formulas involved in deriving the results of square-inch analysis can be easy modeled by formulas in a software spreadsheet. Support for page planning decisions requires that these results be numerically sortable.|$|R
50|$|The model 001 was {{announced}} on April 15, 1975 and first shipped July 1976. It had a print resolution of 144 pels <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (or dots <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> pels are print elements) vertically and 180 pels <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> horizontally. It could print at 10,020 to 20,040 {{lines per minute}} depending on line density (which could range from 6 to 12 lines <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b>|$|R
50|$|Suppose a {{magnetic}} tape can contain up to 3,200 flux reversals <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A Modified Frequency Modulation or (1,3) RLL encoding stores each data bit as two bits on tape, but {{since there is}} guaranteed to be one 0 (non flux reversal) bit between any 1 (flux reversal) bits then {{it is possible to}} store 6,400 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, or 3,200 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A (1,7) RLL encoding can also store 6,400 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, but since it only takes 3 encoded bits to store 2 data bits this is 4,267 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A (2,7) RLL encoding takes 2 encoded bits to store each data bit, but since there is guaranteed to be two 0 bits between any 1 bits then it is possible to store 9,600 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, or 4,800 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (and picks <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|R
5000|$|Closed-cell foams are {{superior}} insulators. While open-cell foams typically have R-values of 3 to 4 <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (RSI-0.53 to RSI-0.70 <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> closed-cell foams can attain R-values of 5 to 8 <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (RSI-0.88 to RSI-1.41 <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> This is important if space is limited, {{because it allows}} a thinner layer of insulation to be used. For example, a 1-inch layer of closed-cell foam provides about the same insulation factor as 2 inches of open-cell foam.|$|R

2500|$|... "The work or shock-resisting {{ability is}} {{greatest}} in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load {{is not so}} great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (rings less than 1.3 mm thick).

50|$|Balanced {{plain weaves}} are fabrics {{in which the}} warp and weft are made of threads of the same weight (size) and {{the same number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> as picks <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R
50|$|One thread per dent is {{most common}} for coarse work, for finer work (20 or more ends <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> {{two or more}} threads are put through each dent. Threads can be doubled in every other space, so that a reed with 10 dents <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> could give 15 ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> or 20 if the threads were simply doubled. Also, threads can be put in every other dent {{so as to make}} a cloth with 6 ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> from a reed with 12 dents <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Putting more than one thread through each dent reduces {{friction}} and the number of reeds that one weaver needs, and is used in weaving mills. If too many threads are put through one dent there may be reed marks left in the fabric, especially in linen and cotton.|$|R
