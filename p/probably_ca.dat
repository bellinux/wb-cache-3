5|$|The {{family name}} of Dokeianos is {{considered}} to derive from Dokia in the Armeniac Theme. The family only came into prominence in the mid-11th century, with Michael {{one of the first}} to be mentioned. He is generally considered as the Dokeianos who married an unnamed daughter of Manuel Erotikos Komnenos and sister of the future emperor Isaac I Komnenos (reigned 1057–59), <b>probably</b> <b>ca.</b> 1030. Together, they had a son, Theodore Dokeianos. According to the near-contemporary official and historian John Skylitzes, Michael Dokeianos was a simple man and not suited for command, and according to the modern scholar Konstantinos Varzos he owed his rise to high office to his family ties with the Komnenoi. It is known that he was wealthy, and possessed estates in Paphlagonia, possibly adjacent or part of the Komnenos family estates in the same region.|$|E

25|$|John Komnenos Vatatzes {{was the son}} of the sebastohypertatos Theodore Vatatzes, and the porphyrogenita princess Eudokia Komnene, {{daughter}} of the emperor John II Komnenos and his empress Eirene of Hungary. Theodore Vatatzes was one of the 'new men' raised to prominence by John II; the Vatatzes family were not previously counted amongst {{the highest levels of the}} Byzantine aristocracy, though they had long been prominent in the region around the city of Adrianople in Thrace. John's parents married in 1131, and he was born soon thereafter, <b>probably</b> <b>ca.</b> 1132. John had a brother, Andronikos, who was also a prominent general - he led an army against the city of Amaseia in 1176 and was killed by the Seljuq Turks; they displayed his severed head during the Battle of Myriokephalon shortly afterwards. He had another brother, named Alexios. John's wife was named Maria Doukaina and they had two sons, Alexios and Manuel. The latter was named for John's uncle, the Emperor Manuel, to whom John was very devoted—to the extent of tolerating a love affair between the emperor and his own sister Theodora.|$|E

At the same time Nikephoros, still in his youth, was taken into the imperial retinue, and was soon appointed to the guard corps of the manglabitai.

50|$|He was {{the eldest}} son of the magistros Eustathios Argyros, Drungary of the Watch under Leo VI the Wise (ruled 886-912). He had two brothers, Leo and Romanos. In ca. 910, Pothos and his brother Leo Argyros were serving at court as manglabites (personal bodyguards of the emperor), when their father was {{poisoned}} after being suspected by Leo for plotting against him. The two brothers brought their father's body for burial to the monastery of Saint Elizabeth in the Charsianon district, founded by their grandfather Leo Argyros. Accordingly he was born <b>probably</b> <b>ca.</b> 890 or a little later.|$|E
5000|$|Dirk IV (ca. 1020/1030 - 13 January 1049) was Count of Holland from 1039 to 1049 (which {{was called}} Frisia at that time).

His base of operations was the stronghold his father built at Vlaardingen. Contemporary chroniclers referred to him (in Latin) as [...] "Theodericus de Phlardirtinga" [...] (Vlaardingen) and as margrave thereof.

5000|$|Saint Athenogenes, a {{saint of}} unknown date but whose saint's day is 16 July, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have composed this hymn {{on the way to}} being martyred. He is often depicted as an elderly bishop with the executioner's arm paralyzed until the saint has completed his song. The Roman Martyrology states: [...] "In Pontus, the birthday of Saint Athenogenes, celebrated. He was an aged theologian, who, when about to consummate his martyrdom by fire, sang a hymn of joy, which he left in writing to his disciples." [...] He is probably identical to the bishop who martyred with ten disciples in Sebaste, Armenia, on July 16 during the reign of Emperor Diocletian, most <b>probably</b> <b>ca.</b> 305 AD.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Probably</b> <b>ca.</b> 290 BC Ptolemy {{began the}} {{construction}} of Alexander's mausoleum, the so-called sēma, in Alexandria, and appointed a priest ( [...] , hiereus) to conduct religious rites there. This office quickly advanced to become the highest priesthood in the Ptolemaic realm, its prominence underscored by its eponymous character, i.e., each regnal year was named after the incumbent priest, and documents, whether in Greek or Demotic Egyptian, where dated after him. The first priest of Alexander was no less a figure than Ptolemy's brother Menelaos. The tenure lasted one year, but under Ptolemy I, the priests apparently held the post for longer tenures, while under his successors. This became an exception under the later Ptolemies.|$|E
50|$|At {{some unknown}} date, <b>probably</b> <b>ca.</b> 1092/3, John was {{military}} governor (doux) of Skopje, {{as indicated by}} his correspondence with Theophylact of Ohrid.

In autumn of that year, when Alexios campaigned against the Cumans in Thrace, he was entrusted the defence of Berroe and its environs along with Nikephoros Melissenos and George Palaiologos. In 1094/5, he participated in the synod at Blachernae Palace, where Leo of Chalcedon was condemned. He appears in the list of attendees with the high title of sebastos, in fifth place overall.|$|E
