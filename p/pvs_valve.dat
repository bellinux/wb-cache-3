MethodsWe replaced the posterior leaflet of the MV and of 1 PV cusp with patches in ewes aged 10 months. There were 2 groups: CardioCel (n =  6) and control (n =  4). All valves were competent. Echocardiography was performed before euthanasia. The collected data were function, macroscopy, histology, and calcium contents. The primary end points were thickening and calcium content. ResultsAll animals survived until sacrifice after 7 months. The valves had normal echo. The macroscopic aspect of the valves was excellent. Examination of the slides for both groups revealed a continuous endothelium {{on both sides of}} the patch and a layer of new collagen developed on both sides between patch and endothelium and interstitial cells and smooth muscle cell in these layers. The patch had not thickened but the 2 layers of new collagen for the PV showed a median thickening of 37 % in the CardioCel group and 111 % in the control group (P = . 01), and for the MV a thickening of 108 % and 251 %, respectively, was seen (P = . 01). The median calcium content in the PV was 0. 24 μg/mg (range, 0. 19 - 0. 30) in the CardioCel group versus 0. 34 μg/mg (range,  0. 24 - 0. 62) in controls (P = . 20).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Local institutional review board approval was obtained, and patients or their parents gave informed consent. Twenty-five patients with a corrected TOF (12 male, 13 female; mean age, 13. 1 years +/- 2. 7 [standard deviation]; age range, 8 - 18 years) and 19 control subjects (12 male, seven female; mean age, 14. 1 years +/- 2. 4; age range, 8 - 18 years) underwent planimetric MR imaging, 2 D VE MR imaging, and 3 D VE MR imaging for TV and PV flow evaluation. For evaluation of diastolic function, PV and TV flow were summated. Data were analyzed by using linear regression analysis, paired and unpaired t testing, and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: Strong correlations between the 2 D VE MR and 3 D VE MR measurements of PV flow (for forward flow: r = 0. 87, P <. 01; for backward flow: r = 0. 97, P <. 01) were observed. With PV effective flow as a reference, 3 D TV effective flow measurements were more accurate than 2 D TV effective flow measurements: In patients, the mean 2 D TV effective flow versus 2 D PV effective flow difference was 17. 6 mL +/- 11 (P <. 001), and the mean 3 D TV effective flow versus 3 D PV effective flow difference was - 1. 2 mL +/- 4. 7 (P =. 22). Diastolic functional impairment in patients could be detected at 3 D VE MR imaging diastolic assessment. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional VE MR imaging is accurate for PV flow assessment and is more accurate than 2 D VE MR imaging for TV flow evaluation.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the growth pattern of the pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> annulus and right heart structures in patients with critical and severe pulmonary stenosis (PS) after balloon dilation, and to determine any morphometric or hemodynamic differences between cyanotic infants with critical PS and asymptomatic infants with severe PS that may account for their varied clinical presentations. Background. Growth of the PV annulus and right heart structures in patients with critical PS after balloon valvuloplasty has not clearly been defined. In addition, the anatomic and hemodynamic factors that determine whether an infant with severe PS will present with cyanosis or without symptoms are not well understood. Methods. Measurements of the <b>PV</b> annulus, tricuspid <b>valve</b> (TV) annulus and main, right and left pulmonary arteries were obtained from initial and follow-up echocardiograms, and Z values were calculated. Hemodynamic data and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty techniques were reviewed. Right ventricular (RV) volumes were measured from angiograms. Results. Fourteen patients with critical PS (mean [±SD] age 0. 21 ± 0. 37 months) and 20 patients with severe PS (mean age 2. 6 ± 2. 9 months) were evaluated at presentation and at 32 ± 33 and 42 ± 32 months of follow-up, respectively. Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was successful in 64 % of patients with critical PS and in 90 % of patients with severe PS. The PV, TV and pulmonary arteries increased in size after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in both groups at a rate that paralleled or exceeded the rate of somatic growth. The initial TV diameter and RV volume were smaller in patients with critical PS than in those with severe PS (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 0008, respectively). Conclusions. After balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in infants with critical and severe PS, right heart structures increase in size at a rate that parallels or exceeds the rate of somatic growth. The primary morphometric differences between these groups are a smaller TV diameter and RV volume in infants with critical PS. This may contribute to increased right to left atrial shunting and account for the variations in clinical presentation.

Methods- From January 2006 to April 2007, all the patients with prosthetic heart valves who were referred for clinically-indicated transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were evaluated for the presence of non-obstructive thrombosis. Clinical information was collected through patient interviews. Non-obstructive thrombosis was defined as a distinct mass (more than 1 mm in width and 2 - 15 mm in length) with abnormal echoes attached to the normally functioning prosthesis and clearly seen throughout the cardiac cycle via two-dimensional, Doppler, and cinefluoroscopy studies.

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} installation of two temperature sensing RTD's in the BC's. Previously, the temperature sensing device used in all three cryostats consisted of a FNAL designed liquid sensing probe (see EN- 168, and drawing ME- 273505). This device was necessary because of the concern that overfilling LN 2 into the main vent line during cooldown could create an undesirable back pressure on the relief valves or rupture disks. This could possibly hinder the relieving of argon gas at the required flow rate in a safety situation. The probe was installed on the CC, and has been operating perfectly, therefore, this probe will not be changed. Figure 1 shows the location of TS 232 E, the CC liquid sensing probe. Note that the probe is located downstream of the condenser outlet <b>valve</b> (<b>PV</b> 210 N), therefore, it effectively operates under atmospheric pressure. On the BC's, however, the probe was originally installed at a different location, upstream of the condenser outlet <b>valve</b> (<b>PV</b> 110 N or PV 310 N). This resulted in the probe effectively sensing the condenser pressure, which varied from approximately 30 psia to 60 psia during cooldown. The changing pressure meant that the corresponding temperature at which liquid appeared also changed. The probe then became inaccurate, especially at higher condenser pressures, when the probe would be fail to trip at the higher liquid temperature. The solution was to replace the original probe with an RTD. This involved using the PLC to compare the temperature sensed by the RTD to the liquid saturation temperature, calculated using the measured condenser pressure. A formula was created to calculate the saturation temperature from the condenser pressure. This formula was derived by curve fitting points taken from the NBS Technical Note 129 for nitrogen. A 2 nd order equation was used to fit the points, since the accuracy was not very important for temperature comparison. The entire equation was then shifted so that the curve was above all of the actual points. This was done {{to insure that the}} formula would provide higher temperatures, so the comparison to the RTD would be conservative, switching before the temperature reached saturation. Figure 2 shows the curve used to fit the data points. The lower curve is the actual data, and the higher curve is the formula to be used. Using the formula derived, the PLC calculates a conservative saturation temperature from the condenser pressure. The condenser pressure is measured by PT 110 N or PT 310 N, on the ECN and ECS, respectively. The transmitters are Rosemount 0 - 75 psia pressure transmitters. The PLC then compares the calculated temperature to the measured temperature from the RTD's, EIl 32 E and EI 332 E, which are Omega platinum RTD probes, model PR- 14 - 2 - 100 - 1 / 4 - 12 -E. If the measured temperature drops below the calculated saturation temperature, an alarm signals on the view page, and the PLC automatically closes the two inlet condenser <b>valves</b> (<b>PV</b> 101 N and PV 102 N, or PV 301 N and PV 302 N). As a final note, there are various advantages and disadvantages to using the RTD's instead of the original probe. The advantages are that the RTD's provide constant monitoring of the temperature, whereas the probe was basically designed as a switch. The RTD's are more accurate in that they can respond over the range of the condenser pressure. The probe was designed to operate under atmospheric pressure. The only disadvantage of the RTD's is that they sense temperature, therefore, they cannot distinguish saturated GN 2 from liquid, while the probe was designed specifically to do so. Overall, however, the RTD's provide an acceptable {{solution to the problem of}} liquid sensing in the vent line. Figure 3 shows the final location of the RTD on the ECN. The ECS location is the same...|$|R

BackgroundOver the past 40 years, prosthetic conduits {{have been developed to}} surgically establish continuity between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. However, stenosis and insufficiency of the conduit due to valvular degeneration or panus ingrowth frequently occur, limiting patients’ lifespan. Percutaneous stenting of conduits has recently emerged as a technique for delaying surgical replacement, but it creates a pulmonary regurgitation when crossing the valve. MethodsSeven children and one adult with stenosis and/or insufficiency of the pulmonary graft underwent percutaneous implantation of a bovine jugular valve in pulmonary position. ResultsPercutaneous pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> replacement was successful in all patients. No complications occurred in early follow-up. Angiography, hemodynamic studies and echocardiography after the procedure showed no significant regurgitation of the implanted valve.

The patient {{did not have an}} associated murmur, which is commonly seen in right-sided infectious endocarditis. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a thickened PV leaflet, with subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram showing a PV mass. Speciation of blood cultures revealed Streptococcus oralis. In right-sided infective endocarditis, usually the tricuspid valve is involved; however, in our case the tricuspid valve was free of any mass or vegetation. The patient did meet Duke criteria and was thus started on long-term intravenous antibiotics for infectious endocarditis. The patient's symptoms quickly improved with antibiotics. A careful history and evaluating the patient's risk factors are key in earlier detection of infective endocarditis (IE). Because of early detection and a high index of suspicion, the patient had no further complications and did not require any surgery.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 80 - 83) Some {{people are}} born with a heart defect that requires replacement of the aortic valve (AV) during their childhood. A surgery called Ross Procedure has been developed in which a patient's AV is replaced with his/her pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> to avoid the degenerative changes that occur in mechanical and biological valves and provide a valve that will grow with the child into an adult. Despite the good success rate, the procedure is not always successful due to the difference in material properties between the AV and <b>PV.</b> The two <b>valves</b> function under different pressure loadings. The transvalvular pressure on the AV reaches a maximum of 80 mmHg and on the PV it is only 10 mmHg. Thus, we hypothesized that the tissue mechanical properties of the PV may not well match to the AV. The {{aim of this study}} was to derive a constitutive law for pulmonary valve leaflet tissue and compare the properties of the PV to the AV tissue using biaxial stretch studies and continuum mechanics analysis. A constitutive law is a mathematical description of the mechanical properties of a material over a range of loading. A three coefficient exponential strain-energy function has been previously developed in our laboratory to determine the mechanical behavior of mitral and aortic valve leaflet tissue., W(I??[lower case alpha]) = c???(exp[upper case Q] [...] 1) where Q=c???(I??? [...] 3) ?? + c???([lower case alpha] [...] 1) ???. c???, c???, c??? are the material coefficients that determine the material behavior. A set of constant invariant test are performed to identify a specific functional form. As the strain energy function is defined as the function of I??? and [lower case alpha], constant invariant stretch protocols are performed in which one of the invariants is held constant while the other is varied. Four leaflets from four porcine pulmonary valves (n= 4) were mechanically stretched in a biaxial testing machine along the circumferential (C) and radial (R) directions. The material indices of the pulmonary valve are calculated from the stress-stretch data and compared to the aortic valve moduli [...] Statistical comparison of the material indices was performed using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and paired t-test using Minitab Software (Minitab, Inc). The results show that the post-transitional stiffness (E[lower case "post"] C) of the pulmonary valve in circumferential direction is higher compared to the pulmonary valve. The "average" coefficients of the pulmonary valve leaflet tissue are calculated as c???= 0. 075 g/cm??, c???= 0. 311 and c???= 1096. The three-coefficient exponential strain energy function which has been developed in our laboratory for mitral and aortic valve leaflets also describes the material behavior of the pulmonary valve leaflet tissue. Comparison of the material indices of the pulmonary valve leaflet tissue with aortic valve data suggests that the pulmonary valve is a suitable replacement for the aortic valve leaflet tissue, as in the Ross surgery...|$|R

Methods: Between May 2007 and July 2011, 16 patients, underwent implantation of a Contegra valved conduit. All operations were performed through a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. Indications included: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n= 11), Tetralogy of Fallot with absent Pulmonary <b>Valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> syndrome (n= 2), double outlet right ventricle, transposition of great arteries and pulmonary stenosis (n= 1), isolated aortic valve disease (n= 1) and a pseudo-aneurysm with infective endocarditis (n= 1). Conduit sizes varied between 16 - 22 mm. Results: The three in hospital deaths were unrelated to the Contegra valved conduit. One patient was lost to follow up. Of the 12 survivors, 10 are currently free from re-operation or complications related to the conduit while one needed distal pulmonary artery dilatation owing to critical stenosis and another had severe Valvular regurgitation.

We also assessed the predictive value of coronary fistulae and right atrial pressure (RAP) score (comprising the tricuspid valve, foramen ovale, and ductus venosus Doppler). ResultsOne-half of the cohort was first assessed before 23 gestational weeks (range 15. 7 to 33. 7 weeks). The TV z-score was a good predictor at all gestations, but the best predictive scores for specific gestations were pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> z-score (31 weeks). The RAP score and coronary fistulae were good independent predictors: RAP score > 3 predicted BV with area under the curve of 0. 833, and detection of fistulae usually predicted a UV route. ConclusionsThe best predictive scores for post-natal outcome in fetal PAIVS/CPS are a combination of morphologic and physiological variables, which predict a BV circulation with a sensitivity of 92 % and specificity of 100 % before 26 weeks...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of infundibular versus pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> dysfunction on right ventricular (RV) function in a porcine model. BackgroundClinical outcome after repair of tetralogy of Fallot {{is determined by the}} adaptation of the right ventricle to the physiological sequelae of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction. Recent surgical techniques are pursuing a PV-versus infundibulum-sparing approach. MethodsIn a porcine model, 3 types of RVOT dysfunction were created and compared with sham-operated controls: infundibular dysfunction (INF), PV insufficiency (PI), and combined infundibular–PV dysfunction (TAP). Both acute and chronic effects on RV function were studied by using conductance technology and magnetic resonance imaging. ResultsIn animals with PI, pulmonary regurgitant fraction progressed more in the presence of concomitant INF (54 % in TAP versus 14 % in PI; p = 0. 03). Subsequently, RV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume increased more in both groups, resulting in decreased ejection fraction after 3 months. Preload-independent systolic indices showed acute impairment of RV contractility in all treatment groups but most in animals with infundibular scarring (INF and TAP). Further chronic deterioration was observed in animals of the TAP group. RV compliance improved proportionally most in the PI and TAP groups in relation to the extent of RV dilation. ConclusionsSurgical RVOT dysfunction, whether it includes the infundibulum and/or the PV, has an immediate effect on RV performance. Although impaired RV contractility is due to intrinsic myocardial damage by infundibular distortion, it is chronically furthered by PI-related RV dilation. These findings support the adoption of a RVOT-sparing strategy to treat tetralogy of Fallot...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundTraditional use of trans-annular patch (TAP) {{to release}} right {{ventricular}} outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction during tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair {{may lead to}} a harmful pulmonary regurgitation. Different approaches have been used to release RVOT obstruction and spare the pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> function. In this study, we aim to evaluate the post-operative course of patients who had TOF repair in the current era that emphasizes on protective strategy of releasing RVOT obstruction and preserving PV function. MethodsA retrospective study of all TOF cases repaired in our institute between March 2002 and December 2007 was conducted. Cases were classified into two groups; group I included patients that had a TAP, while group II included cases that had simple TOF repair without TAP. Group I was subdivided into two groups, group (A) which include patients who had TAP without a valve. Group (B) includes those who had TAP with a monocuspid valve (Contegra). We compared post-operative care and outcome of all groups. ResultsEighty-three patients fulfilled the study criteria. There were 64 cases (77 %) in group I, and 19 cases (23 %) in group II. All children tolerated surgical repair and did well. We observed no statistically significant difference in the post-operative ICU care, complications rates and morbidity between all groups. There was no surgical mortality in all groups. ConclusionChildren undergoing TOF repair had excellent short-term outcome with the current protective strategy aiming to spare valvular function, and conserving myocardial function. Applying a monocuspid patch technique did not show clear short-term benefits. Long term follow up is needed to evaluate future difference in different techniques...|$|R
40|$|Background—D-transposition of {{the great}} arteries (TGA) with left {{ventricular}} outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) may be treated with arterial switch operation (ASO) with or without LVOT intervention, as well as non-ASO anatomic repairs, such as aortic translocation or Rastelli procedure. We evaluated midterm results of repair for TGA/LVOTO at our institution. Methods and Results—Eighty-eight patients with TGA/LVOTO who underwent anatomic repair were retrospectively reviewed. LVOTO was defined as pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> z-score 2. 0 or LVOT gradient 20 mm Hg {{in the presence of}} anatomic subvalvar stenosis. Risk factors for LVOT reintervention were determined by logistic regression. There was no hospital mortality and 1 late mortality. Patients undergoing Rastelli procedure were more likely to require surgical reintervention for LVOTO compared to the other groups (P 0. 015). Patients undergoing ASO alone had a higher rate of late LVOT reintervention compared to those who had concomitant ASO/LVOT intervention (PNS). In those undergoing Rastelli, a larger PV z-score was a predictor of LVOT reintervention (P 0. 012). PV z-scores significantly decreased before repair in patients undergoing delayed repair (P 0. 005); however, they increased significantly after neonatal ASO (P 0. 001). Conclusions—Patients with TGA/LVOTO who undergo Rastelli repair have a high rate of LVOT reintervention. Higher preoperative PV z-score is a risk factor for reintervention in this group. Patients with mild/moderate LVOTO undergoing ASO alone without LVOT intervention may have an increased risk of LVOT reintervention. In neonates who are candidates for ASO, delay of repair is associated with diminution in size of PV, which may subsequently reduce thei...|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the size of the balloon used for balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) and the degree of relief of pulmonary stenosis. Twenty-six BPVs in 22 patients were divided into two groups: (A) those in which the balloon/pulmonary annulus ratio was 1. 0 or less and (B) those in which the ratio was more than 1. 0. In group A (which consisted of 9 BPVs), the mean ratio was 0. 89 (range, 0. 79 to 1. 0, whereas in group B (which included 17 BPVs), the mean ratio was 1. 32 (range, 1. 01 to 1. 69). The two groups had similar pre-BPV pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> gradients [93 ± 41 (mean ± SD) vs 103 ± 40 mm Hg] (p > 0. 1). Immediately after BPV, neither the absolute residual PV gradient (43 ± 29 vs 37 ± 21 mm Hg) nor the percentage of residual PV gradient (44 ± 14 vs 36 ± 17 percent) differed significantly (p > 0. 1) from group to group. However, long-term follow-up (which ranged from 6 to 28 months, with a mean of 12 months), showed the residual PV gradient in group B (18 ± 8 mm Hg) to be lower (p < 0. 02) than that in group A (80 ± 52 mm Hg). Similarly, the percentage of residual gradient (83 ± 41 vs 20 ± 10 percent) was also lower in group B. Repeat BPV was required in four patients from group A, but in none from group B...|$|R

We {{analysed}} data from two case-control studies from Italy and Switzerland including 137 cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer below age 46 and 298 hospital controls. The multivariate odds ratios (OR) were 20. 7 for heavy smokers and 4. 9 for heavy drinkers. The combination of high tobacco and alcohol consumption led to an OR of over 48. Body mass index (OR= 0. 28, for the highest tertile), high consumption of coffee (OR= 0. 25), fresh vegetables (OR= 0. 39), fruit (OR= 0. 73) and beta-carotene (OR= 0. 48) were inversely related to risk. Tobacco accounted for 77 % of all cancer cases in this population, alcohol for 52 %, low vegetable consumption for 52 %, and the combination of the three factors for 85 %.

40|$|Introduction. Pulmonary artery {{stenosis}} (PS) is a congenital heart defect {{which occurs}} in 10 % of all congenital heart defects. Pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty (BVP) {{has been the}} treatment of choice of PS over the last 30 years. Objective. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of this method based on middle-term hospital follow-up, and safety of BVP based on our experience. Methods. The study included 88 patients diagnosed with PS. The patients were divided into three groups based on the severity of the disease. Also, they were divided into two age groups in order to analyze the frequency of complications. Hemodynamic measurements and echocardiography results were recorded before, 24 - 36 hours after BVP and at the end of follow-up. Results. The studied group involved patients of average age 3. 75 ± 4. 3 years (20 days to 17 years). Immediately after BVP a significant decrease of pressure gradient across the pulmonary <b>valve</b> (<b>PV)</b> was recorded in all patients; this result was similar in all 3 groups of patients regardless of the severity of stenosis (p< 0. 001). Complications of BVP occurred most commonly in children up to 12 months of age (ventricular tachycardia 4. 5 % and supraventricular tachycardia 6. 8 %). Pulmonary valve insufficiency after dilatation occurred in 6. 6 % of cases, and was most common in children aged up to 12 months. In 87 (98. 9 %) patients BVP was a definitive solution, and a significant residual stenosis was not recorded during follow-up. Conclusion. BVP is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of isolated PS in children, regardless of the severity of stenosis but also regardless of patients’ age...|$|R
