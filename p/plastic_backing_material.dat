Analytical predictions for modifying the ballistic projectile armor system were verified by a test program conducted to qualify the rotor containment system. With {{only a slight}} change in the areal density of the armor system a more than two-fold increase in kinetic energy protection level was achieved. Thickness of the fiberglass reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> was increased to achieve an optimum ratio of ceramic thickness to backing thickness for the different ballistic defeat condition...|$|E
40|$|In {{continuation}} of efforts from last quarter, processing parameters, {{used in the}} formation of Pd-Cu alloy films, were being optimized in a drum (web) coater system with the goal of producing large-area, contiguous, pinhole-free films for H{sub 2 } separation membranes. Since the (pre-treatment) functionality of the surface of the <b>plastic</b> <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> is sub-optimal, they tended to produce films in the drum coater that were either not contiguous (disseminates upon release from the polymer backing material) or contain pinholes. Alternative approaches, such as direct deposition onto thermally oxidized silicon wafers, have been attempted to yield pinhole-free films; i. e., formation of a poorly adherent Pd-Cu film on silicon will then directly release from the silicon substrate. Permeation characteristics of a 25 {micro}m-thick, Pd{sub 60 }Cu{sub 40 } alloy foil were conducted. After pre-treating the sample to stabilize the FCC {beta}-phase, the hydrogen permeability was determined to be 5. 4 x 10 {sup - 5 } cm{sup 3 } cmcm{sup - 2 }s{sup - 1 }cm Hg{sup - 1 / 2 }. Thin, 1 - 3 {micro}m-thick Pd-Cu alloy films have been prepared on PS films and samples will be prepared and tested in the next quarter...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 From {{the time}} when {{fluoroscopic}} screens were first used there have been scattered references to reduction in their light output due to age, use, etc. References are scarce and usually devoid of quantitative data. A long-range program {{has been set up}} in an effort to arrive at some meaningful information. A group of 24 fluoroscopic screens were used in this study, 12 each from two manufacturers. All screens were of the zinc-cadmium sulfide phosphor type mounted on <b>plastic</b> <b>backing</b> <b>material.</b> The screens were divided into test groups and subjected to exposure of X-ray, sunlight, incandescent lamps and fluorescent lamps. Test conditions were so designed that they could be related to some realistic exposure to which the screen in a diagnostic unit might be subjected. To determine their relative condition, measurements of the light output of all the screens were taken on a monthly basis. These measurements were made under controlled conditions utilizing a specially-constructed special X-ray unit and a direct-light meter employing a photomultiplier tube as the detector. By use of a direct-reading instrument calibrated in foot-lamberts, measurements were made independently of the sensitivity of the observer's eye and required no time-consuming matching of brightness. Calibration of the light meter was maintained by use of a regulated brightness source. Where possible, old fluoroscopic screens were tested to compare their light output efficiency with that of a new screen...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unique through hole forming method in machinable ceramics using a flowable <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> during nanosecond pulse UV laser radiation. While processing through holes, the flowable <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> is arranged {{to be in}} contact with the back side of machinable ceramics, i. e., surface of laser beam's exit side. The laser beam which penetrated machinable ceramics strikes the flowable <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> and superheated plasma is generated by the laser beam’s absorption into the flowable <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> around exit hole. The induced plasma is elevated with the flowable <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> from the <b>back</b> side of machinable ceramics to the front side of that by a capillary phenomenon, and the shape of through holes changed from tapered shape to straight shape by the elevation of plasma. Through this technique, we are able to make substrate for a probe card which has straight shape holes with narrow pitch...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the electromagnetic scattering of targets with thin-coating accurately, a conformal finite-difference time-domain (CFDTD) method based on effective constitutive parameters is presented in this paper. Two kinds of coating problems are considered. For a coated target with medium <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> the CFDTD formulations on conformal cells {{are the same as}} those of the conventional FDTD, but the parameters in FDTD formulations are replaced by effective constitutive parameters to include the curved coating message of target. For a coated target with perfectly conducting (PEC) <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> the contour-path integral is used to exclude the curved PEC part, and effective constitutive parameters are then introduced to include the coating message. The bistatic radar cross section (RCS) of coated spheres with medium <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> and with PEC <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> are computed, respectively, to validate the presented CFDTD scheme. The backscattering of a composite airfoil, which is made of radar absorbing material (RAM) and metal framework, and coated by fiberglass-reinforced plastics, is also analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility of presented scheme. 1...|$|R
