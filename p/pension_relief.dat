50|$|At seventeen, Flournoy {{became a}} deputy in the Caddo Parish sheriff's department, a {{position}} that he held from 1913-1928. He was hence a deputy under his father from 1913 to 1916, as were two of his brothers, James Flournoy, Jr., and George A. Flournoy. From 1928 to 1940, J. Howell Flournoy was a deputy Caddo Parish tax collector. In 1940, Flournoy was elected sheriff to succeed Thomas Roland Hughes in the same political cycle which brought Sam Houston Jones of Lake Charles to the governorship. Hughes, known for his arrest of the controversial blues musician Lead Belly, had succeeded J. Pat Flournoy as sheriff in 1916. As sheriff, J. Howell Flournoy in 1940 organized the Caddo Parish Selective Service board and trained an internal security group in Shreveport during World War II. He spearheaded a measure to establish a <b>pension</b> and <b>relief</b> fund for sheriff's department employees. From 1950 until his death, except for one year, Flournoy headed the Louisiana Sheriff's <b>Pension</b> and <b>Relief</b> Fund.|$|R
40|$|Government {{support of}} private (occupational and personal) {{pensions}} {{through the system}} of tax reliefs is large: between one quarter and one third of that of direct support of state pensions through public expenditure. However, it is regressive, lacks transparency and is difficult to control. This papers argues {{that it should be}} replaced by a cost-neutral matching grant or tax-credit scheme. Such a scheme would embody the 'partnership' idea implicit in much government policy in this area, but would be much more progressive, more open, and more accountable than existing arrangements. The argument is illustrated by statistical comparisons of the distributional impact of the present system and three alternative versions of the tax-credit scheme.

Later this year, GAO will provide a report to Congress in response to these mandates. This statement provides a preliminary summary of that work and focuses on three main questions: (1) what have been the major challenges to the airline industry since 1998; (2) what costcutting measures have airlines reported taking to remain financially viable; and (3) what is the financial condition of the airline industry?...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is an area of}} early retirement. It is focused on {{description}} and analysis of legislative changes which adjust this section of pension scheme. At the beginning of the thesis there is given a description of the social security scheme. There are depicted changes and reforms of the pension scheme.

On these examples there is drawn a comparison between early <b>pensions,</b> unemployment <b>relief</b> and "předdůchody" (an option of leaving the labor market before reaching the retirement age and financing it from private sources). There are also compared the situations before and after the reform from 2011. The conclusion describes the results of the calculations from model situations.

50|$|The OvaHimba are {{predominantly}} livestock farmers who breed fat-tailed sheep and goats, but count their {{wealth in the}} number of their cattle. They also grow and farm rain-fed crops such as maize and millet. Livestock are the major source of milk and meat for the OvaHimba. Their diet is also supplemented by cornmeal, chicken eggs, wild herbs and honey. Only occasionally, and opportunistically, are the livestock sold for cash. Non-farming businesses, wages and salaries, pensions, and other cash remittances make up a very small portion of the OvaHimba livelihood, which is gained chiefly from their work in conservancies, old-age <b>pensions,</b> and drought <b>relief</b> aid from the government of Namibia.|$|R
40|$|The employer`s payroll {{contribution}} for <b>pension</b> system <b>relief</b> {{has been}} one of the most important topic on the debate about social security. Some advocates that the traditional source of funds for pension system tends to undergo a process of erosion. And there are critics, who argue that there is not a direct relationship between tax relief and elevation of formality or wages paid, among others. The main objectives of this work are: to evaluate the rationality of proposals for payroll taxation relief; to check for the fiscal and income distribution short-run impacts of these proposals (as well as suggest what need to occur in the formal labour market to offset this release); and to present the arguments against the current tax relief proposals and compensation through another tribute. One of the conclusions reached is that the impact of release on the level of formality, income, income inequality and social security revenues is controversial. It also concludes that linear release without compensation can be detrimental to pension system fiscal equilibrium. Thus, the proposal of focused release has the advantages of being less costly and still have positive impacts on income inequality...|$|R
50|$|When Lorck had {{received}} his travel stipend from King Christian III in 1549, {{he promised to}} go away for four years only to return and step into {{the service of the}} king or his successor. He had not exactly kept that promise, always interrupted by more interesting prospects or more or less ill fortune. However, in 1578 he applied to the imperial court for a small fiefdom in Silesia, Guppern (unidentified). When the application was dismissed by the emperor, now Rudolph II, he instead applied in 1579 for a <b>pension</b> and <b>relief</b> from duty as ‘’Hartschier’’, both granted graciously. On February 19, 1583 he turns up in the state account books of Denmark with the note “His Royal Majesty has, on February 19, 1580, employed Melcher Lorichs as a painter and counterfeiter”.His works for the king have been lost, if any substantial body of works was ever produced, which is doubtful. An engraved portrait of the king, a unique woodcut that seems to have meant as frontispiece to the rules for the Order of the Elephant, and a painted full length portrait of king Frederik II, {{the first of its kind}} in Danish art, is all that survives today. Apart from this, it appears Lorck spent most of his energy in having produced what amount to the bulk of the woodcuts for the ‘’Turkish Publication’’.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Two {{opposing}} {{views of}} the human body have existed since time began. Can it be traded or does its value go beyond a monetary one? Today it is illegal to sell organs but the success of organ transplantation has give rise to an enormous controversy. The continued increase in the need for organs has lead to a major use of live donors. Consequently, clandestine selling of organs is becoming more widespread for two main reasons: scientific progress and market demand. Our aim was to consider the protection of ethical principles through legislation. Materials and methods. Based on the principle that it is morally unacceptable for people to die on a waiting list, we analysed various ways in which the National Health Service could give incentives to live donors, including reimbursement of health expenses, tax <b>relief,</b> <b>pension</b> or early retirement benefits, or education grants for the children. Possible incentives for cadaveric organ donation included reimbursal of health and funeral costs, or increase in widow/er's pension. Conclusion. The tendency may be toward reimbursement of costs rather than actual payments. A legal, ethical organ market could save thousands of human lives, but it must be correctly regulated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This dataset provides information on unemployment and labour-force participation among working class residents of interwar London. It consists of a 10 % sample of the New Survey of London Life and Labour, plus a supplementary sample of 50 % of the households containing at least one unemployed person. The New Survey of London Life and Labour was carried out, between 1929 and 1931, by the London School of Economics {{under the direction of}} Hubert Llewellyn Smith, and this sample was computerised between 1983 and 1986. It is held at ICPSR - see New Survey of London Life and Labor, 1929 - 1931 The Data Archive holds another study based on the original source data, SN: 3758 New Survey of London Life and Labour, 1929 - 1931 (see 'references to related studies' below). This is a later project, carried out in the UK in 1995 - 1997, which involved computerisation of all surviving records of the original study. Apart from {{the fact that they are}} both based on the same data source, there is no other connection between the two projects. Main Topics : Variables include information on household composition, hours worked both last week and in a full week, last week's earnings and full week's wages, weekly cost of transport to and from work, receipt of unemployment benefits, <b>pension</b> income, poor <b>relief,</b> amount of rent, and income from other sources such as subletting rooms. Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|R
