40|$|International audienceThe French Observatory of Food Quality (Oqali) aims at {{collecting}} all nutritional {{data provided}} on labels of processed foods (nutritional information and composition), at branded products level, {{in order to}} follow nutritional labeling changes over time. This study carries out an overview of allergens labeling frequencies by distinguishing allergens used in recipes from those listed on <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements,</b> for the fourteen allergen categories for which labeling is mandatory according to European legislation. 17, 309 products were collected, between 2008 and 2012, from 26 food categories. Products were classified per family and type of brand (national brands, retailer brands, entry-level retailer brands, hard discount, and specialized retailer brands). Allergenic ingredients were identified from ingredients lists and <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements.</b> 73 % of the 17, 309 products studied contained at least one allergen in their ingredients list and 39 % had a <b>precautionary</b> <b>statement</b> for one or more allergens. Milk (53 %), gluten (41 %), and egg (22 %) were {{the most commonly used}} allergens in ingredients lists. For <b>precautionary</b> <b>statement,</b> nuts (20 %), egg (14 %), peanut (13 %), soybean (12 %), and milk (11 %) were the most common allergens listed. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>statement</b> was most frequently found among first-price products (hard discount and entry-level retailer brands). National brands seemed to use it less frequently. For all these results, differences depended both on food categories and allergen categories. This study will enable to follow allergens labeling and their use as ingredients over time, particularly by assessing an hypothetical increase in allergens presence in processed food...|$|R

5000|$|In , the EPA {{established}} four Toxicity Categories for acute {{hazards of}} pesticide products, with [...] "Category I" [...] being the highest toxicity category (toxicity class). Most human hazard, <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements,</b> and human {{personal protective equipment}} statements are based upon the Toxicity Category of the pesticide product as sold or distributed.

30|$|These {{initiatives}} of the ICCR {{focus more}} on promoting trade than ensuring consumer safety and environmental protection through appropriate RC mechanisms on the label that are comprehensible by the consumer. Nor are manufacturers required to identify hazardous substances through signal words, <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements</b> or pictograms {{as is the case}} with non-PCP hazardous substances (e.g., pesticides, industrial chemicals). Globally, there is a trend to harmonize labelling of products containing hazardous chemicals in order to promote trade. The assumption is that harmonizing labels will also promote effective RC.|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>precautionary</b> <b>statement</b> is {{designated}} a code, {{starting with the}} letter P and followed by three digits. Statements which correspond to related hazards are grouped together by code number, so the numbering is not consecutive.

Some precautionary phrases are combinations, indicated by a plus sign [...] "+". In several cases, there is a choice of wording, for example [...] "Avoid breathing dust/fume/gas/mist/vapours/spray": the supplier or regulatory agency should choose the appropriate wording for the product concerned.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe safety {{data sheet}} (SDS), {{formerly}} known in the United States as the material {{safety data sheet}} (MSDS), contains important information for the safe handling of chemicals. This manuscript will cover the use of safety data sheets for process design and safe handling of chemicals. Three main categories (flammability, physical properties, and toxicity) listed in a SDS will be explained. Within each category, examples will be presented on how the specific information can be used in the design of safe chemical operations. Further, within the United States, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revised their hazard communication standard in March of 2012. Specifically, the standard has been aligned with the United Nations’ Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Changes include requirements for use of standardized signal words, pictograms, hazard <b>statements,</b> and <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements.</b> The presentation will review examples of these important changes, and relating these to the GHS for safe use of chemicals within the workplace worldwide...|$|R

40|$|The 1988 Amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) {{accelerated}} the reregistration schedule for pesticide products {{registered with the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prior to 1984. The compound 3 -chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride (DRC- 1339), an avicide registered to control 14 pest bird species, was included on Pesticide List B published by EPA. For the reregistration of DRC- 1339, 44 studies were required — 22 product chemistry, 7 wildlife/aquatic hazards, 8 human/domestic animal hazards, 5 environmental fate, and 2 residue chemistry studies. In 5 acute human-health-hazards studies, DRC- 1339 was found to: (1) have an oral LD 50 of 330 (272 - 401) mg/kg in rats, (2) have a dermal LD 50 of 3 ̆e 2. 0 g/kg in rabbits, (3) cause corrosive effects to the eyes of rabbits, (4) cause corrosive effects to the skin of rabbits, and (5) induce dermal sensitization in guinea pigs.
