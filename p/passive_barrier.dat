40|$|Through {{laboratory}} and underground studies, the Bureau of Mines has evaluated {{the use of}} <b>passive</b> <b>barriers</b> (dust shields) to help confine dust generated by longwall shearers to the face area. Laboratory studies focused first on selection of the optimum barrier design, which {{proved to be a}} simple, gobside barrier (made of conveyor belting), coupled with a headgate splitter arm, which was found necessary to prevent the dust cloud from entering the walkway at the headgate end of the shearer when cutting tail to head. Further laboratory testing was done to determine whether using <b>passive</b> <b>barriers</b> in combination with different water-spray dust-reduction methods, including the shearer-clearer system developed by the Bureau, would improve dust reduction over that from using the water sprays alone. It was found that the combination of gobs ide <b>passive</b> <b>barriers</b> plus the full shearer-clearer system was most effective, and surmised that this would be especially useful in thicker seams. However, underground testing revealed that the shearer-clearer system alone was 35 pct more effective in reducing dust contamination than when used with the gobside <b>passive</b> <b>barriers,</b> and far more effective than using <b>passive</b> <b>barriers</b> with a conventional water spray system. For such an effective system as the shearer-clearer; the reduction in avail-able space {{over the top of the}} machine actually impeded system performance; this was shom 1 in both eastern and western mines. But when used with comparatively inefficient water spray systems, the <b>passive</b> <b>barriers,</b> used in combination with a headgate splitter arm, provide consider-able help in reducing dust levels in the walkway...|$|R

This leads to an increased hazard potential, because conventional laser safety barriers only offer a short protection time when illuminated with high laser powers.

These systems must fulfil the requirements of functional safety, e. g. according to IEC  61508, which causes high costs.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the {{metallic}} film for the contact to a semiconductor device is discussed. One {{way to try to}} stabilize a contact is by interposing a thin film of a material that has low diffusivity for the atoms in question. This thin film application is known as a diffusion barrier. Three types of barriers can be distinguished. The stuffed barrier derives its low atomic diffusivity to impurities that concentrate along the extended defects of a polycrystalline layer. Sacrificial barriers exploit the fact that some (elemental) thin films react in a laterally uniform and reproducible fashion. Sacrificial barriers have the advantage that the point of their failure is predictable. <b>Passive</b> <b>barriers</b> are those most closely approximating an ideal barrier.

Recent findings suggest that endothelial cells are not a <b>passive</b> <b>barrier,</b> and upon engagement by transmigrating leukocytes trigger extensive dynamic modifications of their actin cytoskeleton. Unexpectedly, endothelial contractility functions as a restrictor of endothelial gap enlargement {{rather than as a}} facilitator of gap formation as was previously suggested.

The majority of our mechanistic insight into the role of actin in endocytosis has come from studies in budding yeast. Although endocytosis in mammalian cells is clearly more complex and subject to a greater array of regulatory signals, recent advances have revealed actin, and actin-regulatory proteins, to be present at endocytic sites.

30|$|In {{the design}} of {{explosion}} barriers, the suppressant agent should be ideally dispersed as the flame front reaches the barrier (Zou 2001). If the suppressant agent is dispersed prematurely, the suppressant will be driven downstream and its concentration will be diluted by the explosion-induced wind force before being overtaken by the flame. When the suppressant agent is dispersed to late, the suppressant cloud is behind the flame where it has minimal effect in distinguishing the flame.

These hybrid polymers can be synthesized by the sol-gel technique.

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that cancer {{is not merely a}} disease of tumor cells, but a disease of imbalance, in which stromal cells and tumor microenvironment play crucial roles. Extracellular matrix (ECM) as the most abundant component in tumor microenvironment can regulate tumor cell behaviors and tissue tension homeostasis. Collagen constitutes the scaf-fold of tumor microenvironment and affects tumor microen-vironment such that it regulates ECM remodeling by collagen degradation and re-deposition, and promotes tumor infiltra-tion, angiogenesis, invasion and migration. While collagen was traditionally regarded as a <b>passive</b> <b>barrier</b> to resist tumor cells, it is now evident that collagen is also actively involved in promoting tumor progression. Collagen changes in tumor microenvironment release biomechanical signals, which are sensed by both tumor cells and stromal cells, trigger a cascade of biological events.

Although lung epithelial cells were initially merely {{regarded as a}} <b>passive</b> <b>barrier</b> impeding allergen penetrance, we now realize that they recognize allergens through expression of pattern recognition receptors and mount an innate immune response driven by activation of nuclear factor kappa B. On allergen recognition, epithelial cells release cytokines, such as IL- 1, IL- 25, IL- 33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and GM-CSF, and endogenous danger signals, such as high-mobility group box 1, uric acid, and ATP, that activate the dendritic cell network and other innate immune cells, such as basophils and type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Different allergens stimulate different aspects of this general scheme, and common environmental risk factors for sensitization, such as cigarette smoke and diesel particle exposure, do so as well. All of this is influenced by genetic polymorphisms affecting epithelial pattern recognition, barrier function, and cytokine production. Therefore, epithelial cells are crucial in determining the outcome of allergen inhalation...|$|E

In this study, a deep insight into the diffraction characteristics of acoustic fields near noise barriers of various geometries and surface conditions was achieved using numerical simulations. A T-shaped <b>passive</b> noise <b>barrier</b> with acoustically soft upper surfaces was demonstrated to outperform other candidates in a middle- or high-frequency range. Based on attributes of the acoustic field diffracted by T-shaped barriers, an active control strategy was developed to revamp the T-shaped barrier, in which a filtered minimax algorithm was established to drive the secondary sound sources. This algorithm resulted in more uniformly distributed residual sound fields than a filtered-X least mean square algorithm.
