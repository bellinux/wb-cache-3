40|$|Implant {{strategy}} and nutrient restriction prior to finishing may alter feedlot performance, {{as well as}} carcass characteristics and consumer acceptability of beef. The objectives of these studies were {{to determine the effect}} of <b>prefinishing</b> implant {{strategy and}} plane of nutrition on <b>prefinishing</b> and feedlot performance, carcass characteristics and quality, and consumer acceptability of beef. In 2 experiments, spring-born calves were weaned in the fall (Exp. 1, n = 120; and Exp. 2, n = 96) and were either finished as calves (CALF-FED) or placed on a growing program with a target ADG of 0. 45 kg/d (RSTR) or 0. 91 kg/d (UNRSTR) before finishing. Half of each backgrounding group received moderate potency combination hormonal implants (Synovex-S/H; Pfizer Animal Health, Madison, NJ) before finishing (IMPL). At arrival to the feedyard all cattle were implanted with a moderate potency implant and were reimplanted following 100 -d (CALF-FED) or 81 -d on feed (UNRSTR and RSTR). Animal performance and carcass characteristics data were analyzed as a split plot design using the Mixed procedure of SAS. Treatment least-squares means were separated using predicted differences. Implantation <b>prefinishing</b> positively affected (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) ADG in UNRSTR cattle in the feedlot in Exp. 1, and in all growth treatment groups (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in Exp. 2. Cattle in the UNRSTR treatment had greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) HCW than CALF-FED or RSTR in both experiments, but there was no effect (P = 0. 38) of implant on HCW. Cattle fed as calves had a greater (P = 0. 02) marbling score than yearlings in Exp. 1, but there were no differences (P = 0. 32) in marbling scores across treatments in Exp. 2. In Exp 1, IMPL cattle tended (P = 0. 06) to have a lower marbling score and had reduced (P = 0. 03) percentage of cattle grading Choice; however, there was no effect (P ≥ 0. 32) of implant strategy on the percentage of cattle grading Choice or on marbling score. Cattle receiving an implant <b>prefinishing</b> had less (P ≤ 0. 03) initial and sustained tenderness than cattle that received a delayed implant in Exp 1 and 2...|$|E
40|$|A thermal {{deformation}} treatment (TDT) method is developed and implemented during production of industrial batches of chromium bronze bars, {{according to which}} aging is performed after intermediate billet drawing to a <b>prefinishing</b> diameter, then finishing drawing of an aged billet follows to a final diameter with a drawing factor of 1. 10 - 1. 25.

40|$|Ongoing {{efforts to}} {{sequence}} {{the human genome}} are already generating large amounts of data, with substantial increases anticipated {{over the next few}} years. In most cases, a shotgun sequencing strategy is being used, which rapidly yields most of the primary sequence in incompletely assembled sequence contigs (“prefinished” sequence) and more slowly produces the final, completely assembled sequence (“finished” sequence). Thus, in general, <b>prefinished</b> sequence is produced in excess of finished sequence, and this trend is certain to continue and even accelerate over the next few years. Even at a <b>prefinished</b> stage, genomic sequence represents a rich source of important biological information that is of great interest to many investigators. However, analyzing such data is a challenging and daunting task, both because of its sheer volume and because it can change on a day-by-day basis. To facilitate the discovery and characterization of genes and other important elements within <b>prefinished</b> sequence, we have developed an analytical strategy and system that uses readily available software tools in new combinations. Implementation of this strategy for the analysis of <b>prefinished</b> sequence data from human chromosome 7 has demonstrated that this is a convenient, inexpensive, and extensible {{solution to the problem of}} analyzing the large amounts of preliminary data being produced by large-scale sequencing efforts. Our approach is accessible to any investigator who wishes to assimilate additional information about particular sequence data en route to developing richer annotations of a finished sequence...|$|R

However, care must be taken to ensure that minimal shrinkage while cooling will not damage the part. This shrinking allows for mild undercuts and negates the need for ejection mechanisms (in most pieces).|$|R
40|$|Because of {{performance}} problems with hardboard siding in southern Florida, the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed a local standard requiring <b>prefinishing</b> of siding and priming of all siding surfaces, including the back. However, {{the effectiveness of}} these practices was questioned. To determine if back-priming or factory finishing improves durability and performance of hardboard siding, we installed factory-finished and factory-primed siding on two buildings in southern Florida. The buildings were identical except that one had gutters and no overhangs and the other had overhangs and no gutters. Half the siding was back-primed and half was not. Moisture content, temperature, and air pressure difference across the siding were continuously monitored for 2 years. Condition and thickness of siding boards were recorded every 3 months. After removal from the buildings, siding was inspected and final moisture contents were determined. The siding was in excellent condition after about 2 years of outside exposure. There was no evidence that back-priming the siding reduced its in-service moisture content. Whether the siding was from the overhang building or the guttered building did not seem to make a difference, but inspection of the windows and final moisture contents of the trim strongly suggested that overhangs provided additional protection on the gable ends (gutters were only present on the sidewalls) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of initial feedlot weight on the finishing performance and body composition of Western Sudan Baggara bulls. Forty-five Western Sudan Baggara bulls, representing three groups (treatments) with average initial live-weights and ages of 180. 33 ± 2. 97 Kg (27 months old), 220. 33 ± 1. 29 kg (33 months old) and 258. 33 ± 3. 09 kg (37 months old), respectively. Nine animals were slaughtered {{at the start of the}} experiment, 3 animals for each group as controls. The remaining thirty-six bulls were used for conducting the experiment. These animals were divided into three different groups according to body weight (small, medium and heavy according to initial live-weight). Each group consisted of twelve bulls; each group was divided into three replicates, which consisted of four animals. The animals were fed ad-libitum on a finishing ration in feedlots (molasses based diet) to reach the final target slaughter weight of 255, 295 and 335 kg, respectively (all animals in different weights were kept to gain 75 kg). Data on feedlot performance was collected. The three body weight groups indicated that, the initially heavier bulls made faster gains (1. 17 kg) than the medium (1. 04 kg) and the small (0. 91 kg) and took less time (66 days) than medium (73 days) and small (85 days) to reach the target weight. There were no significant difference between groups in daily roughages intake, total concentrate intake, total dry matter intake and feed conversion ratio. Daily concentrate intake increased significantly (p< 0. 01) with increased initial body weight while the total roughages intake decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) with increase of initial body weight. Nine animals were slaughtered after finishing, three animals for each groups. The data of body composition was compared between the <b>prefinishing</b> groups (Ab, Bb and Cb) and the post-finishing groups (Aa, Ba and Ca). The results indicated that empty body weight, hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, cold side weight and subcutaneous fat increased significantly (p< 0. 01) as slaughter weight increased. The cold dressing percentage on live-weight basis was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in post-finishing groups than the pre-finishing groups. Gut-fill significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased and rumen full (p< 0. 05) with increase of slaughter weight. The wholesale cuts and longissimus dorsi area showed no significant difference among the different slaughter groups. Muscle to bone ratio increased significantly (p< 0. 05) with the increase of slaughter weight. While the muscle to fat ratio and bone to fat ratio significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased in post-finishing groups than pre-finishing groups and both decreased with increase of slaughter weights. Proximate chemical analysis indicated that meat moisture content significantly (p< 0. 05) decrease with increase of slaughter weight. Protein content (p< 0. 05) and fat content (p< 0. 01) showed a significant increase as slaughter weight increased, while ash content significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased with increase of slaughter weight. Meat quality attributes showed that water holding capacity and cooking loss was found to decrease significantly (p< 0. 01) with increase of slaughter weight. Economically the financial return or margin over production costs from finishing beef cattle starting with initial body weights 180, 220 and 260 kg to reach the target final weights of 255, 295 and 335 kg was generally encouraging for all groups. It was largest when the medium size bulls were finished...|$|E

40|$|Organic–inorganic hybrid coating systems {{based on}} polyesters and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) are {{synthesized}} and evaluated to develop protective coatings with improved performance for <b>prefinish</b> construction steel and aluminium. The coatings have to combine flexibility, necessary for enduring deformation of the metal substrate after coating, and hardness for improved mechanical properties. Two systems have been studied: a polyester–TEOS system and a polyester–epoxide–TEOS system. The polyester–TEOS system contains polyester oligomers which are crosslinked with silica clusters, formed via the sol-gel process. The polyester–epoxide–TEOS system consists of an organic network of polyester and epoxide with silicon compounds, formed by the sol-gel process. Both systems form transparent hybrid organic–inorganic coatings. The influence of the inorganic compound on the König hardness of the coatings is determined. The polyester–TEOS system shows an increase in hardness with increasing silica content.

In this project, two lamps were compared for their suitability to be used on a wood flooring finishing line: a UV-microwave and a UV-LED lamp. Low heat emission was found for the UV-LED lamp compared to the UV-microwave one. This study also reveals that the 4 W/cm 2 UV-LED lamp used is not powerful enough to cure UV high solids acrylate coatings while satisfactory results can be obtained for UV water-based formulations. In fact, conversion percentages were found to be low for the high solids coatings, leaving the coatings tacky. Higher conversion percentages were obtained for the UV water-based formulations. As a result, mass loss, hardness, and scratch resistance found for the samples cured by UV-LED were closed to the ones found for the samples cured using the UV microwave lamp...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the shaping}} and {{assembly}} behavior of adhesive polymer-metal-composites {{was investigated in}} an international cooperation using two step curable uretdione-polyester-based powder coatings (IPF development [1, 2]) which acts simultaneously as a reactive adhesive agent and as a high quality surface finish. To create the composite, a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) layer with good compatibility to the powder coating was over-molded onto a powder coated aluminum substrate. A polyamide (PA 6) layer was over-molded on to the TPU layer to create a stiff composite structure with possibilities for further functionalization. The TPU-layer in between the metal substrate and the polymer top layer acts as a stress and strain compensation layer. These loads are caused by thermal expansion (under fluctuating temperatures) and external forces/deformation. Another key feature of the composite is the innovative process chain. The powder coating can resist high deformation and therefore the coating is suitable for a future application on to a metal substrate using a coil coating procedure. In addition, the coil could be easily implemented into a production line as a semi-finished product. The <b>prefinished</b> coated metal substrate could be formed (e. g. incremental forming, deep drawing) and inserted in the over-molding procedure. This overall shortened process chain allows not only an effective fabrication of pre-coated semi-finished materials and polymer-metal-joints in high quantities by saving process steps (e. g. cleaning steps, glue application) but also a higher versatility in the following composite production...|$|R

[...] The step backs in its footprint with increasing height and its multi-faceted form are reminiscent of the Art Deco skyscrapers of the 1920s, leading some commentators to describe its architecture as Neo-Art Deco. In addition to the KOIN broadcast studios and offices below grade, the building has three principal functional programs, each with its own entrance and distinctive facade—commercial/office on SW Columbia Street, retail and former theater space on the southwest corner, and residential condominiums on SW Third Avenue. In addition, a restaurant space has its own entrance on SW Clay Street. Thus, the building relates to its surroundings in several distinct ways. Of these, most important is the southwest corner as an extension of the public space represented by the Keller Fountain and adjacent Keller Auditorium. A feature unique in Portland, and resulting from the multi-block nature of the original project, is the location of the entrance to the underground parking and loading docks on the adjacent block to the east.

40|$|The {{building}} {{industry in the}} developing countries, today, is confused between technological developments and the vernacular. The values imbibed in tradition, and colonial hegemony in India have had deep impacts in the psychological perception of the vernacular. Unfortunately, in today’s circumstances, where in population explosion and rapid urbanisation have resulted in severe housing shortages and demands, the advantages which can be borrowed from the technological advancements {{in the developed countries}} cannot be ignored. The meaning of ‘traditional’ itself is mistaken today, where the construction practice is no longer vernacular, but utilizing manpower at large on site to produce buildings is being termed as ‘traditional’. The cultural values associated with what has been termed as ‘traditional’ building methods are so deeply rooted that, even though all the stake holders are aware that the ‘traditional’ building methods are no longer viable solutions for present day demands, it is still continued at large, due to lack of much research on what values technology could add to the building methods for housing. Though it must be mentioned that the scene is not the same for commercial projects, where technology is slowly catching up. This trend, is weighing heavily on the housing industry. Therefore the need of the hour is to come up ideas, systems, strategies of utilizing the potentials of what technology can offer to benefit in supplying quicker, better quality housing. This is absolutely essential from the point of not only housing demands, but also there is a deep declined in the percentage of skilled labour available for making good quality ‘traditional’ craftsmanship. So it is better to channelise the ‘unskilled’ labour into a more productive chain of work, to develop new crafts- ‘industrial’ crafts. This report documents a brief investigation of the present housing scenario in India, the existing construction alternatives, what possibilities industrialization can offer, case studies on a few systems to help arrive at a good system to be developed, and finally ends with a development of a product which can be used to address the housing needs in India, with further research. Parallely a study of fly-ash is presented, the under-utilization of which is seen as the second problem in this research work. So the product/ system proposed and developed is one utilizing a good percentage of flyash as its main ingredient. The Flyash ‘Stack-crete’ as I would call it, is a <b>prefinished</b> load bearing wall element, which can be stacked up to make up a load bearing facade, for a low rise. The report culminates with a discussion on a mockup, the potentials of the product and possible constraints. It should be mentioned here, that, industrialization offers several possibilities as noted in the report. Product and system development is one way of addressing it, and is definitely an important step in the whole process. So the flyash based prefabricated product proposed is one of the ways of addressing the housing needs in India in a sustainable way. I shall by no means make a claim that it is the best way of solving the housing problems, but can conclude that it is a viable option under Indian circustances to address the housing needs with further research. facade masterBuilding TechnologyArchitectur...|$|R
