5|$|The {{introduction}} of the Elementary Education Act 1870 (applying to England and Wales), commonly known as Forster's Education Act having been drawn up by William Edward Forster, created the concept of compulsory education for children under thirteen, although the decision to make education compulsory was {{at the discretion of}} school boards; education was compulsory in approximately 40% of schools by 1873. In areas where education was considered a problem, elected school boards could be set up. These boards could, at their discretion, create local by-laws, confirmed by Parliament, to require attendance and fine the <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> who did not attend. There were exemptions for illness, living more than a certain distance (typically one mile) from a school, or certification of having reached the required standard (which varied by board) which were made mandatory across England and Wales by the 1880 Act.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This review {{examines}} {{stress and}} its consequences on attention and working memory, stress symptoms in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> cancer patients and survivors and long-term consequences of stress on cognitive processing in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> cancer survivors. Method: Eligible studies were experimental, meta-analyses, and qualitative (2000 – 2013) from Pubmed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticles, and Google Scholar. Results: We identified 92 eligible papers. They showed that elevated stress can impede performances on tasks requiring attention and memory patterns. In pediatric oncology, parental stress increased shortly after diagnosis involving depression and anxiety. Consequences of stress on cognitive performances were observed mainly among depressed individuals. As regards <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> cancer survivors, female gender, low Socioeconomic Status (SES), and innate traits of anxiety/anger predicted the development of PTSS. Conclusion: Evidence of stress on attention and working memory processes in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> cancer survivors is insufficiently developed...|$|R

The aim of the current research was to investigate the relationship between image of God and mental health in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> exceptional <b>children.</b> To accomplish the stated goal 168 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> exceptional <b>children</b> were selected by means of proportional sampling procedure. The Image of God Inventory (IOG, Lawrence, 1997) and Symptom Checklist 90 -R (SCL- 90 R, Deragotis et al., 1973) were administered on them. Analysis of data revealed that the magnitude of mental health can be predicted from the quality of images <b>of</b> God in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> exceptional <b>children.</b> Moreover, data revealed that <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> exceptional <b>children</b> who had positive image of God were higher in mental health than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> exceptional <b>children</b> who had a negative image of God.

40|$|IntroductionMany {{studies have}} found that <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> {{overweight}} <b>children</b> do not perceive their child to be overweight. Little is known, however, {{about the extent to which}} such misperceptions exist among <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> preschool-aged <b>children.</b> MethodsWe analyzed data that were collected in 2004 - 2005 from <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> 593 preschool-aged <b>children</b> in 20 child care centers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area. Parents were asked how they would classify their preschooler's weight, and children's height and weight were measured. ResultsOf the predominantly white, educated sample, most parents (90. 7 %) of overweight preschoolers classified their child as normal weight. An even higher percentage (94. 7 %) <b>of</b> <b>children</b> at risk for overweight were classified as normal weight by their <b>parents.</b> Most <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal-weight <b>children</b> classified their child's weight as average. However, 16. 0 % classified their normal-weight child as underweight or very underweight. ConclusionResults indicate that parents are unlikely to recognize childhood overweight among preschool-aged children, which is concerning because <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> overweight <b>children</b> may be unlikely to engage in obesity prevention efforts for their child if they do not recognize their child's risk status. A notable proportion <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal-weight <b>children</b> perceived their child to be underweight, which suggests that <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal-weight <b>children</b> may be more concerned with undernutrition than overnutrition...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the attitudes <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and {{teachers}} to the use of pharmacological management or intervention for the child with ADHD in the classroom. Particular focus was placed on differences in attitude toward the use of stimulants, for the management of emotional/behavioural, cognitive/academic, social and classroom organizational behaviours <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD. Thirty female Western Australian primary school teachers and 90 female parents participated in the present investigation. Participants included: (a) <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> non-medicated <b>children</b> with ADHD, (b) <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> medicated <b>children</b> with ADHD, (c) teachers in regular primary schools, and (d) <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> non-affected <b>children.</b> These participants were given an attitude questionnaire to determine their attitudes towards the use of stimulant medications with children who have ADHD.

25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} {{home and school}} environment can improve the behavior of children with ADHD. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the children with ADHD. The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. Classroom management is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a classroom setting. Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the Reformation, baptism was often {{conducted}} in private as a celebration of the birth of children. The rite was considered necessary for salvation, and so midwives often baptized children to avoid the risk that the child would die unbaptized. Strasbourg reformer Martin Bucer made it a part of the worship service so that parishioners could be reminded of their own baptism, which was to be the sign of their incorporation into the church. The <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> were to bring their children to the font following the sermon, and were admonished to catechize their children, a process which was intended to begin around age ten. Catechesis was considered to be entailed in baptism itself, and weekly catechetical services were instituted for this purpose. Zwingli understood baptism to be a sign of membership in a community rather than a ritual which conferred salvation on individuals. He, or possibly Oecolampadius, can be credited with first articulating this line of thought, later called covenant theology, which became the Reformed sacramental theology. During the Reformation, Anabaptists opposed the practice of infant baptism, arguing that only those who had made a profession of faith should be administered the rite. This was based on a theology of decisional regeneration, the teaching that only those who had made a decision for Christ could be saved. Against this, the Reformed believed that justification is only by grace, rather than based on any human decision.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was twofold; it {{examined}} midlife parents' exposure to daily child-related events as well as the daily emotional reactivity that parents experience in association with these events. The premise of the study is that children can influence the well-being <b>of</b> their <b>parents</b> and that both daily exposure and reactivity to child-related experiences differ with the age <b>of</b> <b>child</b> as well as parental gender. Two conceptual frameworks, generativity and stress theory are used to explain how children influence parents' development and well-being. The study variables included daily child-related stressful events of high and low severity, daily emotional support parents provided their children, and parents' negative mood. Data for these analyses are from the National Study of Daily Experiences. The sample for the present study consisted <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> minor <b>children,</b> ages 1 to 21 (n = 214; 107 mothers, 107 fathers), and <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children,</b> ages 22 and above (n = 287; 107 mothers, 180 fathers). The findings indicated that there were no significant parent gender or child age differences in exposure to high severity stressors, but there were parent gender and child age differences in low severity stressors and emotional support. Mothers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> all ages experience more frequent low severity daily stressors and provide more emotional support than do fathers. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> minor <b>children</b> also experience more frequent daily low severity stressors and provide more emotional support than do <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children.</b> However, <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> minor <b>children</b> do not experience more severe events than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children.</b> For <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>children,</b> the proportion <b>of</b> severe stressors to all stressors was much greater than for <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> minor <b>children.</b> In other words, when a <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> an adult <b>child</b> experiences a child-related stressor, it is more likely to be very serious than when a <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> a minor <b>child</b> experiences a child-related stressor. Last, in relation to parental well-being, this daily stressor study showed that low severity stressors are associated with parents' negative mood. Parent gender nor child age moderated the effects of stressors on negative mood. What this might indicate is that it is truly the persistent, mundane child-related stressors that wear a <b>parent</b> down. Implications <b>of</b> this study show that child-related stressors can also enhance parental development and well-being through opportunity for generativity...|$|R
