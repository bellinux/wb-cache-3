5000|$|One {{study on}} a single cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) showed it purred with an average {{frequency}} of 20.87 Hz (egressive <b>phases)</b> <b>and</b> 18.32 Hz (ingressive phases).

The egressive phases were longer than ingressive <b>phases</b> <b>and</b> moreover, the amplitude was greater in the egressive phases.|$|R
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E
