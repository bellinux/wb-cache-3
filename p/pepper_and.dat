5|$|The breed {{remained}} relatively unknown {{outside of the}} borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering was published. Scott had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirkshire and had learned of the prowess {{of these types of}} specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote Guy Mannering, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named <b>Pepper</b> <b>and</b> Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson, who too used the generic terms of <b>Pepper</b> <b>and</b> Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats. Davidson's dogs came {{from a variety of sources}} including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families. Davidson documented his breeding, and he has been accepted as the originator of the modern breed.|$|E

5|$|When {{the second}} {{version of the}} story was {{translated}} into English by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, they made a number of alterations to the text. For instance, Monsieur Tom Hawake, whose name was a pun on tomahawk, was renamed Mr. Maurice Oyle, and the Slift factory was renamed Grynd Corp. Other changes were made to render the story more culturally understandable to an Anglophone readership; whereas the factory originally sold its mix of dogs, cats, and rats as hare pâté—a food uncommon in Britain—the English translation rendered the mix as salami. In another instance, garlic, <b>pepper,</b> <b>and</b> salt were added to the mixture in the French version, but this was changed to mustard, <b>pepper,</b> <b>and</b> salt for the English version, again reflecting British culinary tastes.|$|E

5|$|Against the {{background}} of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in mid-1640. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the mint in the Tower of London, promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners. In August, after the East India Company refused to grant a loan, Lord Cottington seized the company's stock of <b>pepper</b> <b>and</b> spices and sold it for £60,000 (far below its market value), promising to refund the money with interest later.|$|E

5|$|Charles Brooke {{encouraged}} the immigration of the Chinese coolies, {{beginning in the}} 1860s, to expand the state's gambier and pepper industry. Chinese settlers in neighbouring Sabah and Pontianak also established gambier and pepper plantations, although they existed as independent fiefdoms. These plantations rose {{to become one of}} the state's major industries as worldwide prices for gambier went up during the 1880s and 1890s. In the 20th century, as worldwide gambier prices took a dive, the Kangchu channelled their efforts into <b>pepper</b> <b>and</b> opium cultivation in the state. Sarawak's Kangchu system fell into obscurity in the 1920s, as the opium trade with Hong Kong steadily declined during the course of the decade.|$|E
