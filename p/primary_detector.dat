As part of a research project to investigate the use of active Compton-suppressed room-temperature gamma-ray detectors for direct non-destructive quantification of the TRU content of these RH-TRU wastes, we have designed and purchased a unique detector system using a LaBr 3 (Ce) <b>primary</b> <b>detector</b> and a NaI(Tl) suppression mantle. The LaBr 3 (Ce) <b>primary</b> <b>detector</b> is a cylindrical unit ~ 25 mm in diameter by 76 mm long viewed by a 38 mm diameter photomultiplier. The NaI(Tl) suppression mantle (secondary detector) is 175 mm by 175 mm with a center well that accommodates the <b>primary</b> <b>detector.</b> An important feature of this arrangement is the lack of any “can” between the primary and secondary detectors.

Furthermore, we found that several c-glutamyl peptides, which are CaSR agonists, are kokumi substances.

For this purpose, we used Calcium Green- 1 loaded mouse taste cells in lingual tissue slices and confocal microscopy. Kokumi substances, applied focally around taste pores, induced {{an increase in the}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in a subset of taste cells.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{molecules}} {{are reported to}} be involved in chronic pain. This review outlines the specifics of protein kinase C (PKC), its isoforms and their role in modulating thermo-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPV 1 - 4, TRPM 8, and TRPA 1. Anatomically, PKC and thermo-sensitive TRPs are co-expressed in cell bodies of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which are used as physiological correlates of peripheral and central projections involved in pain transmission. In the past decade, modulation of painful heat-sensitive TRPV 1 by PKC has received the most attention. Recently, PKC modulation of other newly discovered thermo-sensitive pain-mediating TRPs has come into focus. Such modulation may occur under conditions of chronic pain resulting from nerve damage or inflammation. Since thermo-TRPs are <b>primary</b> <b>detectors</b> of acute pain stimuli, their modulation by PKC can severely alter their function, resulting in chronic pain. Comprehensive knowledge of pain signaling involving interaction of specific isoforms of PKC with specific thermo-sensitive TRP channels is incomplete.

40|$|AbstractApproximately 20 of the 30 {{mammalian}} transient receptor potential (TRP) channel subunits {{are expressed}} by specific neurons and cells within the alimentary canal. They subserve {{important roles in}} taste, chemesthesis, mechanosensation, pain and hyperalgesia {{and contribute to the}} regulation of gastrointestinal motility, absorptive and secretory processes, blood flow, and mucosal homeostasis. In a cellular perspective, TRP channels operate either as <b>primary</b> <b>detectors</b> of chemical and physical stimuli, as secondary transducers of ionotropic or metabotropic receptors, or as ion transport channels. The polymodal sensory function of TRPA 1, TRPM 5, TRPM 8, TRPP 2, TRPV 1, TRPV 3 and TRPV 4 enables the digestive system to survey its physical and chemical environment, which is relevant to all processes of digestion. TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 as well as TRPM 6 and TRPM 7 contribute to the absorption of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, respectively. TRPM 7 participates in intestinal pacemaker activity, and TRPC 4 transduces muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation to smooth muscle contraction. Changes in TRP channel expression or function are associated with a variety of diseases/disorders of the digestive system, notably gastro-esophageal reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pain and hyperalgesia in heartburn, functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome, cholera, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, esophageal, gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer, and polycystic liver disease. These implications identify TRP channels as promising drug targets for the management of a number of gastrointestinal pathologies.
