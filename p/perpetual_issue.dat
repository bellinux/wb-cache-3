5000|$|A <b>perpetual</b> <b>issue</b> {{for many}} people of Nepali origin; the birthplace of Gautama Buddha {{has long been a}} {{cultural}} and social issue devoid from the political landscape of both Nepal and India. However, since the souring of {{relations between the two countries}}, the issue has been used to undermine relations between the two countries both politically and socially. The two-day-long International Buddhist conference in Kathmandu which ran from May 19-20, 2016 marked Vesak and the 2,560th birthday of the Buddha was also used to promote the Buddha's birthplace which lies in modern-day Nepal. The decision of the Nepal Culture Ministry to change the theme, [...] "Preservation and Development of Buddhist Heritage of Nepal" [...] with the sub-theme [...] "Lumbini - Birthplace of Buddha" [...] under the name [...] "Lumbini - Fountainhead of Buddhism" [...] was met with criticism from India which subsequently boycotted the conference due to this and on the back of China's supposed monetary involvement in the conference. Nepali Prime Minister, K.P. Oli told the media that the conference, [...] "should help us make clear to the world that Buddha was born in Nepal and that Buddhist philosophy is the product of Nepal".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{interdisciplinary}} Companion Modelling (ComMod) approach in renewable resource management is to facilitate collective learning, negotiation, and institutional innovation about concrete problems faced by rural communities. The objective of this communication is to present and to compare {{the effects of the}} ComMod approach on collective water management at three different pilot sites located in upper northern Thailand (two sites) and west-central Bhutan. At these sites, water management is a cross-cutting problem: the processes of agricultural commercialization and increased pressure on the land led to the need for stakeholders to agree on new rules for the management of limited water resources. In the Lingmuteychu watershed of Bhutan, water sharing at rice transplanting has been a <b>perpetual</b> <b>issue,</b> without a way forward, while in montane northern Thailand a looming water scarcity is linked to the increased demand from expanding irrigated horticultural cropping systems. The paper compares the way this approach was flexibly adapted and implemented at the three sites according to the local contexts. The main effects of the ComMod process at the three sites are then presented according to a common framework analysing the processes of collectiv...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Health {{care reform}} {{has been a}} <b>perpetual</b> <b>issue</b> in German {{politics}} since reunification. Reform initially focused on restructuring {{the health care system}} of the former East Germany. It has subsequently focused on questioning whether the financ-ing of the German social health insurance (SHI) system is sustainable, in light of economic malaise that characterized the 1990 s and heightened global competition. In this article, we document twelve significant attempts to reform health care financing in Germany and critically appraise them according to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity on which SHI systems were built. While the reforms in the aggregate offered the prospect of addressing the challenges faced by the system, the modest results of the reforms and remaining deficiencies of the system underscore the limita-tions of the evolutionary approach to reforms. This suggests that reformers should consider a more revolutionary approach. The German social health insurance (SHI) system is an internationally prominent health care system primarily financed via payroll contribu-tions shared by employers and employees and managed by nonprofit sick-ness funds. Whereas, like the United States, financing is tied to the labor market, in comparison Germany has nearly universal health insurance coverage. Care is delivered by self-employed, office-based physicians i...|$|E

40|$|Scamozzi's Idea della architettura universale (1615) is {{the last}} {{architectural}} treatise endeavoring to provide a comprehensive and all-encompassing presentation of all theoretical and practical issues pertaining to architecture. In doing so, Scamozzi follows Alberti and, most notably, Vitruv who had first defined architecture as a "scientia. " Celebrated by his contemporaries for its stunning erudition, Scamozzi's magnum opus was later, on the same grounds, dismissed as incomprehensible. Consequently, translations restricted themselves to the practical parts on building and the obligatory column theory, thus establishing Scamozzi within the canon of authorities, while {{the other parts of}} his all-encompassing work were mainly forgotten. This article is dedicated to Scamozzi's undertaking in its entirety: It traces Scamozzi's claims of the universal scope and significance of architecture and the foundation of these claims within a philosophical tradition. Scamozzi emphasizes that architecture, being committed to the principle of causality, qualifies as a science; more precisely, following Aristotelian tradition and the definiton of architecture as "habitus faciendi," he classifies it also as a "scientia fattiva. " At the same time Scamozzi is eager, more than his predecessor Daniele Barbaro, to situate architecture beyond the realm of practice. These questions of the relationship of architecture to other arts and sciences are far from being obsolete today; to the contrary, {{whether we like it or}} not, they raise the <b>perpetual</b> <b>issue</b> of the self-understanding of architecture and its role and significance within society...|$|E
40|$|Teachers {{and their}} work are crucial in today's society, where {{education}} is deemed highly important. For teachers {{to be given the}} best opportunity to carry out their job, it is important to underst{{and their work}}ing conditions. A number of reforms have been introduced in the upper secondary school in Sweden, reforms that affect not only the pupils but also the teachers. This implies changed working conditions for the teachers. The teaching profession certainly can be categorised as a people-profession. In addition to dealing with their clients -the pupils - teachers also interact professionally with a number of actors in the organisation where they work, for example their fellow colleagues and the headmasters. In addition, they have to relate to both national and local policies, such as the national curricula. Two of the key issues in teachers' work, as with any profession, are those of autonomy and discretionary power. This is a study dealing with teachers' working conditions, focusing on the concept of discretion. It examines the ongoing negotiation process of shaping, and re-shaping professional work. The objects of study are upper secondary teachers, a group of professionals, and their perceived discretion in their school contexts. The aim of the study is to explore and problematise upper secondary teachers' discretion. The context in which this study takes place can be described in terms of a changing school system, with governance as well as organisational changes being introduced. Many reforms during the last couple of decades have their origin in the new public management discourse where effectiveness, efficiency and economy are key words. The public sector needs to become more efficient, it has been claimed, and the question is what that means for the professionals, in this case the teachers. These conditions are applicable to other Western societies, and thus this study can be said to have relevance not only in a Swedish context. In this study the <b>perpetual</b> <b>issue</b> of the tension or dynamics between profession and organisation is examined; teachers' discretionary power will be problematised, using teachers' voices as the point of entry. The study is based on interviews with upper secondary teachers in an upper secondary school. The results point at the tension between profession and organisation. In the interviews on which this study is based, four main relationships emerged as crucial when it comes to the creation of discretionary power. These relationships are with policies, headmasters, colleagues and pupils. This relationship-based approach helps to unveil a dimension of teachers' work and an arena of where and how discretion is created - a social dimension. In these relationships we can see different proportions of power, control, demand, social support, governance and trust. These concepts are enabling and constraining in various ways. In addition, the concept of role identity is central in understanding how the teachers perceive their level of discretion. The social-psychological concepts of power, control, governance, demand, social support and trust help to illuminate the social process in which discretion is created.

50|$|Perpetual {{insurance}} {{is a type}} of homeowners insurance policy written to have no term, or date, when the policy expires. From the effective start date, the coverage exists for perpetuity. The insured deposits money, called a deposit premium, with the insurer for insurance {{for the life of the}} risk. The deposit is many times larger than the cost of a non-refundable, annual premium for an equivalent policy with a one-year term. The insurer must earn enough income from investing the deposits to cover losses and operating expenses for the model to be economically viable. Upon cancellation, the insured is entitled to a full refund of the initial deposit premium, usually without interest. <b>Perpetual</b> insurance, first <b>issued</b> in the U.S. in Philadelphia in 1752, is still used for fire and homeowner's insurance.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that {{a network of}} active stockjobbers existed in Londonâ€™s Exchange Alley before the South Sea Bubble and that the network operated effectively during the bubble to intermediate exchanges among {{a wide variety of}} customers. Moreover, the existence of a new financial asset {{after the collapse of the}} bubble, the 5 % <b>perpetual</b> annuities <b>issued</b> by the government to the South Seaâ€™s stockholders in 1723, allowed the resumption of profitable market-making activity by a new group of stock jobbers specializing in the new asset. We argue that the resiliency of the existing network of stockjobbers to the shock of the bubble and its collapse laid the basis for an effective microstructure in the London capital market, and therefore to the continued rise of a secondary market for the British national debt. Dicksonâ€™s classic study on the financial revolution in Britain (Dickson, 1967) has spawned a large and growing literature on the sources of that revolution, its development over time, and its ultimate effects on the British economy. Dickson focused on the increasing use of funded long-term debt that could be credibly backed by Parliament, a perpetual and self-renewing institution, and dated its start with the implementation of Dutch financial techniques under William III after the Glorious Revolution (or the Dutch coup dâ€™Ã©tat according to recidivist Jacobites). Not until 1750 and the completion of plans to consolidate the governmentâ€™s accumulated long-term debt into the Three Per Cent Consols, however, did Dickson consider the revolution to be complete and its effects on public finance irreversible. Other elements that contributed to Britainâ€™s success in public finance have been studied since. D. W.

40|$|Would {{you prefer}} to receive a fixed rent {{for a period of}} 50 years, 75 years or {{perpetual}}ly? Well, if you have chosen the perpetual option, you are absolutely right. However, when considering a mathematical and financial approach, they may all end up roughly the same whenever the Net Present Value (NPV) is approximately identical. It makes common sense to choose the perpetual option even if the NPV exhibits myopia when computing the discount value of a fixed yearly rent. After a certain period, the discount value becomes approximately the same even when adding more yearly fixed rents. Corporations and governments <b>issue</b> <b>perpetual</b> bonds while recognizing these may not represent a very good financing strategy and thus implying that most of these issues are either callable or convertible on the issuerâ€™s request. In approaching the existing perpetual debt related NPV myopia, this paper holds two main goals: firstly, we intend to study the behaviours of perpetual debt yields against other perpetual instruments and, secondly, we consider the financial methods for assessing the value of money before proposing a formula adjustment that might serve to overcome default NPV when evaluating fixed rents in perpetuity. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
