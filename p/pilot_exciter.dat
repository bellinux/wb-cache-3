50|$|The {{main exciter}} is a 3,000 rpm 3-phase machine {{directly}} coupled {{to the main}} generator shaft. Cooling is effected by a closed air ventilation circuit with pannier mounted coolers supplied with cooling water from the condensate system. The exciter output is rectified by a 3-phase bridge-connected group of silicon diodes which are natural air cooled and accommodated in a bank of nine cubicles located on a platform cantilevered {{from the side of}} the foundation block. Mounted adjacent to the rectifiers is the main field suppression circuit-breaker which incorporates a discharge resistance and auxiliary switch to close the discharge circuit. A permanent magnet high frequency generator, directly coupled to the exciter shaft, acts as a <b>pilot</b> <b>exciter</b> and supplies the exciter field via a power stage magnetic amplifier which may be regulated either by manual control or by the automatic voltage regulator. The AVR is a continuously acting regulator including such features as VAR limiting, automatic follow-up of manual control, and protection against over fluxing or over exciting of the main generator.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternator}} {{was designed}} to operate at 3,000 rpm and was coupled to the turbine via a clutch. The main and <b>pilot</b> <b>exciters</b> were gear-driven {{from the end of}} the alternator shaft at 1,000 rpm.|$|R
