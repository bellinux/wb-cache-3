40|$|International audienceNortheast Asia is the {{greatest}} area {{in the world where}} continental extension is documented, from Transbaikalia to the Pacific coast.

We further provide a compilation of available ages, including new data from Transbaikalia, to constrain crustal stretching throughout northeastern Asia. Our analysis shows that extension is not correlated to orogenic collapse, but is coeval with two major changes in plate kinematics that occurred at ca. 140 Ma: the closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean and a major change in the subduction direction of the Izanagi oceanic plate towards northeast Asia, from high-angle to low-angle convergence.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{the role of the}} {{mechanical}} properties of the wall in auxin-induced cell elongation, a study has been made of the ability of isolated Avena coleoptile walls to extend (creep) when subjected to a constant applied stress. Creep occurs as a viscoelastic extension which has the following characteristics: the extension is proportional to log time and is partly reversible, and the extension rate has a Q 10 of about 1. 05 and is markedly greater in auxin-pretreated walls. In nonconditioned walls the extension rate is proportional to applied stress, but <b>pre-extension</b> causes the appearance of an apparent yield strain. The similarity of creep and instantaneous plastic deformation in response to temperature or to pretreatment with auxin or KCN suggests that the instantaneous deformation is simply the viscoelastic extension which occurs at very short times. A comparison of these viscoelastic properties with the properties of auxin-induced cell elongation indicates that cell elongation requires more than just a physical extension of the wall. It is suggested that elongation occurs as a series of extension steps, each of which involves a viscoelastic extension preceded or accompanied by an auxin-dependent biochemical change in the wall properties...|$|E

Performance of supporting governmental institutions is weakened by bureaucracy and impotent organizational practices on one hand, and on the other, low profit expectations hinder participation of the private sector.

To measure the induced anisotropy, a rubber test piece is subjected to a simple extension l and then it is subjected to small strain oscillations {{in the direction of the}} <b>pre-extension</b> or in shear. These two different deformations will allow the extent of the anisotropy in the viscoelastic behaviour induced by the <b>pre-extension</b> to be measured. Kuhn and Kunzle 5 found that the loss factor resulting from a small oscillation decreased as a function of the static pre-strain. They and many others have interpreted this as a lowering of internal viscosity due to chain orientation. However, a simple analysis shows that this effect is due to geometric changes alone and that the essential viscoelastic behaviour expressed in terms of the deformed dimension after the application of the pre-strain as the loss modulus for an unfilled rubber is constant with strain up to an extension ratio of 2. It is also isotropic in behaviour for filled rubber compounds such as carbon black. For fumed silica filled rubber, the picture is more complex. For a moderately carbon black (25 phr) filled rubber, the loss modulus is still independent of the pre-strain for normal working strains but at highly filler contents (above 50 phr), the loss modulus increases with pre-strain at extension ratios somewhat less than 2. With silica, the coupling agent dominates the viscoelastic behaviour. For filled rubber, the change in loss modulus with strain can in part be explained by strain amplification, slippage of rubber around the filler, and shape factor effects. This approach can help to further understand the mechanism of filler reinforcement in rubber materials. Another complex loading is also used to validate these results with a static pure shear superimposed with simple shear oscillation. The results confirm the loss modulus is independent of the pre-strain for unfilled rubber and lightly filled rubber but for the most highly filled rubber, the test is unsuitable as the smallest oscillating strains were too great for linear viscoelastic behaviour.

Using some of the critical elements to compare approaches, it is obvious that scaling up is superior to <b>pre-extension</b> and other participatory approaches for technology development and transfer. As such, scaling up is getting more momentum and synergy. Since scaling up aims to provide ‘more quality benefits to more people over a wide geographical area more quickly, more equitably and more lastingly’, this approach is gaining constantly more acceptance and popularity in EIAR, among both its partners and stakeholders, to develop and transfer crop, livestock and, to a limited extent, natural resources management (NRM) technologies and knowledge. Improved technologies and innovations are essential to support an increased productivity of natural resources in watershed management. Many research and development programmes and projects on NRM have been conducted in Ethiopia and potential technologies and knowledge for scaling up have been generated. However, very few of the recommendations from research have been put to use by the target end-users. Therefore, there is a huge potential for utilizing scaling up approaches in the area of NRM. The nature of interventions in NRM, lack of institutional and professional commitment to scale up NRM technologies and knowledge, and the failure of research projects to have a communication strategy of research findings to stakeholders other than farmers are some of the challenges that must be dealt with in order to successfully scale up NRM technologies. This paper will evaluate the importance of a scaling up approach for NRM technologies and knowledge development, as well as transfer, and the challenges in the area of NRM scaling up. 10 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to improve the fundamental understanding of mechanical behaviour of ballast and study the effect of tamping on ballast. The experiments were carried out on scaled railway ballast to eliminate the difficulties associated with testing large particle granular materials. Consideration was given to the gradation, mineralogy and shape during scaling. Particle characterisation work was carried out on scaled and full size ballast using imaging techniques to examine the validity of the use of scaled ballast. Detailed analysis of results is used to quantitatively measure the changes in shape with particle size. The results show measurable differences in particle shape between different particle size intervals. As the differences are small in magnitude, they do not invalidate the use of scaled ballast. Monotonic, cyclic experiments were carried out as part of a laboratory testing programme. Scaled ballast shows generally similar stress strain behaviour to larger granular materials. The friction angle of 40 o to 50 o for the confining pressure range of 15 kPa to 200 kPa falls within the range of friction angle obtained for full size ballast in the literature. The effect of changing confining pressure during train loading was examined. The results show that the settlement increases and the stiffness reduces when the confining pressure cycles. The effect of principal stress reversal during tamping was examined by an extension stage after the cyclic loading. It is shown that massive settlement occurs after the extension stage during initial cycles and settlement returns back to the <b>pre-extension</b> stage soon under loading. The results evidence the disruption of ballast structure and loss of stiffness due to tamping. Specimens were resin stabilised within the triaxial cell after specific stress paths had been followed.

40|$|Cenozoic {{topographic}} {{histories of}} the North American Cordillera and Andes are essential to understand the tectonic and climate evolution over these regions. However, because proxy records document both elevation and climate signals, detangling these signals is difficult and often associated with large uncertainties. To overcome this difficulty, this dissertation describes an interdisciplinary approach involving the application of global climate models (GCMs) to search for coherent solutions of paleoelevations and climates that match Cenozoic proxy records. This approach is used to investigate both early Cenozoic uplift and Neogene extension history of western North American Cordillera; and the late Cenozoic co-evolution of the Andean uplift and tropical climate state. My analysis reveals that elevation estimates derived from fossil leaf physiognomy and stable isotope compositions may be substantially biased by ignoring changes in climate states, and spatial climate patterns. Elevation biases are greatest when using fossil leaves if one assumes modern lapse rates as approximations to the past lapse rates, and are small when using stable isotope compositions due to fortuitous canceling of δ 18 O variations induced by changes in regional circulation, mixing conditions, and precipitation types. After accounting for climate, we estimate Western Cordillera attaining a height of 3 - 4 km in the early Cenozoic. In contrast, influences of changing climates on δ 18 O records are strong during the Neogene. These changes could explain stronger proxy δ 18 O enrichment surrounding the northern Sierra Nevada and central Rockies relative to enrichment within the Great Basin. Removal of this climate signal reveals elevation loss up to 1. 5 – 2 km across the Great Basin, but smaller elevation loss in its surroundings, consistent with the reconstructions of early Cenozoic <b>pre-extension</b> topography. Finally, we demonstrate that the Andean uplift played an integral role in creating the present-day east (cold) –west (warm) SST contrast across the tropical Pacific, through strengthening the diabatic vertical tropospheric circulation and low cloud formation along the South American coast. Collectively, these results improve our interpretations and mechanistic understanding of Cenozoic tectonic and climate history around the eastern circum-Pacific orogenic belt...|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distributions of Cenozoic extension and magmatism in the Cordillera suggest that the onset of major crustal extension at a particular latitude was confined to a relatively narrow belt (< 100 km, <b>pre-extension)</b> and followed the onset of intermediate and silicic magmatism {{by no more than}} a few million years. Extension began in early Eocene time in southern British Columbia, northern Washington, Idaho and Montana. Farther S, extension began at about the Eocene-Oligocene boundary in the Great Basin and slightly later in the Mojave-Sonora Desert region. The intervening area, at the latitude of Las Vegas, remained quiescent until mid-Miocene time. Compositional and isotopic characteristics of most pre-Miocene magmas are consistent with their containing major components of melted continental crust. In mid-Miocene time, two major changes occurred: widening of the area of extension and the widespread appearance of basaltic magmas. The area affected by extension, from southwestern Montana to the Lake Mead region, widened to several hundred kilometres. By this time extension in southern British Columbia, northern Washington and northern Montana had ceased (probably before the end of the Eocene), and extension S of Lake Mead (except in the Gulf of California) had waned. Regions affected by the broader belt of extension during late Miocene, Pliocene, and Quaternary time experienced basaltic magmatism, which began along a central rift zone in the northern part of the region, and which had within a few million years spread to include most of the region; later basaltic activity has tended to concentrate in restricted zones, especially near the margins of the extended area. We recognize a correlation between the amount of earlier crustal thickening and Cenozoic extension, and between the length of time after shortening but before extension and the degree to which a given region was intruded by Late Cretaceous plutons. The localization of extension in areas of previous crustal thickening and the dependence of the timing of extension on the thermal state of the overthickened crust is consistent with a simple thermal-mechanical model developed in a companion paper (Sonder et al.). This raises the possibility that stresses inherent in the North American Plate dominated over plate-interaction forces as controls of the Cenozoic tectonomagmatic evolution of the North American Cordillera, especially in its earlier stages. © 1987 The Geological Society...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStructural {{style of}} {{deformed}} lithosphere primarily {{depends on its}} rheological profile type. Considering continental extension processes, narrow rifts develop for 'normal' thickness and thermal initial conditions in the lithosphere giving four-layer-type rheological profiles. Strength concentrates in both upper crust and uppermost mantle in that case yielding to narrow deformed areas (50 to maximum 100 km wide). In contrast, wide rifts correspond to very large deformed areas in the crust (several 100 's of kilometres). They develop for two- (to three-) layer-type rheological profiles with a rather thin (~ 10 km) brittle upper crust {{on top of a}} thick pile of low viscous ductile rocks (including lower crust and overall lithospheric mantle) that can flow over large distances; this tectonic phenomenon locally yields to the development of Metamorphic Core Complexes (MCC) that can thus be regarded as a particular structure/component of a wide rift. After a thermal relaxation period, over-thickened orogenic domains display such two-layer lithospheric rheological profiles and, from this, development of metamorphic core complexes is often regarded as a witness of post-orogenic collapse process. During Mesozoic to early Cenozoic times, a major E to ESE striking continental extensional affected the eastern part of Asia. The resulting structures cover now an area of 600 to 1000 Km wide, extending from East Gobi basin to Korea, parallel to the eastern coast of China. Numerous and various tectonic markers are preserved and include extensional sedimentary basins, synkinematics granitic intrusions and several MCC that have been identified over this extensional "band". Besides, tomographic studies show that this period is marked by an exceptional lithospheric thinning of ~ 100 km. All these features well correspond to characteristics of a wide rift system forming during a post-orogenic stage. However, up to now, no trace of high pressure units of that age, and, thus, of crustal thickening has been documented there. Lithospheric rheological profiles are computed for both <b>pre-extension</b> and Late Mesozoic extensional periods through Northeastern China. First order parameters controlling rheological profiles are (i) the tectonic regime, (ii) the lithologies composing the different lithospheric levels, (iii) the depth of the moho, (iv) the geothermal gradient and (v) the strain rate during extension. Common 'mean' lithologies are used for both crust and mantle. Paleogeotherms estimations for Early and Middle to Late Mesozoic come from available data on the vitrinite reflectance study within several sedimentary basins of the study area. Restoration of Mesozoic extensional structures is made along an E to ESE trending regional-scale section and finite strain amount is calculated. From this, one can deduce the depth of the Moho at that time and, if considering the age of the structures, the mean strain rate during extension. Resulting lithospheric rheological profiles show a two-layer-type during Mesozoic extensional period, with no strength peak localised just below the Moho and 8 to 10 km thick upper brittle crust which highly corresponds to the conditions required for developing wide rifts. On the other hand, finite strain computations show that extension of the crust was surprisingly limited during Late Mesozoic (~ 1, 15 of stretching) and that tectonics can only partially account for lithospheric thinning (< 20 %). From this study, we pretend that Mesozoic metamorphic core complexes of Northeastern China may have developed without any strong previous thickening of the continental crust. Wide rift should better result from an extremely high geothermal gradient, during that period, combined with plate boundary conditions as driving extension. We propose that continuous slab retreat along the East Asia margin, during Mesozoic to Cenozoic times, may constitute the more plausible origin for this large-scale continental extension...|$|E

With conventional practices and more frequent flooding and incidents of drought, smallholder farmers could hardly sustain their livelihoods, which are mainly based on annual upland farming. Farmers with investment capacity have shifted to planting tree crops and/or to animal production in order to cope with the hazardous phenomena. This case story presents the collaborative R&D program between farmers and researchers in Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces in Cambodia. The program aimed to restore soil fertility and build the resilience of smallholder farmers to the effects of climate change while improving crop productivity and profitability of the smallholder farmers. Using the Diagnosis, Design, Assessment, Training and Extension (DATE) methodology, the project implementers designed, tested, and evaluated crop production systems that are grounded on the principles of conservation agriculture (CA). DATE is a multi-scale, multi-stakeholder participatory approach. It integrates scientific and tacit knowledge, and is composed of four components: agrarian systems diagnosis, field experiment, on-farm assessment, and <b>pre-extension.</b> A number of CA-based cropping systems have been designed and validated in the program: (1) mono-cropping of maize in association with pigeon pea or mungbean as relay crops, (2) biannual rotation cropping of maize with soybean or cassava, and (3) intensified cropping of maize and cassava. Synergizing this with the benefits of CA, each system has the capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation, to retain soil fertility, and to increase smallholder farmers' profitability. Based on the results, pigeon pea is the most suitable crop for mollisols used with maize since it can improve the water retention capacity of the soil, reduce soil evaporation, and reduce mineral nitrogen inputs. Moreover, its grain can be sold or used as animal feed to augment farmers' income, a characteristic that smallholders look for in an agricultural production system. Likewise, shifting mungbean to be sown by hand broadcast after harvesting early maize significantly reduces farmers' risks and costs, thereby improving their productivity. Shifting to CA-based cassava production (a key annual crop) using chisel to operate strip tillage on planting rows after the early maize harvest also enables farmers to significantly minimize risks and costs. These risks and costs are estimated to be about USD (United States Dollar) 300 – 400 per hectare and USD 200 per hectare, respectively. Designing CA-based cropping systems based on the DATE methodology presents clear benefits. DATE is a holistic approach for identifying technical, socioeconomic, and institutional elements for a sustainable and more inclusive intensification of smallholder farmers' agricultural production systems. However, designing such innovative techniques is a combination of context-specific and context-generic features. These issues need {{to be taken into account}} should such innovation be replicated in other regions. In addition, this action-research program should be a continuous process; the agro-technical performances of the introduced cropping systems should be continuously validated in multiple locations and for several years. The outcomes of the cropping systems should also be continuously monitored such that their impacts on natural resources (e. g., soil organic carbon, nutrient cycles, xenobiotic dynamic, etc.) can be determined and measured accurately.
