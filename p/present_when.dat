5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'.

The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E

She was the only woman <b>present</b> <b>when</b> the reactor went critical. She worked with Fermi on the Manhattan Project, and, together with her first husband John Marshall, she subsequently helped solve the problem of xenon poisoning at the Hanford plutonium production site, and supervised the construction and operation of Hanford's plutonium production reactors.|$|E
5|$|Both Conte di Cavour and {{her sister}} ship, , participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, where the latter was lightly damaged.
