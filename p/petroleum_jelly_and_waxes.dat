5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> paraffin <b>wax,</b> <b>and</b> other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} {{and retention of}} a range of fungal spores for a novel spore trap (Microtiter immunospore trap (MTIST)), designed for use with immunoassays, was investigated in wind tunnel experiments. Concentrations of spores of Botrytis cinerea, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Lycopodium clavatum, Erysiphe cruciferarum and Penicillium roqueforti, were measured usingthe MTIST and miniature suction traps (same characteristics as a Burkard 7 day volumetric spore trap). A clear relationship was observed between the spore concentrations measure by the MTIST and those measured by the mini-suction traps. No signi 7 cant (FprobÂ¿ 0 : 4) effect of windspeed was observed for any spore type in samples collected in the MTIST trap. There was some effect on windspeed {{in the collection of the}} larger spore types (Lycopodium) as measured by the mini-suction traps. Pre-coating microtiter wells of the MTIST spore trap with a mixture of paraffin <b>wax</b> <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> significantly increased the collection of the two largest spore types. There were significant differences between the MTIST and the mini-suction spore traps in their ability to trap the smaller spore types (Cladosporium and Penicillium). Employinga Botrytis-specific antiserum, a high level of correlation was observed between the numbers of Botrytis conidia trapped by the MTIST spore trap and, corresponding absorbance values of an ELISA when, wells were pre-coated with either distilled water, poly-L-lysine or a <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> paraffin <b>wax</b> mixture...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on fruits of five species of Citrus namely, Citrus sinensis, (sweet orange); C reticulate, (tangerine); C aurantium, (sour orange); C auratifolia, (lime); C paradise (grapefruit). The different citrus fruits were treated by dipping {{in a mixture of}} detergent solution <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> wrapping with aluminium foil and stored at room and refrigerated temperatures for 12 weeks. Control fruits which were not treated were also set up. The fruits treated by dipping in a mixture detergent solution <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> refrigerated showed the least changes in pH, highest changes in titratable acidity and lowest changes in vitamin C content. This was followed by fruits dipped in a mixture of detergent solution <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> refrigerated without wrapping. And the fruits treated by dipping in a mixture of detergent solution <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> stored at room temperature.

50|$|Because {{they feel}} similar {{when applied to}} human skin, {{there is a common}} {{misconception}} that <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> glycerol (glycerine) are physically similar. <b>Petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> is a non-polar hydrophobic (water-repelling) hydrocarbon and insoluble in water. Glycerol is an alcohol that is strongly hydrophilic (water-attracting): by continuously absorbing moisture from the air (humectant), it produces the feeling of wetness on the skin.

25|$|The {{principle}} {{outlined above}} under polarity, that like dissolves like, {{is the usual}} guide to solubility with organic systems. For example, <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> will dissolve in gasoline because both <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> gasoline are non-polar hydrocarbons. It will not, on the other hand, dissolve in ethyl alcohol or water, since the polarity of these solvents is too high. Sugar will not dissolve in gasoline, since sugar is too polar in comparison with gasoline. A mixture of gasoline and sugar can therefore be separated by filtration, or extraction with water.|$|R

30|$|The {{substances}} {{tested in}} this study (<b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> hydrosoluble gel) are {{the most widely used}} substances in clinical practice when lubrication/isolation of the root canal walls is required.

40|$|Background: To {{know the}} effect of surface {{protective}} agents used in day-to-day practice on the fluoride release property of conventional glass ionomer cements (GIC) and discuss its pros and cons. Materials and Methods: Thirty disc-shaped specimens were fabricated from conventional GIC and block randomized into three groups (Group I, II, and III) of 10 each. Group I specimens were unprotected, group II coated with cavity varnish (Namuvar, Ratnagiri, India) and group III with <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> (Vaseline, Hindustan lever ltd). After polymerization, the disks were immersed in three individual sealable plastic bottles containing deionized distilled water which was changed every 24 hours for 15 days to measure the fluoride release. Statistics and Results: Statistical analysis was carried using software version Systat 10. 0, and the data was subjected to one way ANOVA, using Duncan Multiple Range test (Variable LSD) {{with the level of}} significance set at 0. 05 (P < 0. 05). The greatest amount of fluoride was released from the uncoated group, followed in ranking by <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> <b>and</b> varnish coated and the difference among them was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Application of varnish over GIC can severely impede its fluoride release property. Similarly <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> also impedes the fluoride release, but to a very less extent. We suggest that in situations where the fluoride release property is more important than other properties it is better to coat the GIC with <b>petroleum</b> <b>jelly</b> or leave the restoration without any coating...|$|R
