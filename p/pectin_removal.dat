40|$|A {{rational}} {{approach has}} been applied to design a new environmentally acceptable and industrially viable enzymatic scouring process. Owing to the substrate specificity, the selection of enzymes depends on the structure and composition of the substrate, i. e. cotton fibre. The structure and composition of the outer layers of cotton fibre has been established on the basis of thorough literature study, which identifies wax and <b>pectin</b> <b>removal</b> to be the key steps for successful scouring process. Three main issues are discussed here, i. e. benchmarking of the existing alkaline scouring process, an evaluation of several selected acidic and alkaline pectinases for scouring, and the effect of wax removal treatment on pectinase performance. It has been found that the pectinolytic capability of alkaline pectinases on cotton pectin is nearly 75 % higher than that of acidic pectinases. It is concluded that an efficient wax removal prior to pectinase treatment indeed results in improved performance in terms of hydrophilicity and <b>pectin</b> <b>removal.</b> To evaluate the hydrophilicity, the structural contact angle () was measured using an auto-porosimeter...|$|E
40|$|Pectin and lignin {{are both}} very {{important}} noncellulosic substances occurring in hemp fibers. The main task in preparing hemp fibers for textile applications {{is to remove}} these noncellulosic substances without damage to the fiber cellulose. Pectin and lignin in hemp before and after chemical processing are characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The influence of chemical processes, fiber regions, and alkaline boiling parameters on lignin and <b>pectin</b> <b>removal</b> are investigated in this paper. The {{results indicate that the}} alkaline boiling process is effective for removing pectin and lignin. There is no residual pectin in the fibers after the alkaline treatment, but there is a residual level of lignin. The concentration levels of both sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphite have significant effects on lignin removal, and there are variations in lignin properties and accessibility from the lower to the upper regions of the hemp stem. Bast fiber plants tend to be ideal candidates for non-food organic production [20). The impetus for renewed interest in bast fibers arises mainly from ecological con...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to meticulously investigate an inclusive set of physicochemical and handle properties (determined through Kawabata evaluation system) of bioscoured cotton fabrics. The application of a commercial pectinase preparation, Bioprep 3000 L, for a range of concentrations and treatment times, could create a pectin-free textile with low wax content. Multiple regression analysis was used to describe the effect of enzymatic process variables on <b>pectin</b> and waxes <b>removal.</b> Comparison of fabrics' properties such as wettability, whiteness, crystallinity index, and dyeing behaviour, confirmed that bioscouring could be as much effective as the conventional alkaline process. Uncovering the relationship between the composition of materials and their physicochemical properties was attempted. The application of higher enzyme concentrations generated fabrics with improved low-stress mechanical properties. Bending and shear rigidity, compressional resilience, as well as, extensibility of enzymatically treated cotton fabrics could be efficiently predicted by means of a single independent variable, the crystallinity index.

40|$|Standardized {{allergen}} extracts {{are needed}} for diagnosis and therapy purposes. For grapes, standardization is hampered by low protein and high tannin and pectin concentrations. The aim {{of the current study}} was to develop an optimized method for the extraction of grape proteins and possibly extend this to other fruits. Several existing or modified extraction methods were compared by means of protein concentration determination, SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and radioallergosorbent test (RAST). An optimized extraction protocol was obtained in which we combined a high concentration of plant tissue, a concentrated, enriched and neutral buffer able to remove sugars and keep proteins soluble and a bivalent buffer for <b>pectin</b> <b>removal.</b> Both the quantitative (protein concentration) and qualitative parameters (SDS-PAGE protein patterns and IgE reactivity) were compared to standard protocols and commercial extracts used as diagnostic tools in the clinical practice. This method proved to be the most efficient mainly compared to the standard Björksten protocol in extracting the low molecular weight proteins, including the major grape allergen (lipid transfer protein, Vit v 1). It proved to be an easy, low cost and reproducible method proposed to prepare grape extracts that could replace the commercially available ones, used for diagnosis and possibly extend the method to other fruits especially in extracting LTP...|$|E
40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} high pressure homogenized lemon peel cell wall fiber suspensions, obtained after sequential selective pectin extraction, were investigated {{in the current}} study. For comparison, a general pectin extraction was additionally performed on lemon peel under acid thermal conditions. The obtained insoluble residues and solubilized pectin fractions were characterized based on their neutral sugar and galacturonic acid content, degree of methoxylation and molar mass distribution. Subsequently, microstructure and viscoelastic characteristics of the diverse insoluble residue suspensions were investigated by means of microscopic visualization, determination of the particle size distribution and rheological properties after high pressure homogenization. Due {{to the use of}} different extraction conditions, the insoluble cell wall residues were found to have diverse pectin characteristics and contents. While homogenization of non- or moderate-depleted cell wall suspensions resulted in small viscoelastic moduli due to the disruption of the stiff microfibrillar cell wall network, extensive <b>pectin</b> <b>removal</b> was found to correlate to large viscoelastic moduli of the cell wall suspension upon high pressure homogenization. It is suggested that an extensive pectin extraction resulted in the creation of interfibrillar voids within the cellulose-hemicellulose network, increasing the cell wall flexibility and hydration of the fibers upon suspension. Due to the increased flexibility of this fiber network, the interfibrillar voids in the pectin depleted cell wall material were proposed to expand with increasing pressure level during high pressure homogenization of the generated cell wall suspensions, thereby increasing its viscoelastic properties. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Nascent pectin and glucuronarabinoxylan (GAX), {{synthesized}} {{in vitro}} by membrane-bound enzymes from etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) epicotyls, {{were found to}} bind to pea xyloglucan in a pH-dependent manner. The binding was maximum at low pH (3 - 4), and decreased to almost zero at pH 6. The binding seemed to occur instantaneously, to be non-covalent, and to require both terminal fucose residues of xyloglucan, {{in addition to the}} non-reduced acid residues of GAX and <b>pectin.</b> <b>Removal</b> by protease of the proteins attached to nascent pectin and GAX, greatly reduced the maximum binding and abolished the pH-dependence. The proteins involved seem to have approximate molecular weights of 14 and 94 kDa. The pH-dependent binding of nascent pectin and GAX is not completely specific to xyloglucan, since some binding occurred to a range of other matrix polysaccharides, though at a lower level than to pea xyloglucan. Newly-deposited pectin was extracted from peas that were incubated with radioactively labelled sucrose. It was shown to behave in a similar manner as nascent pectin, exhibiting the same pH-dependent binding pattern to xyloglucan. Protease treatment of pectin decreased the binding, indicating the possible presence of proteins attached to pectin in the cell wall, and revealing the role of those proteins in the interaction of pectin with other matrix polysaccharides, particularly xyloglucan. The pH-dependence of the binding suggests a functional interaction with the mechanisms that control growth, since the wall pH decreases when elongation growth is initiated.

In the study, plasma acid was collected by processing distilled water with dielectric barrier discharge device under atmospheric pressure. Then the plasma acid was used in hemp degumming process.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{microbial}} pretreatment on hemp fibres were evaluated after microbial retting using the white rot fungi Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Phlebia radiata Cel 26 and water retting. Based on chemical composition, P. radiata Cel 26 showed the highest selectivity for pectin and lignin degradation and lowest cellulose loss (14 %) {{resulting in the}} highest cellulose content (78. 4 %) for the treated hemp fibres. The <b>pectin</b> and lignin <b>removal</b> after treatment with P. radiata Cel 26 were of the order 82 % and 50 %, respectively. Aligned epoxy-matrix composites were made from hemp fibres defibrated with the microbial retting to evaluate the effects on their ultrastructure. SEM microscopy of the composites showed low porosity on the fibre surfaces after defibration with P. radiata Cel 26 and C. subvermispora indicating good epoxy polymer impregnation. In contrast, fibres treated by water retting and the raw hemp fibres were badly impregnated due to porosity caused by surface impurities such as epidermis and other pectin rich plant cells.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the effect of pre-treatment and modification processes on the properties of hemp cellulose fibre for biopolymer composites application. Hemp fibres have been modified by various extraction, swelling, chemical and enzymatic treatments. The morphology and mechanical properties of the modified fibres have been measured. Biopolymer composites have been prepared using the modified fibres and matrices of cellulose acetate butyrate and cellulose solutions derived from hemp. The first fibre treatment employed was acetone extraction and mercerization. A low pressure acrylonitrile grafting initiated by azo-bis-isobutylonitrile was performed using alkali treated fibre. The AN grafted fibres had no transformation of crystalline structure as observed after mercerization. The mechanical properties performed by a single fibre test method were strongly influenced by the cellulose structure, lateral index of crystallinity, and fraction of grafting. Bioscouring of hemp using pectate lyase (EC 4. 2. 2. 2), Scourzyme L, was performed. Greater enzyme concentration and a longer treatment improved the removal of the low methoxy <b>pectin</b> component. <b>Removal</b> of pectate caused no crystalline transformation in the fibres, except for a slight decline in the X-ray crystalline order index. Smooth surfaces and separated fibres were evidence of successful treatment. The shortening of fibre by grinding and ball-milling was introduced to achieve a desired fibre size. An increase in the milling duration gradual ly destroyed the crystalline structure of the cellulose fibres. An increase in solvent polarity, solvent-fibre ratio, agitation speed and drying rate resulted in the rearrangement of the ball-milled cellulose crystalline structure to a greater order. The thermal degradation behaviour of hemp fibres was investigated by using TGA. The greater activation energy of treated hemp fibre compared with untreated fibre represented an increase in purity and improvement of structural order. The all hemp cellulose composites were prepared by an introduction of fibres into 12 % cellulose N-methyl-morpholine N-oxide (NMMO) solution and water-ethanol regeneration. A broadening of the scattering of the main crystalline plane, (002) and a depression of the maximum degradation temperature of the fibres were observed. These revealed a structural change in the fibres arising from the preparation. The mechanical properties of composites depended on size, surface area, crystallinity and the structural swelling of the fibres. Composites of cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and modified hemp fibres were prepared. Composites containing pectate lyase enzyme treated fibres showed better mechanical property improvement than untreated and alkali treated fibres respectively...|$|R
40|$|Pectic {{substances}} {{are present}} in high proportions in sugar beet pulp. This by-product is therefore a potential raw material for the pectin industry. However, sugar beet pectin has poor physico-chemical properties compared with pectins from other sources. In order to improve these properties, pectins obtained from beet pulp by autoclaving and acid extraction were chemically characterized and subjected to enzymatic modification and oxidative cross-linking. The autoclave extracts contained two populations of feruloylated rhamnogalacturonans with highly branched arabinose side-chains having apparent molecular weights of 1300 and 120 kDa, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of homogalacturonans (21 kDa) and of feruloylated arabinans (10 - 15 kDa) was shown. The acid extracted beet pectin consisted mainly of galacturonic acid with galactose as predominant neutral sugar. The homogalacturonans and rhamnogalacturonans were still linked in this extract. Cross-linking of the extracts obtained by autoclaving or acid treatment with hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase increased the viscosity and {{eventually led to the}} formation of a gel. Treatment of the autoclave extracts with ammonium persulfate decreased the viscosity. Cross-linking of the acid extracted pectin with ammonium persulfate slowly increased the viscosity. The ratio of the different ferulic acid dehydrodimers formed was similar for both oxidants. The total amount of dehydrodimers was lower for the ammonium persulfate cross-linked material. Cross-linking of purified rhamnogalacturonans with hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase led to an increase in viscosity or in gel formation at concentrations as low as 0. 75 %. Oxidative cross-linking of the arabinans also led to gel formation, at a concentration of 4. 0 %. Treatment of acid extracted beet pectin with rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase plus rhamnogalacturonase showed that the rhamnogalacturonan backbone has little effect on the intrinsic viscosity of this <b>pectin.</b> <b>Removal</b> of the arabinans from purifiedrhamnogalacturonans showed that the arabinan side-chains contribute little to the intrinsic viscosity of the rhamnogalacturonans.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis of Gerrit Bouwhuis, {{lecturer}} at Saxion Research Centre for Design and Technology in Enschede {{is the development of}} a new industrial applicable pre-treatment process for cotton based on catalysis. The pre-treatment generally consists of desizing, scouring and bleaching. These processes can be continuous or batch wise. Advances in the science of biocatalytic pre-treatment of cotton and catalytic bleaching formed the scientific basis for this work. The work of Agrawal on enzymes for bio-scouring and of Topalovic on catalytic bleaching led to the conclusion that reduced reaction temperatures for the pre-treatment processes of cotton are possible. A second reason for the present work is a persistent and strong pressure on the industry to implement ‘more sustainable’ and environmental friendlier processes. It was clear that for the industrial implementation of the newly developed process it would be necessary to ‘translate’ the academic knowledge based on the catalysts, into a process at conditions that are applicable in textile industry. Previous experiences learned that the transition from academic knowledge into industrial applicable processes often failed. This is caused by lack of experience of university researchers with industrial product and process development as well as a lack of awareness of industrial developers of academic research. This is especially evident for the so-called Small and Medium Enterprises (SME’s). To overcome this gap a first step was to organize collaboration between academic institutes and industries. The basis for the collaboration was the prospect of this work for benefits for all parties involved. A rational approach has been adopted by first gathering knowledge about the properties and morphology of cotton and the know how on the conventional pre-treatment process. To be able to understand the conventional processes it was necessary not only to explore the chemical and physical aspects but also to evaluate the process conditions and equipment that are used. This information has been the basis for the present lab research on combined bio-catalytic desizing and scouring as well as catalytic bleaching. For the measurement of the performance of the treatments and the process steps, the performance indicators have been evaluated and selected. Here the choice has been made to use industrially known and accepted performance indicators. For the new bio-catalytic pre-treatment an enzyme cocktail, consisting of amylase, cutinase and pectinase has been developed. The process conditions in the enzyme cocktail tests have been explored reflecting different pre-treatment equipment as they are used in practice and for their different operation conditions. The exploration showed that combined bio-catalytic desizing and scouring seemed attractive for industrial application, with major reduction of the reaction and the rinsing temperatures, leading to several advantages. The performance of this treatment, when compared with the existing industrial treatment showed that the quality of the treated fabric was comparable or better than the present industrial standard, while concentrations enzymes in the cocktail have not yet been fully optimized. To explore the application of a manganese catalyst in the bleaching step of the pre-treatment process the fabrics were treated with the enzyme cocktail prior to the bleaching. It has been decided not to use conventional pre-treatment processes because in that case the combined desizing and scouring step would not be integrated in the newly developed process. To explore catalytic bleaching it has been tried to mimic the existing industrial processes where possible. The use of the catalyst at 100 °C, as occurs in a conventional steamer, leads to decomposition of the catalyst and thus no bleach activation occurs. This led to the conclusion that catalytic bleaching is not possible in present steamers nor at low temperature. This latter fact is caused by equipment restrictions, which are not easily overcome without important investments. So it has been decided to explore the bleaching process by simple batch experiments in a beakerglass. From these experiments it has been concluded that catalytic bleaching is only possible in discontinuous equipment, where the fabric is treated in an aqueous environment at low temperature. A special result of the experiments on bleaching was that the bio-catalytic treating steps allows a reduction of the concentration sodiumhydroxide in the bleaching step. In conventional treatments sodiumhydroxide is needed to saponify the waxy layer and to degrade the pectin in the primary wall of cotton. As this has already been achieved in the bio-catalytic treatment step it is not necessary anymore to add sodiumhydroxide for wax and <b>pectin</b> <b>removal</b> to the bleaching liquor. To explore the importance of mass transfer in bio-catalytic wet textile processes a learning model was set-up. The basis for the model is the understanding of fluid flow and diffusion in a textile fabric, which consists of a stagnant core and a convective shell. Wet textile processes are strongly influenced by mass transfer processes, where it is about the transfer of chemicals into and products out of a fabric. The mass transfer in the stagnant core is slow and in the convective shell the mass transfer is fast. A squeezing factor α has been introduced to explain the effect of the mechanical energy on mass transfer. The model provides some insight in the role of the dominating factors in mass transfer, which was qualitatively confirmed by lab experiments. Further it is elucidated that repeated refreshment of the volume in the capillaries of the yarn by the application of mechanical energy is of decisive importance in enzymatic textile treatments. The knowledge and know-how that has been gathered on the enzyme cocktail, bleaching activators and on the necessity of mechanical energy in enzymatic wet textile processes has been transformed in a pre-treatment process for cotton on specific installed base. Subsequently experiments have been carried out on a full size pre-treatment plant and these confirmed the findings of the lab work in terms of desizing and hydrophilic properties of the fabrics. So it is concluded that industrial application of enzymatic desizing and scouring is possible. The developed bleach activation has not yet resulted in the particularly high whiteness standard of the hosting company. Under these conditions the optimal use of the bleach stabilizers is of dominant importance. Recently some industrial experiments have been carried out with a more thermostable manganese catalyst. Although the whiteness was importantly improved, when compared to the previous trials, this has not yet led to full realization of the high whiteness standard of the hosting company. The performance on the whiteness of the fabric that has been treated on industrial scale with the new developed process still has to be further optimized. It is expected that this will be realized in future optimization trials. The reductions on water and energy consumption that have been realized and the decrease of the pollution load of the effluent are found to be substantial. It can be concluded that (bio) catalytic pretreatment of cotton on industrial scale is possible and leads to cost reductions in terms of less water and energy consumption and reduced wastewater treatment costs...|$|E
40|$|In Thailand, {{many plants}} {{have been used as}} {{vegetables}} as well as for traditional medicine. Okra, Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench, is an example of such a plant. Examples for the medical use are treatment of gastric irritation, treatment of dental diseases, lowering cholesterol level and preventing cancer. These biological activities are ascribed to polysaccharide structures of okra in particular pectin structures. However, the precise structure of okra pectins and also of other polysaccharides in okra pods have been lacking so far. In order to obtain detailed information of the different polysaccharides present in okra, okra cell wall material was prepared from the pulp of okra pods and was then sequentially extracted with hot buffer, chelating agent, diluted alkali and concentrated alkali. The sugar (linkage) composition indicated that okra cell wall contained, next to cellulose, different populations of pectins and hemicelluloses. The pectic polysaccharides were mainly obtained in the first three extracts having slightly different chemical structures. The okra pectin extracted by hot buffer was almost a pure rhamnogalacturonan (RG) I {{with a high degree of}} acetylation (DA), covalently linked to a minor amount of homogalacturonan (HG) having a high degree of methyl esterification (DM). The chelating agent extractable pectin and the diluted alkali extractable pectin predominantly contained HG with only minor amounts of RG I. Okra pectins extracted by hot buffer and with chelating agent had in common that both contained highly branched RG I with very short side chains containing not more than 3 galactosyl units attached to the rhamnosyl residues in RG I backbone. Chelating agent extracted okra pectins also carried arabinan and arabinogalactan type II as neutral side chains and these side chains were even more abundantly present in the diluted alkali extracted okra pectin. The hemicellulosic polysaccharides ended up in concentrated alkali extract. From the sugar (linkage) composition and enzymatic degradation studies using pure and well defined enzymes, it was concluded that this fraction contained a XXXG–type xyloglucan and 4 -methylglucuronoxylan. The cellulosic polysaccharides were retained in the residue. The okra hot buffer extractable RG I having a high level of acetyl substitution appeared to be very well degradable by rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase which was known to be hindered completely by acetylated substrates. In contrast, an acetylated galacturonic acid-specific rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase was unable to remove acetyl groups from the RG I molecule of hot buffer extracted okra pectin. For these reasons, the precise position of the acetyl groups present on enzymatically released oligomers were determined by Electron Spray Ionization Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry (ESI-IT-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The acetyl groups were found to be predominantly located at position O- 3 of the rhamnosyl moiety, while the methyl esters seemed to be present only on the HG part of the hot buffer extracted okra pectin. Another novelty of okra RG-I was the presence of terminal alpha-linked galactosyl substitution at position O- 4 of the rhamnosyl residues within the RG I backbone. These specific features (acetylated rhamnosyl- and alpha-galactosyl-substitutions) were almost absent in the chelating agent extracted okra pectin where more commonly known substitutions were present, including acetylated galacturonosyl residues in the RG I backbone. The unique structure features of hot buffer extracted okra pectin led to the assumption that these features may contribute to the rather typical physical properties as well as to the biological properties found for okra pectin. In order to understand the effect of the specific structural features of RG I on its physical properties, the rheological properties of hot buffer extracted okra pectin were determined and compared to those found for chelating agent extracted okra pectin and for pectins from other plant materials as reported in the literature. The solutions of hot buffer extracted okra pectin showed a high viscosity and predominant elastic behaviour which most probably is caused by strong hydrophobic associations through its acetylated rhamnosyl residues rather than by methyl esterified galacturonosyl residues as is commonly the case for <b>pectins.</b> The <b>removal</b> of acetyl groups and methyl esters decreased the association of the pectin molecules as observed by the light scattering experiment, meaning that not only viscosity and rheological properties but also association of pectin molecules were as result of both hydrophobic interactions and charge effects. The effect of the position of acetyl groups on the bioactivity of okra pectin was also determined. The complement-fixing activity of okra pectins was found to be affected by many factors like e. g. the presence of acetyl groups, the size of RG segments and the presence of terminal alpha galactosyl groups and even the three dimensional conformation of the molecules. The hot buffer extracted okra pectin was also examined for its potential to modify surfaces of medical devices and implants. The results showed that okra pectin can be used in coating medical device since it promotes cell apoptosis and shows no macrophage activation. The knowledge described in this thesis provided us with novel information on the unique structures of okra pectins and may lead to a better understanding of the functional properties of okra polysaccharides in general and okra pectin in particular and to optimize the use of okra pectins within the food industry and in medical applications. However, despite our efforts, at the moment the dependency of the (bio) functionality of okra pectins on the precise chemical structure are not yet completely understood...|$|R
