5|$|On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT {{announced}} {{a project to}} reconstruct NY149 and its junction with US4 in Fort Ann. The <b>project</b> <b>would</b> upgrade the intersection by doing an overall expansion, requiring the condemnation of one property. This new widening would help make turns from US4 south to NY149 west. The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US4 and NY149, which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall2013 with construction beginning soon after. The slated date of completion for the $1.3million <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be in Fall2014.|$|E
5|$|An MDOT {{document}} {{indicated that}} in 2010, a $2.1million <b>project</b> <b>would</b> reconstruct M-168. Upon {{completion of the}} project, the route would be jurisdictionally transferred to the Village of Elberta, thereby removing M-168 from the state trunkline system. This transfer was finalized on April 24, 2012, and afterwards, the former M-168 was reclassified a village street.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} {{raised by}} Crozier in 2006 that the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be halted {{after the first}} phase, which were dismissed at the time, no further work has actually been completed on the Essex Bypass since 2012, and the section between Essex and Ruthven remains a two lane highway. It is still considered as a future project by the MTO, with no time line set.|$|E
50|$|Opponents say the {{crossing}} would create unnecessary urban sprawl in the Anchorage area, {{would be more}} expensive and less used than <b>projected,</b> <b>would</b> divert limited transportation funding away from more critical <b>projects,</b> <b>would</b> disrupt the Government Hill neighborhood, and negatively impact the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales.|$|R

5|$|In {{the same}} letter, Gruening also {{promoted}} {{the possibility of}} the dam creating a thriving tourism industry in Interior Alaska, a hypothesis that was raised by other dam supporters as well. Greuning stated that the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be similar to Lake Powell, in that it would create a range of recreational activities, including water skiing and picnicking.|$|E
5|$|Long-term plans from WSDOT {{to address}} {{increasing}} traffic congestion in downtown Monroe include {{the construction of}} a highway bypass for US2 {{to the north of the}} city. The <b>project</b> <b>would</b> include a northern extension of SR522 to intersect the realigned US2 near Kelsey Street and Chain Lake Road.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 2008, the FTA {{reversed}} the earlier decision and approved the above-ground project, {{saying that it}} met standards for cost efficiency, construction and ridership, moving it closer to receiving the $900 million in federal funding. Officials told The Washington Post that the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> move into the final design stage. The FTA approved funding for the project on December 4, 2008.|$|E
50|$|In this way, {{academic}} and industrial partners in these <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> {{become the first}} end users of the framework, and they would highly benefit from an open source initiative. These <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> provide noticeable international visibility to VIATRA2 {{as well as the}} entire GMT project. Moreover, many interesting directions for future developments have already been evolved (and will continuously evolve) using the feedbacks from partners.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{first major}} {{commission}} was the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver. [...] Subsequent <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> include Salle Wilfred-Pelletier, Place Bonaventure, and Maison Alcan.|$|R
50|$|It was {{revealed}} in June 2015 {{that the two}} separately announced <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> in fact be a single crossover, titled Cyborg 009 VS Devilman.|$|R
5|$|Support for the dam project {{came from}} a variety of sources, but {{supporters}} tended to use three primary arguments in favor of its construction: the electricity generated by the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be cheap and plentiful, industries would be attracted to Alaska by the cheap electricity, and the dam's construction would have minimal impact on the environment and human populations.|$|E
5|$|This <b>project</b> <b>would</b> also {{enable the}} {{platforms}} at Herne Hill to be lengthened to accommodate 12-car trains {{as the current}} northern junction, which prevents them from being extended, would be removed. However, longer trains {{could not be used}} on the Sutton/Wimbledon Loop without also rebuilding Tulse Hill and Elephant & Castle.|$|E
5|$|A slip ramp {{was also}} planned in 2000 {{to connect to}} Lafayette Street in Norristown {{as part of a}} {{revitalization}} plan for the community. The <b>project</b> <b>would</b> involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery County officials have proposed a surcharge for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011. On January 7, 2015, the turnpike commission committed $45 million to building this interchange. Construction on the interchange at Lafayette Street may begin as soon as 2018.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approvals}} {{process for}} transmission <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> also be [...] and (for {{the first time}} in Ontario) the bill would enact standards for renewable energy <b>projects.</b> Homeowners <b>would</b> have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest loans to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels.|$|R
50|$|The TBTA was {{merged into}} the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968. Surplus revenue, {{formerly}} used for new automobile <b>projects,</b> <b>would</b> now {{be used to}} support public transportation.|$|R

5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and subpar games. Stevens points out that without the income from the compilation, the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> not have been possible. The developers estimate the production cost of Ace at Â£40k. Following {{the release of}} Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Christopher McQuarrie, {{who went}} uncredited {{for his work}} on X-Men, was hired to write the {{screenplay}} for the second Wolverine film in August 2009. Darren Aronofsky was chosen to direct the film, though bowed out, stating the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> keep him out of the country for too long. James Mangold was later chosen to direct the film. Mark Bomback was then hired to rewrite McQuarrie's script. Principal photography began in August 2012 in Sydney, Australia, and ended in November. The film was released on July 26, 2013.|$|E
50|$|People who back MusicBee <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> {{be offered}} {{different}} tangible or intangible rewards {{designed by the}} project owner, such as mp3 link, tangible CDs, souvenirs and also a private concert etc.|$|R
50|$|Five {{structures}} were planned: however only one, Temenos, has been unveiled. However, in September 2012, Kapoor insisted the other <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> go ahead. But by September 2016 no progress had been announced.|$|R
50|$|It was {{unlikely}} that many <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> {{have been affected}} by the measure, though it could have affected large-scale projects such as California High-Speed Rail and California Water Fix and Eco Restore.|$|R
5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E
5|$|Hitman Go was {{developed}} by Canadian video game studio Square Enix Montreal. It is the first game from the developer, {{which was founded in}} late 2011 by employees of existing Square Enix Europe studios. Upon establishment, the studio announced that their first <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be a new video game in the Hitman franchise. The studio's original aspiration was creating triple-A console games within the series and expanding to a team size of 150 people. After a year, while the team was still expanding, the console game was cancelled and the studio shifted its focus to mobile games. This transition led to around one third of the staff leaving the development team.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, the Shetland Islands Council {{signed a}} {{partnership}} agreement with Scottish and Southern Energy for the Viking Wind Farm, a 200-turbine wind farm and subsea cable. This renewable energy <b>project</b> <b>would</b> produce about 600 megawatts and contribute about Â£20 {{million to the}} Shetland economy per year. The plan met with significant opposition within the islands, primarily resulting from the anticipated visual impact of the development. The PURE project on Unst is a research centre which uses a combination of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system. The project {{is run by the}} Unst Partnership, the local community's development trust.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2012, Tyler Perry {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} with OWN. According to the terms, all of Perry's new TV <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> air on the OWN network. [...] These TV <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> comprise a total of 90 episodes and help the network fill its programming schedule with original content. These shows include a drama, The Haves and the Have Nots, a new original comedy, Love Thy Neighbor, {{as well as a}} third season of the comedy series Tyler Perry's For Better or Worse which formerly aired on TBS. All three series were renewed after their respective first seasons on OWN.|$|R

5|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Grint would star in the drama film Cherrybomb with Robert Sheehan and Kimberley Nixon. Grint found shooting this film very different from the Harry Potter films since he had to adjust to doing a dozen scenes per day. Grint's character Malachy, a worker at Belfast goes to great lengths to impress his boss's daughter, with whom he is infatuated. This film, like his next <b>project,</b> <b>would</b> involve him playing violent roles. Despite premiering at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, the film was initially unable to find a distributor. An online campaign by Grint's fans was credited with helping to secure a deal for distribution in the UK in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, The Guardian {{reported}} on concerns regarding {{funding for the}} Tablighi Jamaat's construction project. Documentation filed with the Charity Commission indicated that 's annual donations {{were in the order}} of only Â£500,000, suggesting the need for significant extra financial support to fund the building project. It was suggested that the <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be funded by Saudi Salafi groups. This was based on Tablighi Jamaat's being a Deobandi Muslim organisation that has close links with the form of the religion practised by the Saudi royal family.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, Governor Larry Hogan {{announced}} {{a plan to}} widen the Baltimore-Washington Parkway by four lanes, adding express toll lanes to the median, {{as part of a}} $9 billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland. The <b>project</b> <b>would</b> be a public-private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the lanes. As part of the proposal, the portion of the parkway owned by the National Park Service would be transferred to the Maryland Transportation Authority.|$|E
40|$|BPA {{has been}} asked by PPM Energy, Inc. to {{interconnect}} 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity generated from the proposed Klondike III Wind Project to the Federal Columbia River Transmission System. Orion Energy LLC has also asked BPA to interconnect 400 MW of electricity from its proposed Biglow Canyon Wind Farm, located north and east of the proposed Klondike III Wind Project. (Portland General Electric recently bought the rights to develop the proposed Biglow Canyon Wind Farm from Orion Energy, LLC.) Both wind projects received Site Certificates from the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council on June 30, 2006. To interconnect these <b>projects,</b> BPA <b>would</b> need to build and operate a 230 -kV double-circuit transmission line about 12 miles long, expand one substation and build one new substation. The wind <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> require wind turbines, substation(s), access roads, and other facilities. Two routes for the transmission line are being considered. Both begin at PPM's Klondike Schoolhouse Substation then travel north (Proposed Action) or north and westerly (Middle Alternative) to a new BPA 230 -kV substation next to BPA's existing John Day 500 -kV Substation. BPA is also considering a No Action Alternative in which BPA would not build the transmission line and would not interconnect the wind projects. The proposed BPA and wind <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> be located on private land, mainly used for agriculture. If BPA decides to interconnect the wind projects, construction of the BPA transmission line and substation(s) could commence {{as early as the}} winter of 2006 - 07. Both wind <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> operate for much of each year for at least 20 years. The proposed <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> generally create no or low impacts. Wildlife resources and local visual resources are the only resources to receive an impact rating other than ''none'' or ''low''. The low to moderate impacts to wildlife are from the expected bird and bat mortality and the cumulative impact of this project on wildlife when combined with other proposed wind projects in the region. The low to high impacts to visual resources reflect the effect that the transmission line and the turbine strings from both wind <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> have on viewers in the local area, but this impact diminishes with distance from the project...|$|R
50|$|As of 2012, Wind {{power in}} Vermont {{consists}} of 109 megawatts (MW) of operational wind farms. Together these wind <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> meet the electrical needs of approximately 56,000 average Vermont households (approximately {{the size of}} Windsor County).|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Ontario Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli {{announced}} that the made-in-Ontario content requirements for wind and solar <b>projects</b> <b>would</b> be scrapped, after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled {{that they were a}} violation of WTO regulations.|$|R
