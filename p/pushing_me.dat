[...] The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while brainstorming on her treadmill.

500|$|Reviews of Mysteries of Westgate were mixed. 1UP.com's Jason Wilson {{said that}} the game's plot is [...] "an {{intriguing}} tale, and even after finishing the game, a number of encounters and plot points ring in my head ... but the story's poor stitching distracts from its arc—I felt like a great hand ... was <b>pushing</b> <b>me</b> through the plot, and the tale felt a bit muddled toward the end." [...] Brett Todd of GameSpot called the plot [...] "rough around the edges", while GameZone reviewer Michael Lafferty said, [...] "The game may have a disjointed storyline, but there are moments where humor shines through, and the game does take a few interesting plot twists. And {{the exploration of the}} city zones, the underground areas where the trolls abound, hold that sense of joyful discovery that make an RPG worth playing." [...] Numerous reviewers mentioned that the impact of the mask which drives the story is minimal, having little effect on the actual gameplay. Lafferty said the side quests were not necessarily optional, as they were often a source of additional gold, and a certain point in the game's plot required a substantial sum of it to proceed. GamesRadar's Rich McCormick praised the game's storyline and main quest as some of its best points. In a review for GameStar, Christian Schmidt thought that the game's appearance and humor were poor, but recommended it because of its strong storyline.|$|E
