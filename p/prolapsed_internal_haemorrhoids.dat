40|$|Haemorrhoids {{are one of}} {{the most}} common anal {{disorders}} encountered in primary care. Haemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. 1 These cushions are usually found in three main locations: left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior (3, 7 and 11 o'clock positions). 2 These vascular cushions participate in the drainage of the anal canal. It has also been suggested that these cushions intensify the action of the anal sphincter mechanism, thereby contributing to continence. There are two types of haemorrhoids: internal and external. <b>Internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> arise above the dentate line, are viscerally innervated and therefore painless. External haemorrhoids can be painful because they originate below the dentate line and have a somatic innervation. 3 <b>Internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> are further subdivided according to the degree of prolapsed. peer-reviewe...|$|R

2500|$|Internal rectal {{intussusception}} (occult rectal <b>prolapse,</b> <b>internal</b> procidentia) can {{be defined}} as a funnel shaped infolding of the upper rectal (or lower sigmoid) wall that can occur during defecation. This infolding is perhaps best visualised as folding a sock inside out, creating [...] "a tube within a tube". Another definition is [...] "where the rectum collapses but does not exit the anus". Many sources differentiate between internal rectal intussusception and mucosal prolapse, implying that the former is a full thickness prolapse of rectal wall. However, a publication by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons stated that internal rectal intussusception involved the mucosal and submucosal layers separating from the underlying muscularis mucosa layer attachments, resulting in the separated portion of rectal lining “sliding” down. This may signify that authors use the terms <b>internal</b> rectal <b>prolapse</b> and <b>internal</b> mucosal <b>prolapse</b> to describe the same phenomena.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{periodic}} dispute regarding {{the cause of}} coccydynia and its appropriate treatment. Among the causes that have been proposed are local conditions of the coccyx and sacro-coccygealjoints, median lumbar disc protrusions (Richards 1954) and small tumours of the glomus coccygeus (Klem 1948, Reuther 1938). The patient to be described presents an additional possible cause which merits consideration. A further aspect is that whereas many authors have drawn attention to {{the frequency with which}} cauda equina tumours present with backache and sciatic pain (Toumey, Poppen and Hurley 1950), no reference {{can be found in the}} recent literature to such tumours causing coccygeal pain only.

40|$|AbstractExternal rectal {{prolapse}} {{is defined as}} a full thickness extrusion of the rectum outside of the anus. In patients who are fit enough, it is usually treated with surgical intervention. The surgical focus has traditionally been on reduction of the prolapse, rather than improvement in function. <b>Internal</b> rectal <b>prolapse</b> is also well recognised, being a folding of the full thickness of the rectal wall that occurs on straining to defecate, but that does not protrude outside of the anus. It may present with either obstructed defecation or faecal incontinence. 1, 2 In contrast to external <b>prolapse</b> surgery for <b>internal</b> rectal <b>prolapse</b> has enjoyed a poor reputation, in part due to the poor results of surgery in the late 1980 s 3, 4 but also because of the suggestion that <b>internal</b> <b>prolapse</b> is an incidental finding. 5 The introduction of surgical techniques that focus on functional outcomes in external prolapse surgery have led to a re-appraisal of the treatment of <b>internal</b> rectal <b>prolapse.</b> 6 This coupled with new evidence regarding the morphology of symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>prolapse</b> has quashed the concept of <b>internal</b> <b>prolapse</b> as an untreatable and incidental phenomenon. 7, 8 This article will outline the evolution of surgery for {{rectal prolapse}}, the use of laparoscopic ventral rectopexy in external prolapse and the evaluation and treatment of patient with <b>internal</b> rectal <b>prolapse...</b>|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the efficacy of colonoscopic BL as therapy for symptomatic IH. Methods: Patients seen at our center with symptomatic IH who underwent BL between January 2006 and December 2011 were included in this prospective study. The clinical and colonoscopic details were entered in uniform structured data forms. Results: Two hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with symptomatic IH were enrolled in the study. The presentations were rectal bleeding in 150 (69 %) and prolapse in remaining 68 (31 %) patients. Twenty-four patients (11 %) had chronic liver disease (child B-C). Same operator treated all the patients. The severity of the IH was classified by using Goligher grading system. The mean age of patients was 48. 3 + 15 years with range of 22 - 85 years. The mean follow up was 3 months (range 1 month - 36 months). In 209 patients (96 %) there was at least 1 grade reduction in hemorrhoids as well the symptoms were controlled. Two patients required surgery and another 7 patients required repeat session of banding. After banding session 32 (15 %) patients had perianal pain and 13 (6 %) had mild bleeding.

40|$|Introduction: Pelvic floor disease affects many patients, with age, female {{gender and}} multiparity being {{significant}} associations. This can present clinically as pelvic organ <b>prolapse,</b> <b>internal</b> and external rectal mucosal intussuception, obstructed defecation syndrome, rectocele, cystocele and urinary/faecal incontinence. Diagnostic and treatment {{strategies for the}} management of such disorders is significantly varied, and evidence for current surgical management is poor. This thesis explores diagnostic and operative strategies currently regarded as state of the art and examines a novel method of pelvic floor assessment using MRI-based statistical shaped modelling. Methods: Meta-analysis in accordance with Cochrane collaboration guidelines was performed to assess laparoscopic versus open techniques for urinary incontinence, as well as endoanal ultrasound (EUS) scanning versus MRI in the assessment of faecal incontinence. The efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) was reviewed. In addition, decision analysis was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of delayed versus immediate anal sphincter repairs, and current operative treatments for end-stage faecal incontinence, and operative strategies for end-stage incontinence. MRI-based statistical shaped biomechanical modelling was performed to assess normal pelvic floors in comparison with patients with obstructed defecation syndrome. 15 asymptomatic volunteers aged 18 to 60 years were scanned and compared against 7 with obstructed defecation (ODS). Finally, 7 patients who were treated surgically for ODS were reassessed 6 months post-operation. Results: There were significant benefits to laparoscopic colposuspension for urinary incontinence. EUS was superior to MRI at detecting internal sphincter lesions, but not for external sphincter lesions. Immediate sphincter repairs were more cost-effective than delayed repairs. The artificial bowel sphincter and end stoma were more acceptable to both patient and institution than dynamic graciloplasty. Patients with obstructed defecation had significantly more irregular levator muscles with wider levator hiatus. Pressure during straining was concentrated in the posterior aspect of the hiatus, potentially contributing to the rectal neuropathy noted in obstructed defecation. Conclusions: Sacral nerve stimulation is an effective treatment for faecal incontinence. The artificial bowel sphincter and end stoma were cost-effective long-term strategies for end-stage faecal incontinence. A new technique for dynamic imaging and functionally assessing pelvic floor musculature has been developed and is showing promise as an adjunct to conventional assessment. Conventional defecating proctography does not provide the dynamic and functional assessment provided by this technique, and may translate well into a means of functional radiological assessment in the future.

25|$|Many {{people with}} FI have a {{generalized}} {{weakness of the}} pelvic floor, especially puborectalis. A weakened puborectalis leads to widening of the anorectal angle, and impaired barrier to stool in the rectum entering the anal canal, and this is associated with incontinence to solids. Abnormal descent of the pelvic floor {{can also be a}} sign of pelvic floor weakness. Abnormal descent manifests as descending perineum syndrome (>4cm perineal descent). This syndrome initially gives constipation, and later FI. The pelvic floor is innervated by the pudendal nerve and the S3 and S4 branches of the pelvic plexus. With recurrent straining, e.g. during difficult labour or long term constipation, then stretch injury can damage the nerves supplying levator ani. The pudendal nerve is especially vulnerable to irreversible damage, (stretch induced pudendal neuropathy) which can occur with a 12% stretch. If the pelvic floor muscles lose their innervation, they cease to contract and their muscle fibres are in time replaced by fibrous tissue, which is associated with pelvic floor weakness and incontinence. Increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latency may indicate pelvic floor weakness. The various types of pelvic organ prolapse (e.g. external rectal prolapse, mucosal <b>prolapse</b> and <b>internal</b> rectal intussusception & solitary rectal ulcer syndrome) may also cause coexisting obstructed defecation.|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies was to {{increase}} the knowledge about rectal <b>prolapse</b> and <b>internal</b> rectal intussusception, with special reference to bowel function and treatment with the Ripstein rectopexy. Results after the Ripstein rectopexy in 69 patients with rectal prolapse and in 43 patients with internal metal intussusception were evaluated. There was no operative mortality and early postoperative morbidity was 33 %. The majority of complications were minor. Severe early complications were one faecal impaction and one ureteral stricture. Recurrencies and late complications were studied in 63 of the patients with rectal prolapse. Median length follow-up was 7. 0 (range, 1. 7 - 16. 5) years. There was one recurrence. Forty-two of the patients with internal rectal intussusception were followed-up during median 5. 4 (range, 1. 1 - 16. 5) years. Severe complications were two rectovaginal fistulae and one faecaloma in the sigmoid colon with perforation and lethal peritonitis. Pre- and postoperative functional evaluation {{was carried out in}} 76 patients. Anal continence improved postoperatively and the number of bowel movements per week decreased. Emptying difficulties did not change significantly in patients operated for rectal prolapse but increased in those operated for internal rectal intussusception. Results of repeated defaecography studies in patients with internal rectal intussusception were analyzed. Among 38 patients with a second investigation after mean 5. 6 (range, 1. 1 - 19. 5) years one had developed a rectal prolapse. The remaining patients were further followed-up: one developed a rectal prolapse, 7 underwent surgery for internal metal intussusception, 29 did not develop a rectal prolapse during a mean follow-up of 5. 8 (range, LO- 14. 6) years. Anorectal manometry was carried out preoperatively and 7 days and 6 months postoperatively in 42 patients. Patients operated on for rectal prolapse had increased anal maximum resting pressure 6 months postoperatively but not after 7 days. Anal maximum squeeze pressure did not change significantly. No significant changes in anal maximum resting or squeeze pressures were seen in the patients with internal rectal intussusception. Anal continence improved. Preoperative electrophysiological assessment (conventional needle EMG, FD-assessment and pudendal nerve latency) was compared with pre- and postoperative functional evaluation regarding anal continence in 43 patients. Electrophysiological examination could not predict the outcome of Ripstein rectopexy with respect to anal continence. Whole gut transit studies were undertaken pre- and postoperatively in 30 patients. Retention of markers increased after the Ripstein rectopexy. The number of bowel movements per week decreased but constipation was mainly experienced as emptying difficulties. There was a correlation between preoperative retention of markers and postoperative emptying difficulties. Conclusion: Rectal <b>prolapse</b> and <b>internal</b> rectal intussusception can be treated by the Ripstein rectopexy with low mortality and low frequency of serious complication.

In this study, Kshar Sutra Ligation (KSL), a modality of treatment described in Ayurveda, was compared with Barron's Rubber Band Ligation (RBL) for grade II and grade III hemorrhoids. This study was conducted in 20 adult patients of either sex with grade II and grade III hemorrhoids at two different hospitals. Patients were randomly allotted to two groups of 10 patients each. Group I patients underwent RBL, whereas patients of group II underwent KSL. Guggul-based Apamarga Kshar Sutra was prepared according to the principles laid down in ancient Ayurvedic texts and methodology standardized by IIIM, Jammu and CDRI, Lucknow. Comparative assessment of RBL and KSL was done according to 16 criteria. Although the two procedures were compared on 15 criteria, treatment outcome of grade II and grade III hemorrhoids was decided chiefly on the basis of patient satisfaction index (subjective criterion) and ability of each procedure to deal with <b>prolapse</b> of <b>internal</b> hemorrhoidal masses (objective criterion) : Findings in each case were recorded over a follow-up of four weeks (postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 15 and 30).

40|$|Background and aims: We report our {{experience}} of concomitant laparoscopic treatment for enterocele and stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) for rectocele and/or rectal prolapse in patients with complex obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS). Patients and methods: From June 2005 to June 2007, we submitted 20 patients with ODS due to rectal prolapse and/or rectocele, combined with stable enterocele, to STARR and laparoscopic correction of the enterocele. Preoperative assessment included symptom evaluation with standardized questionnaires, clinical examination, colonoscopy, proctoscopy, anal sphincter ultrasonography, video-defecography with synchronous opacification of the ileal loops in all patients and colpography in female patients, and anorectal manometry. Follow-up was performed in the first, third, sixth, 12 th, and 24 th month after surgery. Results: Eighteen (90 %) patients were submitted to both procedures, simultaneously. One patient, previously submitted to STARR, underwent laparoscopic treatment of the enterocele. Postoperative complications occurred in two (10 %) patients: one case of postoperative rectal bleeding and one case of retropneumoperitoneum. Median (range) preoperative and postoperative Altomare's obstructed defecation score was ten (6 - 14) and two (0 - 14), respectively (p< 0. 001). Median (range) preoperative and postoperative quality of life score was 79 (39 - 109) and 109 (50 - 126), respectively (p< 0. 001). No symptom related to ODS was detected at 6 -month follow-up (19 patients) and at 24 -month follow-up (19 patients).

Materials and methods: 228 females aged from 60 to 70 with genital prolapse grade III–IV (according to classification by Baden-Walker) were divided into 3 groups depending on the leading anatomical structure in the prolapse. In all patients, extraperitoneal colpopexy with a prolene mesh was performed, with additional perineal plastics, in 165 patients from Group 1 (mean age, 63 years) being an anterior plastics, in 47 patients from Group 2 (mean age, 65 years) – posterior, in 12 patients from Group 3 (mean age, 68 years) – total. Efficacy of surgery was assessed at 2 to 4 months according to degree of genital prolapse, absence of erosions of vaginal walls and absence of the alloplast shrinkage and/or displacement. Results: Almost in 50 % patients, a latent form of urine incontinence was diagnosed that required an urethropexy by a free synthetic loop through a transobturator approach. Frequency of intraoperational complications was low (n = 1). Among post-operation complications, 60 % patients from Groups 1 and 3 had urination disorders that resolved by days 4 – 5 after surgery with anti-inflammatory treatment and with the use of agents increasing the detrusor tone. Frequency of vaginal wall erosions and of a partial prosthesis expulsion was 4. 2 % each in Groups 1 and 2. There were no vaginal wall erosions in Group 3. Clinically insignificant partial shrinkage of the prolene mesh was noted in 4. 5, 4. 2 and 5. 9 % of cases in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. After the surgical correction, in 100 % of patients from Groups 1 and 3 and in 70. 6 % of patients from Group 2 their genital prolapse was assessed as having grade I according to Baden-Walker, and in 29. 4 % of patients from Group 2, as grade II. However, there were many cases of prolapse progression of the contralateral vaginal wall: in 72 (44 %) of patients in Group 1 and in 4 (23, 5 %) in Group 2, that in some cases (18, 4 %) necessitated the surgery to be repeated. Conclusion: The use of prolene mesh for extraperitoneal strengthening of the pelvic fundus in the elderly is an effective way of treatment. With strict adherence to proper surgical technique it is associated with a minimal number of complications that are mainly easily eliminated. </p...|$|R
