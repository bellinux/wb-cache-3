5000|$|Cromwell {{arranged}} for leaflets with stamps featuring Momotombo {{to be sent}} to every Senator as [...] "proof" [...] of the volcanic activity in Nicaragua. An eruption in May 1902 on the island of Martinique resulted in 30,000 human fatalities. This catastrophe persuaded most of the United States Congress to vote in favor of constructing the canal in <b>Panama,</b> <b>leaving</b> only eight votes in favor of Nicaragua. The decision to build the Panama Canal passed by four votes. Cromwell was paid US$800,000 for his lobbying efforts.|$|R

50|$|After {{participating}} in Drake's successful voyage, Oxenham launched his own expedition to <b>Panama,</b> <b>leaving</b> Plymouth on 9 April 1576 with an 11-gun frigate (100-140 tons, name unknown) and 57 men, and after taking some prizes and prisoners, hid his ship and prizes and proceeded on the Panama mainland. The Cimarrones guided Oxenham {{and his men}} across the Cordillera de San Blas {{to the head of}} the Chucunaque River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean. During the winter, Oxenham's men and their Cimarron allies felled and milled cedar trees to build a shallow-draft 45 foot, oared boat, that they then floated down the river and into the ocean, making Oxenham the first Englishman to build a vessel in the New World, and the first to sail in the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Newcastle, Staffordshire, England, Abraham Griffith was born September 17, 1822. At {{the age of}} 22, Griffith came to America in 1844, {{arriving}} in New York, where he resided until 1849. News of the California Gold Rush excitement had spread and Mr. Griffith was introduced {{to one of the}} Aspinwall's, a founder of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and given a position as stoker on the steamship <b>Panama.</b> <b>Leaving</b> New York December 1, 1848, they were out only five days when the ship suffered mechanical difficulty and was forced to set sail back to New York. That winter, Mr. Griffith worked as a clerk in a store until July 15, 1849, when he again was given the opportunity to work for his passage to California, this time on the steamer Empire City to the Isthmus of Panama, then aboard the steamer Oregon, arriving in San Francisco September 16, 1849.|$|R

50|$|Netherton {{enlisted in}} the Army during the Vietnam War era, and was sent to Panama. By that time, he had also chosen {{to pursue a career}} in music, singing with the Army and Air Force bands. He became a born again Christian when he listened to a sermon at a Baptist church in <b>Panama.</b> Upon <b>leaving</b> the service, he spent a year at the Bethany Fellowship Missionary Training Center in Bloomington, where after being torn between missionary service and a career in entertainment, chose to follow the same path taken by his idol Pat Boone by being a Christian singer.|$|R
50|$|The town {{is about}} 25 km off the Interamerican Highway by a two-lane road. The road is {{generally}} in good condition, {{with a few}} potholes that are repaired regularly. Buses, usually mini-buses, to Panama City are frequent and take approximately 2.5 hours. As of 2014, the last direct bus to <b>Panama</b> City <b>leaves</b> El Valle at 3pm with a fare of $4.25. To reach other locations in Panama, it is generally necessary to take a bus to San Carlos and transfer there. As of 2014, the last bus from El Valle to San Carlos leaves at 6pm.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 July 2009, Aguirre was ejected in an {{incident}} during the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup match versus Panama. During a play along the sideline, Aguirre kicked Panamanian player Ricardo Phillips, triggering Phillips to push Aguirre, causing ejections for both Aguirre and Phillips and delaying the match for over 10 minutes due {{the refusal of}} the player from <b>Panama</b> to <b>leave</b> the field. [...] Aguirre apologized to the Mexican fans, media, football players and staff, but never extended such courtesy to Philips or the Panamanian team. He was suspended for three games and the Mexican Football Federation was fined USD $25,000 by CONCACAF.|$|R

5000|$|In January, 1851, Northerner {{arrived from}} San Francisco with $2,600,000 in gold dust and {{treasure}} on board, and carrying 500 passengers. In August, 1851 Northerner broke {{the shaft of}} her starboard wheel soon after <b>leaving</b> <b>Panama.</b> She completed the voyage to San Francisco using only one paddle wheel, in 22 days, arriving September 8, 1851, with 20 tons of freight and 350 passengers, including mutineers from the Commodore Stockton [...] {{who had to be}} clapped in irons for disorderly conduct by the captain.|$|R
30|$|Parmentiera cereifera (candle tree) {{belongs to}} the Bignoniaceae family and is a small tree native to <b>Panama.</b> The <b>leaves</b> are oblong and acuminate. The flowers are white, {{slightly}} fragrant, and emerges directly on the bark of the tree. The fruits are smooth, waxy skinned green-yellow, and resemble candles. The tree is grown as an ornamental for its flowers and unusual appearance (van Steenis 1977; Madulid 2000). Previous studies have highlighted the anticancer properties, {{in addition to its}} anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and antimicrobial properties by flavonoids, saponins, tannins, triterpenoids, terpenoids, and steroids in the leaves, barks, and fruits (Reyad-ul-Ferdous et al. 2012; Reyad-ul-ferdous et al. 2014 a; Reyad-ul-ferdous et al. 2014 b and Reyad-ul-ferdous et al. 2015). In Egypt, propagation of this tree is very challenging, and only two Parmentiera cereifera trees remain throughout the country (Theresa 2010). Plant tissue culture technology may have the potential to solve such problems.|$|R
40|$|A {{glance at}} <b>Panama’s</b> {{development}} indicators <b>leaves</b> the researcher with an optimistic forecast for Panama’s future. However, a more studied examination of Panama at current reveals that tides of growth may soon recede if Panama cannot diversify its economy under strong institutional direction. Due to a less-than-coherent governing body, Panama struggles to efficiently utilize a fundamental national asset (the Panama Canal). This paper examines {{the implication of}} Panama’s inefficient handling of its main national asset. Essentially, Panama may be sacrificing economic growth that benefits {{a large proportion of}} its population for soaring, yet dubious economic growth that benefits few...|$|R
50|$|Iglesia de San Felipe {{is located}} in Portobelo, a block {{to the east of}} Real Aduana. It is {{situated}} near the ruined 17th-century Iglesia de San Juan de Dios, which was built in 1589. The Iglesia de San Felipe, a large white-painted building, was the last structure built by Spain before <b>leaving</b> <b>Panama.</b> After the Cristo Negro statue was constructed in 1814, it was installed in the church. The statue is adorned in various gowns; these are preserved at the Museo del Cristo Negro (Black Christ Museum), which is situated at the Iglesia de San Juan de Dios.|$|R
50|$|When Arias left Panama, the First Vice-President, Jose Pezet, {{could not}} be found; the Third Vice-President, Anibal Rios D., was in Lima where he was serving as Panamanian Minister to Peru; but the Second Vice-President, Ernesto Jaén Guardia, Panamanian Minister to Mexico, {{happened}} to be in <b>Panama</b> City on <b>leave,</b> and on the morning of 9 October 1941, he officially assumed control of the Government of Panama and appointed a new Cabinet. Three hours later he resigned, and the Cabinet elected its ranking member, Ricardo Adolfo de la Guardia Arango, Minister of Government and Justice, to head the government.|$|R
50|$|Flying from Langley, the XB-15 {{arrived at}} Albrook Field in Panama on 10 April 1940 and {{immediately}} began classified bombing tests of canal lock protections, commanded by Haynes and including Captain Curtis LeMay as navigator and Lieutenant John B. Montgomery as bombardier. Of 150 bombs dropped, only three hit the target: a specially made bunker simulating a reinforced machine room. The few hits nevertheless led to improvements in bunker design. In early May, Haynes and LeMay made a survey flight from Panama over the Galapagos islands, the inspection including Baltra Island. Haynes piloted the XB-15 {{back to the}} US, <b>leaving</b> <b>Panama</b> on 11 May 1940.|$|R
50|$|Group A (Colombia, Honduras, Panama, and Trinidad & Tobago) {{started with}} an upset 1-0 win for Panama over Colombia and a 1-1 draw between Honduras and Trinidad. The second matchday saw Honduras defeat Colombia 2-1 and Panama and Trinidad draw with two goals apiece. This left guest nation Colombia {{at the bottom}} of the table heading into the final matchday, but with the format of the tournament all the teams were still alive. Colombia beat Trinidad in the first half of a doubleheader, meaning that Panama and Honduras would be {{guaranteed}} qualification. Honduras won to finish on top of the group, <b>leaving</b> <b>Panama</b> second; Colombia finished with three points and a goal differential of 0; they would have to wait for other games to determine whether they would advance.|$|R
5000|$|The first dual paddle steamer plus three masts powered {{steamship}} {{used on the}} Pacific run was the $200,000 [...] It was 203 ft in length, 33.5 ft in beam, and 20 ft deep, with a {{draft of}} 14 ft, and grossed 1,057 tons; when it sailed around the Cape Horn of South America, {{it was the first}} steamship on the west coast of South and North America. When it stopped at Panama City on , it was besieged by about 700 desperate gold seekers. Eventually, it managed to <b>leave</b> <b>Panama</b> City for California on , with almost 400 passengers, and entered San Francisco Bay, a distance of about 3500 mi, on February 28, 1849 — 145 days after leaving New York. There, nearly all its crew except the captain deserted and were stranded for about four months until a new supply of coal and a new (much more expensive) crew could be hired.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his last}} fight in Panama City in June 1917, Hollandersky lost to Pat Kiley in an {{unsuccessful}} 15 round attempt at the Panamanian Welterweight Title. It {{would be his}} last recognized championship bout. <b>Leaving</b> <b>Panama</b> in July, he would stop in New York to help accompany his father Charles, who was ill, to New London. [...] Perhaps {{as a result of this}} loss and his previous brutal loss to Dave Palitz in September 1915, Abe prematurely announced his retirement from boxing to his local paper on Christmas Eve 1917. [...] He continued with exhibition matches, including those on ship and on bases to assist with the training of sailors, but subsequently faced very few opponents in actual prize fights. Returning to New London in August 1917 from Panama City after his loss to Kiley, Abe was not permitted to join the Navy for WWI due to his eyesight, but was fortunate enough to find a position as a Naval boxing instructor at a base near the New London Pier. Fighting training matches for the instruction of naval troops often daily, his personal tally of fights continued to climb rapidly.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, {{after visiting}} Panama, Gauguin spent several months near Saint Pierre in Martinique, {{accompanied}} by his friend the artist Charles Laval. Paul Gauguin spent approximately 6 months {{on the island of}} Martinique in June to November 1887. His thoughts and experiences during this time are recorded in his letters to his wife Mette and his artist friend Emile Schuffenecker. He arrived in Martinique by way of Panama where he had found himself broke and without a job. At the time France had a policy of repatriation where if a citizen became broke or stranded on a French colony, the state would pay for the boat ride back. Upon <b>leaving</b> <b>Panama</b> protected by the repatriation policy, Gauguin and Laval decided to get off the boat at the Martinique port of St. Pierre. Scholars are in disagreement if Gauguin intentionally or spontaneously decided to stay on the island. At first, the 'negro hut' in which they lived suited him, and he enjoyed watching people in their daily activities. However, the weather in the summer was hot and the hut leaked in the rain. Gauguin also suffered dysentery and marsh fever. While in Martinique, he produced between 10 and 20 works (12 being the most common estimate), traveled widely and apparently came into contact with a small community of Indian immigrants; a contact that would later influence his art through the incorporation of Indian symbols. During his stay, the writer Lafcadio Hearn was also on the island. His account provides an historical comparison to accompany Gauguin's images.|$|R
2500|$|The fifth {{voyage of}} Suomen Joutsen {{was the longest}} the ship had ever done under the Finnish flag. After leaving Helsinki on 9 October 1935, the ship stopped briefly at Lisbon, Portugal, and then {{continued}} across the Atlantic, eventually arriving in the Panama canal on 26 December. It took eleven {{and a half hours}} to transit the [...] canal. After <b>leaving</b> <b>Panama</b> behind, Suomen Joutsen headed south and crossed the Equator on 4 January 1936 with appropriate ceremonies. Later the ship stopped at Callao in Peru and Valparaiso in Chile, where five men escaped after a local barkeeper had offered them full upkeep for playing at his bar. The men were later caught by local officials and returned to Finland, where they were sentenced for six months in prison. After leaving Chile, Suomen Joutsen sailed around the Cape Horn without major difficulties and arrived in Buenos Aires on 21 March. From Argentine, the ship continued to Rio de Janeiro, where she encountered the Brazilian school ship Almirante Saldanha, whose purchase had been inspired by the previous visit of the white swan of Finland. Suomen Joutsen sailed out on 14 April and due to heavy weather and headwinds, it took seven weeks to reach the Azores. On 9 May, Captain Konkola turned 50 and after the crew had sung [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] at 6:30 in the morning, he stuck his head out from the cabin door and yelled [...] "Steward, give them booze!" [...] Suomen Joutsen arrived in Helsinki on 4 July 1936. After a number of disagreements regarding the use of tugboats in the foreign ports, Captain Konkola decided to sail the full rigged ship {{all the way to the}} harbour, crossing the narrow Kustaanmiekka strait at full sail. Finally, when the bow had already been moored at Katajanokka, he allowed the tugboat to push the stern against the pier and the fifth voyage was over.|$|R
