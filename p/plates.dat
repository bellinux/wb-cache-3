5|$|Although Smith had {{previously}} refused {{to show the}} <b>plates</b> to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer {{that they would be}} allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden <b>plates</b> by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden <b>plates</b> by Smith.

5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} <b>plates</b> on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of <b>plates</b> as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the <b>plates</b> in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus <b>plates</b> have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like <b>plates</b> from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the <b>plates</b> are manifestly chiral and no two <b>plates</b> of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however <b>plates</b> have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the <b>plates</b> of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the <b>plates</b> were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the <b>plates</b> may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the <b>plates</b> were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered <b>plates</b> that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The <b>plates</b> would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the <b>plates</b> reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these <b>plates</b> to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized <b>plates</b> have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the <b>plates</b> to be defensive in nature is that the <b>plates</b> had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped <b>plates</b> on its hips.|$|E

5|$|Bathymetry is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic <b>plates.</b> In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining <b>plates</b> to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two <b>plates</b> apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the <b>plates</b> grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic <b>plates</b> slide beneath the continental <b>plates</b> and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental <b>plates</b> are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E

40|$|A gold <b>plating</b> {{process in}} the {{electronics}} industry can be classified as (i) all surface <b>plating</b> or (ii) selective <b>plating.</b> Selective <b>plating</b> is more widely used than all surface <b>plating</b> because it can save more gold used in the <b>plating</b> process and takes less <b>plating</b> time. In this research, the selective <b>plating</b> process called jet <b>plating</b> was studied.

These factors included (a) <b>plating</b> temperature, (b) crystal (inhibitor) amount, (c) distance between workpiece and anode, (d) <b>plating</b> current and (e) <b>plating</b> speed. A two-level Full Factorial design with center points was first performed to screen the factors.

According to the analysis, the optimal settings should be as follows: the <b>plating</b> temperature at 55. 5 deg C, the crystal amount at 90 %, the distance at 0. 5 mm, the <b>plating</b> current at 2. 8 A, and the <b>plating</b> speed at 4. 5 m/min.
