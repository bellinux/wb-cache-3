40|$|The {{literature}} regarding breaking {{bad news}} distinguishes three disclosure models: non-disclosure, full-disclosure and individualized disclosure. In this study, we investigated {{the relations between}} attitudes regarding disclosure of bad news and global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> regarding medical care {{in a sample of}} medical students (n= 88). The Attitudes towards Breaking Bad News Questionnaire was developed and factor analysed to provide a valid and reliable instrument to measure attitudes regarding disclosure of bad news. The results indicate a preference for an individualized, patient-centred disclosure model in male and female students. Regarding the global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes,</b> female students appear more humane-oriented than male students. Second, the relationship between global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and attitudes regarding breaking bad news was examined by means of correlational and cluster analysis. The inter-relationship between global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and attitudes regarding bad news is poor. Results of the cluster analysis, however, suggest that the sample can be divided into subsamples representing different disclosure clusters on the basis of specific combinations of global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> regarding medical care and attitudes regarding breaking bad news. The results are discussed in view of the theoretical framework proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in their training module on communication of bad news. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the process of socialisation of teachers in the teaching profession. Drawing on socialisation theory the study sees the process of secondary socialisation in teacher preparation as building skills and enabling personal development. It was predicted that in the transition from the training institution to the first years of teaching, the degree of job satisfaction and commitment to teaching would be related to the degree of conflict experienced and that job satisfaction and commitment would be less for beginning teachers compared with that anticipated by trainees. Conflict was seen as appropriately measured by the difference between personal <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and occupational values one {{the one hand and the}} <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and occupational values perceived to be held by senior teachers on the other. Seventy-three final year trainee teachers at the Canberra College of Advanced Education and 47 beginning teachers in their first two years of teaching in Canberra primary and secondary schools, were selected as the sample. Previously validated instruments were used in a questionnaire. The findings clearly showed the existence of conflict between personal <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and occupational values and the perceived <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and occupational values of senior teachers. The difference in conflict between trainees and beginning teachers was small and tended to decrease. However, there was a marked increase in variance of conflict scores for women conpared to men. For women also, conflict was highly related to job satisfaction. Thc findings suggested that men tend to be more homogeneous in their adaptation to teaching and are more inclined to be satisfied and committed despite holding <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and occupational values which conflict with those of senior teachers. The study discusses some of the imlications of the findings for the training institution and the importance, particularly for women teachers, of coping with conflict in the teaching situation...|$|E
40|$|The “hidden curriculum” {{has long}} been {{supposed}} {{to have an effect}} on students' learning during their clinical education, and in particular in shaping their ideas {{of what it means to}} be a professional. Despite this, there has been little evidence linking specific changes in <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> to the individual components of the hidden curriculum. This study aimed to recognize those components that led to a change in students' <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> at a UK veterinary school, as well as to identify the attitudes most affected. Observations were made of 11 student groups across five clinical rotations, followed by semi-structured interviews with 23 students at the end of their rotation experience. Data were combined and analyzed thematically, taking both an inductive and deductive approach. Views about the importance of technical competence and communication skills were promoted as a result of students' interaction with the hidden curriculum, and tensions were revealed in relation to their attitudes toward compassion and empathy, autonomy and responsibility, and lifestyle ethic. The assessment processes of rotations and the clinical service organization served to communicate the messages of the hidden curriculum, bringing about changes in student <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes,</b> while student-selected role models and t...|$|E

40|$|Research {{has been}} done for the past 4 years with 75 Physical Science {{teachers}} to construct and test a holistic model for professional development via Distance Education. Three dimensions were targeted that need development, namely, the teachers’ physics content knowledge, their teaching approaches and <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes.</b> In {{the first phase of}} the research, baseline data were obtained to see if there is a problem in these dimensions. In the second and third phase a model was developed and trialled each time with a new set of teachers in the urban and rural parts of South Africa.

Evidence shows that the teachers changed from being caught in a vicious circle of poor content knowledge, lack of confidence and enjoyment and unwillingness to spend time on task (poor <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes,</b> ineffective teaching approaches) to being part of a virtuous circle of improved content knowledge, more confidence and enjoyment and willingness to spend more time on task (better <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> and effective teaching approaches). One of the elements of the model that was found to be the key to success was the study material. An integrated approach of developing content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge simultaneously was followed.
