5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was formed}} by {{the construction of a}} dam and provided water to the <b>pumping</b> station which originally contained four Woolf compound rotative beam <b>pumping</b> engines, built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock, which have now been replaced by electric pumps. Two of the steam engines have been preserved, with one in working order as part of the visitor centre which also includes educational facilities for children. The <b>pumping</b> station is now a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} a {{highland}} carrier, {{as it is}} embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and drainage schemes have relied on <b>pumping</b> to remove the water. The <b>pumping</b> station at Westonzoyland was built in 1830, the first mechanical <b>pumping</b> station on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery, {{and the success of}} the drainage system {{led to the formation of}} Internal drainage boards and the construction of other <b>pumping</b> stations.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A <b>pumping</b> station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the <b>pumping</b> station or blown away from it. The <b>pumping</b> station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E

5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of <b>pumping</b> cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled. Depending on local regulations, the vapors can be expelled {{into the atmosphere}} or discharged back to the <b>pumping</b> station {{by way of a}} vapor recovery line. It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|E
5|$|The Langport & River Parrett Visitor Centre at Langport details local life, history, and wildlife. The Westonzoyland <b>Pumping</b> Station Museum, {{near the}} town on the River Parrett, is housed {{in one of the}} {{earliest}} steam-powered <b>pumping</b> stations on the Levels, dating from the 1830s; it was closed in the 1950s. Featuring several steam engines, some built locally, the museum holds a number of live steam days each year. The pump house has been Grade II* listed, and is on English Heritage's Heritage at Risk Register.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{on how the}} {{displacement}} principle is implemented, a distinction can be drawn between rotary and reciprocating <b>pumps.</b> The rotary circulation <b>pumps</b> includes eccentric screw <b>pumps,</b> centrifugal <b>pumps,</b> and squeezed tube (peristaltic) <b>pumps.</b> Reciprocating <b>pumps</b> include plunger, diaphragm, and piston <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{submersible}} <b>pump</b> (or sub <b>pump,</b> electric submersible <b>pump</b> (ESP)) is {{a device}} {{which has a}} hermetically sealed motor close-coupled to the <b>pump</b> body. The whole assembly is submerged in the fluid to be <b>pumped.</b> The main advantage {{of this type of}} <b>pump</b> is that it prevents <b>pump</b> cavitation, a problem associated with a high elevation difference between <b>pump</b> and the fluid surface. Submersible <b>pumps</b> push fluid to the surface as opposed to jet <b>pumps</b> having to pull fluids. Submersibles are more efficient than jet <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one <b>pump</b> can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own <b>pump.</b> In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. Gear <b>pumps</b> are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. Vane <b>pumps</b> and gerotor <b>pumps</b> too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw <b>pumps</b> can be combined with gear or vane <b>pumps.</b> Axial piston swashplate <b>pumps</b> can be combined with a second <b>pump,</b> or {{with one or more}} gear <b>pumps</b> or vane <b>pumps</b> (the gear or vane <b>pumps</b> often serving as flush <b>pumps</b> for cooling larger units). Axial plunger <b>pumps</b> of the bent-axis design cannot be combined with other <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
5|$|The South Forty-Foot Drain and the Black Sluice <b>pumping</b> station, {{together}} {{with most of}} the side channels which run into the drain are the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Management of the drainage ditches which drain the Fens are the responsibility of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board, who maintain 34 <b>pumping</b> stations and three gravity stations in the region. Of these, 21 are situated {{on the banks of the}} Drain, and pump directly into it, while one, the Black Hole Drove <b>pumping</b> station, is constructed over the channel, and acts as a boundary between the part of the Drain managed by the Environment Agency, and that managed by the Drainage Board.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pumping</b> {{station is}} {{maintained}} by {{volunteers from the}} Trust and {{is open to the}} public every Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holiday except during the winter maintenance period, when opening is only on Saturdays. There is a working model of the <b>pumping</b> station at the Kennet & Avon Canal Museum at Devizes. The restoration work received an Engineering Heritage Award from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is pumped}} {{to the summit}} at {{the western end of}} the locks, from Wilton Water, by the {{restored}} Crofton <b>Pumping</b> Station. The original steam-powered <b>pumping</b> station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.|$|E
30|$|There {{were about}} 150 solar <b>pumps</b> in Bangladesh among them 65  % solar <b>pumps</b> {{were used for}} {{supplying}} drinking water to the poor people of the locality and about 35  % solar <b>pumps</b> were used for irrigation purposes. Panel cost was the major cost (45  %) in solar <b>pump</b> followed by installation cost (18  %), motor cost (16  %), <b>pump</b> cost (10  %), and pipes and fitting cost (4  %). Considering the operating cost, diesel engine-operated <b>pump</b> is profitable {{for the period of}} less than 5 years. For the period of 5 years or more, solar <b>pump</b> becomes more profitable than diesel engine-operated <b>pump</b> of same capacity. The benefit cost ratio of solar <b>pump</b> (1.91) was found higher than diesel-operated <b>pump</b> (1.31). Net present value of solar <b>pump</b> was higher than diesel engine-operated <b>pump</b> which indicates that investing on solar <b>pump</b> is more profitable than diesel <b>pump.</b> Internal rate of return of solar <b>pump</b> (80  %) was found higher than diesel engine-operated irrigation <b>pump</b> (71  %). Numbers of irrigation <b>pumps</b> and carbon dioxide emissions from irrigation <b>pumps</b> over the years are increasing. Diesel engine-operated irrigation <b>pump</b> emits carbon dioxide and pollutes environment, but solar <b>pump</b> is an environment-friendly irrigation technology.|$|R
50|$|A bilge <b>pump</b> is a water <b>pump</b> used {{to remove}} bilge water. Since fuel can {{be present in}} the bilge, {{electric}} bilge <b>pumps</b> are designed to not cause sparks. Electric bilge <b>pumps</b> are often fitted with float switches which turn on the <b>pump</b> when the bilge fills to a set level. Since bilge <b>pumps</b> can fail, use of a backup <b>pump</b> is often advised. The primary <b>pump</b> is normally located at the lowest point of the bilge, while the secondary <b>pump</b> would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary <b>pump</b> activates only when the primary <b>pump</b> is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary <b>pump</b> free of the debris in the bilge that tends to clog the primary <b>pump.</b>|$|R

5|$|After its closure the <b>pumping</b> station lay {{derelict}} {{until the}} late 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of returning the <b>pumping</b> station to working order. Work started in 1969 with engineering students from Bath providing the labour {{under the supervision of}} John Butt, and the Trust providing the funding. Within the building rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To work on the sluices and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation in Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John Butt retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak teeth on the pitwheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The <b>pumping</b> station was formally re-opened in 1978.|$|E

50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{molecular}} <b>pumps</b> are the diffusion <b>pump</b> and the turbomolecular <b>pump.</b> Both types of <b>pumps</b> blow out gas molecules that diffuse into the <b>pump</b> by imparting momentum {{to the gas}} molecules. Diffusion <b>pumps</b> blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular <b>pumps</b> use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these <b>pumps</b> will stall and fail to <b>pump</b> if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical <b>pump.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1800 {{the civil}} {{engineers}} William Jessop and John Rennie assisted local engineers {{with plans for}} improvements, the chief of which was for a steam <b>pumping</b> station. This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The <b>pumping</b> station was {{the largest in the}} Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, the St Germans <b>pumping</b> station ran {{at maximum}} capacity, which was 6134 Ml/d (or 71 tonnes per second), for over 50 hours, and {{this led to}} the {{decision}} to replace it with a brand new installation, with 40% extra capacity. Work started in December 2006, and the <b>pumping</b> station, which is the second largest in Europe, includes a glass wall to enable visitors to see the pumps. The new station was commissioned on 22 April 2010, after which the old station was demolished. A formal opening ceremony was held on 20 April 2011, when the station was opened by Lord James Russell, brother of the Duke of Bedford, and a descendent of the Earl of Bedford who started the process of draining the Fens in the seventeenth century. There are more than one hundred smaller <b>pumping</b> stations scattered throughout the system to maintain the water levels and prevent flooding.|$|E
