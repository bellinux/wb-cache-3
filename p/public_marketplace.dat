2500|$|Laclède himself {{arrived in}} April 1763 {{to inspect the}} site, at which point he named the village St. Louis and {{provided}} detailed plans for laying out streets and for construction of his headquarters. The plan of the village {{was similar to that}} of New Orleans, including a <b>public</b> <b>marketplace</b> centered on the riverfront and a grid street pattern. The market, Laclède's headquarters, and a church stood in a line of blocks west from the bank of the river, and the market block was separated from the river by a limestone block ledge. Three streets ran parallel to the river: First Street (also known as La Rue Royale, La Grande Rue, and Main Street), Second Street (also known as La Rue d'Eglise or Church Street), and Third Street (also known as La Rue des Granges or Barn Street). North of the market block and perpendicular to the river was Market Street (also known as La Rue de la Place or La Rue Bonhomme); south of the market block were Walnut Street (also known as La Rue de la Tour) and Chestnut Street (also known as La Rue Missouri). [...] In addition, many prominent, intelligent figures, such as Madame Marie-Therese Chouteau, had moved to St. Louis, and with their keen eye and intelligence, was able to advise the new residents on how to best prosper in the local government and home.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{the water}} rights {{situation}} in Texas {{is similar to}} that of the states where water rights have been clearly defined. Texas Supreme Court's decision in Day McDaniels vs. Edwards Aquifer Authority in support of the right of capture in 2012, set the foundation for the trading of the ground water rights (surface water is regulated through a separate mechanism). Texas Water Exchange, founded in 2013, is the only <b>public</b> <b>marketplace</b> for trading ground water rights in the state, and, currently, in the US. Traditional methods of trading water rights through water attorneys also still exist.|$|E
50|$|The Quem quaeritis? is {{the best}} known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical {{dialogue}} between the angel at the tomb of Christ {{and the women who}} are seeking his body.

The writers and directors of the earliest plays, were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.|$|E

Christians later used these same to pave the <b>public</b> <b>marketplace.</b>|$|E
