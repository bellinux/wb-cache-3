50|$|The model {{starts with}} the {{observation}} that cell membranes always have a freezing point (the temperature below which the consistency changes from fluid to gel-like) only slightly below the organism's body temperature, and this allows for the <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> <b>solitons.</b> An action potential traveling along a mixed nerve results in {{a slight increase in}} temperature followed by a decrease in temperature. Soliton model proponents claim that no net heat is released during the overall pulse and that the observed temperature changes are inconsistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model. However, this is untrue: the Hodgkin Huxley model predicts a biphasic release and absorption of heat. In addition, the AP causes a slight local thickening of the membrane and a force acting outwards; this effect is not predicted by the Hodgkin-Huxley model but does not contradict it, either.|$|E
50|$|The authors {{claim that}} their model {{explains}} the previously obscure {{mode of action}} of numerous anesthetics. The Meyer-Overton observation holds that {{the strength of a}} wide variety of chemically diverse anesthetics is proportional to their lipid solubility, suggesting that they do not act by binding to specific proteins such as ion channels but instead by dissolving in and changing the properties of the lipid membrane. Dissolving substances in the membrane lowers the membrane's freezing point, and the resulting larger difference between body temperature and freezing point inhibits the <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> <b>solitons.</b> By increasing pressure, lowering pH or lowering temperature, this difference can be restored back to normal, which should cancel the action of anesthetics: this is indeed observed. The amount of pressure needed to cancel the action of an anesthetic of a given lipid solubility can be computed from the soliton model and agrees reasonably well with experimental observations.|$|E

The mathematical modeling of these local fluctuations of dielectric properties of fibers {{was performed by}} Gaussian functions. By simulating soliton wave propagation in optical fibers with Gaussian fluctuations in their dielectric properties, {{it was observed that}} the perturbed soliton numerical solution presented higher sensitivity to fluctuations in the dielectric parameter β, a measure of the intensity of nonlinearity in the fiber. In order to verify whether the fluctuations of β parameter in the splices of the optical fiber generate unstable <b>solitons,</b> the <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>soliton</b> wave, subject to this perturbation, was simulated for large time intervals.
