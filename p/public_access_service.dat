Local Economy, 31 (7), 757 - 777. DOI: 10. 1177 / 0269094216670938. Copyright © 2016 SAGE. Reprinted {{by permission of}} SAGE Publications. In the UK, the geography of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure required for Internet connectivity is such that high speed broadband and mobile phone networks are generally less available in rural areas compared with urban areas or, in other words, as remoteness and population sparsity increase so too does the likelihood of an area having no or very poor broadband connectivity. Against a policy backdrop of UK Government efforts to bring forward network infrastructure upgrades and to improve the accessibility of broadband services in locations {{where there is a}} weak commercial investment case, this paper considers the options for the ‘final few’ in the prevailing ‘Digital by Default’ public services context. The paper outlines the Rural <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> WiFi <b>Services</b> project, a study focused upon enabling Internet connectivity for commercially ‘hard to reach’ rural areas in the UK. The Rural <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> WiFi <b>Services</b> concept and the experiment are introduced before findings from a pilot deployment of a broadband service to households in a remote rural area, who may be classified as ‘digitally excluded’, are presented. The paper then reflects on our field experiment and the potential of the Rural <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> WiFi <b>Services</b> model as a solution to overcoming some of the digital participation barriers manifest in the urban–rural divide. Early indications show that the Rural <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> WiFi <b>Services</b> model has the potential to encourage participation in the Digital Economy and could aid the UK Government’s Digital by Default agenda, although adoption of the model is not without its challenges...|$|R

40|$|One {{could make}} the case that recent changes in {{scholarly}} communications (including publishing, sharing and peer review) have been driven in large part by the health and life sciences. For example, the adoption of the NIH <b>Public</b> <b>Access</b> Policy (2008) and the launch of Public Library of Science (2003) have done much to move the exchange of scholarship beyond the subscription-only model. One might assume that scholars publishing in the health sciences would be more familiar and more accepting of these relatively new approaches to dissemination. To test this assumption and to explore other attitudes and actions related to open access publishing, self-archiving and peer review, we conducted a faculty survey on the IUPUI campus (including the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Public Health). In this paper presentation we report on disciplinary differences in attitudes toward scholarly communications. In addition, our results are compared to similar surveys conducted at University of California (2006) and University of Toronto (2010). The results may be used in guiding education and outreach efforts at academic libraries with an interest in scholarly communication, open <b>access</b> and <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
