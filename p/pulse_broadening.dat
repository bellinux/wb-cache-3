40|$|Polarization mode {{dispersion}} is {{the effect}} of signal broadening in a fiber with birefringent disorder. The disorder, frozen into the fiber, is characterized by the so-called vector of birefringence (VB). In a linear medium a <b>pulse</b> <b>broadens</b> as the two principal states of polarization split. It is well-known that, under the action of short-correlated disorder, naturally present in fibers, the dispersion vector (DV), characterizing the split, performs a Brownian random walk. We discuss a strategy of passive (i. e., pulse-independent) control of the DV broadening. The suggestion is to pin (compensate) periodically or quasi-periodically the integral of VB to zero. As a result of the influence of pinning, the probability distribution function of the DV becomes statistically steady in the linear case. Moreover, pinning improves confinement of the pulse in the weakly nonlinear case. The theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical analysis. © 2004 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 060. 5530, 190. 0190, 000. 5490. 1...|$|R

In addition, a <b>pulse</b> <b>broadened</b> by the positive dispersion fiber can be equalized using self-phase-modulation (SPM) in the optical fiber. The majority of metro and access networks are made up of conventional single-mode fibers (SMF) which are positive dispersion fibers.

Furthermore, simulations suggest that this technique is able to enhance the performance of directly modulated wavelength division multiplexed systems if the power of each channel is chosen correctly.
