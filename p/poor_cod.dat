The first records for the Severn Estuary of two cold water species, northern rockling and Norway pout, which were present in appreciable numbers, {{may be related to}} the effects of the changes that commenced in south-western English waters during the 1960 s. Maximum numbers of the five most abundant gadoids were attained in different years, with the greatest catches being recorded for whiting and <b>poor</b> <b>cod</b> in 1975 / 6, bib and pollack in 1974 / 5 and northern rockling in 1976 / 7. Peak abundance in the middle estuary was reached by whiting, bib, <b>poor</b> <b>cod</b> and pollack in the autumn and by northern rockling in the winter or early spring. The 0 + age class of these species, which was always by far the most predominant category, showed increases in mean length during their relatively short stay in the estuary.

The values of parameter b (the exponent of the arithmetic form of length-weight relationships) of males (2. 97), females (3. 01) and total sample (2. 99) indicated isometric growth.

40|$|Advanced {{oxidation}} processes (AOPs) {{have been}} used to treat drinking water and wastewater but their application to greywater is limited to photocatalysis. Therefore, three homogeneous AOPs were investigated in this project: Fenton, photo-Fenton, and UVC/H 2 O 2 processes. Alum and ferrous sulphate coagulation were also compared and their supernatants were treated by UVC/H 2 O 2. The process comparisons were based on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), treatment type (physical separation versus chemical oxidation), sludge formation, complexity in operation, required pH, visual aesthetic of effluent and energy requirement. Treating greywaters collected from the researcher&# 039;s home or laboratory, alum coagulation achieved 73 % COD removal and was more effective than ferrous sulphate coagulation (49 %) and the Fenton process (45 %). The photo-Fenton process removed 83 % COD, compared with 87 % by overnight settlement and subsequent UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment. Using ferrous sulphate and alum, sequential coagulation and UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment removed 91 % and 98 % COD, respectively. Overnight settlement generated little sludge and the subsequent UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment removed most organic contaminants by oxidation. All other processes produced a large quantity of chemical sludge from coagulation which requires appropriate disposal. Also, the residual iron in some treated water was not aesthetically desirable. The Fenton and photo-Fenton processes were complex and involved the optimisation of multiple parameters. Their requirement for different procedures according to the greywater type presents a major challenge to process design and operation. Due to the non-selectivity of the hydroxyl radicals (●OH), the UVC/H 2 O 2 process was capable of treating all greywaters collected by the researcher, and its operation was moderate in complexity. The COD removal was modelled as a pseudo first-order reaction in terms of H 2 O 2 dosage: The rate constant (k´) increased linearly up to 10 mM H 2 O 2, above which the excess H 2 O 2 scavenged the ●OH and reduced the rate. The overall kinetics of COD removal followed a second-order equation of r = 0. 0637 [COD][H 2 O 2]. In contrast to the literature, operation of UVC/H 2 O 2 in acidic conditions was not required and the enhanced COD removal at the initial pH of 10 was attributed to the dissociation of H 2 O 2 to O 2 H-. Maintaining the pH at 10 or higher resulted in <b>poorer</b> <b>COD</b> removal due to the increased decomposition rate of H 2 O 2 to O 2 and H 2 O. The performance of the UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment was unaffected for initial pH 3 - 10 with the initial total carbonate concentration (cT) of 3 mM. For initial cT ≥ 10 mM, operating between pH 3 and 5 was essential. After 3 hours of the UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment, the effluent met the requirement of Class B reclaimed water specified by the Environment Protection Authority of Victoria, and less than 1 org/ 100 mL of Escherichia coli survived. A subsequent treatment such as filtration may be required to meet more requirements for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), turbidity and total suspended solids. Since the biodegradability (as BOD 5 :COD) of the greywater was increased from 0. 22 to 0. 41 with 2 hours of UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment, its integration with a subsequent biological treatment may be viable to reduce the costs and energy consumption associated with the UVC/H 2 O 2 process...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that changes in}} zooplankton community structure {{over the past four}} decades led to reduced growth and survival of prerecruit Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and that this was a key factor underlying poor year classes, contributing to stock collapse, and inhibiting the recovery of stocks around the UK. To evaluate whether observed changes in plankton abundance, species composition and temperature could have led to periods of <b>poorer</b> growth of <b>cod</b> larvae, we explored the effect of prey availability and temperature on early larval growth using an empirical trophodynamic model. Prey availability was parameterized using species abundance data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Our model suggests that the observed changes in plankton community structure in the North Sea may have had less impact on cod larval growth, at least for the first 40 days following hatching, than previously suggested. At least in the short term, environmental and prey conditions should be able to sustain growth of cod larvae and environmental changes acting on this early life stage should not limit stock recovery.

In the Irish Sea, an increase in jellyfish abundance was evident (r 2 = 0. 29, P= 0. 03) in a 16 -year time-series (1994 – 2009) collected during juvenile fish surveys. Jellyfish abundance correlated positively with sea surface temperature (SST) over the preceding 18 months (r= 0. 65, pACF< 0. 001) and copepod biomass {{in the previous year}} (r= 0. 56, pACF= 0. 03) and negatively with spring (February–May) precipitation (r=− 0. 57, pACF= 0. 02). Principal components regression indicated that climatic indices explained 68 % of the interannual variability in jellyfish abundance (P= 0. 003), where the components were based on the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, SST and precipitation. The frequency of cnidarian material present in Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) samples has also increased since 1970, with a period of frequent outbreaks between 1982 and 1991. Before this period, the herring stock in the northern Irish Sea declined rapidly to a low level, potentially stimulating structural change in the ecosystem. In 1985, there was a step decrease in CPR copepod biomass and in 1989, a step increase in the phytoplankton colour index, suggesting a cascading regime shift during the 1980 s. Subsequent overexploitation of gadids, coupled with warm temperatures and the <b>poor</b> recruitment of <b>cod,</b> led to the rapid decline in cod biomass from 1990. While the biomass of sprat has decreased in the last decade, the herring stock has recovered partially. Reductions in demersal fishing pressure since 2000, intended to stimulate cod recovery, appear to have facilitated further rises in haddock biomass. Since the 1980 s regime shift, sea temperatures have increased, the fish community has altered and jellyfish abundance has risen such that jellyfish and haddock may now play an increasingly important role in the ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Post {{settlement}} cod (3 - 11 cm {{total body}} length) juvenile s diet, condition, body length and macro parasites were investigated in coastal Skagerrak, June 2005. They {{were collected by}} beach seining in eelgrass habitats. Three fjord systems were targeted in eastern Skagerrak and three in the west. Two major exposure regimes were chosen; inner enclosed areas, and outer locations close to the coastal current. The aims were to get baseline data on the early life history of Skagerrak cod, and to investigate possible factors contributing to the records of <b>poor</b> recruitment to <b>cod</b> stocks of the eastern Skagerrak, and of smaller body lengths of juveniles inside many of the fjords. A total of 997 0 -group cod were investigated in a balanced study design for length, and of these 796 for external parasites, 363 for condition, liver index and internal parasites, and 218 for stomach contents. Cladocerans were surprisingly the dominant prey item by volume across most sites. A range of other prey types were also common at some sites, among them polychaetes, small and large copepods, small benthic crustaceans, and chironomid larvae. All the post settlement cod juveniles had what is regarded as an acceptable liver index indicating decent nutrient surplus from last weeks feeding. There was a distinct difference in the parasite fauna of the cod juveniles at the inner versus the outer sites: lice (Caligus elongatus) dominating the inner fjord samples in prevalences up to 20 %, and nematodes and spiny-headed worm (Echinorhynchus gadi) dominating the outer fjord areas. The study shows that cod recruits settling in Skagerrak coastal habitats already soon after settlement, at 3 - 4 cm total body length, utilize {{a wide range of}} food sources largely decoupled from the North Sea oceanic system. We suggest that the known stable weather conditions and high local coastal production in the early post settlement period of June is a reliable and important food source for the recruits of coastal cod. Abundances were lowest in the east, and consistently lowest at inner sites across all fjords. Low abundances at these sites is suggested to reflect recruitment limitation as they were five times lower than in outer western sites where densities of 0. 2 individuals per square meter is close to the saturation point for eelgrass found in other studies. The low abundances can be driven by the known absence of local recruitment in some of the fjords, and is also evidence of restricted import of external recruits to these inner fjords. Identical liver index at inner and outer sites in every fjord indicated that inner fjords were not detrimental environments. Poor environmental profitability is hence an unlikely explanation of the observed trend of shorter and slimmer (lower Fulton K at length) cod juveniles inside the western fjords. A more parsimonious explanation, which also lends support from the pronounced dichotomy in the parasite fauna between inner and outer sites, is a separation in pools of settling larvae between these areas. The presence of transparent juveniles inside the fjords indicated recent pulses of settlement here around 1 st of June. Estimated settlement dates along the outer coast were at least three weeks before. This result is in accordance with cod post settlement juveniles inside the fjords being primarily of local origin, and a majority of the ones at the outer coast being recruited from upstream sources like the North Sea or offshore banks with earlier spawning, a picture also emerging from several other recent studies along this Skagerrak coast. Further analysis of the detailed dynamics in the recruitment and early life stages of coastal cod should be very aware of this potentially mixed origin, and also that knowledge from the wealth of studies on the early life history and feeding on large copepods in the oceanic cod stocks seems to have limited relevance for cod settling in coastal areas...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{anaerobic}} {{membrane bioreactor}} (AnMBR) {{technology has been}} increasingly researched for municipal wastewater treatment {{as a means to}} produce nutrient-rich, solids free effluents with low levels of pathogens, while occupying a small footprint. An AnMBR can be used not only for on-site wastewater treatment, but also for the generation of nutrient-rich irrigation water leading to reuse and recycling possibility for agricultural applications as well. Furthermore, biogas produced in the anaerobic process could potentially be used for minimising the energy requirements of AnMBR operation. Despite the mentioned advantages, the current state-of-the-art AnMBR technology for potential full-scale application raises some concerns related to energy requirements and investment costs for membrane fouling control, as well as the impact of high shear stress on biomass activity. Municipal wastewater in many countries can be characterised as low strength and is generated at high flows rates, related to the population served. However, ongoing efforts in water conservation and the implementation of source separated sewer systems may possibly change municipal wastewater characteristics in the near future. Several factors involved in design and operation of AnMBR systems may influence membrane fouling, such as treatment plant configuration and membrane characteristics, feeding and biomass properties and operational conditions. Among them, reactor design is proposed as an important factor that can change the AnMBR sludge fouling propensity. To date, especially in the last decade, many studies have been conducted in which various types of anaerobic reactors, including completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, expanded granular sludge bed reactor (EGSB), were used in combination with various types of membranes. Among them, a membrane coupled UASB reactor may be a promising approach to overcome problems related with fouling since the membrane is only subjected to supernatant filtration and not by bulk sludge. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the applicability of an innovative AnMBR configuration in order to produce a pathogen-free but nutrient-rich effluent for use in agricultural irrigation, concomitantly enabling energy recovery. With the realization of this study, flux enhancement by controlling the total solids (TS) load to the membrane was the major starting point, bringing AnMBR technology for full-scale sewage treatment one step closer to realisation. The AnMBR-Digester system as developed in this study may offer a solution for the mentioned challenges. The system consisted of a membrane integrated UASB reactor coupled to a parallel operating digester that can be operated at any required process temperature between 0 - 40 °C. The external cross-flow tubular membrane module contained 28 membrane fibers with a very small internal tube diameter of 1. 5 mm in order to increase the filtration area for accommodating large sewage flows. Blocking of the membrane module lumens is minimised by the preceding UASB reactor, which scavenges the large part of suspended solids (SS), having only the supernatant subjected to membrane filtration. Besides that, the combination of a UASB reactor and a sludge digester, the so-called UASB-Digester system, {{has been shown to be}} successful for mutual sewage treatment at low temperature and sludge stabilization. Therefore, membrane integration to the UASB-Digester system can be attractive for producing high quality and nutrient-rich effluents for reuse purposes under moderate climate conditions. Based on this general aim, the optimum upflow velocity that will result in an effluent with good filterability is determined in a laboratory-scale UASB reactor for the case of membrane coupled UASB reactor systems. Filterability tests were carried out in order to assess the effect of upflow velocity on subsequent membrane performance. Results indicated a significant impact of upflow velocity on both biological performance and physicochemical effluent characteristics. Operation at a higher upflow velocity caused the washout of colloidal particles. Effluent characterization results coincided with filterability tests. Results showed that filterability of the effluent during the operation at 0. 6 m/h was better than that during the operation at 1. 2 m/h. The observed differences in protein/carbohydrate ratio (P/C) and particle size distribution (PSD), which play important roles in membrane fouling, lead to the hypothesis that upflow velocity is a critical parameter for effluent filterability in membrane coupled UASB reactors. In subsequent experiments, the membrane was integrated into the UASB reactor and the system was operated as an AnMBR system with an upflow velocity of 0. 6 m/h in order to understand the impact of membrane addition on both the biological performance and sludge characteristics. Membrane incorporation induced an accumulation of fine particles and a decrease in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), resulting in a decrease in PSD and thus, a drop in sludge settleability. Deterioration of sludge settleability led to an increase in sludge washout, with a resultant increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in the UASB effluent. However, SS-free permeate with an average COD of 42 mg/L was obtained and despite the sludge bed deterioration, the average transmembrane pressure (TMP) value was 85 mbar during reactor operation, indicating that no severe membrane fouling occurred in the AnMBR. Following that investigation, the AnMBR was operated at 15 °C in order to investigate whether the membrane coupled UASB is a technically feasible alternative in the treatment of municipal wastewater at lower temperatures. The results showed that membrane fouling at 15 °C was more severe than at 25 °C. Increased COD and soluble microbial products (SMP) concentrations, reduced particle’s diameter, and higher turbidity in the UASB reactor effluent at lower temperature aggravated membrane fouling. However, treatment performance was not considerably affected by temperature possibly due to the retention capacity of membrane. Cake resistance was found responsible for over 40 % of the total fouling at both temperatures. However, an increase was observed in the contribution of irreversible fouling resistance to the total filtration resistance (RT) at lower temperature, related to the larger amount of fine particles in the UASB reactor effluent. During the operation at 15 °C, differences were observed in sludge characteristics at different heights along the UASB reactor. The best location in the sludge bed for conveying the sludge from the UASB reactor to the digester needed to be determined. Analysis over the height of the reactor with time showed that TS, volatile solids (VS), TSS and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentrations in the reactor decreased with height, and highest COD concentration of 46 g/L was observed at the bottom of the reactor. The active biomass remained near the inlet of the reactor; whereas, non-active biomass consisted of loose, suspended particles and flocculents moved towards the top. This was confirmed by the high specific COD consumption rate near the inlet and the <b>poor</b> specific <b>COD</b> biodegradation in the remaining portions of the bioreactor. Apparently, the assumption of a completely mixed sludge bed behavior for the UASB reactor, being part of an AnMBR system, does not hold for this type of reactor systems even at low temperatures, which makes the location in the sludge bed from where the sludge is to be conveyed to the digester of operational importance. Considering the observed sludge bed stratification with regard to sludge stability and solids concentration, the sludge to be recirculated from the UASB reactor to the digester is recommended to be extracted from the sampling point where the sludge has the lowest stability. A low value of stability coincides with a high amount of anaerobic biodegradable organic compounds present in the sludge. Finally, the impact of digester coupling on removal efficiency and filtration performance of the AnMBR was investigated. Digester incorporation remarkably influenced the characteristics of the UASB reactor effluent, resulting in a decrease in turbidity, soluble and total COD and an increase in median particle size (D 50), which led to a substantial decrease in the RT. Improved stability and specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the sludge were achieved in the UASB reactor with an increase in total biogas production of the AnMBR-Digester system. The sludge recirculation from the sampling point having the lowest stability in the AnMBR-Digester system improved both the solids physical removal and the conversion, which confirms the importance of sludge transfer point selection, especially for the filtration performance of AnMBR-Digester systems. Overall, it can be concluded that the UASB reactor is a suitable alternative for coupling membranes in AnMBR systems at 25 °C. Despite the sludge bed deterioration, SS-free permeate with an average COD of 42 mg/L was obtained and the average TMP of 85 mbar was maintained during the operation period, indicating no severe membrane fouling. However, this configuration is not found technically feasible at 15 °C, considering the deterioration of the filtration performance, which would be a bottleneck to the practical engineering application of AnMBRs. Thus, the filtration performance of the investigated single stage AnMBR was limited by the low temperature. In that situation, the results revealed the high potential of the new AnMBR-Digester configuration for treating municipal wastewater at 15 °C, as it couples wastewater treatment and sludge stabilization. Under optimized sludge recirculation conditions, the integrated AnMBR-Digester system represents an efficient technology to mitigate rapid membrane fouling for the low temperature applications of membrane coupled UASB reactors.

To this end, we conducted an extended set of interviews with experienced fishers that enabled us to classify species (or taxa) as ‘decreasing ’ or ‘increasing ’ {{both in terms of}} abundance, as well as average size in the catch. The aspect that most clearly emerged in all the investigated areas over time was the notable increase of fishing capacity indicators, such as engine power and fishing depth range. Atlantic mackerel, <b>poor</b> <b>cod,</b> scorpionfishes, striped seabream, and John Dory dem-onstrated a decreasing trend in the fishers ’ perceived abundance, while Mediterranean par-rotfish, common pandora, cuttlefish, blue and red shrimp, and mullets gave indications of an increasing temporal trend. Although, as a rule, trawler captains did not report any cataclys-mic changes (e. g. extinctions), when they were invited to estimate total catches, a clear de-creasing pattern emerged; this being a notable finding taking into account the steep escalation of fishing efficiency during the past century.

40|$|Research {{into the}} feeding habits of {{cetaceans}} has traditionally relied on examining samples taken From the digestive tracts of commercially caught or stranded and by-caught animals. This {{depends on the}} identification and measurement of hard parts such as fish otoliths. Otoliths are often partially digested in the stomach, making quantitative estimates of fish size from otolith size biased. As a preliminary attempt to quantify the size reduction of otoliths found in the stomachs of small cetaceans, an in vitro digestion experiment was carried out. Otoliths of herring, whiting, <b>poor</b> <b>cod</b> and haddock were digested at 37 degrees C, pH = 3. 6, and measured every 60 min. Linear regressions relating otolith size to digestion time and original size generally provided an adequate description of {{the time course of}} size reduction. The parameter that changed most rapidly due to digestion was otolith thickness. Differences in digestion rates between species reflect the general robustness and shape of the otoliths. A simulation using actual dietary data showed that the overall diet composition was not radically changed by accounting for otolith digestion, although the apparent contribution of herring increased as the assumed digestion time is increased, because herring otoliths were the most susceptible to digestion...|$|E
40|$|High {{stranding}} {{frequency of}} porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, along the Dutch coast since 2006 {{has led to}} increased interest in the ecology of porpoises in the North Sea. Stranded porpoises were collected along the Dutch coast (2006 – 2008) and their diet was assessed through stomach content and stable isotope analysis (d 13 C and d 15 N) of porpoise muscle and prey. Stable isotope analysis (SIAR) was used to estimate the con- tribution of prey species to the porpoises’ diet. This was compared to prey composi- tion from stomach contents, to analyze differences between long- and short-term diet. According to stomach contents, 90. 5 % of the diet consisted of gobies, whiting, lesser sandeel, herring, cod, and sprat. Stable isotope analysis revealed that 70 - 83 % of the diet consisted of <b>poor</b> <b>cod,</b> mackerel, greater sandeel, lesser sandeel, sprat, and gobies, highlighting a higher importance of pelagic, schooling species in the porpoises’ diet compared to stomach contents. This {{could be due to}} prey distribution as well as differ- ences in behavior of porpoises and prey between the coastal zone and offshore waters. This study supports the need for multi-method approaches. Future ecological and fishery impact assessment studies and management decisions for porpoise conservation should acknowledge this difference between the long- and short-term diet.

40|$|Mortality {{during the}} egg and larval stages is thought {{to play a major}} role in {{determining}} year-class strength of many marine fish. Predation of eggs and larvae is normally considered to be a major factor but the full suite of predators responsible has rarely been identified. Potential predators on a patch of plaice Pleuronectes platessa eggs located in the eastern Irish Sea were mapped using acoustics and sampled by trawl and a plankton multi-net. Gut contents of 3373 fish, crustacea and cephalopods sampled in the area were screened using a plaice-specific TaqMan DNA probe. Herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus dominated trawl catches and showed high positive TaqMan responses (77 and 75 % of individuals tested respectively). Locations of clupeid schools also broadly corresponded with the distribution of fish eggs in the plankton. Whiting Merlangius merlangus were also reasonably abundant in trawl hauls and 86 % of their stomachs tested positive for plaice DNA. Species showing lower levels of positive TaqMan response included mackerel Scomber scombrus, <b>poor</b> <b>cod</b> Trisopterus minutus, squid Loligo spp., dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and weever Trachinus vipera. Non-reactivity of all negative controls precluded the occurrence of cross-contamination, and positive reactions from demersal species, such as dogfish and weever, may have resulted from secondary predation. No benthic macro-crustaceans tested positive. Samples of planktonic organisms yielded 13 % positive TaqMan reactions, mainly from clupeoid or sandeel (Ammodytidae) larvae, but also included some Malacostraca and Amphipoda. Use of the molecular approach allowed rapid screening of a large number of potential predators of plaice eggs, and the results provide a more holistic description of the predator community than has previously been achieved...|$|E
40|$|Length-based methods (LBMs) {{were used}} to study the growth of Trisopterus minutus capelanus in the Strait of Sicily (Messina Strait). A total of 16, 304 'merluzzetto' or <b>poor</b> <b>cod</b> {{collected}} by experimental trawling off the southern coast of Sicily during spring, summer, autumn 1986 and winter 1987 were measured in order to estimate the length structure of the population. Length-frequency distribution were analyzed and normal components were discriminated. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were derived from the mean length of the normal components. The growth parameters obtained by weighted non-linear regression were: K= 0. 462 (yr super(1)), L sub(infinity) = 222. 3 (TL,mm) and t sub(o) =- 0. 679 yr. The resulting growth performance index (Phi ') was 4. 36, a value slightly lower than those derived for Western Mediterranean (mean Phi '= 4. 45) and Adriatic (Phi '= 4. 58) populations and slightly higher than that derived for Hellenic waters (Phi '= 4. 27). On {{the basis of the}} von Bertalanffy parameters estimated, an array of age-specific instantaneous natural mortality rate (M sub(t) = 0. 5 - 1. 1) and an average value of total natural mortality rate (Z= 2. 1 yr super(1)) were estimated and used in the Thompson and Bell yield per recruit (Y/R) analysis in order to evaluate the status of the fishery and forecast the effects of changes in the fishing pattern. Results indicate that this resource is overexploited and that Y/R could be increased by postponing the age at first capture from 0. 5 to 1. 0 yr. Even a slight reduction in fishing mortality could improve the performance of the fishery. At the present level of exploitation, and assuming a constant recruitment, the spawning stock biomass per recruit (SPR) is well below the conservative threshold of 30 % of the pristine or unexploited SPR...|$|E
40|$|Samples of the {{demersal}} fish fauna {{have been collected}} by beam trawl from the coastal waters of northwest Europe (49 – 57 °N, 8 °W 9 °E) by the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, since 1990, during {{the third quarter of}} the year. Changes in community structure within small spatial scales were subtle as species compositions formed part of a continuum over the entire continental shelf. Populations of low diversity were particularly evident in the German Bight and on the North Sea continental coast, where dab Limanda limanda were abundant. In the Channel and {{to the west of the}} UK the demersal assemblages were more species-rich than in the North Sea and, although dab was still an important member of the underlying fish assemblage, the abundance of other species, especially <b>poor</b> <b>cod</b> Trisopterus minutus, solenette Buglossidium luteum, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, and the lesser weever, Echiichthys vipera, allowed a range of different groups to be identified. Despite the greater species diversity in this westerly region only eight out of a total nineteen flatfish species were found in abundance. The dominance of different species in different size classes was a key feature of the community structure. Flatfish were the largest group by weight in the smaller-length classes (< 30 cm), and in western areas the elasmobranchs dominated the larger-size classes. Observed patterns in community structure were partly explained by the zoogeography of the region and the presence of the British Isles at the boundary between two faunal types. The additional influence on demersal populations of depth and substrate type, which may regulate the abundance of flatfish at key stages in their life history, was also discussed. In addition to these natural processes, recent increases in fishing effort are thought to have affected the structure of the demersal assemblage, and an examination of aggregated length-frequency distributions from these surveys tends to support this conclusion. Without further information on the distribution of fishing effort, it is not possible to separate the influence of natural faunal changes between regions from that of artificial changes caused by fishing activity...|$|E
40|$|Monthly {{samples of}} {{fish from the}} intake screens of power {{stations}} at Oldbury and Berkeley in the inner Severn Estuary and Hinkley Point in the inner Bristol Channel, were used to analyse the community structures of the ichthyofauna in these regions. Marine species that use the estuary as a nursery area (marine estuarine-opportunists) were very abundant in the shallow inshore waters at Oldbury. Diadromous species were more abundant in the offshore and deeper waters at Berkeley than at Oldbury. Only {{one of the two}} species that complete their life cycles in the estuary was even moderately abundant in the inner estuary and the 15 freshwater species were relatively rare. Bass and particularly the sand goby complex were more numerous in the protected, inshore waters than the more offshore waters of the estuary. With the yellow and silver stages of the European eel, the reverse situation pertained. Seasonal changes in faunal composition were more pronounced in the inshore shallow than in more offshore deeper waters of the estuary. This largely reflected the sequential immigration of large numbers of the juveniles of marine estuarine-opportunist species into the former area for relatively short periods. Although the ichthyofaunal composition in the shallows at Oldbury underwent the same pattern of cyclical variation in each of five consecutive years, the degree of intra-annual variability differed, reflecting interannual differences in the recruitment strengths of the 0 + age classes of the different marine estuarine-opportunists. These cyclical changes were not correlated strongly with either salinity or water temperature. The faunal composition of the protected inshore, more marine waters of the inner Bristol Channel differed from those in both inshore and offshore regions of the inner estuary. The species which typified the fauna of the Channel were bib, <b>poor</b> <b>cod,</b> five-bearded rockling, sole and conger eel. Although the first four of these species were relatively more abundant in these waters than in the estuary, their juveniles often made extensive use of the shallows at Oldbury. This study emphasizes that, for some marine species, the protected inshore, and more marine, waters in the Bristol Channel can act as alternative nursery areas to those provided by the inshore shallows of the Severn Estuary...|$|E
40|$|In the past, oceans have {{strongly}} influenced atmospheric CO 2 levels through organic and inorganic carbon cycling. The inorganic carbon pump {{relies on the}} formation of calcium carbonate which releases CO 2 into the surface ocean and traps alkalinity in solid form which sinks to deeper ocean layers and sediments. After sinking, calcium carbonate can either then become trapped in the sediments or dissolve increasing the alkalinity of deeper ocean layers. The net effect is of acidifying surface oceans and encouraging release of CO 2 to the atmosphere. The present thesis focuses on marine teleost (bony) fish in temperate areas as previously poorly understood but potentially major producers of calcium carbonate in the ocean. Fish in temperate areas may be contributing to carbonate sediment production and as such the inorganic carbon pump. Prior to this thesis only tropical fish have been investigated as major piscine sediment producers. The present thesis describes the composition and morphology of carbonates produced by many different species of temperate fish providing {{a basis for the}} understanding the fate of these carbonates in the environments and their potential contribution to sediment production and the inorganic carbon cycle. Characteristics of carbonates produced by fish in the wild were fairly consistent within a species upon examination of carbonates produced by <b>poor</b> <b>cod</b> (Trisopterus minutus) {{over the course of a}} year. However, despite the likely consistent and distinct characteristics of fish carbonates, little evidence of them was found in temperate shallow sediments beneath pens of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) where there theoretically should be very high production rates. Reduced salinity, often a feature of temperate areas compared to tropical areas, was found to reduce production rates of carbonate from fish compared to higher salinities. However, salinity reductions below the ocean average of 35 psu (practical salinity units) had less impact on production rates than increases above 35 psu. As such it is argued that production rates in temperate environments should still be relatively high considering high fish biomasses in some temperate regions and could still mean fish in temperate areas are an important source of carbonate production and potential sediment production.

40|$|Fish were {{collected}} from the intake screens of the Oldbury Power Station in the Severn Estuary in each week between early July 1972 and late June 1977 and at least twice monthly between early January 1996 and late June 1999. The annual catches, after adjustment to a common sampling effort, demonstrate that the abundance of fish at Oldbury was far greater in the 1990 s than 1970 s, mainly due to marked increases {{in the numbers of}} certain marine species, such as sand goby, whiting, bass, thin-lipped grey mullet, herring, sprat and Norway pout. These increases may reflect the great improvement that occurred in the water quality of the Severn Estuary between these decades. The only species that declined markedly in abundance was <b>poor</b> <b>cod.</b> Modest declines in flounder and River lamprey paralleled those occurring elsewhere in the UK. The species composition in the two decades also differed, reflecting changes not only in the relative abundances of the various marine estuarine-opportunistic species, which dominated the ichthyofauna, but also in those of the suite of less abundant species in the estuary. The cyclical changes undergone each year by the species composition of the fish fauna of the Severn Estuary reflect sequential intra-annual changes in the relative abundances of species representing each of the marine, diadromous and freshwater categories. New approaches have been developed to test whether or not large sets of correlations between patterns of recruitment amongst abundant marine species (internal correlations), and between those patterns and salinity and water temperature within the estuary (cross-correlations), were significant. The correlation profile analyses found no evidence that the annual recruitment strengths of these species were either intercorrelated, or correlated with either one or a combination of both of the above environmental variables. Yet, the timings of the recruitment of these species into the estuary were intercorrelated, i. e. a slightly earlier or later than normal immigration by one species in a given year was paralleled by the same trend in other species. However, this association in recruitment times could be linked neither to salinity nor water temperature within the estuary, nor to a combination of these two variables. These results indicate that, while the factors that influence the annual recruitment strengths of the juveniles of different marine species vary, inter-annual differences in the phasing of events that regulate spawning times and/or larval dispersal influence, in the same direction, the times when marine species are recruited into the estuary...|$|E
40|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} and white-beaked dolphins are {{the most}} common small cetaceans in the North Sea and Dutch coastal waters. The distribution and relative abundance of harbour porpoises and white-beaked dolphins from the Dutch coastal waters has changed significantly over the past decades. This thesis describes the past and present feeding ecology of these two species in Dutch coastal waters and investigates whether changes in abundance and relative distribution of porpoises reflect changes in their foodbase. For porpoises, three techniques for dietary analyses were combined, including stomach contents-, stable isotope- and fatty acid analysis, providing the most detailed description of their diet in time and space, elucidating differences between their short- and longer term diet. Stable isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were carried out in bone and muscle samples collected from porpoises stranded along the Dutch coast. Muscle δ 15 N values revealed that neonatal enrichment occurred and that larger porpoises, in particular males, seem to feed on lower trophic level species, compared to smaller individuals. Also bone δ 15 N values show that larger animals had fed on lower trophic levels in distant times. Seasonal variation in bone δ 15 N and δ 13 C values revealed two distinct groups of porpoises along the Dutch coast, a winter group (mainly males) that migrated from neighbouring regions and a Dutch subpopulation in summer (Chapter 2). To assess the contribution of prey species to the porpoises’ diet, stable isotope analysis in both porpoise muscle and prey were carried out. With the use of a mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R, SIAR), we revealed that 70 - 83 % of the diet of porpoises consisted mainly of <b>poor</b> <b>cod,</b> mackerel, greater sandeel lesser sandeel, sprat and gobies. This highlights a higher importance of pelagic, schooling species in the porpoises’ diet compared to stomach contents, where 90. 5 % of the diet consisted of gobies, whiting, lesser sandeel, herring, cod and sprat. Porpoises thus also feed offshore on pelagic, schooling species, while they feed closer to shore on more benthic and demersal species shortly before they strand. This could be due to the distribution of prey species as well as differences in behaviour of porpoises and their prey between the coastal zone and offshore waters (Chapter 3). The use of Quantitative Fatty Acid Analysis (QFASA) showed that the diet of porpoises consisted mainly of gobies, mackerel, smelt, herring and dragonet, pointing towards profound differences between the diet as estimated by QFASA and as deduced from stomach contents. This study revealed that the longer term diet of porpoises in Dutch coastal waters consists both of coastal species (e. g. gobies, smelt and dragonet) and also pelagic, schooling species (e. g. mackerel and herring). The results also brought to dawn possible methodological problems in using QFASA for porpoise diet estimation, emphasizing the importance of applying different dietary analysis techniques when studying marine mammal diets and the need for controlled feeding experiments in order to improve the interpretation of dietary analysis results (Chapter 5). Besides new insights in the feeding ecology of porpoises, stable isotope analysis also elicited a non-food related conservation ecology issue. Distinct δ 13 C values in muscle of porpoises stranded in the Eastern Scheldt revealed that these porpoises foraged there for a longer period. This distinct δ 13 C signature of animals from the Eastern Scheldt was not observed in bone tissue, which suggests a relatively recent shift in habitat use rather than life-long residency of porpoises within the Eastern Scheldt. The high number of strandings within the Eastern Scheldt revealed a higher mortality rate compared to the Dutch coastal zone, indicating that along with other changes in the physical environment, the building of the storm surge barrier may {{play an important role in}} determining the residency of porpoises in the Eastern Scheldt, and that the area might act as an ecological trap for porpoises entering it. This is an example of the impact on marine species due to protection structures that emerge and respectively increase worldwide in response to the effects of global warming and climate change. It highlights that even semi-open structures, which are meant to ameliorate habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, may still affect the abundance and distribution of migratory marine mammal species (Chapter 4). The analysis of stomach contents of white-beaked dolphins showed that their diet was dominated by Gadidae. All other prey species combined contributed little to the diet by weight. The two most important prey species based in weight were whiting and cod. In numbers, gobies were most common, but these contributed little to the diet by weight. The overall diet showed a lasting predominance of whiting and cod, without clear changes over time (35 years) or differences between sexes or size-classes of dolphins and revealed that white-beaked dolphins in the south-eastern North Sea are specialist feeders, with a strong preference for whiting and cod (Chapter 6). Stomach contents of juvenile white-beaked dolphins in our study revealed that at the age of about 1. 5 years old, they had started feeding on solid food by taking a variety of small fish and invertebrate prey, mostly shrimp and squid. Immatures in our study, estimated to be 2 - 4 years old, still take small prey, including small gadoids, but also take larger gadoids. Calves apparently gradually learn to eat big fish by taking prey that is much smaller than those normally taken by their mothers. This study illustrates novel techniques for diet estimation to reconstruct sizes of shrimp and whiting from tail flaps and eye lenses, respectively (Chapter 7). Most dietary studies on porpoises and white-beaked dolphins are deduced from stomach contents. This thesis has demonstrated that using indirect methods for studying the feeding ecology of marine mammals is a valuable addition to the more direct approach using stomach contents. It supports the need for multi-method approaches because by using only one technique, key prey species in the predator-prey relation may be missed or underestimated. Future ecological and fishery impact assessment studies and management decisions for the conservation of porpoises and white-beaked dolphins should acknowledge a difference between their long- and short-term diet. Large improvement in the interpretation of the results from diet analyses can be established either by controlled feeding experiments with animals in captivity or by studies that help to understand the common principals in dietary analyses (e. g. digestion rates, turnover rates of tissues, tissue-dependent isotopic fractionation between predator and prey and lipid metabolism within the animal) and variation of these between species...|$|E
