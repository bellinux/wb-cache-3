40|$|Bell's palsy is the eponym for {{idiopathic}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis.</b> It {{is named}} after Sir Charles Bell (1774 - 1842), who, {{in the first half}} of the nineteenth century, discovered the function of the facial nerve and attracted the attention of the medical world to facial paralysis. Our knowledge of this condition before Bell's landmark publications is very limited and is based oil just a few documents. In 1804 and 1805, Evert Jan Thomassen a Thuessink (1762 - 1832) published what appears to be the first known extensive study on idiopathic <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis.</b> His description of this condition was quite accurate. He located several other early descriptions and concluded from this literature that, previously, the condition had usually been confused with other afflictions (such as 'spasmus cynicus', central facial paralysis and trigeminal neuralgia). According to Thomassen Thuessink, idiopathic <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> and trigeminal neuralgia were related, being different expressions of the same condition. Thomassen a Thuessink believed that idiopathic <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> was caused by 'rheumatism' or exposure to cold. Many aetiological theories have since been proposed.

We describe {{the case of a}} 26 year old man who had initially been diagnosed with myocardial infiltration on an echocardiogram, presenting with a testicular mass and unilateral <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis.</b> On admission, electrocardiograms (ECG) revealed negative T-waves in all leads and ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. On two-dimensional echocardiography, there was infiltration of the pericardium with mild effusion, infiltrative thickening of the aortic walls, both atria and the interatrial septum and a mildly depressed systolic function of both ventricles. An axillary biopsy was performed and reported as a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). Following the diagnosis and staging, chemotherapy was started. Twenty-two days after finishing the first cycle of chemotherapy, the ECG showed regression of T-wave changes in all leads and normalization of the ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. A follow-up Two-dimensional echocardiography confirmed regression of the myocardial infiltration. This case report illustrates a lymphoma presenting with testicular mass, unilateral <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> and myocardial involvement, and demonstrates that regression of infiltration can be achieved by intensive chemotherapy treatment.

40|$|Long-standing <b>peripheral</b> monolateral <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> in {{the adult}} has {{challenged}} otolaryngologists, neurologists and plastic surgeons for centuries. Notwithstanding, {{the ultimate goal of}} normality of the paralyzed hemi-face with symmetry at rest, and the achievement of a spontaneous symmetrical smile with corneal protection, has not been fully reached. At the beginning of the 20 (th) century, the main options were neural reconstructions including accessory to facial nerve transfer and hypoglossal to facial nerve crossover. In {{the first half of the}} 20 (th) century, various techniques for static correction with autologous temporalis muscle and fascia grafts were proposed as the techniques of Gillies (1934) and McLaughlin (1949). Cross-facial nerve grafts have been performed since the beginning of the 1970 s often with the attempt to transplant free-muscle to restore active movements. However, these transplants were non-vascularized, and further evaluations revealed central fibrosis and minimal return of function. A major step was taken in the second half of the 1970 s, with the introduction of microneurovascular muscle transfer in facial reanimation, which, often combined in two steps with a cross-facial nerve graft, has become the most popular option for the comprehensive treatment of long-standing <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis.</b> In the second half of the 1990 s in France, a regional muscle transfer technique with the definite advantages of being one-step, technically easier and relatively fast, namely lengthening temporalis myoplasty, acquired popularity and consensus among surgeons treating <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis.</b> A total of 111 patients with <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> were treated in Caen between 1997 and 2005 by a single surgeon who developed 2 variants of the technique (V 1, V 2), each with its advantages and disadvantages, but both based on the same anatomo-functional background and aim, which is transfer of the temporalis muscle tendon on the coronoid process to the lips. For a comprehensive treatment of the paralysis, the eyelids are usually managed by Paul Tessier's technique to lengthen the levator muscle of the upper eyelid by aponeurosis interposition, combined with external blepharorrhaphy with Krastinova-Lolov's technique. Facial reanimation using lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a dynamic procedure that has its roots in the techniques of Gillies and McLaughlin. This method is a true lengthening myoplasty procedure using no intermediate grafts. In general, the results with a 1 -stage combination of lengthening temporalis myoplasty and static correction of the lagophthalmos appear comparable with the major series in the literature using free microneurovascular transfers combined with cross-facial nerve grafts for longstanding <b>peripheral</b> monolateral <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis.</b> The obvious advantages of temporalis elongation myoplasty consist in its technical ease, a single step, low incidence of complications and markedly reduced operating time...|$|R

Methods: In this retrospective study, all patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis,</b> referred to the emergency department of Poursina hospital, Rasht, Iran, from August 2012 to August 2013, were enrolled. For all patients with diagnosis of Bell's palsy variables such as age, sex, occupation, clinical symptoms, comorbid disease, grade of paralysis, and the severity of the facial palsy were reviewed and analyzed using STATA version 11. 0. Results: A total of 121 patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> were assessed {{with a mean age of}} 47. 14 ± 18. 45 years (52. 9 % male). The majority of patients were observed in the summer (37. 2 %) and autumn (33. 1 %) and the recurrence rate was 22. 3 %. The most common grades of nerve damage were IV and V based on House- Brackman grading scale (47. 1 %). Also, the most frequent signs and symptoms were ear pain (43. 8 %), taste disturbance (38. 8 %), hyperacusis (15. 7 %) and increased tearing (11. 6 %). There were not significant correlations between the severity of palsy with age (p= 0. 08), recurrence rate (p= 0. 18), season (p= 0. 9), and comorbid disease including hypertension (p= 0. 18), diabetes (p= 0. 29), and hyperlipidemia (p= 0. 94).

40|$|Background: the {{decrease}} of facial movements in <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> {{and the resulting}} aesthetical sequels may have important emotional repercussions as a consequence to the functional deficit, and depending on {{the intensity of the}} clinical condition. Orofacial rehabilitation has as a purpose to favor the recovery of orofacial movements and to adequate and/or adapt orofacial functions and facial mimic. However, quantifying therapeutic results in an attempt to measure the muscle tonus is a challenge. Generally, the used forms of measurement are general and subjective. Aim: to propose the labial commissure angle as an anthropometric marker and to evaluate its reliability as an objective tool to evaluate the modification of the facial muscle tonus after rehabilitation. Method: participants of the study were 20 patients presenting <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> - level IV. The study was conducted using images from the photographical documentation taken fifteen days to one year post-onset of facial paralysis. The angle was measured by tracings determined by pre-established anthropometric facial points, such as the line between the glabella and the gnation and the crossing with the left and right chelion points determining an angle manually measured with a protractor on the photography. Results: The average Labial Commissure Angle before treatment was of 101. 70 and after rehabilitation of 93. 80 (standard deviation, SD = 4. 3).

These metabolites cause metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, renal failure, oxaluria, damage to the central nervous system and cranial nerves, and cardiovascular instability. Early initiation of treatment can reduce the mortality and morbidity but different clinical presentations can cause delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. Herein, we report a case with the atypical presentation of <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis,</b> hematuria, and kidney failure due to EG poisoning which progressed to end stage renal failure and permanent right <b>peripheral</b> <b>facial</b> nerve palsy...|$|R
