50|$|Although Martí did {{not oppose}} the U.S. concept of <b>Panamericanism</b> as such, he was {{concerned}} that it carried with it the implicit assumption that this current of inter-American cooperation had been launched by the United States, that its first conference was being held in Washington, that its permanent secretariat would be established a short walking distance from the White House and the State Department, {{and that it would}} serve as the vehicle for U.S. commercial and diplomatic influence in the Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Martí's {{comments}} on the Washington Conference emphasize the opportunities {{as well as the}} dangers inherent in a closer relationship between Latin America and the United States. His commentary helped forge public and official opinion in Argentina and other countries regarding the motives of the United States in calling for the meeting, and to some degree they continue to influence ambivalent Latin American attitudes towards US-led <b>Panamericanism</b> to this day. Finally, Martí provides us with insights into the Conference's functioning in political, psychological, cultural and linguistic terms.|$|E
5000|$|The Pan American {{approach}} {{is a part of}} PAHO history and the spirit of <b>Panamericanism</b> continues to stimulate technical cooperation among countries in health. PAHO has helped countries work together toward common goals, and to initiate multi-country health ventures in Central America, the Caribbean, the Andean Region, and the Southern Cone. Experience has shown practical benefits such as the solidarity that helped Central America after hurricane Mitch, and there are numerous other examples. Health collaboration found expression at the highest political level when American heads of state in their Summit in Santiago accepted a health initiative called [...] "Health Technology Linking the Americas." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Ecuadorian {{government}} quickly regretted {{having become}} {{a party to}} the Rio Protocol. The protocol became the focus of a surge of Ecuadorian national pride and concomitant opposition to Arroyo in a new coalition—the Democratic Alliance. The coalition brought together a wide array of Ecuadorian politicians dedicated to replacing the [...] "president who had been unable to defend the national honor." [...] Arroyo's rejoinder that he would remain in office the full four years, [...] "neither one day more nor one day less," [...] and his being prominently hailed in Washington as [...] "the Apostle of <b>PanAmericanism</b> [...] " [...] only increased his political isolation. A persistent inflation that whittled away at the purchasing power of salaried workers was a further cause of popular resentment against Arroyo.|$|E
50|$|This accomplished, the twenty-seven {{delegates from}} {{thirteen}} countries settled in to tackle their substantial agenda. Two nations {{which might have}} been expected to play a major role, were passive: Brazil because of internal political developments (the Empire was giving way to the Republic), and Mexico, which under the long-term authoritarian rule of Porfirio Díaz had a special and deferential relationship with the United States. Leadership among the Latin American nations was exercised mainly by the Argentine delegation, {{in part because of the}} high caliber of its delegates, but also because Argentina saw U.S.-guided <b>Panamericanism</b> as a threat to her special relationship with key European countries. Argentine opposition began with the issue of electing the chairman of the Conference. The U.S. delegation more or less assumed that Blaine as host would be elected. But Blaine was technically not a delegate, and the Argentines (backed by the Chileans, who mistrusted Blaine because of his diplomatic role in the War of the Pacific) seized on this to argue that he was not qualified, and thus got the deliberations off to a sour start.|$|E
40|$|Authentic Assertions, Commercial Concessions” {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} popular black and white Cuban entertainers and the Cuban communities and broader Latino/a publics of New York City and Miami in the 1940 s and 1950 s. It uses the stories told {{by some of the}} key Cuban participants in the Latin music scene of this period as well as the public discourse produced in the Spanish-language newspapers in both cities as a window into a broader experience of Cuban ethnic identity. In New York City, Cuban migrants and musicians settled nearby and among much larger Puerto Rican and African-American communities. It was within these contexts that black and white musicians engaged with ideas about their music, race, and national identity. In Miami, Cuban migrants and musicians lived {{in the context of a}} tourism industry and political climate that facilitated a massive back-and-forth movement between the United States and Cuba. Here, Cuban communities and Cuban ethnic identity developed in relation to the racial and political demands of Jim Crow and <b>Panamericanism.</b> In both cities and, indeed, in the broader realm of popular culture, black and white Cuban musicians – from Mario Bauzá and Machito to Xavier Cugat and Desi Arnaz – played key roles in shaping Cuban ethnic identity for others. Through their participation in music festivals, nightclubs, social clubs, and television and film productions and with the Spanish-language press acting as an important intermediary, Cuban performers also played a central role in constructing Hispano and Latino/a identity and culture. With Cuban music and musicians at the center, a relationship developed between national origin communities, nationalist cultural representations, and an emerging public defined by shared language, hemispheric solidarity, and transnational culture. Among the 90, 000 Cubans settled in New York and Florida before the Cuban Revolution of 1959 were numerous musicians, who at times shifted seamlessly between critical and oppositional stories of race to discourses of musical nationalism and racial harmony. This dissertation examines what it meant to be “Cuban,” “Afro-Cuban,” “Hispanic,” and “Latin” on the stages, dance floors, television screens, and crowded streets of New York City and Miami in the 1940 and 1950 s...|$|E
