40|$|Introduction: Surgical {{procedures}} for pacemaker implantation vary among facilities. The extrathoracic venous <b>puncture</b> method has been utilized for lead insertion, although patients' body movements can displace the targeted vein {{from the area}} into which a contrast agent has been injected for imaging. Failed <b>punctures</b> cause edema around the <b>puncture</b> site, spasm, or venous collapse due to bleeding, which may render another <b>puncture</b> impractical. To overcome these problems, we report a new technique for the extrathoracic <b>puncture</b> method. Methods and results: From April 2007 through March 2011, we performed 35 new dual chamber pacemaker implantation procedures. This study compared a conventional <b>puncture</b> group (from April 2007 through March 2009; Group A) with a catheter-guided <b>puncture</b> group (from April 2009 through March 2011; Group B). We analyzed procedure time and procedure-related complications in each group. The procedure time was 138. 6 ± 41. 8  min in the conventional <b>puncture</b> group (Group A) and 109. 8 ± 23. 2 in the catheter-guided <b>puncture</b> group (Group B). There was {{a significant reduction in}} the procedure time in the catheter-guided <b>puncture</b> group (Group B) compared with the conventional <b>puncture</b> group (Group A; p= 0. 016). No patients in either group had pneumothorax, hematoma, or any other complications. Conclusion: Our <b>puncture</b> method involving catheter insertion appears to be safe and effective...|$|R

5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment <b>punctured</b> a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have <b>punctured</b> the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A precise <b>puncture</b> of the renal {{collecting}} {{system is the}} most essential step for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). There are many techniques describing this crucial first step in PCNL including the bull's eye technique, triangulation technique, free-hand technique, and gradual descensus technique. We describe a novel <b>puncture</b> guide to assist accurate percutaneous needle placement during bull's eye technique. Methods: The mini access guide (MAG) stabilizes the initial <b>puncture</b> needle by mounting it on an adjustable multidirectional carrier fixed to the patient's skin, which aids in achieving the “bull's eye” <b>puncture.</b> It also avoids a direct fluoroscopic exposure of the urologist's hand during the <b>puncture.</b> Sixty consecutive patients with solitary renal calculus were randomized to traditional hand versus MAG <b>puncture</b> during bull's eye technique of <b>puncture</b> and the fluoroscopy time was assessed. Results: The median fluoroscopy screening time for traditional free-hand bull's eye and MAG-guided bull's eye <b>puncture</b> (fluoroscopic screening time for <b>puncture)</b> was 55 versus 21 s (P = 0. 001) and the median time to <b>puncture</b> was 80 versus 55 s (P = 0. 052), respectively. Novice residents also learned <b>puncture</b> technique faster with MAG on simulator. Conclusion: The MAG is a simple, portable, cheap, and novel assistant to achieve successful PCNL <b>puncture.</b> It would be of great help for novices to establish access during their learning phase of PCNL. It would also be an asset toward significantly decreasing the radiation dose during PCNL access...|$|R
40|$|<b>Puncture</b> {{resistance}} {{is among the}} major mechanical properties often required for protective clothing, especially in the medical sector. However the intrinsic material parameters controlling <b>puncture</b> resistance of protective materials are still unknown. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} work is to study the mechanism and mechanical behaviors of <b>puncture</b> resistance of protective clothing materials to various probe types. A better understanding of <b>puncture</b> mechanics will be helpful to develop suitable methods to evaluate the <b>puncture</b> resistance and to predict the failure of protective clothing materials. The thesis includes 4 articles which expose two major phases in this study. Article I and II studied the mechanics and mechanisms of <b>puncture</b> by conical and cylindrical probes used in the standard test methods (ASTM F 1342 and ISO 13996). The results show that the <b>punctures</b> of rubber membranes by conical and cylindrical probes are controlled by a maximum local deformation (or <b>puncture</b> failure strain) that is independent of the probe geometry. The <b>puncture</b> strengths of elastomer membranes are much lower than their tensile and biaxial strengths. In addition, a simpler cylindrical probe can be used in the place of the costly conical probe required by the ASTM standard and still provides a quantitative characterization of <b>puncture.</b> Actually, since 2005, an alternative method B had been added to F 1342 ASTM with 0. 5 mm-diameter rounded-tip cylindrical probe. Furthermore, the <b>puncture</b> probes used in the ASTM F 1342 are very different to the actual pointed objects (medical needle, pointed tip of knife [...] .) and cannot accurately characterize the <b>puncture</b> resistance to real objects. Therefore, in the second step, the mechanics and mechanisms of <b>puncture</b> by medical needles were studied. Article III shows that the <b>puncture</b> by sharp-pointed objects like medical needles {{is very different from the}} <b>puncture</b> by conical probes used in the ASTM standard test. For medical needles, the <b>puncture</b> resistance involves cutting and fracture energy of material. Using the fracture mechanics, based on the change in strain energy with the change in fracture surface, the fracture energy in <b>puncture</b> was estimated. This calculation assumes that there is no friction between the needle tip and fracture surface. However, even with the application of a lubricant on the needle surface, the effect of friction on the <b>puncture</b> process cannot be totally eliminated, preventing the determination of the material fracture energy. Therefore, Article IV has described a method, similar to that of Lake and Yeoh for cutting to access the precise value of fracture energy in <b>puncture</b> of rubbers by sharp-pointed objects. The method allows substantially eliminating the effects of friction on the evaluation of the fracture energy involved in the <b>puncture</b> process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResistance to <b>puncture</b> is a {{critical}} property for several applications, in particular for elastomer materials used in protective clothing. To evaluate the <b>puncture</b> resistance of membranes, some methods have been proposed as standard tests. However, the rounded <b>puncture</b> probes used in these tests {{are very different from}} real pointed objects like medical needles, and may not measure the level of material resistance that correspond to them. In fact, <b>puncture</b> by medical needles is shown to proceed gradually as the needle cuts into the membrane. This behavior is highly different from <b>puncture</b> by rounded probes which occurs suddenly when the strain at the probe tip reaches the failure value. In addition, maximum force values are observed to be much smaller with medical needles. A method has been developed based on the change in strain energy with the <b>puncture</b> depth to evaluate the fracture energy associated to <b>puncture.</b> The results show that the phenomenon of <b>puncture</b> by medical needles involves contributions both from friction and fracture energy, in a similar way as for cutting. Prestrained samples must be used to determine the material <b>puncture</b> energy...|$|R
