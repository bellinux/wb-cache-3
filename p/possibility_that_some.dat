Jones calculated unit-strengths in Egypt under Diocletian using papyrus evidence of unit payrolls. But a rigorous reassessment of that evidence by R. Duncan-Jones concluded that Jones had overestimated unit sizes by 2–6 times. For example, Jones estimated legions on the frontiers at c. 3,000 men and other units at c. 500. But Duncan-Jones' revisions found frontier legions of around 500 men, an ala of just 160 and an equites unit of 80. Even allowing for the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of these units were detachments from larger units, {{it is likely that}} Diocletianic unit-strengths were far lower than earlier.|$|E

Astronomers initially ruled out the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the point-like objects are white dwarfs, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time.

The Conservatives argued that the GST cuts would benefit all Canadians, including low-income earners and those outside the workforce who do not pay income tax.|$|R

Allowing for the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte. An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had {{at the beginning of the}} battle on 12 July.

Jennings recounts entering a nearby basement where Wahdat fighters had tied up non-Hazara hostages with wire, shot them and tried to burn the bodies, before fleeing the scene ahead of Massoud's advancing troops. Jennings also describes Ahmad Shah Massoud's followers rescuing a wounded Hazara civilian {{caught in the crossfire}} {{during the height of the}} battle. Despite these written reference — and although Jennings is quoted as a reliable source on other topics in the Human Rights Watch reports — any account of what he witnessed during and after the Afshar battle was left out by Human Rights Watch editors.|$|E
25|$|Square {{shoulder}} spades: Square shoulder spade coins have square shoulders, {{a straight}} or slightly curving foot, and three parallel {{lines on the}} obverse and reverse. They are found in quantities of up to several hundreds in the area corresponding to the Royal Domain of Zhou (south Hebei and north Henan). Archaeological evidence dates them to the early Spring and Autumn period, around 650 BC onwards. The inscriptions on these coins usually consist of one character, {{which can be a}} number, a cyclical character, a place name, or the name of a clan. The <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> inscriptions are the names of merchants has not been entertained. The crude writing is that of the artisans who made the coins, not the more careful script of the scholars who wrote the votive inscriptions on bronzes. The style of writing is consistent with that of the middle Zhou period. Over 200 inscriptions are known; many have not been fully deciphered. The characters {{can be found on the}} left or the right of the central line and are sometimes inverted or retrograde. The alloy of these coins is typically 80% copper, 15% lead, and 5% tin. They are found in hoards of hundreds, rather than thousands, sometimes tied together in bundles. Although there is no mention in the literature of their purchasing power, it is clear that they were not small change.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there is}} no extant music that can be {{positively}} identified with Nero, there is a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of {{it may have been}} used in later works. John E. Sawyer, in his analysis of Agrippina, reveals that this work, composed five years after Nero with similar characters, [...] "contains the highest proportion of borrowed material of any of the composer's major dramatic works", and Dean and Knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from Nero. According to the Handel scholar Charles Cudworth, the suite of dances that follows the overture to Handel's 1707 opera Rodrigo (his first after leaving Hamburg), could very well have begun as ballet music in Nero or another of the lost Hamburg operas. The musicologist Bernd Baselt has raised the possibility that Handel's Harpsichord Suite in G Minor, HWV 453, is an arrangement of the overture to Nero. A version of this suite, reconstructed for orchestra by Peter Holman, is included in a selection of Handel's Hamburg music, issued by Hyperion Records in January 2012.|$|E
500|$|However, {{claims have}} since been made that Pickingill was not a cunning man or {{involved}} in folk magic at all. Local Canewdon historian Sylvia Webster expressed her view to Howard that tales regarding Pickingill's magical practices had been invented by the locals of Canewdon to impress Maple. Supporting this position, she highlighted {{that there was no}} evidence to suggest that Pickingill was a cunning man prior to Maple's publications. Similarly, Richard Ward argued that the contemporary obituaries and interviews conducted with Pickingill had shown no evidence of any magical activities, when such might have been expected. Ward suggested that many of the stories regarding Pickingill's magical activities were adapted from those of a genuine Essex cunning man, James Murrell. Hutton responded critically to Ward's claims, highlighting his own investigations into the local folklore and his interview with Taylor to express the view that there [...] "seems little doubt" [...] that Pickingill was a cunning man, although [...] "there are still questions over what sort of one he was". At the same time, Hutton also accepted the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the legends associated with Murrell had come to be associated with Pickingill, although stated that this seemed to be [...] "incapable of solid proof". In his counter-response to Hutton, Ward accepting that Pickingill could have been associated with [...] "some apparent supernatural control or knowledge of horses" [...] as Taylor had claimed, but that this did not automatically make him a cunning man, for which there remained no contemporary historical evidence.|$|E
