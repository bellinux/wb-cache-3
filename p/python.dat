50|$|Smaller declines were {{observed}} where <b>pythons</b> were only recently documented {{and the greatest}} mammalian abundances {{were observed}} outside of the python's current range. Burmese <b>pythons</b> were the dominant predator of reintroduced marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris) in Everglades National Park, and predation by <b>pythons</b> extirpated the rabbit population in less than 11 months.|$|R
5|$|Before version 3.0, <b>Python</b> had {{two kinds}} of classes: old-style and new-style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the {{difference}} being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of <b>Python</b> 2 from <b>Python</b> 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in <b>Python</b> 3.0.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to standard desktop integrated development environments (<b>Python</b> IDEs), {{there are also}} web browser-based IDEs, SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related <b>Python</b> programs), and a browser-based IDE and hosting environment, PythonAnywhere.

5000|$|Burmese <b>pythons</b> prey on a {{wide variety}} of birds, mammals, and crocodilian species occupying the Everglades. [...] Pronounced declines in a number of {{mammalian}} species have coincided spatially and temporally with the proliferation of <b>pythons</b> in southern Florida, indicating the already devastating impacts upon native animals. Although the low detectability of <b>pythons</b> makes population estimates difficult, most researchers propose that at least 30,000 and upwards of 300,000 <b>pythons</b> likely occupy southern Florida and that this population will only continue to grow. The importation of Burmese <b>pythons</b> was banned in the United States in January 2012 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. However, the lack of effective control methods for the already-established reproducing population necessitates better management of a potentially devastating invasive species.|$|R

5000|$|The Chicago <b>Pythons</b> were a {{professional}} indoor football team based in Homer Glen, Illinois. The team {{was a member}} of the Continental Indoor Football League (CIFL). The <b>Pythons</b> joined the CIFL in 2012 as an expansion team under the name [...] "Chicago Vipers". They changed their name to the [...] "Chicago Pythons" [...] four weeks into the season. The <b>Pythons</b> were the third indoor football team based in the Chicago area. The Chicago Rush of the Arena Football League were based in Rosemont, and the Chicago Slaughter of the Indoor Football League are based in Hoffman Estates. The <b>Pythons</b> replaced the Chicago Knights, formerly the Chicago Cardinals, as the Illinois-based CIFL team, which replaced the Slaughter after they left for the Indoor Football League after a dispute with CIFL management. The Owner of the <b>Pythons</b> was Michael Duran. The <b>Pythons</b> were supposed to play their home games at The Megaplex in Homer Glen, Illinois, but the team never hosted a home game.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, as apex {{predators and}} dietary generalists, Burmese <b>pythons</b> target {{a wide array}} of taxonomic groups. Thus, they are not {{dependent}} upon a specific prey species. The flexible dietary requirements of Burmese <b>pythons</b> enable them to survive {{for long periods of time}} without food, but when prey is readily available, they will eat regularly. Consequently, Burmese <b>pythons</b> pose a great threat to wildlife, especially mid-sized mammals.|$|R
5|$|<b>Python</b> {{does not}} support tail call {{optimization}} or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From <b>Python</b> 2.5, {{it is possible to}} pass information back into a generator function, and from <b>Python</b> 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Python</b> has {{a type of}} {{expression}} termed a list comprehension. <b>Python</b> 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Python</b> {{has been}} used in {{artificial}} intelligence tasks. As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, <b>Python</b> is often used for natural language processing tasks.|$|E
50|$|Belief in {{existence}} of witches was pertinent {{in the world}} view of the Nyakyusa. It was believed that certain people flew on <b>pythons,</b> harming people and cattle at night. These witches inherited their power and <b>pythons</b> from a parent, and greed was the typical motive for harming men and cattle. <b>Pythons</b> lusted for the meat and milk available at the funeral of those killed. Sexual dreams were not thought to come from witchcraft, even though the witches always went naked, flew through the air riding their <b>pythons,</b> while 'throttling' is a polite word for sexual intercourse.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{non-native}} snakes {{have been released}} in the wild. In 2010 the state created a hunting season for Burmese and Indian <b>pythons,</b> African rock <b>pythons,</b> green anacondas, and Nile monitor lizards.|$|R
50|$|Some {{endangered}} species of Indian snakes {{can be found}} here, including <b>pythons.</b> Netarhat School's biology laboratory has a collection of live and preserved snake varieties that include cobras, pit vipers, tree snakes and <b>pythons.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Python</b> is {{intended}} to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. <b>Python</b> does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional, in contrast to many other programming languages. Further, <b>Python</b> has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Python</b> {{provides}} a round function for rounding a float {{to the nearest}} integer. For tie-breaking, versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is âˆ’1.0. <b>Python</b> 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) is 2, round(2.5) is 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Python</b> uses dynamic typing and {{a mix of}} {{reference}} counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. An important feature of <b>Python</b> is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.|$|E

5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal {{increase in speed}} {{at the cost of}} clarity. When speed is important, a <b>Python</b> programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a <b>Python</b> script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the <b>Python</b> interpreter.|$|E
5|$|Python's {{development}} is conducted largely through the <b>Python</b> Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process. The PEP {{process is the}} primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into <b>Python.</b> Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the <b>Python</b> community and by Van Rossum, the <b>Python</b> project's Benevolent Dictator For Life.|$|E
5|$|Python's name {{is derived}} from the {{television}} series Monty Python's Flying Circus, and it is common to use Monty <b>Python</b> references in example code. For example, the metasyntactic variables often used in <b>Python</b> literature are spam and eggs, instead of the traditional foo and bar. Also, the official <b>Python</b> documentation and many code examples often contain various obscure Monty <b>Python</b> references.|$|E
50|$|Burmese <b>pythons</b> are {{opportunistic}} feeders; {{they eat}} almost any time food is offered, and often act hungry {{even when they}} have recently eaten. As a result, they are often overfed, causing obesity-related problems to be common in captive Burmese <b>pythons.</b>|$|R
50|$|An indoor exhibit {{that houses}} several {{different}} types of smaller, exotic animals. These include Pygmy marmosets, leafcutter ants, praying mantises, Lake Malawi cichlids, salmon-pink bird-eating spiders, locusts, Burmese <b>pythons,</b> plumed basilisks, veiled chameleons, green tree <b>pythons,</b> and poison dart frogs.|$|R
30|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{increase}} in <b>pythons</b> on Kinmen in recent years {{appears to be the}} sudden increase in suitable habitats. Large forested areas, open grasslands, abandoned camps, and tunnels all provide suitable habitats for <b>pythons.</b> Most local villagers do not enter these areas because of the possibility of stepping on unexploded land mines. Radio-tracking also revealed that <b>pythons</b> consistently use old underground tunnels as overwintering shelters (Chou et al., unpublished data; FigureÂ  2 B). The increase in <b>pythons</b> is also likely related to increases in available prey. For example, in the early 2000 s, typhoons destroyed several local bird farms and caused the escape of Korean ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus karpowi) and Indian peacocks (Pavo cristatus). Soon after this event, these two non-native birds established populations and now occupy all habitat types throughout the island (Hung et al. 2009). The sudden availability of these large, terrestrial birds may also have provided a rich food source for the <b>pythons</b> (Dove et al. 2011).|$|R
