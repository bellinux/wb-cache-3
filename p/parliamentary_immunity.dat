5|$|The looming {{referendum}} {{prompted a}} number of actions in the Quebec Superior Court, which were consolidated under the application of prominent lawyer Guy Bertrand. Bertrand asked for interim and permanent injunctions against the holding of the referendum. The Federal Attorney General declined to intervene, and after failing in a motion to strike the application, the Quebec Attorney General unilaterally withdrew from the hearing.

The deputies had no set term of office, although in practice it was about four months long, from their election at a regional sejmik, to their report on the next sejmik dedicated to hearing and discussing the previous sejm's proceedings (those sejmiks were known as relational or debriefing). Deputies had <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> and any crimes against them were classified as lèse-majesté.|$|E

A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E

When he returned, the National Assembly of Iraq voted to remove his <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunities</b> and ban him from travelling. The Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Safaaeddine al-Safi, said he would seek a prosecution for [...] "visiting a country that Iraq considers an enemy". Such a crime can carry the death penalty. Alusi appealed to the Supreme Federal Court who overturned the lifting of his immunity, ruling that it was unconstitutional as no crime had been committed.|$|R

40|$|Anima a elaboração do presente trabalho, de proporções limitadas, o propósito de destacar alguns dos mais importantes aspectos a respeito das imunidades parlamentares, — tema que ultimamente só tem merecido a atenção de poucos estudiosos, - sem a menor veleidade de esgotar a matéria, quer em extensão, quer em profundidade. Alguns de tais aspectos, exigentes de mais detida apreciação, não puderam ser senão aflorados, como os da crise das concepções clássicas da repartição tripartida do Poder, do princípio representativo e do federalismo ortodoxo, que se encontram na base da própria fundamentação do instituto. Depois das considerações iniciais e da parte histórica, o estudo se limita a um enfoque de feição jurídica, na medida em que, deixando entre parênteses as inclinações do autor, tenta desenvolver-se exclusivamente à luz do ordenamento constitucional ora em vigor no Brasil. The {{elaboration}} of this study, of limited proportions, {{is inspired by}} the aim of distinguishing {{some of the most}} important aspects of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunities</b> - a theme that has recently gained the attention of few scholars - without the least velleity of exhausting the matter in terms of either depth or extent. Some or said aspects, requiring more prolonged consideration, such as those of the crisis of the classic conceptions of the tripartite partition of power, the representative principle, and orthodox federalism, which are encountered at the base of the very foundations of the institution, could not otherwise be touched upon. Following the initial considerations and the historical part, the study limits itself to focusing upon juridical features, inasmuch as, leaving in parentheses the author's inclinations, it attempts to unfold exclusively in the light of the constitutional ordination presently in vigor in Brazil...|$|R
50|$|Barbon {{was also}} active {{in other fields}} during the 1690s. He was MP for Bramber in Sussex in 1690 and 1695, which allowed him to take {{advantage}} of <b>Parliamentary</b> privilege (<b>immunity</b> from prosecution)—this helped him evade various court actions which were pending against him. Another project involved trying to pump drinking water from the River Thames, to be piped to his new building developments. He patented a design in 1694, and tried to sell pumping rights alongside fire insurance contracts. He built a house for himself and his business interests in Fleet Street, but later moved to Osterley House, a 16th-century manor house west of London. He died there in 1698 or 1699: his will was written in May 1698 and his executors received probate on 6 February 1699.|$|R

25|$|Members of Parliament are {{permitted}} to speak on any subject without fear of censure outside Parliament; the only body that can censure an MP is the House Committee of Privileges. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> takes effect from the moment a member of Parliament is sworn in, and only applies when that member has the floor; it {{does not apply to}} statements made outside the House. An exception to this rule are portions of the constitution related to the social contract, such as the Articles governing citizenship, Bumiputera (Malays and indigenous people) priorities, the Malay language, etc. — all public questioning of these provisions is illegal under the 1971 amendments to the Sedition Act, which Parliament passed {{in the wake of the}} 1969 13 May race riots. Members of Parliament are also forbidden from criticising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and judges. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> and other such privileges are set out by Article 63 of the Constitution; as such, the specific exceptions to such immunity had to be included in the Constitution by amendment after the 13 May incident.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Möllemann had been confronted with {{allegations}} {{he had been}} involved in illegal arms deals and evaded taxes on millions of euros he allegedly earned from those activities.

25|$|The fourth part treats {{in detail}} the {{legislative}} power from article 106 to article 124. The legislative power {{is in the hands}} of the National Assembly and the Senate; while National Assembly representatives are directly elected by universal suffrage, those to the Senate represent the Decentralised Territorial Collectivities and are elected indirectly by a college composed regional, départemental and municipal councillors. While the firsts are elected for four years, the seconds are elected for six. Deputees and Senators enjoy <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> from legal prosecution, except when the parliamentarian is caught in the act. A parliamentarian may be legally persecuted and even arrested by decision of his chamber of Parliament.|$|E
5000|$|Article 29 of the Law {{concerning}} involuntary hospitalization in {{a mental}} hospital shall not apply to senior officials and the judiciary {{on the ground that}} they are vested with <b>parliamentary</b> or judicial <b>immunity.</b> A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his or her diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. Passport data of persons vested with <b>parliamentary</b> or judicial <b>immunity</b> shall be included in the computer database, which is available to every psychiatric institution and shall be used by every psychiatrist before addressing the issue of involuntary hospitalization of a person in a psychiatric hospital. Psychiatrists commented on how to treat the judge vested with judicial immunity as follows: [...] "While knowing that the person in twilight state is dangerous and may kill or maim people nearby, the psychiatrist should provide this information to the regional court so that three judges of the court within 10 days can send to the Supreme Court of the country a petition for the removal of immunity from the judge. It is only a possible victim who should be worried about the fact that aggressive actions are likely to happen now because twilight state is usually short-lived. The victim may suffer or die, but it would happen in strict accordance with the Law on the Status of Judges!" [...] According to the next item of the commentary, the psychiatrist has no right to subject the incumbent President of the Russian Federation to the procedure of involuntary psychiatric examination or involuntary hospitalization.|$|R
5|$|In April 1995, the State Duma {{considered}} {{the first draft}} of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book Punitive Medicine, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior. Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with <b>parliamentary</b> or judicial <b>immunity.</b> A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.|$|R

Halvorssen concluded that Castro Llanes was laundering drug money and was involved in other financial irregularities and handed over the material to allies in the Congress who had <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity.</b> Castro's adversaries started a media campaign to discredit him.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, he {{received}} a degree in sociology from the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Bucharest, and in 1975, he studied at the School for Reserve Officers in Bucharest.

During the communist era, he worked as a journalist, editor, and poet: in the early 1970s, {{he was one of the}} editors at România Liberă, and after 1975 was an editor at the Romanian official press agency, Agerpress. He served as senator from 1992–2008. For the first time since 1990, after the election of 30 November 2008, he and his party were no longer present in either of the Romanian legislative chambers. On 25 September 2001, Tudor renounced his <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> from prosecution.|$|E
25|$|In {{the run-up}} to the election, the media {{observed}} a potential disagreement between the AKP government and President Erdoğan, with Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç openly criticising Erdoğan's comments on the ongoing Solution process with Kurdish rebels. Erdoğan's allegedly critical stance on government policy was widely perceived to be an attempt to win back nationalist voters who had defected to the MHP. A polemic subsequently took place between Arınç and Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek, with Gökçek demanding the former's resignation for criticising the President and accusing him of being a follower of Fethullah Gülen. Despite a statement from Prime Minister Davutoğlu warning both men to end their arguments, Arınç made a statement accusing Gökçek of bringing personal and family issues into the political sphere and attempting to secure parliamentary candidacy for his son, for which he would not respect the Prime Minister's demands. The Ankara Attorney General began a criminal investigation into both individuals, though Arınç has <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> from prosecution until the election.|$|E
25|$|After the {{publication}} of the committee's report on December 15, 1894, Crispi dissolved the Chamber by decree amidst increasing protests, which compelled Giolitti – now that his <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> was lifted – to leave the country; officially to visit his daughter in Berlin. Crispi denounced the Giolitti documents as a mass of lies, but rumours of Crispi's resignation turned out to be unfounded. Five battalions of infantry had been brought to Rome to quell possible riots. Giolitti was accused of embezzlement as well as libel against Crispi and his wife, and was summoned before the courts in February 1895 after the Public Prosecutor, sustained by lower courts, had started the prosecution. However, on April 24, 1895, the Supreme Court decided that Giolitti could not be tried by an ordinary civil court, as Giolitti had argued, because he had made his accusations against Crispi in the Chamber. Only the Senate could hear the case.|$|E
25|$|Mithal al-Alusi, {{a secular}} Muslim Iraqi lawmaker, who is openly pro-Israel, paid {{a heavy price}} for visiting Israel in September 2004, criticizing Hamas and Hezbollah as {{terrorist}} organizations, and advocating peace with the Jewish state. Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunmen opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed. According to Alusi, there is no Iraqi-Israeli problem, {{and the interests of}} the two countries are parallel; thus, he advocates strategic relations between Iraq and Israel against terrorism. Alusi returned to Israel for a second visit in September 2008. Upon his return to Iraq, he was stripped of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity</b> so that he could face charges of traveling illicitly to Israel. Later that year, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court ruled in his favor, maintaining it was no longer a crime for Iraqis to travel to Israel.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, he {{published}} Omul periculos, a pamphlet attacking the regnant House of Hohenzollern, accusing {{the king of}} abusing his prerogatives and allowing his ministers to ignore the constitution while suggesting he abdicate. Sued for lèse-majesté, {{he was sentenced to}} two years' imprisonment and a fine of 5000 lei. After writing an article to explain he was not fleeing but going into exile, he left for Vienna in May and was returned in absentia to the Assembly the following January, as an opposition member. In February, he was arrested but soon released, having gained <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity.</b> A government crisis was going on at the same time, and Panu, both in parliament and in Lupta, bitterly attacked the new government of Theodor Rosetti and the continued influence of Junimea. Later that year, he put forth a program for his party, which touched on subjects such as the peasantry, industrial development, relations between owners and workers, social insurance and universal suffrage. He shared these objectives with the socialists, along with an anti-dynastic outlook and calls for an eight-hour workday and Sundays off. However, his Radicals began to diverge from the socialists during the 1888 crisis: while the former took an active role both in parliament and in the streets, the latter kept its distance in the belief that the situation did not concern them.|$|E
25|$|The {{collaboration}} with socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta was praised {{by both sides}} {{at the start of}} the mandate, but deteriorated thereafter once with foreign visits of the Head of the Executive, without informing the President, but especially with the criminal prosecution of Victor Ponta for 22 alleged corruption charges, prompting Iohannis to demand his resignation from the head of the Government. Relations with Parliament went similarly. Iohannis criticized the Parliament for defending MPs by rejecting the requests of the National Anticorruption Directorate for lifting their immunity, as in the case of PSD senator Dan Șova or Prime Minister Victor Ponta. Regarding the judicial system, Klaus Iohannis pleads for a sustained fight against corruption. Likewise, Iohannis expressed dissatisfaction with attempted amendments to the Penal Code. Since coming into office, President Klaus Iohannis has made a habit to hold consultations with parliamentary parties. The first round of consultations took place on 12 January, the purpose of these discussions being a political agreement that would ensure, by 2017, a minimum threshold of 2% of GDP for the Ministry of Defence, agreement signed by all parties. The second round of consultations focused on the legislative priorities of the parliamentary session: voting in diaspora, financing electoral campaigns and parties and lifting <b>parliamentary</b> <b>immunity.</b> Because the Parliament has not implemented the commitments made on 28 January, Iohannis has organised another series of consultations on the state of electoral laws, but also on rejection of Justice requests for approval of arrest or prosecution of MPs. The topics of other meetings between the president and parties aimed the Big Brother law package and the national defense strategy.|$|E
