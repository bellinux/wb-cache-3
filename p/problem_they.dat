5|$|In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein {{published}} {{a study on}} bankruptcy and medical bills, which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so {{in the aftermath of}} a serious medical <b>problem.</b> <b>They</b> say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. This study was widely cited in policy debates, although some have challenged the study's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.|$|E

Since there was no permanent stadium, the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974–75, the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975–76, the GSZ Stadium again in 1976–77, Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977–78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious <b>problem,</b> <b>they</b> appear to be on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles {{as part of the}} range of attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled {{in the city of}} Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a <b>problem.</b> <b>They</b> apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim {{to take control of the}} synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the <b>problem,</b> <b>they</b> drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} two decades, the General Assembly laid the {{foundation}} of the state. They created the framework for the state's public school system, began construction on the State Seminary and of roads {{in the southern part of}} the state. Initially, the General Assembly was faced with low tax revenues. In response to the <b>problem,</b> <b>they</b> created the Bank of Indiana and sold nine million acres (36,000km²) of public lands to finance their projects. The General Assembly relocated the capitol to Indianapolis in 1824, and in 1831 they authorized the construction of the first dedicated statehouse.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{video game}} , {{developed}} by Insomniac Games, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and released for the PlayStation 3 video game console, features combat scenes {{that take place}} within a virtual representation of Manchester Cathedral in England set in an alternate history. It was released on 23 March 2007 in the United Kingdom. The use of images of the cathedral caused controversy {{with the leaders of}} the Church of England, which claimed its depiction to be desecration and copyright infringement, and that it was inappropriate of Sony to allow players to fire guns in a city with a gun <b>problem.</b> <b>They</b> have made several legal threats against Sony. They intended to make several demands of Sony, including an apology, a substantial donation, complete withdrawal of the game or modifying the segment featuring the interior of the cathedral, and financial support of Manchester groups trying to reduce gun crime in the city.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{rendezvous}} of the Kvant-1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 {{was troubled}} {{by the failure of}} the onboard control system. After the failure of the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to fix the <b>problem.</b> <b>They</b> found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing the bag, docking was completed on 12 April.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, Rutherford {{had succeeded}} in {{disintegrating}} nitrogen atoms with alpha particles emitted from decaying radium atoms. This and subsequent experiments hinted at the structure of atomic nuclei. To explore it further, he needed an artificial means of creating particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the charge of the nucleus. This opened {{a new line of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory. He assigned Cockcroft, Thomas Allibone and Ernest Walton to the <b>problem.</b> <b>They</b> built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Mark Oliphant designed a proton source for them. A crucial moment came when Cockcroft read a paper by George Gamow on quantum tunnelling. Cockcroft realised {{that as a result of}} this phenomenon, the desired effect could be achieved with much lower voltages than first thought. In fact, he calculated that protons with energy of just 300,000 electronvolts would be able to penetrate a boron nucleus. Cockcroft and Walton worked on their accelerator for the next two years. Rutherford obtained a £1,000 grant from the University of Cambridge for them to buy a transformer and other equipment they needed.|$|E
5|$|Power {{and water}} schemes were {{expanded}} {{to be able}} to cope with the industrial development occurring. The state was at a disadvantage in that it was completely reliant on imports for its fuel supply. South Australia's near-monopoly electricity supplier, the Adelaide Electricity Supply Company (AESC), was reluctant to build up coal reserves in case of a transportation <b>problem.</b> <b>They</b> ran on coal that was shipped over from New South Wales (NSW), where the mines were inefficient and plagued by communist-agitated industrial strife. Playford demanded that supplies be built up so the factories could keep producing; he managed to secure eight months worth of coal reserves from NSW, but even that began to dwindle due to the continued industrial action. Coal supplies were ordered from South Africa in desperation, at Playford's behest. The frustration he experienced while dealing with the AESC would later prove disastrous to the company as the Premier took action against them.|$|E
5|$|Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus' {{assistant}} Frank Wolff are aboard {{an atomic}} rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth {{bound for the}} Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away onboard, putting a strain on the oxygen supply. The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the <b>problem.</b> <b>They</b> then suffered a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in Land of Black Gold (1950)), resulting in their hair growing rapidly in multiple colours. Calculus subsequently administers a cure. Haddock, who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becoming a satellite of the asteroid Adonis (at which point, Professor Calculus humorously says he will tell Earth that Adonis has a new satellite {{by the name of}} Haddock) but Tintin is able to rescue him.|$|E

5|$|The Peace of Thorn of 1466 {{reduced the}} Teutonic Knights, but brought no lasting {{solution}} to the <b>problem</b> <b>they</b> presented for Poland and their state avoided paying the prescribed tribute. The chronically difficult relations had gotten worse after the 1511 election of Albrecht as Grand Master of the Order. Faced with Albrecht's rearmament and hostile alliances, Poland waged a war in 1519; the war ended in 1521, when mediation by Charles V resulted in a truce. As a compromise move Albrecht, persuaded by Martin Luther, initiated a process of secularization of the Order {{and the establishment of}} a lay duchy of Prussia, as Poland's dependency, ruled by Albrecht and afterwards by his descendants. The terms of the proposed pact immediately improved Poland's Baltic region situation, and at that time also appeared to protect the country's long-term interests. The treaty was concluded in 1525 in Kraków; the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights (East Prussia centered on Königsberg) was converted into the Protestant (Lutheran) Duchy of Prussia under the King of Poland and the homage act of the new Prussian duke in Kraków followed.|$|E
