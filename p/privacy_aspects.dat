As companies are further embracing social media, how {{if at all}} does this practice affect the work dynamics? While privacy has been a hot topic in online social network research in general, there is little work investigating the <b>privacy</b> <b>aspect</b> of this practice at workplace.

Search engine theory is also presented, and focus is on how it works and what information is logged about their users. A series of interviews is conducted, which shows usability and attitudes towards <b>privacy</b> <b>aspects</b> concerning search engines. The results show, among others, the users concern of keeping control of their personl information on the Internet, and that they ignore the search engines ability to find personal information. The empirical material also show that the users do not think of search engines ability to log information about their users as a privacy threat.

The <b>privacy</b> <b>aspect</b> of Art 8 ECtHR {{will never be a}} successful argument with reference to marriage which involves a public status. The equality argument (Article 14) is useful in addressing this issue with its close connections with citizenship, symbolic value and proven record internationally. Difficulties remain with the equality argument; its conditional status, the width of the margin of appreciation ('MoA') required and the need for an equality comparator. The equality argument needs reinforcement by use alongside a developing family law argument under Article 8 and a dynamically interpreted Article 12 (right to marry) argument. Ultimately the success of any argument depends upon the developing consensus among Member States of the Council of Europe ('Member States') ...|$|R
40|$|Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) {{is rapidly}} {{emerging}} as a prominent technique for multiagent coordination. However, despite agent privacy being a key motivation for applying DCOPs in many applications, rigorous quantitative evaluations of privacy loss in DCOP algorithms have been lacking. Recently, [Maheswaran et al. 2005] introduced a framework for quantitative evaluations of privacy in DCOP algorithms, showing that some DCOP algorithms lose more privacy than purely centralized approaches and questioning the motivation for applying DCOPs. This paper addresses {{the question of whether}} state-of-the art DCOP algorithms suffer from a similar shortcoming by investigating several of the most efficient DCOP algorithms, including both DPOP and ADOPT. Furthermore, while previous work investigated the impact on efficiency of distributed contraint reasoning design decisions (e. g. constraint-graph topology, asynchrony, message-contents), this paper examines the <b>privacy</b> <b>aspect</b> of such decisions, providing an improved understanding of privacy-efficiency tradeoffs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Internet {{users are}} {{becoming}} increasingly concerned about their personal information being collected and used by Web service providers. They want {{to ensure that it}} is stored and used according to the providers ’ privacy policies. Since these policies are mainly developed and maintained separately from the business process that collects and manipulates data, it is hard to perform analysis and management of the processes in terms of privacy policies. To address this problem, we propose a formal technique with which Web service providers describe the use and storage of personal data. The description is integrated with a Web service protocol using an extended state machine model. Having such a conceptual model will enable model-driven development and management of Web service protocols with respect to their <b>privacy</b> <b>aspects</b> such as collection, disclosure, and obligation. A tool support has been implemented, as part of ServiceMosaic, to let designers model <b>privacy</b> <b>aspects</b> within the Web service protocol. Key words: Web service protocols, privacy policies, conceptual modeling. ...|$|E

This paper proposes an annotation- free evaluation method that assesses the two key <b>aspects</b> of <b>privacy</b> protection that are privacy and utility. Unlike some existing methods, the proposed method does not rely {{on the use of}} subjective judgements and does not assume a spe- cific target type in the image data. The <b>privacy</b> <b>aspect</b> is quantified as an appearance similarity and the utility aspect is measured as a structural similarity between the original raw image data and the privacy-protected image data. We performed an extensive experimentation using six challeng- ing datasets (including two new ones) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluation method by providing a per- formance comparison of four state-of-the-art privacy pro- tection techniques...|$|R

40|$|As our ground {{transportation}} infrastructure modernizes, {{the large amount}} of data being measured, transmitted, and stored motivates an analysis of the <b>privacy</b> <b>aspect</b> of these emerging cyber-physical technologies. In this paper, we consider privacy in the routing game, where the origins and destinations of drivers are considered private. This is motivated by the fact that this spatiotemporal information can easily be used as the basis for inferences for a person's activities. More specifically, we consider the differential privacy of the mapping from the amount of flow for each origin-destination pair to the traffic flow measurements on each link of a traffic network. We use a stochastic online learning framework for the population dynamics, which is known to converge to the Nash equilibrium of the routing game. We analyze the sensitivity of this process and provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence rates as well as differential privacy values for these models. We confirm these with simulations on a small example. Comment: Extended draft of paper that appears in 2015 IEEE CD...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{withdrawn}} {{by the author}} due to a crucial sign error in equation 1. With the advance of online social networks, there has been extensive research on how to spread influence in online social networks, and many algorithms and models have been proposed. However, many fundamental problems have also been overlooked. Among those, the most important problems are the incentive <b>aspect</b> and the <b>privacy</b> <b>aspect</b> (eg, nodes' relationships) of the influence propagation in online social networks. Bearing these defects in mind, and incorporating the powerful tool from differential privacy, we propose PRINCE, which {{is a series of}} PRivacy preserving mechanisms for INfluenCE diffusion in online social networks to solve the problems. We not only theoretically prove many elegant properties of PRINCE, but also implement PRINCE to evaluate its performance extensively. The evaluation results show that PRINCE achieves good performances. To the best of our knowledge, PRINCE is the first differentially private mechanism for influence diffusion in online social networks.

40|$|International audienceDynamic {{carpooling}} (also {{known as}} instant or ad-hoc ridesharing) is {{a service that}} arranges one-time shared rides on very short notice. This type of carpooling generally makes use of three recent technological advances: (i) Navigation devices to determine a driver's route and arrange the shared ride; (ii) smartphones for a traveller to request a ride from wherever she happens to be; and (iii) social networks to establish trust between drivers and passengers. However, the mobiquitous environment in which dynamic carpooling is expected to operate, raises several privacy issues. Among all the personal identifiable information, learning the location of an individual {{is one of the}} greatest threats against her privacy. For instance, the spatio-temporal data of an individual can be used to infer the location of her home and workplace, to trace her movements and habits, to learn information about her centre of interests or even to detect a change from her usual behaviour. Therefore, preserving location privacy is a major issue to be able to leverage the possibilities offered by dynamic carpooling. In this paper we use the principles of privacy-by-design to integrate the <b>privacy</b> <b>aspect</b> in the design of dynamic carpooling, henceforth increasing its public (and political) acceptability and trust...|$|R
