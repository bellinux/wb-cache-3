40|$|A {{simple and}} mild on-line photo-oxidative {{decomposition}} method for the highly sensitive flow-injection spectrophotometric determination of total phosphorus in river and waste waters {{was developed for}} the first time by using low pressure mercury lamps. Organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> in sample solutions were injected into a carrier solution, which merged with the decomposition solution containing sulfuric acid and potassium peroxodisulfate. The solution components were decomposed oxidatively to orthophosphate while flowing in a photo-reactor. After the decomposition, orthophosphate was determined spectrophotometrically based on the formation of Molybdenum Blue. The photo-reactor consisted of two low pressure mercury lamps, a poly(terafluoroethylene) (PTFE) tubing and a reflection mirror. The PTFE tubing was wound directly around the mercury lamps, which were covered with reflection mirror. The detection limit for phosphorus was about 0. 001 mg l(- 1), and the sample throuphput was about 20 samples per hour for total phosphorus determination. By using the photo-reactor, most of the phosphorus compounds were decomposed completely, whereas some condensed phosphates were less susceptible to photo-oxidation. The analytical results for practical samples obtained by the proposed method showed a good correlation with those obtained by using a heat-oxidation method, which indicates that the content of the condensed phosphates difficult to be decomposed was very scarce in the practical samples...|$|R

40|$|Enzymes play a {{key role}} in {{nutrient}} cycling in the soil environment. In this work, four phosphatases of the soil environment were investigated. A study of the effect of metal ions and metal ion concentrations on inorganic pyrophosphatase activity in three NH(, 4) OAc-leached soils showed that seven of the metal ions tested promoted activity. The average efficiency of these metal ions in promoting pyrophosphatase in decreasing order was: Ca(2 ̆ 72 +) 3 ̆e Mg(2 ̆ 72 +) 3 ̆e Ba(2 ̆ 72 +) = Co(2 ̆ 72 +) 3 ̆e Ni(2 ̆ 72 +) 3 ̆e Zn(2 ̆ 72 +) 3 ̆e Mn(2 ̆ 72 +). Sodium ions and K(2 ̆ 7 +) did not affect pyrophosphatase activity and Cu(2 ̆ 72 +) and Fe(2 ̆ 72 +) decreased this activity. Optimum pyrophosphatase activity occurred at a Mg(2 ̆ 72 +) :PPi or Ca(2 ̆ 72 +) :PPi ratio of 1 : 1. Protection of pyrophosphatase in the NH(, 4) OAc-leached soils against heat inactivation by Mg(2 ̆ 72 +) and Ca(2 ̆ 72 +) was also observed;The rates of hydrolysis of seven organic and two <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> added to soils and incubated under aerobic or waterlogged conditions showed that monomethyl phosphate, (beta) -glycerophosphate, and (alpha) -D-glucose- 1 -phosphate were hydrolyzed at similar rates in the three soils used.

40|$|Hamsters {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of calcium glycerophosphate on dental caries. Within the 60 -day experimental period, cal-cium glycerophosphate significantly reduced caries when fed in the diet at levels of 1 %g and higher, and when applied topically at levels of 2 % and higher. The importance of dietary supplements of <b>inorganic</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> as cario-static agents was first suggested by Osborne, Noriskin, and Stazl in 1937. They observed that human tooth enamel was decalcified in vitro when incubated in the presence of re-fined flour and sucrose; however, decalcifica-tion did not occur when the incubation me-dium had been supplemented with organic phosphorus compounds. Based on chemical analyses, Osborne postulated that a protec-tive agent had been removed during the refining process of flour and sugar. The pro-tective agent was later identified as a phos-phate ion esterified to organic molecules. 2 Calcium glycerophosphate, an organic phos-phorus compound, seems to be especially well suited for supplementing diets with ad-ditional phosphorus; it is nontoxic, has a lengthy history for systemic administration in calcium and phosphorus deficiencies, and {{has been shown to be}} an effective anticaries agent when fed to laboratory animals. Many separate investigations have since demonstrated that increased levels of phos-phate in the diet reduce the severity of den-tal caries in laboratory animals.
