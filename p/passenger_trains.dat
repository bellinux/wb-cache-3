5|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>trains</b> connect from Suvalki, Hrodno and Lithuania to Warsaw and {{the rest}} of the European {{passenger}} network. Passenger services are provided by two rail service providers, PKP Intercity that provides intercity passengers trains (express, intercity, eurocity, hotel and TLK) and Przewozy Regionalne that operates only regional <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> financed by the voivodeship. <b>Passenger</b> <b>trains</b> are mostly run using electrical multiple units (on electrified lines) or rail buses.|$|E
5|$|The {{platforms}} {{are numbered}} 1 to 15 but <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> {{are confined to}} just eight tracks. Most platforms are numbered separately at each end, with odd numbers at the east end and even numbers at the west. Platform 2 is not signalled for <b>passenger</b> <b>trains,</b> {{and there is no}} platform 14.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July 1872, two <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> {{collided}} {{due to a}} pointsman's error. A few passenger {{were slightly}} injured.|$|E

The <b>Passenger</b> <b>train</b> service between Jasidih to Ambajora Sikaripara started on 30 June 2014 via Dumka railway station. The <b>Passenger</b> <b>train</b> service between Dumka to Rampurhat started on 4 June 2015 when a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> started operating from Dumka to Rampurhat. The <b>Passenger</b> <b>train</b> service between Dumka to Bhagalpur started on 28 September 2016 when a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> started operating from Hansdiha to Dumka.|$|R
50|$|On 16 November 1979, a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> was {{run into}} by another <b>passenger</b> <b>train.</b> Thirty-six people were injured.|$|R

5|$|By around 1900, {{there were}} {{between five and}} seven {{services}} operating daily along the Cheddar Valley Line, with a mixed mail train on Sundays. Traffic was to increase from 1901 {{with the opening of}} the Wrington Vale Light Railway. Although this line joined the Cheddar Valley Line at , most services continued to Yatton. In 1901 there were four <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> per day and one goods train, which increased to five <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> per day by 1903. The line was known for the transport of mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, {{the passing}} loop {{was used by}} one pair of <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> in the evening, with an extra down train (toward Amlwch) making seven down and six up trains per day. The railmotor train's {{services}} had grown to 24 single trips between Gaerwen/Holland Arms and Llangefni/Red Wharf Bay. The continuing shortages of World War I meant that in January 1917 many passenger services were to be cut to give more resources to the war effort. The railways were slow {{to recover from the}} wartime hardships, and in 1921 there were six <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> to and from Amlwch, and only 18 single trips by the motor train.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line trains, the Illawarra railway line carries interurban and freight traffic. The Cronulla branch {{line and the}} Eastern Suburbs Railway are exclusively used by <b>passenger</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 10 February 1946, a <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> crashed at , Hertfordshire {{due to a}} signalman's error. The {{wreckage}} fouled signal cables, {{giving a}} false clear to an express <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> which then ran into the wreckage. A third <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> then collided with the wreckage. Two people were killed.|$|R
50|$|On 21 October 1974, {{locomotive}} B202 was hauling {{an empty}} <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> when it ran away driverless from Connolly station and {{collided with a}} <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> at , County Meath, A third <b>passenger</b> <b>train,</b> hauled by locomotive B219 {{was struck by the}} wrecked trains.

50|$|Then {{a design}} becomes {{focused on the}} {{behavior}} of doors, brakes, and passengers, and how those objects (doors, brakes, etc.) are related and behave within the <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> domain. Other objects, that provide services used by the <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> domain, are modeled in other domains connected to the <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> domain.|$|R
5|$|On 17 August 1845, two <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> {{collided}} due {{to one of}} {{them having}} insufficient brakes and passing a signal at danger. Some passengers sustained slight injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} never served by <b>passenger</b> <b>trains,</b> but between 1914 and 1918 Norway Telecom (now Telenor) used {{the line for}} {{transporting}} steel when Tryvannstårnet was being constructed. Occasionally charter trips to Øvresetertjern for passengers were also arranged.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war there}} was limited {{resources}} for new rolling stocks and upgrades to the line. Multiple units gradually took over <b>passenger</b> <b>trains,</b> and by 1957, no <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> to Storlien were hauled by locomotives. That year Stavne–Leangen Line opened, allowing trains to bypass Trondheim Central Station. The new Di 3 diesel locomotives {{were put into}} service in 1961. The last steam engine {{was taken out of}} service in 1971. The introduction of the Di 3 forced an upgrade to the line to allow for an axle load of 18 tonnes. The opening of European Road E14 in the 1950s caused a reduction in shorter-haul passenger and freight. NSB subsequently cut passenger services to a single daily train, with a Di 3 hauling Swedish carriages through Meråker. Trains continuing along the Nordland Line continued to increase.|$|E

5|$|By 1870, a track {{had been}} added to the east of the station and two sidings {{had been added}} to the west; one of the western sidings was a bay {{platform}} for <b>passenger</b> <b>trains,</b> which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor. Interlocking signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.|$|E
5|$|From 3 June 1984, the {{day train}} {{was moved to}} run via Drammen. Until 1989, the Roa–Hønefoss Line had four daily round trips with a local train from Hønefoss via Roa to Oslo, {{normally}} a Class 65 or Class 67 unit. From 1989, this {{was reduced to a}} single round trip, with a morning train from Hønefoss to Oslo and a return in the afternoon. Eventually this was taken over by a Class 69 unit and by the late 1990s taken out of service. The Roa–Hønefoss Line remains a pure freight track for long-haul freight trains on the Bergen Line. After the opening of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station in 1989, <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> run via Drammen; however, the Roa–Hønefoss Line is used as a reserve line for <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> when the Drammen Line or Randsfjord Line is out of service.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, the New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer. That year, the {{railroad}} constructed a freight depot and steamboat wharf (likely {{also used for}} <b>passenger</b> <b>trains)</b> along Water Street. The depot burned on May 8, 1864, but was rebuilt on the same site.|$|E

5|$|King's Cross {{sustained}} {{no damage}} during World War I even though {{large amounts of}} high explosives were carried to the station in <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> during this time. Where possible, trains were parked in tunnels {{in the event of}} enemy aircraft overhead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>trains</b> {{generally}} {{served the}} station only on weekdays, although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays. While {{the village of}} Westcott was small, the proximity of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger and goods traffic.|$|E
5|$|The July 1924 {{timetable}} showed eight <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> {{each way}} between Amlwch and Gaerwen, with the Red Wharf Bay railmotor operating to Llangefni {{three times a}} day. The extra Thursday service to Llangefni for the market was still included. By the summer of 1929, there were eight trains from Gaerwen to Amlwch, and seven in the other direction. One train to and from Amlwch no longer ran Thursdays, replaced with a second two return trip to Llangefni, operated by the railmotor. The loop at Llangwyllog now saw three pairs of <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> passing on weekdays, while the daily freight train would be shunted into sidings at Llangefni and Llanerchymedd to make way. Motor train services were back up to 24 single trips a day, including the Red Wharf Bay services.|$|E

From that point on, {{the men of the}} 5th and the federal troops took turns guarding the station.|$|E
5|$|Although the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre's steam trains {{run on the}} sidings {{which were}} {{disconnected}} from the network in 1967, the station still has a working railway line passing through it, used for occasional special <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre. Regular freight trains are mainly landfill trains from waste transfer depots in Greater London to the former brick pits at Calvert.|$|E
40|$|The <b>{{passenger}}</b> <b>train</b> sets is {{the carrier}} of railway passenger transport production and reasonable {{use of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> sets {{is one of the}} key goals of railway transportation plan. In order to improve the operation efficiency of <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> sets, optimization model of railway <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> sets assignment have been built to minimize the non-production staying time of <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> sets at <b>passenger</b> station based on established train diagram and established configuration of train sets system. On that basis, considering that the parameters of simulated Annealing Algorithm (SA) directly affect the efficiency and precision of solving, SA parameters is optimized based on nested partitions, then improved simulated annealing algorithm (ISA) is designed to solve this model. Finally, a case study has been carried out taking Zhengzhou railway station of china as an example in order to testify validity of this model and its algorithm by using calculating and comparing analysis and further solved practical problems is analyzed. The results show that the number of <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> sets required and carriage staying time at passenger station are reduced and this model and its algorithm can be used to optimize railway <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> sets assignment to improve efficiency of railway <b>passenger</b> <b>train</b> sets assignment...|$|R
