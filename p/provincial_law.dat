5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error. It cited several breaches of <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> regarding {{the operation of}} commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive {{if they have been}} working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log book keeping, and the lack of a contingency plan in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.|$|E

50|$|As Swedish {{evolved from}} Old Norse in the 13th century, the Swedish {{literature}} {{began to take}} form as an independent body of literature. The earliest form of an independent Swedish language is called Old Swedish, and it {{was used in the}} years 1225 to 1526. The period was initiated by the first <b>provincial</b> <b>laws.</b> In them, the runic Futhark was almost totally replaced by the Latin alphabet. The <b>provincial</b> <b>laws</b> are believed to have had a solid centuries-old foundation that was kept alive by oral tradition until they were written down. Compared to the Christianity-influenced Swedish literature during the ensuing centuries, the <b>provincial</b> <b>laws</b> are described as having a touch of the ancient folkhistory; of tradition and age.|$|R

25|$|As Minister of Mines, {{her first}} {{significant}} {{piece of legislation}} was a change to the Canada Labour Code, placing federally-regulated mines in Ontario under the stricter provincial health and safety laws by adopting the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act as federal law. The issue had long been championed in particular by uranium miners in Elliot Lake {{after a number of}} incidents in which workers had requested exemption under the <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> from unsafe duties for which the federal law did not offer protection, but the workers criticized the process Erola used as an ineffective one that was likely to be challenged in the courts by mining companies. The change also permitted women, who had previously been barred from working underground in mines by federal regulation even though the <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> permitted them, to work underground for the first time.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Egale Canada {{presented}} Jaime Watt, {{a political}} strategist {{in the government}} of former Premier of Ontario Mike Harris, with its inaugural Leadership Award in honour of his role in supporting the <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> that granted common-law marriage rights to same-sex couples. The decision was denounced by some LGBT activists because of Watt's role in some other government policies that had been unpopular within the gay community.|$|E

The Klein government increasingly utilized CAPS, the {{precursor to the}} Sheriffs Branch, for special <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> enforcement duties instead of the RCMP. In 2006, CAPS was renamed and the newly christened Sheriffs Branch was expanded rapidly to take on assignments that previously were {{the purview of the}} RCMP, the provincial policing authority.|$|E

While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards). Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.|$|E
25|$|What tribunals {{all have}} in common is that they are created by statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by <b>provincial</b> <b>law.</b> There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E

The civil code's authority over <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> improved the inconsistent existing legislation throughout {{the country at the}} time. This unity and coherence would bring two important benefits: it would facilitate both the people's knowledge about the law, as well as its application by judges, the legislation would also strengthen the political independence of the country, through legislative independence and national unity.|$|E
25|$|Vacancies in {{a council}} seat may be filled {{in one of}} two ways, either by the holding of a {{by-election}} or through direct appointment of an interim councillor chosen by the council in an internal vote. Normally the council is allowed to decide which process to follow in each individual case; however, if the vacancy occurs after March 31 in the year of a regularly scheduled municipal election, then the vacancy must be filled by direct appointment as <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> prohibits the holding of a by-election in the final six months of a council term.|$|E
25|$|The new {{government}} called the Legislature back in session in late 2003, and passed {{a series of}} bills relating to its election promises. The government brought in auto insurance reforms (including a price cap), fixed election dates, rolled-back a series of corporate and personal tax cuts which had been scheduled for 2004, passed legislation which enshrined publicly funded Medicare into <b>provincial</b> <b>law,</b> hired more meat and water inspectors, opened up the provincially owned electricity companies to Freedom of Information laws and enacted a ban on partisan government advertising.|$|E

25|$|Automatic {{accreditation}} of graduates from proposed faculty {{were approved by}} most of the <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> societies across Canada, except The Law Society of Upper Canada (Ontario) and the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society. On June 11, 2014, 3,210 of the Law Society of British Columbia's 13,000 members voted in support of a resolution to reverse its decision to grant the faculty accreditation and requested that the province revoke its {{accreditation of}} the law program because of the view that it discriminates against unmarried couples and homosexual individuals. 968 members voted against with 8,822 not registering a vote. On September 26, 2014 the governing members of the Law Society decided to hold a binding referendum of their membership to determine whether to revoke Trinity Western's accreditation.|$|E
25|$|Västergötland {{received}} much early influence from the British Isles and {{is generally considered}} to be the bridgehead of Christianity's advance into Sweden. Recent excavations at Varnhem suggest that at least its central parts were Christian in the 9th century. Around 1000, King Olof Skötkonung is held to have received baptism in Husaby, near lake Vänern. However, the Christianization was met with heavy opposition in the rest of his kingdom, and so Olof had to restrict the Christian activities to Västergötland. The Christian faith spread, {{and by the time the}} <b>provincial</b> <b>law</b> Västgötalagen was written in the 13th century, Västergötland had 517 churches. The seat of the area’s diocese seems to originally have been Husaby, but since 1150 the city of Skara (just some 20 kilometers south) held that distinction.|$|E
25|$|Saskatchewan's Lieutenant Governors {{have filled}} {{the office of}} Visitor to the University of Saskatchewan since its establishment. Former Lieutenant Governor Sir Richard Lake was famously called upon to assume the visitor's role in the {{so-called}} Crisis of 1919. Four {{senior members of the}} Board of Governors had been dismissed after three among them abstained from a vote of confidence in university president Walter Murray. Murray was under scrutiny for his maintenance of University finances. The public and press clamoured for an explanation, and, in accordance with <b>provincial</b> <b>law,</b> Lake held a series of hearings through the office of the King’s Bench. His findings, delivered in April 1920, vindicated the dismissals, saying they were “regular, proper and {{in the best interest of}} the university.” In other words, their acts of disloyalty were enough to cost them their jobs.|$|E

As {{constitutional}} scholar Peter Hogg writes, [...] "Hunting on a reserve is such a significant element of traditional Indian ways that it should probably be free of provincial regulation." [...] He points to R. v. Jim to back this up. As for hunting outside reserves, the Supreme Court of Canada case Kruger and al. v. The Queen (1978) suggested this was not [...] "Indianness," [...] whereas Dick v. The Queen (1985) suggested it was.|$|R
