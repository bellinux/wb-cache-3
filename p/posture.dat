5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} {{in western}} jackdaw flocks {{is determined by}} supplanting, fighting, and threat displays—several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up <b>posture,</b> the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the <b>posture</b> is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down <b>posture</b> is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this <b>posture</b> until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat <b>posture,</b> a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat <b>posture,</b> the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E

5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal <b>posture,</b> leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal <b>posture.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Decerebrate <b>posturing</b> {{indicates}} {{brain stem}} damage, specifically damage {{below the level}} of the red nucleus (e.g. mid-collicular lesion). It is exhibited by people with lesions or compression in the midbrain and lesions in the cerebellum. Decerebrate <b>posturing</b> is commonly seen in pontine strokes. A patient with decorticate <b>posturing</b> may begin to show decerebrate <b>posturing,</b> or may go from one form of <b>posturing</b> to the other. [...] Progression from decorticate <b>posturing</b> to decerebrate <b>posturing</b> is often indicative of uncal (transtentorial) or tonsilar brain herniation. Activation of gamma motor neurons is thought to be important in decerebrate rigidity due to studies in animals showing that dorsal root transection eliminates decerebrate rigidity symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{abnormal}} <b>posturing</b> are decorticate <b>posturing,</b> with the arms flexed over the chest; decerebrate <b>posturing,</b> with the arms extended at the sides; and opisthotonus, {{in which the}} head and back are arched backward.|$|R
5|$|Red fox body {{language}} consists of {{movements of the}} ears, tail and <b>postures,</b> with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. <b>Postures</b> {{can be divided into}} aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some <b>postures</b> may blend the two together.|$|R
5|$|Athetosis – Athetosis is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical <b>posture</b> (e.g. cerebral palsy, choreoathetosis).|$|E
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb <b>posture</b> and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal <b>posture</b> impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral <b>posture</b> of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert <b>posture,</b> and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting <b>posture.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tonic <b>posturing</b> (see {{abnormal}} <b>posturing)</b> preceding convulsion {{has been}} observed in sports injuries {{at the moment of}} impact where extension and flexion of opposite arms occur despite body position or gravity. The fencing response emerges from the separation of tonic <b>posturing</b> from convulsion and refines the tonic <b>posturing</b> phase as an immediate forearm motor response to indicate injury force magnitude and location.|$|R

50|$|The body {{language}} of dogs are the <b>postures</b> {{and behaviors of}} dogs indicate their emotions and intentions. In some instances, the recognition of specific <b>postures</b> and behaviors can be learned. The <b>postures</b> of dogs can indicate acceptance and aggression.|$|R
5|$|Other {{recognized}} motor {{signs and}} symptoms include gait and <b>posture</b> disturbances such as festination (rapid shuffling steps and a forward-flexed <b>posture</b> when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck to the floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
5|$|Practically {{every imaginable}} <b>posture</b> has been {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, plantigrade feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, kangaroo-like hopping, {{a change of heart}} for which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian <b>posture.</b> Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an erect limb <b>posture</b> that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presence}} of abnormal <b>posturing</b> indicates a severe medical emergency requiring immediate medical attention. Decerebrate and decorticate <b>posturing</b> are {{strongly associated with}} poor outcome {{in a variety of}} conditions. For example, near-drowning victims that display decerebrate or decorticate <b>posturing</b> have worse outcomes than those that do not. [...] Changes in the condition of the patient may cause him or her to alternate between different types of <b>posturing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that our perception of the human body differs from that of inanimate objects. This study investigated whether the visual perception of the human body differs from that of other animate bodies and, if so, whether that difference could be attributed to visual experience and/or embodied experience. To dissociate differential effects of these two types of expertise, inversion effects (recognition of inverted stimuli is slower and less accurate than recognition of upright stimuli) were compared for two types of bodies in <b>postures</b> that varied in typicality: humans in human <b>postures</b> (human-typical), humans in dog <b>postures</b> (human-atypical), dogs in dog <b>postures</b> (dog-typical), and dogs in human <b>postures</b> (dog-atypical). Inversion disrupts global configural processing. Relative changes in the size and presence of inversion effects reflect changes in visual processing. Both visual and embodiment expertise predict larger inversion effects for human over dog <b>postures</b> because we see humans more and we have experience producing human <b>postures.</b> However, our design that crosses body type and typicality leads to distinct predictions for visual and embodied experience. Visual expertise predicts an interaction between typicality and orientation: greater inversion effects should be found for typical over atypical <b>postures</b> regardless of body type. Alternatively, embodiment expertise predicts a body, typicality, and orientation interaction: larger inversion effects should be found for all human <b>postures</b> but only for atypical dog <b>postures</b> because humans can map their bodily experience onto these <b>postures.</b> Accuracy data supported embodiment expertise with the three-way interaction. However, response-time data supported contributions of visual expertise with larger inversion effects for typical over atypical <b>postures.</b> Thus, both types of expertise affect the visual perception of bodie...|$|R
40|$|Responding to others’ {{emotional}} body expressions is {{an essential}} social skill in humans. Adults readily detect emotions from body <b>postures,</b> but {{it is unclear whether}} infants are sensitive to emotional body <b>postures.</b> We examined 8 -month-old infants’ brain responses to emotional body <b>postures</b> by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) to happy and fearful bodies. Our results revealed two emotion-sensitive ERP components: body <b>postures</b> evoked an early N 290 at occipital electrodes and a later Nc at fronto-central electrodes that were enhanced in response to fearful (relative to happy) expressions. These findings demonstrate that, (a) 8 -month-old infants discriminate between static emotional body <b>postures,</b> and (b) similar to infant emotional face perception, the sensitivity to emotional body <b>postures</b> is reflected in early perceptual (N 290) and later attentional (Nc) neural processes. This provides evidence for an early developmental emergence of the neural processes involved in the discrimination of emotional body <b>postures...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Abnormal motor <b>posturing</b> {{is often}} {{observed}} {{in children with}} cerebral malaria, but the aetiology and pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study examined the risk factors and outcome of <b>posturing</b> in Kenyan children with cerebral malaria. METHODS: Records of children admitted to Kilifi district hospital with cerebral malaria from January, 1999 through December, 2001 were reviewed for <b>posturing</b> occurring on or after admission. The clinical characteristics, features of raised intracranial pressure, number of seizures and biochemical changes in patients that developed <b>posturing</b> was compared to patients who did not. RESULTS: Of the 417 children with complete records, 163 (39. 1 %) had posturing: 85 on admission and 78 after admission to hospital. Decorticate <b>posturing</b> occurred in 80, decerebrate in 61 and opisthotonic <b>posturing</b> in 22 patients. <b>Posturing</b> was associated with age > or = 3 years (48. 1 vs 35. 8 %, p = 0. 01) and features of raised intracranial pressure on funduscopy (adjusted OR 2. 1 95 %CI 1. 2 - 3. 7, p = 0. 009) but not other markers of severity of disease. Unlike decorticate <b>posturing,</b> decerebrate (adjusted OR 1. 9 95 %CI 1. 0 - 3. 5) and opisthotonic <b>posturing</b> (adjusted OR 2. 9 95 %CI 1. 0 - 8. 1) were, in addition, independently associated with recurrence of seizures after admission. Opisthotonus was also associated with severe metabolic acidosis (OR 4. 2 95 %CI 3. 2 - 5. 6, p < 0. 001). Thirty one patients with <b>posturing</b> died. Of these, 19 (61. 3 %) had features suggestive of transtentorial herniation. Mortality and neurological deficits on discharge were greatest in those developing <b>posturing</b> after admission. CONCLUSION: Abnormal motor <b>posturing</b> is a common feature of cerebral malaria in children. It is associated with features of raised intracranial pressure and recurrence of seizures, although intracranial hypertension may be the primary cause...|$|R

30|$|These <b>postures</b> {{have been}} chosen to be easily {{performed}} by any person. They differ from the sign language which aims at easing lip reading. To afford a large dictionary, and thereby numerous functionalities of the human-machine interface, the dictionary must include a number of <b>postures</b> which is large enough.

Some <b>postures</b> permit to test the discrimination performances of the proposed and comparative methods: they are visually very close, such as <b>postures</b> 4 and 5, as well as <b>postures</b> 8 and 9. The images of the database were obtained as follows: an expert user shoots a movie containing the 11 <b>postures.</b> Then the frames of the video are split to get the images in the RGB color space. These images compound the learning set. Other users which are not the expert user shoot a movie containing the 11 <b>postures.</b> The same process as for the learning database is adopted to get a set of images; these images compound the test set. To generate the learning database and the test set, a simple setup involving a camera is used.|$|R
