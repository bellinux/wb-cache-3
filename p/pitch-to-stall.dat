40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to design, analyze, manufacture, and test a {{mechanical}} passive pitch mechanism for a small horizontal axis wind turbine. Several pitching concepts were investigated in the wind industry and related fields before ultimately deciding on a centrifugal governor design concept in a <b>pitch-to-stall</b> configuration. Inertial and aerodynamic models were developed in order to predict steady-state performance and an optimization routine was created to optimize the pitch mechanism configuration subject to manufacturing constraints. Dynamic modeling in HAWC 2 validated the steady-state design code, aeroelastic simulations were performed in turbulent wind conditions to simulate the pitch system dynamics. Physical testing of the full turbine was not completed, however the hub sub-assembly was tested on its own to validate the passive pitch characteristics and showed good agreement with the simulation tools developed. The turbine was run in the TU Delft open-jet wind tunnel, but lack of instrumentation meant little data could be collected. Video evidence was collected which showed the pitch system clearly activating at high rotor speeds as expected. In addition to the pitch system design, a new blade structural design was completed with the BECAS design tool using glass fibre instead of the carbon-Kevlar hybrid material used last year.
