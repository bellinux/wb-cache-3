50|$|A {{revolving}} center, {{also known}} as a live center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a <b>plain</b> <b>center</b> placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|E
5000|$|The Market Place covers {{an area of}} 165 acre [...] and {{has more}} than 120 stores, restaurants, cafes and theaters. Designed by Mexican {{architect}} Ricardo Legorreta, it consists of monumental but extremely simplified cubic forms, with anchor stores marked by massive towers roughly 70 ft high displaying the store name. The center is also unique in that all the store signs are displayed in neon. The overall design operates {{on the idea that}} center's tenants add most of the color and character to the otherwise <b>plain</b> <b>center,</b> a concept that had previously (though unsuccessfully) been attempted with Britain's Tricorn Centre. The buildings are arranged in a ring around a large central series of parking lots and fast-food restaurants. The center on the whole has a [...] "desert" [...] look to it, with parking lots shaded under groves of date palms, and extensive rock landscaping {{around the perimeter of the}} center. The parking lots are illuminated by arrays of xenon floodlights set inside the peaks of 100 ft high towers. The buildings themselves are uniformly surfaced in bright orange, purple, and pink stucco.|$|E
