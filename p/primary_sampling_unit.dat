In selecting Primary Sampling Units, if a <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> that was in the 1990 design is reselected in 2000, then the experienced field representative in that <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> can remain working on the survey.

This will help reduce nonsampling errors caused by the inexperience of newly hired field representatives and the costs to train them.

40|$|In {{repeated}} surveys, {{the usual}} survey estimator of a characteristic {{can be represented}} as {{the sum of the}} true value and a measurement error, where the measurement error is due to sampling. If the <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> stay in the survey for a fixed finite number of periods, then the sequence of sampling errors, [̆subscript]t, is a moving average. Assuming that the sequence of true values, [subscript]t is a realization of a time series, the objective of estimating the covariance structure of the series [subscript]t is considered;For the Current Population Survey, a components-of-variance model for the sampling error is estimated. Three components of variance are identified. These are a replicate component that is due to variation between <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>units,</b> a permanent component associated with rotation groups within <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>units,</b> and a transient component associated with rotation groups within <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>units.</b> The replicate component and the permanent rotation group effects are assumed to be constant over time. The transient rotation group effect is assumed to be a third order autoregressive process.

Given the covariance function of [̆subscript]t, two estimation procedures of the structure of [subscript]t are proposed and applied to data from the Current Population Survey.

40|$|Abstract Background Cluster sample study {{designs are}} cost effective, however cluster samples violate the simple random sample {{assumption}} of independence of observations. Failure {{to account for}} the intra-cluster correlation of observations when sampling through clusters may lead to an under-powered study. Researchers therefore need estimates of intra-cluster correlation for a range of outcomes to calculate sample size. We report intra-cluster correlation coefficients observed within a large-scale cross-sectional study of general practice in Australia, where the general practitioner (GP) was the <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> and the patient encounter was the unit of inference. Methods Each year the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) study recruits a random sample of approximately 1, 000 GPs across Australia. Each GP completes details of 100 consecutive patient encounters. Intra-cluster correlation coefficients were estimated for patient demographics, morbidity managed and treatments received. Intra-cluster correlation coefficients were estimated for descriptive outcomes and for associations between outcomes and predictors and were compared across two independent samples of GPs drawn three years apart. Results Between April 1999 and March 2000, a random sample of 1, 047 Australian general practitioners recorded details of 104, 700 patient encounters. Intra-cluster correlation coefficients for patient demographics ranged from 0. 055 for patient sex to 0. 451 for language spoken at home. Intra-cluster correlations for morbidity variables ranged from 0. 005 for the management of eye problems to 0. 059 for management of psychological problems. Intra-cluster correlation for the association between two variables was smaller than the descriptive intra-cluster correlation of each variable. When compared with the April 2002 to March 2003 sample (1, 008 GPs) the estimated intra-cluster correlation coefficients were found to be consistent across samples. Conclusions The demonstrated precision and reliability of the estimated intra-cluster correlations indicate that these coefficients will be useful for calculating sample sizes in future general practice surveys that use the GP as the <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>unit.</b> </p...|$|E

However, many ecosystem maps in tropical countries consist of discrete polygons containing information on various ecosystem properties such as vegetation cover, soil, climate, geomorphology and biodiversity.
