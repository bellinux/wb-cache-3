25|$|As {{part of his}} bachelor's {{degree in}} Law and Arabic, Nawaz spent a {{compulsory}} year abroad in Egypt, arriving just one day before the 9/11 attacks took place. Since political Islamist organisations like Hizb ut-Tahrir were banned in Egypt, Nawaz was arrested and interrogated in Alexandria by the Egyptian security agency Aman al-Dawlah. Like most foreign prisoners, he was not subjected to torture, but faced the threat of torture during interrogation and witnessed other prisoners being tortured. He was then transferred with fellow foreign prisoners, including Ian Nisbet and Reza Pankhurst, to Mazrah Tora prison. There, he was put on trial. Represented by Sadiq Khan, {{he was sentenced to}} five years' imprisonment. During the trial, he was adopted by Amnesty International as a <b>prisoner</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> who helped to secure his return to London.|$|E

25|$|In November 2008, U Gambira, {{a leader}} of the All Burma Monks' Alliance, was {{sentence}}d to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years of which will be hard labour; other charges against him are still pending. In early 2009, his sentence was reduced to 63 years. His sentence was protested by Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International considers him a <b>prisoner</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Both groups called for his immediate release. Gambira was released during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 as part of the 2011–2012 Burmese political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012, and as of 11 December 2012, was released on bail.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{attacks by}} ASALA {{prompted}} Turkey to accuse Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding ASALA. Although they publicly distanced themselves from ASALA, Turkey's Armenian community {{came under attack}} by Turkish nationalists {{in reaction to the}} group's actions. This became apparent after the assassination of Ahmet Benler on October 12, 1979 by Armenian militants in the Hague. The reaction to the attack led to the bombing of the church of the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate in Istanbul on October 19 in retaliation. In 1980, the Turkish government arrested Armenian priest Fr. Manuel Yergatian at the Istanbul airport for the alleged possession of maps that indicated Armenian territory within modern-day Turkey and was sentenced to 14 years in prison for possible ties with ASALA. Amnesty International adopted him as a <b>prisoner</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> concluding that the evidence against him was baseless. According to Tessa Hofmann, Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, 2017, the European Parliament {{condemned}} {{the wave of}} killings in the Philippines and called for De Lima's release. It expressed serious concerns that the offences Senator De Lima {{has been charged with}} are almost entirely fabricated. Amnesty International regards de Lima as a <b>prisoner</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Despite her imprisonment, de Lima continues to oppose the policies of Duterte and remains a member of the Philippine Senate and the Liberal Party. She was part of the debate regarding martial law. In late July 2017, de Lima was visted by members of the European Parliament and the Liberal International. She was unable to vote against the martial law extension because of her detention. She petitioned her release but the Supreme Court rejected her request, and later slapped her with the affirmation of the release of numerous prisoners guilty of graft or corruption during the previous administrations. By October 2017, de Lima released numerous statements while in prison condemning the death toll of the Philippine Drug War which has increased to 14,000 Filipino deaths, where a huge number were children, infants, and teenagers. In November 2017, de Lima was awarded the Prize for Freedom by Liberal International, becoming the second Filipino to receive the prestigious award after Corazon Aquino.|$|E
