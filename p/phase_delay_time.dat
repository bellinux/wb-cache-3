Our system {{consists of a}} circular loop connected to a single wire of semi-infinite length {{in the presence of}} Aharonov-Bohm flux. We calculate the analytical expression for the saturated delay time. This saturated delay time is independent of Aharonov- Bohm flux and the width of the opaque barrier thereby generalizing the Hartman effect. This effect implies superluminal group velocities as a consequence. We also briefly discuss the concept called "space collapse or space destroyer". Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

In order to remove erroneous solutions and outliers, two inspections were made.

Second, a moving average filter with a window size of 21 time steps (corresponding to approximately 3.5 h) was applied to each time series. From {{the difference between the}} original time series and the filtered time series, observations outside of 3 σ were considered as outliers and removed.

40|$|Based {{upon the}} nonequilibrium Green's {{function}} formalism, {{we present a}} time-dependent Landauer approach to transport through a mesoscopic system under an ac bias voltage. The system is modeled as an elastic scatterer coupled to large electron reservoirs through perfect conducting wires (leads). The chemical potentials of the reservoirs are driven apart by the bias and, consequently, current flows through the leads from one reservoir to another. We examine the nonequilibrium statistical processes of electrons in the leads. The electronic waves are quantized {{on the basis of}} orthonormal wave packets moving along the leads, scattered by the scatterer, and coupled to the reservoirs. The time for an electron to traverse the leads between the source and the drain reservoirs plus the <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> caused by the scatterer is found to be the relevant time scale in the time-dependent transport. The frequency dependence of the admittance is fully investigated. 73. 40., 72. 10. Bg, 85. 30. De Ty [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In the past, {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} tunneling time through simple rectangular barrier has been obtained by various theoretical approaches including the dwell time, the <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> the Larmor clock time and also using {{the numerical analysis}} of wave packets. The agreement among these approaches over a range of incident electron energy is far from satisfactory. In this manuscript, analytical expressions for the tunneling time are derived based on the group velocity approach (referred hereafter as the average particle time, τAPT) for single and double rectangular potential barriers under zero bias. The results of the single barrier case, including the limiting value of the tunneling time for various energy limits, are compared with these previous tunneling time calculations. The τAPT results provide physically meaningful tunneling times for zero and infinite incident energy limits of the electron. The τAPT for the double barrier structure is computed from the analytical solution {{as a function of}} the incident energy of the electron for two experimentally studied resonant tunneling structures.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{collaborative}} venture between operational researchers and civil engineers over 3 years. The main objectives were to collect and publish data on the observed rates of deterioration of particular defect types in {{a large number of}} concrete bridges, and to develop predictive mathematical models that relate inspection frequency to maintenance costs. The motivation was in part associated with the prototype modelling paper for inspection practices of major concrete structures, Christer (1988). The paper reports on the analysis of data collected and the estimation of deterioration using the concept of delay time. The two <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> model is extended to an extra phase in order to model the process of cracking and spalling in concrete. Maximum likelihood techniques are used to estimate modelling parameters and an appropriate test of fit is carried out.

The cost model is applied first to an element, and then to an aggregate number of component types to produce a cost model for maintenance of a bridge or set of bridges...|$|E

Aims. To evaluate use of multislice spiral computed tomography in preoperative assessment of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma using volume-rendering as image reconstruction algorithm. Patients. A total of 27 patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma underwent multislice spiral computed tomography examination. Methods. All studies were performed on a multislice computed tomography scanner with the following parameters: slice collimation, I mm; slice thickness, 1. 25 mm; reconstruction interval, I mm; scan time, 22 - 25 sec; mAs, 165. Scans were acquired with a biphasic technique with a 30 -sec (pancreatic phase) and a 70 -sec (portal venous <b>phase)</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> after start of contrast material injection.

Positive predictive values for resectability and unresectability were 80 % and 93. 3 %, respectively. Three-dimensional volume-rendered images improved diagnostic confidence in the depiction of major vascular structures.

40|$|The {{spectra of}} tsunamis {{observed}} on a continental shelf {{are closely related}} to the spectra of water level fluctuations in ordinary days with the period of 10 to 100 minutes, the so-called back-ground spectra. Therefore, the nature of back-ground oscillations on the shelf in the vicinity of Enoshima Island, Miyagi Prefecture, where a tsunami observatory is located, has been investigated. Theoretical trapped and leaky modes of oscillations were computed for the shelf near Miyagi-Enoshima and also the records of the back-ground oscillations sampled from the data through the year in 1965 were examined by means of the Fourier analysis. The Fourier spectrum averaged through a year coincided fairly well with the theoretical spectrum of the leaky mode for the constant spectral input offshore, particularly in the period band shorter than about 40 minutes. In the periods longer than about 50 minutes, the spectral intensity of the back-ground is much larger than the theoretical spectrum. There is a possibility that the incoming waves which excite back-ground oscillations may be more intensive in the longer period band. Another possibility is the contribution of the trapped waves for this period band. Very often the <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> obtained from the phase angle of the Fourier spectrum coincides fairly well with the one derived from the calculated dispersion curve on the assumption that waves start from a localized source with the same phase for all frequency. This suggests the existence of edge waves.

The {{phase time}} in quantum {{tunneling}} can be disentangled into a dwell time plus a term arising {{due to the}} interference of the reflected and incident waves {{in front of the}} barrier.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on thermoregulatory {{responses}} to exercise in women during follicular (F) and luteal (L) phase of the menstrual cycle. Ten subjects performed a graded bicycle exercise in a thermoneutral environment (23 oC, 52 - 60 % relative humidity). Women were tested after consuming, for 3 days, a control diet (C: 60 % carbohydrates, 20 % fat, 20 % protein) and after that a low-carbohydrate diet (LCHO: 50 % fat, 35 % protein and 5 % carbohydrates), in each phase of the menstrual cycle. Tympanic temperature (Tty), mean skin temperature (Tsk), electrical skin resistance (ESR), oxygen uptake (VO 2), heart rate (HR) as well as blood β-hydroxybutyrate acid (β-HB), glucose (Glu) and lactate (LA) concentrations were measured. On the basis of ESR, dynamics of sweating was estimated. No differences in Tty and Tsk were found between the C and LCHO during exercise tests. However, Tty was significantly higher during L than F <b>phase.</b> <b>Delay</b> <b>time</b> for sweating was shorter after LCHO (F: 10. 8 vs 9. 4 min, P< 0. 05, L: 9. 9 vs 9. 3 N. S.), but temperature threshold for this reaction was unchanged (L: 37. 22 vs 37. 37 and F: 36. 91 vs 36. 94 oC). Sweating sensitivity was greater after LCHO during both F and L. Resting blood Glu and LA concentrations were similar in women after C and LCHO diet. Before exercise β-HB level was F: 0. 45, L: 0. 35 mM after LCHO and F: 0. 08, L: 0. 09 mM after C diet (P< 0. 05), respectively. At rest and during exercise HR was significantly higher after LCHO diet in women during F phase. In submaximal exercise loads VO 2 after LCHO diet were significantly higher than after C diet in all women. It was concluded that the low-carbohydrate diet ingested by young women in both phases of the menstrual cycle have no effect on body temperature, however, it affects heat dissipation mechanism during exercise...|$|E
