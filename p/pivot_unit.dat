40|$|On the Latvian railway, {{derailments}} of {{freight cars}} {{take place in}} the course of shunting work on marshalling yards. A number of factors during shunting work on marshalling yards may contribute to the derailments of rolling stock: longitudinal dynamics during braking of cars with the turned off brakes by locomotive, hauling down cars from a marshalling hill with braking position controlled by an operator, dry internal rails in curves, absence of greasing in the <b>pivot</b> <b>unit</b> of freight bogies. At present, measures allowing elimination of the car derailments during shunting work are developed. During the period between repairs, the abutment unit of freight car often works in conditions of dry friction. Our observations suggest {{that at the time of}} taking a car into repair, there is often an absence of greasing between trail bearing and center plate of the abutment, and a presence of sandy dust. It increases a friction and, together with high contact pressures and dynamic influence, hinders the turn of bogie at motion of car. In this paper, the results of studying the resisting moment in the abutment to turning of bogie is reported. The study was conducted on the basis of freight bogie of type 18 - 100; the body was leant on the center plate unit of the abutment, on the center plate unit, and on the sliders. Experiments were conducted, with the use of greasing and at the dry friction of center plate unit...|$|E
50|$|On the Union Garratts, {{as on the}} Modified Fairlies, {{the frames}} were prone to metal fatigue and cracking, {{brought about by the}} long frame {{overhang}} at the rear beyond the engine <b>unit</b> <b>pivot</b> centre.

50|$|The {{faces of}} the {{speedometer}} and tachometer were changed from a blue background to brown to match {{the appearance of the}} instruments on the GS models. There was also a change in the plastic used as lens because it no longer developed serious opacity and cracks after long exposure to sunlight. The instruments did not get the then-unique rose-colored backlighting that the GS models had. The front brake caliper was changed to a <b>pivoting</b> <b>unit</b> made by Asco rather than the fixed Tokico caliper that had been supplied from the introduction of the disc brake system. The GT and GS series were sold side by side during this one year overlap. This was the last MY for GT550 production. This MY sales were ~6,000+ making this the rarest of all the 550 models.|$|R
5000|$|The sandboxes, {{which were}} {{mounted on the}} bogie frames, were {{ineffective}} and required much too complicated gearing {{due to the fact}} that the engine <b>units</b> <b>pivoted.</b> It was suggested that sandboxes mounted on top of the smokeboxes would require much simpler gearing.|$|R
2500|$|To {{allow for}} the tight curves, {{including}} [...] radius bends with [...] superelevation without any intermediate tangent and the steep, twisting nature of the line, the front engine <b>unit's</b> <b>pivot</b> bearing was spherical, with its alignment controlled by sprung rollers.

50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, a 0-6-6-0 wheel arrangement refers to a locomotive with two engine units mounted under a rigid locomotive frame, with the front engine <b>unit</b> <b>pivoting</b> and each engine unit with six coupled driving wheels without any leading or trailing wheels. The wheel arrangement was mostly used to describe Mallet locomotive types.|$|R

50|$|The Union Garratt was {{a hybrid}} locomotive, part Garratt and part Modified Fairlie, {{designed}} and built for the SAR by Maffei in Munich, Germany. The {{front end of the}} locomotive was of a typical Garratt arrangement, with a water tank mounted on the front engine unit’s frame, while the rear end was constructed in the Modified Fairlie fashion, with the coal bunker mounted on a rigid extension of the locomotive’s main frame and with the <b>pivoting</b> rear engine <b>unit</b> positioned beneath the coal bunker.|$|R

5000|$|The Fairlie {{locomotive}} {{was invented}} by a Scottish engineer, Robert Francis Fairlie, and patented on 12 May 1864. In general appearance, the locomotive {{is reminiscent of the}} German-built Zwillinge (twins) of 1898, which saw service on the narrow gauge lines in German South West Africa and other German territories. However, while the Zwillinge were pairs of individual locomotives which were semi-permanently coupled back-to-back, the Double Fairlie was a single [...] "two-faced" [...] locomotive with either a double-ended boiler or two separate boilers and with smokeboxes at each end, a central firebox and a central cab, all mounted on one rigid frame. It ran on two <b>pivoting</b> engine <b>units</b> or powered bogies, similar to those of a Garratt locomotive, with the cylinders on each engine unit at the respective locomotive ends. Couplers, buffers and, where they were in use, cowcatchers were mounted on the engine unit bogies so that they could more accurately follow the curvature of the track.|$|R
50|$|The Modified Fairlies and the Union Garratt {{variations}} {{of it were}} not successful and they suffered from the same shortcomings. On the Union Garratt, as on the Modified Fairlie, the frame was also prone to metal fatigue and cracking {{brought about by the}} long frame overhang at the rear beyond the engine <b>unit's</b> <b>pivot</b> centre. The overhang, laden with the coal bunker of which more than 80% extended beyond the rear pivot centre, was subjected to severe vertical vibration while the locomotive was in motion and this led to structural weakening of the frame over time.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had round-topped fireboxes, bar frames, Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and Z-ported cylinders with short-lap, short-travel valves. The {{design of the}} two Union Garratt types deviated from the Garratt principle, the patent of which was held by Beyer, Peacock and Company, and the end results were hybrid locomotives, part Garratt and part Modified Fairlie. The {{front end of the}} locomotive was of a typical Garratt arrangement with a water tank mounted on the front engine unit's frame, while the rear end was constructed in the Modified Fairlie fashion with the coal bunker mounted on a rigid extension of the locomotive's main frame and with the <b>pivoting</b> rear engine <b>unit</b> positioned beneath the coal bunker.|$|R

One reason which had been put forward for the construction of the rear end on the Modified Fairlie principle was to enable the coal bunker to be rigidly in line with the boiler frame to ensure a satisfactory arrangement for the installation of the mechanical stoker. Since the locomotive was neither Garratt nor Modified Fairlie, its unique configuration was dubbed Union Garratt.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cellulose is {{the most}} {{familiar}} and most abundant strong biopolymer, but the reasons for its out-standing mechanical performance are not well understood. Each glucose unit in a cellulose chain is joined to the next by a covalent C−O−C linkage flanked by two hydrogen bonds. This geometry suggests some form of cooperativity between covalent and hydrogen bonding. Using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we show that mechanical tension straightens out the zigzag conformation of the cellulose chain, with each glucose <b>unit</b> <b>pivoting</b> around a fulcrum at either end. Straightening the chain leads to a small increase in its length and is resisted {{by one of the}} flanking hydrogen bonds. This constitutes a simple form of molecular leverage with the covalent structure providing the fulcrum and gives the hydrogen bond an unexpectedly amplified effect on the tensile stiffness of the chain. The principle of molecular leverage can be directly applied to certain other carbohydrate polymers...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} match {{demands for}} a newly promoted European Super League (ESL) squad were analysed over a full season using global positioning systems. Players were classified into four positional groups: outside backs (OB), <b>pivots</b> (PIV), middle <b>unit</b> forwards (MUF) and wide running forwards (WRF). MUF covered less total distance (4318 ± 570 m) than WRF (6408 ± 629 m), PIV (6549 ± 853) and OB (7246 ± 333 m) (P 0. 05). WRF (36 ± 5) and MUF (35 ± 6) were involved in more collisions than OB (20 ± 3) and PIV (23 ± 3; P < 0. 05). The high-speed running and collision demands observed here were greater than that previously reported in the ESL, which may reflect increased demands placed on the lower ranked teams. The present data {{may be used to}} inform coaches if training provides the physical stimulus to adequately prepare their players for competition which may be especially pertinent for newly promoted franchises...|$|R
50|$|The South African Railways also {{operated}} a Double Pacific {{version of the}} Union Garratt articulated locomotive. The Union Garratt was a hybrid locomotive, partly Modified Fairlie and partly Garratt. The front end was of a typical Garratt arrangement, with a water tank mounted on the front engine unit’s frame, while the rear end was constructed in the Modified Fairlie fashion, with the coal bunker mounted on a rigid extension of the locomotive’s main frame and with the <b>pivoting</b> rear engine <b>unit</b> positioned beneath the coal bunker. It had an additional large underbelly water tank under the boiler. The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab, coal bunker, {{as well as the}} underbelly water tank. As a result, like the Modified Fairlies, the Union Garratts were prone to metal fatigue and cracking of the frames. In the case of the Union Garratts, this occurred particularly at the rear, brought about by the long frame overhang laden with the coal bunker.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine <b>units</b> <b>pivoted</b> as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn acyclic USO on a {{hypercube}} {{is formed}} by directing its edges {{in such a}} way that the digraph is acyclic and each face of the hypercube has a unique sink and a unique source.

In such a way, Zadeh’s ‘least entered rule’ and other history based pivot rules can be applied to the problem of finding the global sink of an acyclic USO. In this paper we present some theoretical and empirical results on the existence of acyclic USOs for which the various history based pivot rules can be made to follow a Hamiltonian path. In particular, we develop an algorithm that can enumerate all such paths up to dimension 6 using efficient pruning techniques. We show that Zadeh’s original rule admits Hamiltonian paths up to dimension 9 at least, and prove that most of the other rules do not for all dimensions greater than 5...|$|R

40|$|Fabulous Hats’ {{featured}} {{new work}} {{commissioned by the}} Royal Mail to celebrate the individual skills of four British milliners. International fashion photographer Nick Knight photographed each of the hats separately, modelled by Erin O'Connor, clearly identifiable in silhouette. This {{was the first time}} in history that the identity of a living person, other than HM the Queen, has been revealed on a stamp. The hat selected pioneered a series of pieces, which continued a five-year investigation into ideas and techniques employed to create innovative structures for the head-using feathers. Examining the qualities of transparency that could be achieved using white Turkey ‘broads’, the feathers were transformed with the application of clear lacquers and varnishes that both increased the transparency to different degrees and created an inflexible structure that could be cut and accept further surface applications. This surface technique, appropriated from Japanese lacquer work, was re-examined in relation to a composite form comprising numbers of feathers, whereby frequencies of repetition correlated with differing densities. Through experimentation, the span of the final structure could be defined. Accepting the resonance with the wings from which the feathers themselves are taken, and with reference to the biomorphic structures of Engineer Santiago Calatrava, the individual feather <b>units</b> <b>pivot</b> around a fulcrum and are secured to achieve the frequency, span and opacity required to mask the identity of the wearer. The silhouette of the construction is defined with the ‘clipping’ of the margins that the lacquer enables, and the further application of a stencilled motif with coloured lacquer acts as a further foil. The work was published as part of the Royal Mail Year Book and disseminated in The Times newspaper, South Wales Echo and Graphics International Magazine...|$|R
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} for a {{sustainable}} agricultural production respecting ecological, {{social and economic}} values, modern farmers {{are well aware of}} the importance of a correct and precise fertiliser application. Indeed, non-uniform spread patterns can cause extra pressure on the environment and might result in economic losses for the farmer. Because of the higher price of pneumatic fertiliser spreaders and the limited working width of pendulum spreaders, centrifugal spreaders are most commonly used in Europe. Although the centrifugal spreading mechanism is simple, the process is hard to control and can lead to a deviation between the desired and the actual fertiliser distribution in the field. This non-uniform application can have several causes: the behavior of the operator, the properties of the fertiliser, the settings of the machinery and external conditions like the unevenness of the field or the wind. Even though farmers realize the importance of a precise fertilising, most of them cannot adapt the settings of the spreader to improve the pattern uniformity because they do not have the proper tools to determine and evaluate the spread pattern at farm level. Therefore, the general objective of this dissertation is to explore and develop a fast and accurate technique for measuring the spread pattern of conventional centrifugal spreaders. This method aims to be low cost and applicable on farm level. Also, it has to be mobile to the extent that the device can be built up on site to test several machines. The device should enable the adjustment of the spreader in such a way that a uniform spread pattern is obtained. Three existing approaches for evaluating the spread pattern are available. For the collector tray method, the grains are collected in trays and weighted in spread halls or on the field. The tests are time and fertiliser consuming. By using a full modeling approach, like the Discrete Element Method (DEM), this can be avoided. DEM takes all possible interactions between the grains into account and performs well in predicting spread pattern. The hybrid approach combines measurements and modeling. These measurements involve the measurement of the initial speed, direction and sometimes also the diameter of the grains. With a ballistic flight model the landing points are calculated. In this thesis the hybrid approach is applied: the spread pattern was predicted with a ballistic flight model based on the measurement of the horizontal outlet angle, the vertical outlet angle, the grain diameter, the grain density and the initial velocities. The horizontal outlet angle is the angle between the trajectory of the fertiliser grain and the radial line at the outlet position of the grain on the edge of the disc. The vertical outlet angle is the angle between the trajectory of the grains and the horizontal plane. Two dimensional imaging techniques were used to measure the horizontal outlet angle and the speed of the grains. First, a virtual camera was developed to assess the deviation caused by theperspective projection. It was found that in the center of the image the deviation on the horizontal outlet angle was below 1 &# 176; leading to an acceptable influence on the landing point in the field. Then a test spreader was used to make blurred images of the trajectories and to measure the horizontal outlet angle of two different spreader set ups: short vanes and long vanes. This method with one low cost camera mounted in the test spreader led to useful results for predicting the spread pattern: the mean horizontal outlet angle of the grain trajectories could be measured at different camera positions. The cylindrical spread pattern, measured with the test spreader, provided the mass distribution and allowed one to calculate the vertical outlet angle. However, the applied method did not give any information on the speed and the processing was partially manual and thus time consuming. Moreover, because the test spreader was a closed set the full spread pattern could not be measured which is necessary to validate the simulated spread patterns. Therefore, a new modular measurement device that tackled these shortcomings was proposed. This device consisted of two main parts: a test spreader and a measurement unit. As the arm with the measurement <b>unit</b> <b>pivots</b> on the center of the test device, the measurement unit traces a path around the circumference of the disc. The grains flying under the measurement unit were imaged using two different techniques: the high speed and a developed stroboscopic imaging technique. For the high speed technique a camera, type MotionXtra HG 100 K (Roper Scientific, New Jersey, USA), was mounted in the measurement unit. The stroboscopic technique used a specially designed LED stroboscope combined with the Nikon D 100 camera. Both techniques were able to visualize the grain flow but to extract information from the images, specific image processing was necessary. Filtering and morphological operations removed noise and made the segmentation, i. e. the recognition of the grains as objects in the image, possible. Several approaches were compared to develop a robust algorithm. Next, an efficient algorithm to detect the trajectories of the grains was developed. Finally, their direction and speed were deduced. A comparison between the more expensive high speed technique and the developed low cost stroboscopic technique was made. Also the differences between the short and long vanes were studied. Qualitatively, the strobe and the high speed technique gave very similar results for the angles and for the speeds. To quantitatively investigate the effects of the measurement technique, vane length and outlet positions, a regression analysis was performed. Using the short vanes increased the outlet angle with 1 %. The outlet speed of grains ejected by the short vanes was significantly lower than for the long vanes. Only for the speed measurement with the short vanes, both techniques gave statistically the same results. For the other cases, the high speed camera measured slightly higher values. The error for both techniques was the same. Overall the strobe technique and the high speed technique were capable of measuring the outlet angle and the outlet speed. Small differences between the measurements existed, but ultimately we were interested in the resulting spread pattern in the field. In this phase, all necessary inputs for simulating the spread pattern were available i. e. mass of the grains, vertical and horizontal outlet angle and outlet speed. These inputs were used to simulate four spread patterns: two spread patterns for the short vanes and two spread patterns for the long vanes based on the measurements of stroboscopic and the high speed technique, respectively. Next the real spread pattern of our set up was determined in a spread hall. The best correspondence between the measured and the simulated spread pattern was found when the regression function was used to generate the speed and the angles for each outlet positions on the disc in incremental steps of one degree. The relative error was 29. 2 % for the high speed technique and 30. 6 % for the strobe technique with the short vanes. Looking at the spread pattern of the long vanes, the relative errors for the strobe and the high speed technique were 29. 2 % and 29. 7 % respectively. The simulated spread patterns between the two techniques differed little with relative errors of 13. 2 % and 17. 0 %. The results were slightly better than the differences reported by Reumers et al. (2003 a), but clearly better than the differences Olieslagers (1997) found. Their spread patterns were calculated for a grid size of 1 m x 1 m. The DEM simulation of Van Liedekerke (2007) performed better with the same grid size as ours, but with a smaller total transverse spread distance. The transverse spread patterns however corresponded much better. This is an important result since the transverse spread pattern is generally used to evaluate spreaders in the field. Indeed, it means that the transverse pattern of our measurement technique could replace the method with the collector trays as it exists in the field. Two things will have to occur before farmers can use our development as a tool to adjust a spreader. First, we will need a new test set-up that allows a real spreader to be placed under the rotating arm, and second, a cylindrical collector will need to be designed. Replacing the collector tray method by our technique has some important advantages. The collector tray method is very time consuming and expensive. At least two, but preferably four people are needed to perform a test. A large number of collectors with inserted grids are needed. To achieve the desired distribution pattern in the field, several tests can be necessary and hence, lots of fertiliser is spilled. With our technique one person can perform the test, less fertiliser is used and all fertilizer is collected in the trays rather than spread out in the field. A cylindrical collector is needed to measure the mass distribution and the vertical angle. This is an important shortcoming of our method. Furthermore, the full spread pattern will result from the superposition of the spread pattern of both discs. Possible effects that arise from two discs that spread simultaneously are not yet investigated. Our set up preferably operates indoors. The set up can be disassembled and moved from one location to another, but is not fully mobile. A possible solution could be to equip the set up with wheels and a pull bar to make it transportable by car. Our technique could also be considered as a possible on board sensor to measure the spread pattern online, but this has not yet been investigated. The sensor should then also measure the size and the distribution of grains. The ambient light will certainly disturb the lighting and the image processing will have to be thoroughly adapted. Also important difficulties will arise from the vibrations and the movement of the spreader. Practical problems like dust and corrosion will also have to be solved. status: publishe...|$|R
