40|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the increase in}} the volume of world trade, cargo handling rates and seafarers' pace of work has increased. Although the STCW regulations and restrictions on working hours has improved, this tempo has brought with it insufficient resting hours, especially in short sea transport. It is known that individuals under stress and intensive workloads are more prone to making mistakes due to fatigue. In this study, the officers’ working hours are simulated in full-mission simulator at short sea transport to investigate errors made during the navigation and <b>port</b> <b>watches.</b> For this purpose, the data were obtained from 7 volunteers watchkeeping officers with the help of video monitoring and check lists in the full-bridge simulator system and also, system records in cargo handling simulator. With this study, introduced what types of errors made during navigation and <b>port</b> <b>watches</b> by watchkeeping officers under the intense pace of work. And the errors are evaluated under the legislation of international maritime. As a result, to comply with the limitations of working hours, it is necessary {{to increase the number of}} officers responsible for operations on short sea transport...|$|R

Herrick silently passed them by. They hailed him in thick voices, he made no answer; they cursed him for a churl, he paid no heed although his belly quivered with disgust and rage. He closed-to the door of the house behind him, and cast himself on a locker in the cabin--not to sleep, he thought--rather to think and to despair. Yet he had scarce turned twice on his uneasy bed, before a drunken voice hailed him in the ear, and he must go on deck again to stand the morning watch.|$|E

[...] Captain Allistoun said sharply to the second mate: [...] "Keep quiet, Mr. Creighton," [...] and stood composed in the tumult, listening with profound attention to mixed growls and screeches, to every exclamation and every curse of the sudden outbreak. Somebody slammed the cabin door to with a kick; the darkness full of menacing mutters leaped with a short clatter over the streak of light, and the men became gesticulating shadows that growled, hissed, laughed excitedly. Mr. Baker whispered:--"Get away from them, sir."

In addition, they had protected the port with four ships: a brig, two schooners and a lugger. After an intense combat three ships were taken. Bouchard burned the brig San Antonio and the schooner Lauretana, because their owners had not offered enough money for them, 30,000 and 20,000 duros respectively.

50|$|There is {{a popular}} belief {{that it was the}} silting of the River Dee that created the land which is now Chester's racecourse (known as the Roodee), on which a stone cross still stands which {{is said to have been}} erected in memory of Lady Trawst who died as a result of an image of the Virgin Mary called Holy Rood falling upon her in Hawarden church a few miles down the river). But the Roodee was in {{existence}} as early as the 13th and 14th centuries, so it cannot have been created by later silting. The silting which led to the creation of the Roodee, in its current form, is well established on a sequence of post-medieval maps dating from the later 16th century. It has also been established by archaeological evaluations and excavations in the area of the Old Port, known as the Roodee tail. Physical evidence for the silting of this area of the city is shown by the building of the 14th-century <b>port</b> <b>watch</b> tower, now known as the Water Tower, which projects from the north-west corner of the city walls. This tower was originally built out into the river. Maps of the 16th century, its archaeological form and related documentary evidence all demonstrate this.|$|E
50|$|In galley warfare, {{a secure}} basis on shore to store {{provisions}} and rest the crews was highly beneficial. Therefore, the wider operations were slowly made. Therefore, too, when {{the enemy was}} to be waited for, or a <b>port</b> <b>watched,</b> some point on shore was secured and the ships were drawn up. It was by holding such a point that the Corinthian allies of the Syracusans were able to pin in the Athenians. The Romans watched Lilybaeum in the same way, and Hannibal the Rhodian could run the blockade before they were launched and ready to stop him. The Norsemen hauled their ships on shore, stockaded them and marched inland. Roger of Lauria, in 1285, waited at the Formigues with his galleys on the beach till the French were seen to be coming past him. Edward III. In AD 1350, stayed at Winchelsea till the Spaniards were sighted. The allies at Lepanto remained at anchor near Dragonera till the last moment.|$|R
