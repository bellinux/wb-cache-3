They are also employed in public institutions, such as community clinics, elementary schools, colleges, and universities.

5000|$|Lab-on-a-chip {{technology}} may soon {{become an important}} part of efforts to improve global health, particularly through the development of point-of-care testing devices. [...] In countries with few healthcare resources, infectious diseases that would be treatable in a developed nation are often deadly. In some cases, poor healthcare clinics have the drugs to treat a certain illness but lack the diagnostic tools to identify patients who should receive the drugs. Many researchers believe that LOC {{technology may}} be the key to powerful new diagnostic instruments.

50|$|The current {{standard}} of care for Severe Early childhood caries includes restoration and extraction of carious teeth and, where possible, includes early intervention which includes application of topical fluoride, oral hygiene instructions and education.The initial visit is important as it allows dental professionals to flag unfavourable behaviour or eating habits. This will also allow dental clinician, working in a collaborative team, to <b>perform</b> <b>diagnostic</b> testing to determine the rate and progression of the disease. This is done by performing risk assessment based on the child's age, {{as well as the}} social, behavioural, and medical history of the child. Children at low risk may not need any restorative therapy, and frequent visits should be made to detect possible early lesions. Children at moderate risk may require restoration of progressing and cavitated lesions, while white spot and enamel proximal lesions should be treated by preventive techniques and monitored for progression. Children at high risk, however, may require earlier restorative intervention of enamel proximal lesions, as well as intervention of progressing and cavitated lesions to minimize continual caries development.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{thoracic}} surgery performed for diagnosis or treatment of chest conditions has required {{access to the}} chest through thoracotomy or sternotomy incisions. Sternotomy {{requires the use of}} a sternal saw to divide the sternum and requires spreading of the divided portions of the sternum with a sternal retractor to allow for visualization of the thoracic structures, passage of instruments into the chest, and removal of specimens. Thoracotomy, as most commonly performed, requires division of one or more major muscles of the chest wall including the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis or serratus muscles, along with spreading of the ribs with a rib spreader. Because the joints of the ribs with the vertebral bodies have only limited flexibility, the use of a rib spreader usually results in rib fractures in the process of rendering the interspace between the ribs wide enough to <b>perform</b> <b>diagnostic</b> or therapeutic maneuvers. Because of this, thoracic surgeons generally intentionally remove a section of one or more ribs in an effort to prevent splintered rib fractures {{associated with the use of}} a rib spreader. Sternotomy and thoracotomy have been proven over decades to provide highly effective means of access to thoracic structures and in general are tolerated by patients. However, both incisions have the potential for causing significant pain that may last for extended periods and both result in bony fractures that require a minimum of six weeks to heal during which time patients must refrain from heavy lifting or strenuous activity. The great advantage of VATS over sternotomy or thoracotomy is avoidance of muscle division and bone fractures that allows for diminished duration and intensity of pain and a shorter time to return to full activity.|$|E
5000|$|As {{this is not}} a BBC production, direct {{references}} to Doctor Who are not legally allowed for rights reasons. However, Baker and Tams have confirmed that this K-9 is the original K-9 Mark I, who appeared in Doctor Who from The Invisible Enemy (1977) to The Invasion of Time (1978). This model was last seen in the possession of Leela on Gallifrey; in the first episode, the robot dog is damaged and undergoes a [...] "regeneration" [...] into a new, more advanced form capable of flight. He then explains that most of his memory was damaged, so he cannot remember anything about itself or its past. In [...] "The Curse of Anubis", Starkey and Jorjie steal the Anubians book, which contains drawings of creatures the Anubians have enslaved, including a Sea Devil (as seen in The Sea Devils and Warriors of the Deep), a Mandrel (as seen in Nightmare of Eden) and an Alpha Centauran (as seen in The Curse of Peladon and The Monster of Peladon). While K-9 and the Professor <b>perform</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tests on K-9s damaged memory drive in episode 1, [...] "Regeneration", K-9 plays a three-note cue from the Doctor Who theme, but cannot identify the music. Much like the TARDIS exteriors appearance as a 1963 police box, the Professors laboratory and home is in a disused police station, still bearing its police lamp next to the front door. In the episode [...] "The Cambridge Spy", Starkey and K-9 follow Jorjie into the past to when the lab was still a police station — specifically to the evening of 23 November 1963, the evening when Doctor Who premiered with [...] "An Unearthly Child". In the pilot episode, K-9 Mark I gave his own life by self-destructing in order to kill the hostile aliens and save humans in London, just as K-9 Mark III did in [...] "School Reunion".|$|E
