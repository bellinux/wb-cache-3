50|$|AUI used a {{full-sized}} 15-pin D connector (model DA-15) {{that used}} a sliding clip for mechanical connections {{in place of}} thumbscrews. AAUI replaced these with a small 14-position, 0.05-inch-spaced ribbon contact connector. The connector may {{have been changed to}} avoid confusion with the monitor port on early Macintoshes, which also used a 15-pin D connector. The connector was locked into position using two clips or hooks {{on the sides of the}} connector outside of the D shell (where screws often are on D subs) which automatically clicked on when plugged in, and could be removed simply by pulling back on a sliding sheath over the body of the connector, disengaging the hooks. Third-party AAUI devices often omitted this sheath, requiring the user to directly squeeze small tabs on the sides of the <b>plug</b> <b>housing</b> to detach the hooks.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary valve}} works using a short {{circular}} <b>plug</b> <b>housed</b> {{in a larger}} cylindrical casing. Ports are cut along one plane through the stock and direct the airflow into the lengths of tubing when the stock is rotated 90 degrees.Trombone F-attachment valves are usually rotary, with several variations on the basic design also in use, such as the Thayer axial flow valve and Hagmann valve. Horns almost always have rotary valves, and many tubas have rotary valves.Joseph Riedlin is credited with the first use of rotary valves on brass instruments in 1832.|$|R

50|$|After the {{acquisition}} of Berry Records by Sony Music, Guitar Vader became increasingly unhappy with their contract, in particular their lack of ownership of their music, low royalties, and inability {{to get a new}} album released. At the time, both members of the band still worked part-time jobs to earn their living. The band left Berry in 2003 and formed an independent label, <b>Plugs</b> <b>House.</b> They built their own studio and produced a fourth album, Dawn. The release marked a continued evolution of the band's sound, with synths and programming performed by Ujuan. During 2003, the band also played two shows in England, hosted by Pixelsurgeon, their only shows outside Japan.|$|R

2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor.

One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm.

40|$|The {{design of}} the ITER ECRH system {{provides}} 20 &#xa 0;MW millimeter wave power for central plasma heating and MHD stabilization. The system consists of an array of 24 gyrotrons with power supplies coupled {{to a set of}} transmission lines guiding the beams to the four upper and the equatorial launcher. The front steering upper launcher design described herein has passed successfully the preliminary design review, and it is presently in the final design stage. The launcher consists of a millimeter wave system and steering mechanism with neutron shielding integrated into an upper port plug with the plasma facing blanket shield module (in-vessel) and a set of ex-vessel waveguides connecting the launcher to the transmission lines. Part of the transmission lines are the ultra-low loss CVD torus diamond windows and a shutter valve, a miter bend section and the feedthroughs integrated in the plug closure plate. These components are connected by corrugated waveguides and form together the first confinement system (FCS). In-vessel, the millimeter-wave system includes a quasi-optical beam propagation system including four mirror sets and a front steering mirror. The millimeter wave system is integrated into a specifically optimized upper port plug providing structural stability to withstand plasma disruption forces and the high heat load from the plasma side with a dedicated blanket shield module. A recent update in the ITER interface definition has resulted in the recession of the upper port plug first wall panels, which is now integrated into the design. Apart from the millimeter wave system the upper port <b>plug</b> <b>houses</b> also a set of shield blocks which provide neutron shielding. An overview of the actual ITER ECRH Upper Launcher is given together with some highlights of the design...|$|R

40|$|The drying {{properties}} of linseed oil {{have been known}} since the 15 th century, and exploited in artistic and industrial paints. Unfortunately, {{in the presence of}} metal salts, linseed oil applied to cotton fabric may induce self-heating and spontaneous ignition. The present study elucidates the chemical mechanisms which trigger both phenomena. Low-temperature oxidation of linseed oil and its active components, linoleic, linolenic and oleic acids in equimolar O 2 /N 2 mixture has been investigated in a <b>plug</b> flow reactor <b>housed</b> inside an oven at an initial temperature between 60 and 100 °C, with the liquids impregnated onto the glass wool support. In particular, we have studied the effect of transition metal salts on the oxidation of linseed oil. We identified the gaseous species produced in the oxidation by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and quantified them by micro gas chromatography (μGC). FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of aldehydes and carboxylic acids, with identification of these species confirmed by GC-MS. We propose that {{in the presence of a}} metal catalyst, the oxidation process involves the formation of metal-dioxygen (superoxide) adducts. The catalytic effect of a metal cation depends on its ability to form superoxide. Cobalt(II) is the most effective catalyst among other transition metal salts, followed by manganese(II) and iron(II). In the absence of a catalyst, we found the oil samples to undergo a slower autoxidation process, probably associated with cross-linking or polymerisation together with partial fragmentation to form the observed low molecular weight products...|$|R
40|$|Already in {{the early}} phase of a design for ITER, the {{maintenance}} aspects {{should be taken into}} account, since they might have serious implications. This paper presents the arguments in support of the case for the maintainability of the design, notably if this maintenance is to be performed by advanced remote methods. This structure is compliant to the evolving maintenance strategy of ITER. Initial results of a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and a development risk analysis for the ITER upper port <b>plug</b> # 3, <b>housing</b> the Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic, are employed for the definition of the maintenance strategy. The CXRS upper port plug is essentially an optical system which transfers visible light from the plasma into a fiber bundle. The most critical component in this path is the first mirror (M 1) whose reflectivity degrades during operation due to deposition and/or erosion dominated effects. Amongst other measures to mitigate these effects, the strategy is to allow for a replacement of this mirror. Therefore it is mounted on a retractable central tube. The main purpose of this tube is to make frequent replacements possible without hindering operation. The maintenance method in terms of time, geometry and spare part policy has a large impact on cost of the system and time usage in the hot cell. Replacement of the tube under vacuum and magnetic field seems infeasible due to the operational risk involved. The preferred solution is to have a spare tube available which is replaced in parallel with other maintenance operations on the vessel, as to avoid any interference in the hot cell with the shutdown scheduling. This avoids having to refurbish a full port plug and also allows for a more frequent replacement of M 1, as we can replace the mirror anytime the vacuum vessel is vented, estimated to be once a year.
