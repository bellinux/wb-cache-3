The bubbly flow pattern is an entrance condition or a non-fully developed flow. A spontaneous changeover to slug or annular flow usually occurs if the channel is long enough. The experiments were performed in turbulent flow with superficial liquid velocities ranging from 5 to 30 ft/sec. The friction, hydrostatic, and momentum pressure drop have been separated and analyzed individually {{with the aid of}} two new experimental measurements. These measurements were of the wall shear force and the momentum flux. The validity of these measurements was verified with numerous single-phase tests.

To demonstrate {{the importance of the}} plate-bone interface, this interface was represented three different ways in the {{finite element model}}. A plated tube with a uniform transverse osteotomy gap was also examined to study the mechanics of plated fractured bones. To validate the model, the results for the intact plated tube were compared to composite beam theory and strain gauge data from an instrumented physical model. Applications of the finite element model data included the prediction of screw failure modes, plate-induced osteopenia, and multi-axial strains in an interfragmentary region. The addition of sliding motion between the plate and tube resulted in a deviation from composite beam theory and improved correspondence with strain gage data when compared to a model having the plate and tube securely bonded. Sliding motion resulted in a much smaller region of bone subjected to reduced axial stress levels, which may decrease the extent of plate-induced osteopenia. The complex nature of induced strains in an osteotomy gap was also demonstrated, along with the tendency for failure of the screws nearest the fracture site...|$|E

The test facility is equipped with differential pressure transducers and two quick closing valves to measure the pressure drops and the average void fraction respectively. The pressure drop across the liquid single phase region has been changed by inserting calibrated orifices into the horizontal region. The data show the effect of the air flow rate and pressure losses on the liquid flow rate, void fraction, flow pattern, and recirculation ratio. The air pumping power has been experimentally estimated versus the liquid flow rate and the pneumatic efficiency has been evaluated.

The used filter media were included conventional sand, BFS and Iranian natural zeolite. The filtration rate was adjusted between 0. 1 and 0. 24 m 3 /m 2 /h and hence that the flow rate of each filter was 1. 5 L/h. Turbidity, total hardness and EC of water samples were analyzed before and after the treatment process according to standard methods. Results: The mean turbidity removal efficiencies in the studied filters were 98. 82 %, 98. 98 % and 98. 97 % for conventional SSF, slag modified filter (SMF) and zeolite modified filter (ZMF), respectively. The mean EC reduction efficiencies in SSF, SMF and ZMF also were similar and were 9. 99 %, 11. 02 % and 10. 73 %, respectively.

40|$|A {{plexiglass}} tube-type water profile sampler {{was designed}} for use in relatively shallow bodies of water, such as farm ponds, small recreational lakes, irrigation canals, and the surface 2 m of larger lakes and rivers. The sampler is a <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tube</b> with holes drilled at intervals (side ports) corresponding to water layers which are to be sampled. To obtain a water sample, the tube (open at both ends and with the side ports closed) was gently lowered vertically into the water. With the top stoppered, the tube was raised and its bottom stoppered just under the water surface. While the tube is held vertically, the water profile samples are rapidly and easily obtained after removing the top stopper and successively collecting {{from top to bottom}} the water sample from each side port. Dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles of the ponds measured with an oxygen probe directly in the ponds were similar to DO profiles of water samples collected with the tube sampler. Chemical and biological analyses of water samples obtained with the tube-type sampler and two other standard type water samplers (Kemmerer and Van Dorn) were compared. The analyses revealed that similar relative results were obtained from water samples collected with all three samplers, but the tube-type sampler was more desirable for obtaining water profile samples because of its simplicity of design and operation, especially in small ponds...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the propagation characteristics of methane-air deflagration flames {{and in an}} obstacle-filled tube, a high-speed color video camera, photoelectric sensors, and pressure transducers were {{used to test the}} deflagration flame propagating parameters. The tests were run in a 1500 mm long <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tube</b> with a 100 × 100 mm square cross-section. The obstacles included four types of repeated baffles and five forms of solid structure obstacles. The results showed that: (1) the flame front was constantly distorted, stretched, and deformed by different types of obstacles and, consequently, the flame propagating parameters increased; (2) plates and triple prisms increased the speed of the flame and overpressure to the highest extent, whereas cuboids and quadrangulars exerted an intermediate effect. However, the effect of cylindrical obstacles was comparatively limited. It was suggested that the obstacle’s surface edge mutation or curvature changes were the main factors stimulating the flame acceleration; (3) the peak pressure of deflagration was relatively low near the ignition end, increased gradually until it reached the maximum at the middle of the tube, and decreased rapidly near the open end; and (4) the fixed obstacles in front of the flame exhibited a blocking effect on flame propagation during the initial stages; the flame speed and overpressure increased when the flame came into contact with the obstacles. This study is of significance because it explains the methane-air propagation mechanism induced by different types of obstacles. The findings have value for preventing or controlling gas explosion disasters...|$|E

So far, the void fraction and the dispersed-phase velocity, which are the two essential factors required for calculation of flowing enthalpy, have been determined by using resistivity and photo-sensors. Currently, research efforts have been oriented toward measuring downhole enthalpy by fiber optics. The normal reflection probe with the tip surface cut at a right angle to the fiber axis was used to investigate the void fraction first in water-air flow then in water-steam flow. A 4 -inch tall <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tube</b> was used in the experiments. The comparison measurements for void fraction were made by using the fractional flow ratio detector (FFRD). Successful results were obtained for the slow bubble flow case and water-steam flow. After void fraction measurements, a new probe with two fibers of different lengths was designed for the dispersed phase velocity measurement. The dispersed phase velocity values obtained from the fiber probe showed good agreement with the values measured by using a video camera. After obtaining satisfactory results in the 4 -inch tube, we tested our device in a 6. 5 -foot model wellbore and comparison measurements for void fraction were made using a resistivity sensor. The results were in good agreement. It was observed that the correlation between resistivity sensor and fiber optic sensor increased with increasing air flow rates. vi...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{fluorescent}} labelling {{method is}} presented as a new tool for the investigation of organic particle transport and biogenic carbon cycling processes in sandy littoral interstices at Lake Tegel, Berlin, Germany. Passive particle transport through the pore system was studied by in situ exposition of 2. 4 μm monodisperse polymeric resin microparticles stained with 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin (AMC). Uptake of fluorescein- 5 -isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled Chlorella vulgaris and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) by the interstitial fauna was investigated in laboratory and field experiments. The major portion (> 85 %) of the FITC-labelled particles added to sediment cores was recovered from the topmost centimetre of sediment during the study period of 14 days. Uptake of FITC-labelled FPOM was observed in several benthic groups, e. g. chironomids, microcrustaceans, oligochaetes and tardigrads, whereas C. vulgaris was ingested by oligochaetes only. There is evidence to suggest that both are suitable materials for investigating the fragmentation and ingestion of organic material by herbivorous and detritivorous fauna. Field experiments with inert microparticles and FITC-labelled FPOM (< 1 mm) prepared from dried alder leaves were carried out in <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tubes</b> as in situ whole core technique. Within the investigation period of two weeks, the transport of FPOM was restricted to the topmost 2 – 3 cm of sediment in conjunction with a distinct fragmentation to finer size classes with respect to increasing sediment depth. Vertical FPOM transport was hindered by a high interstitial concentration of natural POM and an intensive settlement of the interstices by algae (mainly epispammic algae, 65 – 96 % of algae cell number) and extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS), which formed a dense three-dimensional structure...|$|R

Thus {{the aim of this}} work was to visualize and quantify, through X-ray CT scan, the pores distribution in an oxidic Latosol submitted to a conservation management system with different gypsum doses. Three random trenches were dug lengthwise along the plant row in a very clayey gibbsitic dystrophic Red Latosol, subjected to the following gypsum levels: G 0 : absence of gypsum; G 7 : 7 Mg ha- 1 and G 28 : 28 Mg ha- 1 of additional gypsum, applied {{to the surface of the}} plant row. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tubes</b> at depths of 0. 20 - 0. 34, 0. 80 - 0. 94 and 1. 50 - 1. 64 m after six years of coffee cultivation for quantification of 3 D pores obtained by X-ray CT scan. The spatial variability of the soil structure was evaluated by semivariograms generated by 3 D images in grayscale. Distribution of the detectable pore diameter was conducted by data mining. Statistical analyzes employed packages 'geoR' to semivariogram and 'randomForest' for data mining in R language. A greater spatial continuity of the pores occurred in the G 7 at the three depths. The combined effects of the management system promoted a greater spatial variability of the soil structure in the G 28 treatment. Based on geostatistical analyses, it can be infer that the adoption of the system under study promoted changes in the pore network in all directions (X, Y and Z), however with better pores continuity in the vertical direction(Z) ...|$|R

Differential pressure transducers {{were used to}} automate the water level measurement in the reservoir. The Mariotte bottle was automated {{by a set of}} solenoid valves which were connected via tubing to pre-defined depths in the Mariotte bottle. Based on design parameters tested in the laboratory (sensor sensitivity, water reservoir diameter, and bubbling rate) three identical tension infiltrometers connected to a single Mariotte bottle were built. A new reservoir system made of two <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tubes</b> of different diameter slotted in each other was found to reduce the measurement fluctuations caused by the disturbance created to rising bubbles in the reservoir. The new system was tested on a uniform sandy loam profile prepared in the soil bin laboratory and different analytical and numerical data analysis methods were compared. The measured steady state data were used to determine K(h) at different suctions using the analytical method proposed by Reynolds and Elrick (1991). The K(h) points obtained were fitted with the van Genuchten’s equation (van Genuchten, 1980) using the RETC program to calculate the best fit parameters Ks,  and n. These parameters were used as initial estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters in the numerical models HYDRUS 1 D and 2 D, in which transient cumulative flow data was used to determine the soil hydraulic functions via inverse modelling. The analysis of variance determined significantly higher K(h) values calculated by HYDRUS 1 D while the other methods did not differ from each other. Finally, the tension infiltrometer was used in the field on a sandy loam soil to characterise five different tillage treatments (conventional plough, shallow plough, minimum tillage, direct drill, and no-tillage). The effect of wheel traffic was also evaluated by measuring the infiltration rates in the wheel-marks. The fully automated system allowed the measurement of infiltration rates for 8 tensions in triplicate per day with hardly any human intervention apart for refilling the reservoir. The results show that the tillage practices and wheel-traffic have a significant influence on the soil hydraulic function K(h) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} two-phase gas-liquid vertical annular climbing film flow. Using a high speed Fastax movie camera, motion was slowed sufficiently to facilitate {{detailed analysis of the}} climbing film structure, based on single frame projections. The dynamic characteristics of the liquid film could likewise be obtained, though these were necessarily of a qualitative nature, A technique based on a diffusion controlled electrochemical reaction was employed to monitor the local instantaneous mass transfer coefficient at the solid-liquid interface. The resultant fluctuating electrical signal was amplified and presented for direct comparison with the climbing film structure, using split image photography. The signal was also subjected to a spectral density analysis to further {{understanding of the nature of}} the turbulence produced at the interface. The vertical annular column was constructed of a three-inch inside diameter clear <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tube,</b> with a one-inch outside diameter concentric core, supported laterally by a series of streamlined centering pins. The column extended some 35 feet from the base with all tests carried out approximately midway up the column to minimize end effects. The particular construction of the column permitted an unobstructed view of the free surface of the climbing film. Determination of the pressure gradients was likewise simplified as the inner surface of the outer tube remained essentially dry throughout the experimental program. The air flow rates varied from 172 cfm to 616 cfm at one atmosphere pressure and 68 °F, temperature. Liquid flow rates were confined to a range from. 19 lbm/min to 1. 5 lbm/min so as to stay within the climbing film regime. From the movie film analysis, values for the average film thickness, wave frequency and phase velocity were determined with their respective standard deviations.

40|$|The United States meat {{industry}} {{has worked hard}} to improve its image and to remain competitive in the world protein market. Delivery of animals to market that possess excessive carcass fat impede efficiency {{at all levels of the}} market chain. Advances in electronic technologies have made it possible to assess carcass composition very accurately. The objective of this study was to examine electronic technologies for the estimation of porcine and ovine carcass composition. Electromagnetic (EM) scanning, optical reflectance probes, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and realtime ultrasound were evaluated for prediction of carcass and (or) live animal body composition. The electromagnetic scanner generates a constant, low level electromagnetic field within a large <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tube.</b> The amount of electromagnetic energy lost to the lean (conductive) component of a carcass can be quantified and used to predict total carcass lean weight, percentage of carcass lean, and primal cut lean weight. An optical reflectance probe gives an indication of fat and muscle tissue depth at a specific anatomical location based on the different reflectance properties of white fat versus red lean. The fat and muscle depths are then used as prediction variables for estimation of proportional carcass yield. Bioelectrical impedance analysis measures the resistance (Rs) and reactance (Xc) of an applied electrical current through the body of a live animal or carcass. Leaner animals contain less fat, which serves as an insulator, and will have lower components of impedance (Rs and Xc). Realtime ultrasound gives a visual representation of tissue interfaces (loin eye area and fat depth) from the reflectance of ultrasonic frequencies as they encounter the tissue interface. Bioelectric impedance analysis was the most accurate means for estimation of dissected lean and fat-free lean for live lamb measurement. Ultrasound was identified as an accurate means for assessment of fat depth on live lambs. Electromagnetic scanning was the most accurate electronic technology for prediction of lamb carcass composition for total and leg lean. Application of electromagnetic scans was shown to be very accurate for predicting pork carcass composition in an online industrial configuration. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{which account}} for the diminished responsiveness (tolerance) of an individual to a drug, {{as a result of}} prior exposure to that drug, are not yet fully understood. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} drug tolerance is a learned adaptive response. This possibility was examined by studying the effect of ethanol on body temperature and behavioral thermoregulatory responses of Sprague-Dawley rats. Two major studies were conducted. The first study examined the initial dose-related effects of ethanol (1, 2, or 3 g/kg i. p.); the second study examined the effect of ethanol (2. 5 g/kg i. p.) administered on 14 consecutive days. Rats were tested in a thermocline, a hollo <b>plexiglass</b> <b>tube</b> in which a linear temperature gradient (6 - 36 °C) was established through local heating and cooling of opposite ends of the tube. The position of rats in the thermocline was detected by a series of infrared light emitting diodes and photocells. The body temperature of rats in the thermocline was transmitted by a temperature sensitive telemetry capsule surgically placed in the peritoneal cavity. Validation studies demonstrated that rats reliably responded to temperature cues within the thermocline. In the first experiment ethanol produced a dose-related decrease in body temperature. All rats following injection initially selected an ambient temperature cooler than baseline. Rats receiving control treatment or the high dose of ethanol eventually shifted to a warmer ambient temperature. Activity levels were depressed equally by all three doses of ethanol. In the second experiment tolerance developed to the hypothermic effect of ethanol. A diminished response to ethanol was evident by the second test day and was maximal by day 7. Ethanol treated rats selected a cooler ambient temperature than control rats throughout the 14 day period, and activity levels continued to be depressed by ethanol throughout the 14 days. On the fifteenth day all rats were given an injection of saline. Rats which had previously received daily ethanol injections exhibited a hyperthermic response to saline compared to control rats. These results suggest that ethanol altered the central control of thermoregulation by lowering and possibly broadening the thermoregulatory set point. There was evidence for a conditioned hyperthermic response, but not a learned behavioral response, which contributed to the tolerance development...|$|E
