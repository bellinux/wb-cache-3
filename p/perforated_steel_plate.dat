40|$|Key words: Steel plate shear wall; {{concrete}} filled {{steel tube}} column; seismic performance; energy dissipation; ductility Abstract. In {{view of the}} proposal of embedded steel plate concrete shear wall with concrete filled steel tube columns which contains a new kind shear connector of tie-bars through the circular holes linking concrete layers {{on both sides of}} the plate. In order to prove the seismic performance of walls with circular holes on the plate, three steel plate shear wall specimens, including the plate without holes bolted with columns, welded with columns, and the perforated plate welded with columns, were tested under cyclic loading. According to the results, the load-bearing capacity, ductility, energy dissipation, hysteretic behavior and failure phenomena were analyzed. It is showed that the load-bearing capacity of the three specimens were quite close. However, the wall with <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> has better ductility, energy dissipation and hysteretic behavior. So, it is an effective way to improve the seismic performance of walls by means of embedded <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> instead of ordinary ones...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe brick infill walls {{cease to}} {{contribute}} to the lateral strength and stiffness of a structure as soon as they fail in a brittle manner {{in the early stages of}} an earthquake. Recent studies indicated that the <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> externally bonded to both faces of a wall lead to two benefits. First, the increase in the lateral strengths and rigidities of the walls increase the overall lateral strength and stiffness of the structure. Secondly, the increase in the ductilities of the walls allows the walls to absorb higher amounts of the earthquake-induced energy before failure so that smaller amounts of energy are required to be absorbed by the bearing structural members. The present study is dedicated to investigate the efficiency of this technique on the behavior of brick walls under out-of-plane bending moments, induced by the blast effect of an explosion or pressure from the soil, wind or snow next to the wall. A brick wall strengthened with <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and a brick wall strengthened with <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>steel</b> strips on both faces were subjected to four-point bending. The <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> greatly contributed to the bending capacities of the walls. The use of steel strips on the plates did not affect the flexural capacity of the wall, while increasing the ductility of the wall considerably...|$|R

40|$|<b>Perforated</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Plate</b> Shear Wall (P-SPSW) is a {{relatively}} new lateral load resisting system used for resisting wind and earthquake loads. Current North American standards have recently adopted this new lateral load resisting system and proposed guidelines for the design of P-SPSWs. Research on P-SPSW is in the initial stage and to the best of this researcher’s knowledge, no seismic performance of code designed P-SPSWs has been studied yet. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the seismic performance of code designed P-SPSWs. Three multi-storey (4 -, 8 -, and 12 -storey) P-SPSWs were designed according to the seismic provisions in NBCC 2010 and CSA/CAN S 16 - 09. Nonlinear time history (NTH) analysis was conducted using detailed finite element (FE) modeling techniques. The finite element (FE) model developed was validated with two experiments results for quasi- static monotonic and cyclic analysis. Excellent correlation was found between detailed FE analysis and tests result. For seismic analysis a series of ten ground motion data were chosen which were compatible with Vancouver response spectrum. All the perforated shear walls exhibited excellent seismic behavior including high stiffness, stable ductility, and good energy dissipation during nonlinear time history (NTH) analysis. It was observed from the seismic analysis that proposed code equation provided a good estimation of the shear strength of the perforated plate when the plate was fully yielded. Thus, it can be concluded that recommended equation of CSA/CAN S 16 - 09 is conservative to select the infill plate thickness of <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> shear wall. The N 2 method has been used as an easy means of seismic demand evaluation compared to nonlinear time history analysis. The applicability of the N 2 method for seismic demand assessment of P-SPSWs is investigated in this research. Results from N 2 method was compared with the more accurate NTH analysis results. It was observed that the N 2 method predicted seismic response parameters such as roof displacement reasonably accurately for 4 -and 8 -storey P-SPSW. For 12 -storey P-SPSW N 2 method slightly overestimated the roof displacement. The applicability of the modified strip model (MSM) was also evaluated in this research for unstiffened P-SPSW. After validating two experiments, the model was used for the three selected P-SPSWs. Monotonic pushover analysis results were compared with detailed FE analysis results. It was observed that the modified strip model efficiently captures the inelastic behavior of multi-storey unstiffened P-SPSWs with adequate accuracy. The ultimate strength was predicted well, and the initial stiffness was slightly underestimated...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in a flume (3. 0 meter long, 0. 3 meter wide by 0. 3 meter deep) to examine chemical loss to surface runoff. The bottom of the flume was made of a <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate,</b> which allowed infiltration to occur during the runoff event. Three experiments {{were conducted}}. The objective of the first experiment was to introduce a calcium chloride solution as surface flow into the flume which was pre-saturated with calcium bromide. This experiment allowed the transfer of chemicals from soil to runoff to be examined. The second experiment was the reverse of the first experiment, i. e. the soil was saturated with calcium chloride and the surface flow contained calcium bromide. This experiment was done to examine chemical transport from runoff to the soil. In the last experiment, the soil was saturated {{with a mixture of}} calcium bromide, sodium benzoate, and pentafluorobenzoic acid (PFBA), and the surface flow contained calcium chloride. The sodium benzoate was chosen to examine biodegradation. The PFBA and bromide, both non-reactive tracers, have different aqueous diffusion coefficients. The results obtained for these two were compared to help determine if the mass transfer in the soil mainly is due to flow, or if diffusion contributes. With this research {{it has been shown that}} there are several factors influencing chemical loss to runoff infiltration, biodegradation, and there are also suggestions that there is transfer due to diffusion processes...|$|E
40|$|Public safety {{has long}} {{been one of the}} chief design {{concerns}} for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). For this reason, the design of a NPP must include plans for different accident scenarios called Design Basis Accidents (DBAs). One such DBA is called a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA); Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) are particularly prone to them. In order to better understand the phenomena associated with a LOCA, a great deal of research has been undertaken. In particular, many studies have been done under the designation Generic Safety Issue- 191 (GSI- 191). GSI- 191 seeks to better understand the secondary effects of a LOCA such as the pressure drop and debris bypass of the containment sump strainer and the impact that both can have on the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS). The present study was undertaken to build upon previous work that sought {{to determine whether or not}} a voltage applied to the sump strainer would affect the amount of fibrous debris bypass. To this end, a vertical strainer made from a <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> was installed in a horizontal flow loop. A filter bag was installed downstream from the strainer to collect the debris bypass. The fibrous debris was made from one-side baked NUKON fiberglass insulation. Measurements were also taken of the pressure drop across the debris beds. A total of 19 tests were carried out across five different voltages. No significant difference was observed in either the bypass or the pressure drop between the different voltages. The test results may have been affected by the fact that the present study involved water that was cooler than previous studies. The results may have also been affected by leaks in the test section. Furthermore, the use of multiple NUKON mats may also have affected the results. A study on the sensitivity of the debris bypass to kinematic viscosity could help shed some light on the former problem...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSteel {{perforated}} liners {{have been}} used in turbine combustions for several years. The main purpose of the holes on the chambers is for cooling the combustion wall by inducing cooling air flows through the holes. It would be very useful if the <b>steel</b> <b>perforated</b> liners could be used for attenuating the combustion noise too, especially for the low frequency noise. This paper presents a series of acoustic attenuation measurements which were carried out in a 500 mm (width) × 500 mm (height) × 6000 mm (length) impedance tube on flat <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with various geometric parameters. The measured absorption coefficient and impedance show that the <b>steel</b> <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> have strong sound attenuation on a certain frequency bandwidth. Experimental data were compared with the predicted data that concerned the effects of air inertia and viscosity in apertures. The results show reasonable agreement with the prediction. The acoustic attenuation properties, inferred from normal surface resistance and absorption coefficient data on perforation panels with different plate thickness, perforation, aperture diameter and aperture distribution are presented. The measurement results and analyses show that with careful design the cooling holes on the combustion wall can be used to attenuate the noise efficiently...|$|R

The airfield facility became a Royal Air Force station and was renamed RAF Changi in 1946 after the Japanese surrender. Imprisoned Japanese troops were then made to improve the runways, reinforcing the north-south runway for military aircraft and adding <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> to the east-west runway.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn many {{high-performance}} applications {{there is}} a need to join steel to CFRP parts. However the stiffness mismatch between these materials leads to high stress concentrations in such joints. This paper uses the biomimetics approach to help develop solutions to this problem. Nature has found many ingenious ways of joining dissimilar materials, with a transitional zone of stiffness at the insertion site commonly used. In engineering joints, one way to reduce the material stiffness mismatch is to gradually decrease the effective stiffness of the steel part of the joint by perforating it with holes. This paper investigates joining of flat <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> to a CFRP part by a co-infusion resin transfer moulding process. The possible effect of mechanical interlocking as resin fills the perforations is assessed by filling the holes with PTFE prior to moulding to prevent such resin ingress. The joints are tested under static tensile loading. The <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> joints show a 175 % increase of joint strength comparing to non-perforated joints. Finite element analyses are used to interpret the experimental results.

40|$|In {{the field}} of the seismic {{protection}} of buildings, the use of <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> shear walls (SPSWs) may be particularly appropriate for the intervention of seismic retrofitting of existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings designed for gravity loads only. Some past research has shown that, when traditional full SPSWs are used as bracing devices for framed buildings, they may induce excessive design forces to the surrounding frame members. Therefore, low yield steel could be a valuable option to overcome this applicability limit. Nevertheless, the scarce availability in the market of these steels suggests the employment of aluminium alloys and <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> which {{have the benefit of}} incurring behaviour in the plastic range for low stress levels. In this paper, in order to conduct a parametric analysis concerning the use of full and perforated SPSWs for seismic upgrading of existing RC framed structures, first some experimental tests have been numerically calibrated using the SeismoStruct software. Subsequently, the proposed finite element model has been used to design the retrofitting systems with either full or perforated SPSWs of an existing RC residential five-storey building. Finally, the differences in the use of these solutions, in terms of both structural and economic viewpoints, have been demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|At a {{residency}} at Yaddo artists’ retreat at Saratoga Springs in {{the spring}} of 1953, Dienes made a large number of monoprints by taking rubbings from textured surfaces using a printmaker’s brayer. Back in New York in the summer of 1953 she began taking rubbings of the sidewalks, subway gratings and other urban features on very large sheets of paper or Webril. As she told The Village Voice in 1956: ‘About 5 o’clock on Sunday mornings is the best time because there aren’t as many hecklers, and traffic is light. I take those big sheets of paper that photographers use but I have to keep a firm hold or they blow away. Sometimes I take rubbings of cracks in the sidewalk and sometimes I take rubbings of rubbings.’ Dienes sometimes enlisted the aid of younger artists Rachel Rosenthal, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Johns later recalled assisting Dienes: ‘After finishing my work at a bookstore on 57th Street, I used to visit Sari, who lived nearby. After midnight we would go out on 6th Avenue and she would work over the cracked street and various cast-iron manhole covers. I was responsible for keeping the sometimes enormous sheets of fabric or paper that she used from blowing away.’ ‘She was very uninhibited, I thought. People would come up and ask what was going on, and she would talk as she continued to work, {{in the middle of the}} street.’ Dienes’ ‘Sidewalk Rubbings’ were featured in solo exhibitions at the Betty Parsons Gallery in April-May 1954 and November-December 1955, in the windows of the New York department store Bonwit Teller in July 1955, and at the Contemporaries Gallery in New York in 1959. Reviewing an exhibition of Dienes' work at Gump's Gallery in San Francisco in 1957, noted critic Alfred Frankenstein described her rubbings as follows: 'A circular saw and various spiky forms lead to a sunflower as eloquent as any of Van Gogh's, but most of the pictures are not as specifically representational as that. Manhole covers, <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> boards, sidewalk grilles and other surfaces have been drawn upon for a series of designs laying stress on the movement of rectilinear and circular forms and on exquisitely sensitive resonances of color and tone.|$|R

Epoxy adhesive with several weight percent of water absorption will degrade the physical properties of the adhesive. Moisture condition has some effect on the strength of the adhesive bonding. 1. 0 mm of adhesive thickness provides the highest value of failure load.

In this mode of heat transfer the benzene was dispersed as a family of droplets into the water, which formed the continuous phase. The pulse column was 1. 92 -in. in inside diam., and contained 8 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> spaced 2. 00 inches apart. The plates were perforated with 1 / 8 -in. holes in a triangular 60 deg pattern, providing 24. 6 per cent free area. The equipment was carefully insulated and modified in many details in order to permit precise heat transfer measurements. The operating conditions were varied so as to provide wide ranges of variables and heat transfer responses. (W. L. H. ...|$|R

The possible application variants of mentioned screens are offered and analyzed. Main attention is given for producing one-layer and multi-layer screens with cellular structure {{due to its}} relatively low weight and technological elasticity-complex three-dimensional structures could be done successfully. Examples of produced shielding screens from <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> tape for protection from electromagnetic fields in different frequency range are offered and tested. The efficiency of a shielding material was determined by measuring the magnetic field before and after applying the shielding material. Distribution of the magnetic field behind the shielding screen was determined by software vector mapping. Shielding efficiency was measured for 1) a three layer <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> screen; 2) an one-layer <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> screen - shielding screen was placed in between the magnetic field source and the measurement point forming two dimensional screen; 3) copper composite sprayed screen. During experimental investigation it was established, that a three-layer <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> screen application allowed the 27 % reduction in the magnetic field, while one-layer <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> screen gave only 12 % reduction. Copper composite sprayed screen reduced magnetic field by 15 %. Recommendations for producing the multi-layer <b>perforated</b> <b>steel</b> screen accordingly to shielding efficiency are elaborated and laid down. The discussed material carries also ecological significance, since the material is produced by waste products (after stumping etc.). Therefore the production of such materials comes with reduced cost both in light of capital expenditures and ecological footprint...|$|R
