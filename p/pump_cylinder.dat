2500|$|The American windmill, or wind engine, {{was invented}} by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger {{versions}} were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain. In early California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse. During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction. [...] At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use. Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, Eclipse, Fairbanks-Morse, Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds. [...] A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, saw mills, and agricultural machinery.|$|E
50|$|The pump's primary {{components}} {{consist of}} the pump handle, the riser main which carries {{the water to}} the surface, the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> which pushes water up the riser main, and the connecting rod which connects the pump handle to the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{at the bottom of}} the well. After a borehole is drilled, a well casing is inserted into the hole to prevent the erosion of the borehole walls. The India Mark II needs a borehole with a minimum diameter of 10 cm. The casing has a well screen to allow water to pass into the casing but keeps rocks and dirt out. A <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> is attached to the bottom of a series of pipes call riser mains or riser pipes and sits below the water surface in the well once installed. The riser main will carry the water from the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> to the surface. Inside the riser main, a series of rods connect the pump handle to the top of the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{at the bottom of the}} well. The reciprocating up and down movement of the pump handle raises and lowers the connecting rod thus raising and lowering the plunger of the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Two one-way water valves inside the cylinder suck water into the cylinder on the upstroke and force the water into the riser main on the down stroke. Water flows up the riser main and out of the spout at the top of the well head assembly.|$|E

50|$|The said type of {{gate valve}} {{is having a}} {{rotating}} member inside a rotating valve chamber wherein {{the center of the}} valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the <b>pumping</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the <b>pumping</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the <b>pumping</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member & the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{always worked}} as a water pump and was {{equipped}} with two cast iron cylinders {{at opposite ends of}} the beam, one for the working cylinder and one for the pump. The <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> was taller and thinner, of 24 in diameter and 8 ft tall, designed for a working stroke 7 ft within this, although only 6 ft was used in practice. The pumped water was delivered at a head of 24 ft. The engine was later described as being of 30 hp in power.|$|E
50|$|A Flit gun {{consists}} of a pneumatic <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> with a hand-operated piston to force air through an air nozzle in the front. Below {{the front of the}} pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container designed to act as a reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to the pump and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to the pump with a coarse screw fitting and a seal of cork composite or gasket paper, so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A siphon tube extends from the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> downward into the reservoir and {{the upper end of the}} siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on the air pump. When a jet of high-velocity air exits the pump and streams across end of the siphon tube, it lowers the pressure in the siphon, drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet. With each vigorous forward stroke of the pump handle a burst of spray is produced, similar to that of a modern aerosol spray can.|$|E
50|$|The AEGs were {{developed}} in Japan and the Japanese company Tokyo Marui is credited with creating the original gearbox system. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a train of 3 gears mounted inside a gearbox, which then loads a pump piston against a spring. Once the spring is released, it pushes the piston plunger forward through the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> to propel a pellet resting within the chamber forward through the barrel {{and out of the}} muzzle. Many manufacturers have now more or less replicated this basic model, adding reinforced parts or minor improvements.|$|E

50|$|The multi-bladed {{wind pump}} or wind turbine atop a lattice tower {{made of wood}} or steel hence became, for many years, a fixture of the {{landscape}} throughout rural America. These mills, made {{by a variety of}} manufacturers, featured a large number of blades so that they would turn slowly with considerable torque in moderate winds and be self-regulating in high winds. A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft converted the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> below. Today, rising energy costs and improved pumping technology are increasing interest in the use of this once declining technology.|$|E
5000|$|Spring-powered airsoft guns (or [...] "air-cocking guns" [...] as {{called by}} Tokyo Marui) are single-shot devices {{that use the}} elastic {{potential}} energy stored within a compressed coil spring to drive a piston air pump, which is released upon trigger-pull and rapidly pressurizes the air within the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> to in turn [...] "blow" [...] pellets down the gun barrel. The user must recompress the spring under stress prior to each shot, typically by manually pulling back the slide (pistols), bolt handle (rifles) or forend pump (shotguns) on the weapon, which cocks and readies the gun. Because of this, spring guns are by design incapable of automatic or semi-automatic firing.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{element of}} the transfer tube pump is the so-called [...] "S" [...] transfer tube installed inside the feed hopper. The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> which is currently pushing the material {{is connected to the}} delivery line by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the S-shaped tube which is connected to the delivery line is swung over to the other delivery cylinder with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.|$|E
50|$|Clerk's {{original}} design {{did not allow}} the construction of smaller engines, as it required the aforementioned additional <b>pumping</b> <b>cylinder</b> for each working cylinder. The crucial simplification of the concept, that made possible small yet powerful two stroke engines for mass markets, was patented by Joseph Day in 1894.|$|R
50|$|The Vespa ET2 scooter had a 50 cc {{two-stroke}} engine in which air was admitted through the transfer port and a rich fuel mixture was {{injected into the}} cylinder near the spark plug just before ignition.

50|$|Newcomen {{replaced}} the receiving vessel (where the steam was condensed) with a cylinder containing a piston based on Papin's design. Instead of the vacuum drawing in water, it drew down the piston. This {{was used to}} work a beam engine, in which a large wooden beam rocked upon a central fulcrum. On {{the other side of}} the beam was a chain attached to a pump at the base of the mine. As the steam cylinder was refilled with steam, readying it for the next power stroke, water was drawn into the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> and expelled into a pipe to the surface by the weight of the machinery. Newcomen and his partner John Calley built the first successful engine of this type at the Conygree Coalworks near Dudley in the West Midlands. A working replica of this engine can be seen at the Black Country Living Museum nearby.|$|E
50|$|More {{reliable}} pumps {{have been}} developed to be maintained at the local level: village level operations and maintenance (VLOM). The India Mark III, Afridev, and Bluepump are the most common VLOM pumps. The pumps incorporate the use of larger PVC riser mains to allow for the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> to be removed without lifting the rising main out of the borehole. This makes maintenance on the pumps easier but the initial cost for the pipes can be twice as much. Routine maintenance is still required and maintaining funds for replacement parts is still necessary. Without the need for a specialized pump mechanic these newer pump designs can provide longer lasting sustainable access to drinking water. Unfortunately, some countries have restricted importation and installation of these pumps citing the need to standardize pumps to reduce cost and ensure an adequate supply of replacement parts. The government of Uganda, for example, enforces the standardization by placing high tariffs on pumps other than a variant of the India Mark II, known as U2.|$|E
5000|$|Blake v. City and County of San Francisco, , was {{an appeal}} from a decree that {{dismissed}} a bill {{filed by the}} appellant to restrain the infringement by the appellees of reissued letters patent granted to the appellant as the assignee of original letters patent issued to Thomas H. Bailey. The original patent was dated February 9, 1864, and the reissue September 18, 1877. They were for [...] "a new and improved valve for water cylinders of steam fire engines and other pump cylinders." [...] The specification, which was substantially the same in both patents, stated that previous to the invention therein described, the only valve used to relieve the pressure upon fire hose {{to prevent them from}} bursting was one operated by hand. To obviate the defects of such a valve, the inventor applied at some point between the engine or pump and the hose nozzle a valve which opened automatically by the pressure in the hose or the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder,</b> so as to discharge an additional stream and thereby relieve the pressure.|$|E

The air <b>pumping</b> <b>cylinder</b> is above the steam power cylinder and crosshead. The main force of the piston is transmitted to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth the action of the engine. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards.|$|R

5000|$|Spring-piston air guns (or simply [...] "spring guns" [...] or [...] "springers") operate {{by means}} of a coil {{spring-loaded}} piston pump assembly contained within a compression chamber separate from the gun barrel. Before shooting, the user need to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the pump assembly. The cocking causes the pump piston to move backwards and compress the spring until its rear engages the sear. The act of pulling the trigger disengages the sear, allows the spring to decompress and release the elastic potential energy stored within it, and pushes the piston forward thereby compressing the air in the <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Because the pump outlet (located {{to the front of the}} pump) is directly behind the pellet sitting in the barrel chamber, once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome any static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air. All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes adiabatic heating to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands. This can also cause a phenomenon referred as [...] "dieseling", where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g. petroleum-based lubricant) can be ignited by the heat generated, and lead to combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle upon firing.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the pump}} {{performance}} {{is much better}} than the European designed family pumps that were installed prior to this new design, the India Mark II has several flaws. Many versions of the pump use cast iron riser mains (the pipe that carries water {{from the bottom of the}} borehole to the surface). These pipes rust quickly (sometimes in just 2 years), and either leak water or separate completely from the pump rendering it useless. The pump requires routine maintenance and will fall into disrepair if certain procedures are not followed. A <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder</b> rests at the bottom of the borehole and may needs to be replaced every two years. To remove the cylinder, the riser main also needs to be lifted from the borehole. As one can imagine, lifting up to 100 ft of iron pipe and cylinder from a well is no easy task and requires special tools, a tripod stand, the replacement parts, and most importantly, the know-how to do it. In many developing countries and remote villages, these requirements cannot be met and the pumps often remain broken. Some estimates put the number of broken pumps at 150,000. [...] Longer lasting materials can be retrofitted to the India Mark II. PVC riser mains are less expensive and can last longer. PVC is much lighter, easier to work with and significantly reduce the cost of ownership of the well. PVC has had its own set of issues. In deeper wells, the pumping action can flex the PVC and cause cracking. The connecting rods can also wear through the PVC if the rods are not centred in the riser main. Riser main stabilizer and connecting rod centralizers can be used to prvent this type of wear. Ministry of water officials have pushed back on the using of PVC citing the materials have not been tested thoroughly, though several countries have been using PVC successfully for years. Government corruption may be at the root of the decision. Iron replacement pipes are often paid for by the NGO. The sellers of the pipes are often the ministry members themselves, family or close friends.|$|E
50|$|Cylinder C1 is {{one inch}} in radius, and {{cylinder}} C2 is ten inches in radius.

40|$|In this study, a {{model of}} a high {{pressure}} hydraulic system was developed using the bond graph method to investigate the effect of the internal leakage of its main components (<b>pump,</b> <b>cylinder</b> and 4 / 2 way valve) on the operational characteristics of the system under various loads. All the main aspects of the hydraulic circuit (like the internal leakages, the compressibility of the fluid, the hydraulic pressure drop, the inertia of moving masses and the friction of the spool) were taken into consideration. The results of this modeling were compared with the experimental data taken from the literature and from an actual test platform installed in the laboratory. Modeling and experimental data curves correlate very well in form, magnitude and response times for all the system’s main parameters. This proves that the present method can be used to accurately model the response and operation of hydraulic systems and can thus be used for operational fault diagnosis in many cases, especially in simulating fault scenarios when the defective component is not obvious. This is very important in industrial production systems where unpredictable shutdowns of the hydraulic machinery have a considerable negative economic impact on cost...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} low-cost {{drilling rig}} was imported to Uganda in August 1999 {{and handed over}} to Mpigi District Government. Field trials of this machine were undertaken between 20 th August and 13 th November 1999. This work was enabled through a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding between the Cranfield University/DFID Low Cost well Drilling Project, the Directorate of Water Development (DWD) of the Government of Uganda, and the local Government of Mpigi District. A total of fourteen holes were drilled {{in a range of}} geological formations, and six of these were equipped with U 3 handpumps installed by the direct install method (screen directly attached below <b>pump</b> <b>cylinder,</b> with rising main doubling as well casing). Of these six, one gave inadequate yield, while the other five were put into use as community water supply wells. The trial of the prototype Pounder Rig offered much opportunity to learn about its capability, the practicalities of well construction by the direct install procedure, and the acceptability of the technology to the Ugandan crew. A full design review followed the field trials, and this is reported under separate cover. A number of practical issues arose during this period, including methods of crew payment, funding of trials, logistics, and conflicts between the requirements of drilling trials and the expectations of rural communities. These were addressed as they arose, but with the benefit of hindsight they could no doubt have been resolved in better ways...|$|E
