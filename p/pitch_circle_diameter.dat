40|$|Number of {{conventional}} methods {{are available for}} solving different types of optimization problems. But due to their complexity and convergence problems these methods {{are not able to}} give optimal solution. A gear transmission problem {{is one of the most}} complex optimization problems because of relationship between different variables. A Gear design require the designer to compromise many design variables; i. e. continuous, discrete & integer variables in order to determine best performance of gear set. Therefore researchers are now going to use Evolutionary Techniques. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of such technique. In this paper the attempt has been made to optimize worm and worm wheel with multiple objectives, which takes gear ratio (i), face width of worm & worm wheel (b) and <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> <b>diameters</b> of worm (dw) & worm wheel (dg) as design variables.

50|$|The {{starter ring}} gear is most {{commonly}} made by forming a length of square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together. There then follow various operations such as normalising (to remove stresses and improve the properties in the weld area), turning, generating the teeth by gear hobbing and finally a heat-treatment operation(s). The teeth of the starter ring need to be hardened {{in order to increase}} their strength and resist wear. The normal hardness at <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> <b>diameter</b> is 45-55 HRC. The body of the ring is generally left untreated which gives some ductility for shrinking onto a flywheel or welding to a flexplate.|$|E

40|$|Helically coiled heat exchangers, {{where one}} of the working fluids is flowing through helical coil, are used in various process {{industries}} due to better heat transfer characteristics and the resulting compact layout. Out of these, process requirements make some of the heat exchangers to operate in air-water two-phase region. Even though the characteristics of their operation with single-phase working fluids are well documented, it is not so for the case of two-phase flows. There do exist few experimental results on hydrodynamics of air-water flow through helical pipes. However numerical investigation, which can give much insight into the physics of the problem, is lacking and this is the subject matter of this paper.

Therefore supply of water {{has become one of}} the {{fundamental}} requirements of any society and the need to transfer water has generated the design of various forms of mechanical devices, which can be categorized as pumps. Jet pump is a device that performs its pumping action by the transfer of energy from a high velocity supply jet to one of low velocity suction flow. These two flows mix in the mixing tube and the kinetic energy of the combined flow is converted partially into the pressure energy in the diffuser. The optimization of the design of multi hole nozzle jet pump with various <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> <b>diameter</b> (PCD) and five different diameter mixing tubes.

The experimental program tests {{the top and bottom}} sections of a typical concrete column, and a two-bay waffle floor slab sub-assemblage. The specimen of the scaled bottom section of the typical column is an octagonal section with a circular reinforcing steel arrangement on a <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> <b>diameter</b> of 41 Omm. The reinforcing steel is lapped at the base with a lap length of 45 db. The analysis and results indicate a lap-splice failure mechanism with pinching of the hysteresis loops after the nominal flexural capacity of the specimen is reached. The section has an effective moment of inertia of O. l 6 Ig and a yield drift, 8 y of 0. 62 %. It is possible from the new theory developed to predict whether a lap-splice failure mechanism will form and at what stage strength degradation begins. Hysteretic · modelling of the experimental results is possible with the proposed hysteresis rule. The specimen of the scaled top section of the typical column is an octagonal section with a 215 mm high column capital. The reinforcing steel arrangement is circular on a <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> <b>diameter</b> of 41 Omm with additional reinforcement at 45 degrees in the column capital. The analysis and results indicate a flexural failure mechanism with pinching of the hysteresis loops due to slip of the reinforcement. The section has an effective moment of inertia of 0. 19 Ig and a yield drift, 8 y of 0. 65 %. Hysteretic modelling of the experimental results is possible with currently available hysteresis rules. The scaled two-bay waffle floor slab sub-assemblage supported by three central columns is tested to determine the critical failure mechanism. Scaling symmetry and elongation allowances are incorporated into the design of the testing setup. The results match the structural assessment predictions of a unidirectional flexural yield line failure mechanism. The effective moment of inertia of the floor slab is 0. 43 Ig and the full flexural strength is reached at an interstorey drift of 1. 0 %. The bay elongation characteristics of the specimen are matched by the theory for elongation of unidirectional hinges. Elements of an assessment methodology for reinforced concrete structures are discussed and the outcomes of such an assessment related to damage state indices for both pre and post earthquake assessments.
