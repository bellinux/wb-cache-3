5000|$|After a fair {{serve the}} {{receiver}} strikes the ball {{so that it}} {{either directly or indirectly}} hits the front wall before hitting the floor a second time, goes out of bounds, or strikes the tin. Players thus alternate hitting the ball until one fails to make a fair return. The ball can only be played off the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> if the ball first hits the <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> A ball may hit anywhere on the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> if it first bounces off the floor - otherwise it must stay below the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> out line. Unintentional interference results in a [...] "let" [...] - the point is replayed.|$|R
40|$|Hanukkah lamp {{consisting}} of a <b>back</b> <b>wall,</b> side walls, a hanger, a shamash and a row of oil containers. The openwork <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> is surmounted by two confronting birds and a hanger; decorated with a central vase with flowers & five pointed horseshoe arches. The shamash is in the <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> The rectangular side panels are decorated with a horseshoe arch topped by a hamsa motif. 8 rectangular spouted oil containers.

50|$|The {{entrance}} to the tomb leads to the main chamber. The <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the main chamber is opposite to the entrance and contains two doorways that lead to two other chambers. Frescoes with brightly colored animals adorn the gabled areas {{at the top of}} the front and <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of the chambers. These include bulls, birds, hippocampi, a panther, a lion and a goat. The <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of main chamber is the only wall with frescoes painted below the gable.|$|R
50|$|Along the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> are evenly-spaced orifices, {{indicating}} the support areas {{for the old}} high-choir. To the west (of the left entrance) is the baptistery marked by arched doorway, sheltering a semi-circular stone baptismal fountain decorated with various motifs and along the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> an old closet.|$|R
40|$|An {{inexpensive}} and automated method for presentation of olfactory or tactile stimuli in a two-choice task for rats was implemented {{with the use}} of a computer-controlled bidirectional motor. The motor rotated a disk that presented two stimuli of different texture for tactile discrimination, or different odor for olfactory discrimination. Because the solid olfactory stimuli were placed outside the chamber in metal pods with a mesh at front for odor sampling, “washout” of odors between trials was not necessary. To avoid differential auditory cues from motor rotation, the stimuli were arranged such that on each trial the motor always rotated exactly one quarter revolution (in 1  s), left or right, to present the next stimulus at trial start. To illustrate the use of the equipment, 2 rats were trained on tactile discrimination and 2 rats on olfactory discrimination. The rats sampled the stimulus on the disk through a <b>port</b> on the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> by sniffing at it (olfactory) or touching it (tactile). The task was a go-left/go-right discrimination with the stimulus on the disk being discriminative for which lever provided reinforcement. The rats reached a stable level above 90 % correct after 21 and 32 training sessions for tactile and olfactory discrimination, respectively. The article outlines how the equipment was constructed from low-cost components. Inputs from and outputs to the equipment were implemented through the parallel port of a personal computer without the use of a commercial interface board. The method of automated and low-cost presentation of olfactory or tactile stimuli should be of use for a variety of experimental situations such as matching-to-sample and cross-modal discrimination...|$|R

50|$|The heavy, solid balls take a {{great deal}} of spin, which often causes them to rebound from the walls at {{unexpected}} angles.

50|$|JSW II was {{originally}} created as an Amstrad version of Jet Set Willy (by Derrick P. Rowson and Steve Wetherill), but with expansions {{to exploit the}} 64K RAM of the Amstrad CPC range (compared with the 48K of the ZX Spectrum, the game's home platform). This version was subsequently <b>ported</b> <b>back</b> to the Spectrum. The porting across to Amstrad and <b>porting</b> <b>back</b> to Spectrum may also explain {{a number of other}} small differences, including the loss of coloured backgrounds in certain screens as the CPC version ran in a 4-colour display mode.|$|R
