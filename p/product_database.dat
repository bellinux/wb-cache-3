40|$|It is {{realistic}} {{to assume that}} a database management system provides access to the active domain via built-in relations. Therefore, databases that include designated predicates that hold the active domain, which we call <b>product</b> <b>databases,</b> form a natural notion that deserves our attention. An important issue then {{is to look at}} the consequences of <b>product</b> <b>databases</b> for the expressiveness and complexity of central existential rule languages. We focus on guarded-based existential rules, and we investigate the impact of <b>product</b> <b>databases</b> on their expressive power and complexity. We show that the queries expressed via (frontier-) guarded rules gain in expressiveness, and in fact, they have the same expressive power as Datalog. On the other hand, there is no impact on the expressiveness of the queries specified via weakly-(frontier-) guarded rules since they are powerful enough to explicitly compute the predicates needed to access the active domain. We also observe that there is no impact on the complexity of the query languages in question...|$|R

40|$|Two natural <b>products</b> <b>databases,</b> {{the marine}} natural <b>products</b> <b>database</b> (MNPD) and the {{traditional}} Chinese medicines database (TCMD), were used to find novel structures of potent SARS-CoV protease inhibitors through virtual screening. Before the procedure, the databases were filtered by Lipinski&# 39;s ROF and Xu&# 39;s extension rules. The results were analyzed by statistic methods to eliminate the bias in target-based database screening toward higher molecular weight compounds for enhancing the hit rate. Eighteen lead compounds were recommended by the screening procedure. They were useful for experimental scientists in prioritizing drug candidates and studying the interaction mechanism. The binding mechanism was also analyzed between the best screening compound and the SARS protein. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. I Comput Chem 26 : 484 - 490, 2005.

40|$|Abstract. Recently {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} apply ontology to the product information domain. From a practical point of view, a key problem to streamline this trend is {{how to make a}} <b>product</b> ontology <b>database</b> operational. Technical solutions should consider the characteristics that a pragmatic <b>product</b> ontology <b>database</b> contains; first, the database size is quite huge, and second, ontological manipulation and utilization should be realistically feasible. We recently engaged in a project to build an operational product ontology system. The system is designed to serve as a product ontology knowledge base, not only for the design and construction of <b>product</b> <b>databases</b> but also for the search and discovery of products. From the insights gained through this project, we believe that ontological modeling and its implementation on an operational database, as well as the building applications which exploit ontological benefits, are the most important facets towards the successful deployment of a practical product ontology system. As such, searching techniques should take into account the features of an underlying ontological model especially with product searching being {{one of the most popular}} applications within product information systems. In this paper, we present these two issues; product ontology modeling and searching techniques. Although our work presented herein may not be the only way to build an operational <b>product</b> ontology <b>database,</b> it may serve as an important reference model for similar projects in future. ...|$|R
