Rising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women.

According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature in Delhi during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.|$|E

This article presents {{a study on the}} effects of using different ventilation setups on the concentration level of gases and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> inside a passenger compartment of a university’s shuttle bus. The goal is to find a suitable layout of the air supply diffusers and air return grilles that would lower the concentration level of contaminants inside the passenger compartment. Field measurements were carried out to quantify the concentration of gases (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and formaldehyde) and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> (PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10). The measurements were done at the front section of the bus compartment, close to the front door. The data were acquired in the morning, afternoon and evening hours during a clear and sunny day. The bus travelled along an in-campus road with no passengers. A simplified three-dimensional model of the bus compartment was developed using computational fluid dynamics software. Flow analyses were carried out to predict distribution of gases and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> concentration. The concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and <b>particulate</b> <b>matters</b> obtained from the field measurements were used as boundary conditions and for validating the computational model. A parametric study was carried out to identify a suitable layout of air supply diffusers and air return grilles that would lower the concentration level of the air contaminants.

5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

Exposure to manganese welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (<0.2 mg/m3), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk.

Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish.

5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles.
