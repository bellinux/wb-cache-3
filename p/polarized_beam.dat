25|$|The linear {{polarized}} light that {{is seen to}} rotate in the Faraday effect {{can be seen as}} consisting of the superposition of a right- and a left- circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>beam</b> (this superposition principle is fundamental in many branches of physics). We can look at the effects of each component (right- or left polarized) separately, and see what effect this has on the result.|$|E
25|$|A {{more useful}} <b>polarized</b> <b>beam</b> can be {{obtained}} by tilting the pile of plates at a steeper angle to the incident beam. Counterintuitively, using incident angles greater than Brewster's angle yields a higher degree of polarization of the transmitted beam, at the expense of decreased overall transmission. For angles of incidence steeper than 80° the polarization of the transmitted beam can approach 100% with as few as four plates, although the transmitted intensity is very low in this case. Adding more plates and reducing the angle allows a better compromise between transmission and polarization to be achieved.|$|E
25|$|In circularly {{polarized}} light {{the direction of}} the electric field rotates at the frequency of the light, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. In a material, this electric field causes a force on the charged particles comprising the material (because of their low mass, the electrons are most heavily affected). The motion thus effected will be circular, and circularly moving charges will create their own (magnetic) field in addition to the external magnetic field. There will thus be two different cases: the created field will be parallel to the external field for one (circular) polarization, and in the opposing direction for the other polarization direction – thus the net B field is enhanced in one direction and diminished in the opposite direction. This changes the dynamics of the interaction for each beam and one of the beams will be slowed down more than the other, causing a phase difference between the left- and right-polarized beam. When the two beams are added after this phase shift, the result is again a linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>beam,</b> but with a rotation in the polarization direction.|$|E

Furthermore, we theoretically investigate a scenario in which highly focused azimuthally and radially <b>polarized</b> <b>beams</b> interact with a linear polarizer placed in the focal plane and expand the resulting fields into VSHs.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel <b>polarizing</b> <b>beam</b> splitter {{that uses the}} anisotropic spectral reflectivity (ASR) characteristics of a high spatial frequency multilayer binary grating. By combining the form birefringence effect of a high spatial frequency grating with the resonant reflectivity of a periodic multilayer structure, the ASR characteristics for the two orthogonal linear polarizations are obtained. Such ASR effects allow us to design an optical element that is transparent for TM polarization but reflective for TE polarization. The properties of the <b>polarizing</b> <b>beam</b> splitter are investigated using rigorous coupled-wave analysis. The design results show that an ASR polarization beam splitter can provide a high polarization extinction ratio for optical waves {{from a wide range}} of incident angles and a broad optical spectral bandwidth. Such ASR <b>polarizing</b> <b>beam</b> splitters are uniquely suitable for image processing and optical interconnection applications.

500|$|Quantum logic ("The world obeys a {{non-human}} kind of reasoning.") Associated with John von Neumann, Garrett Birkhoff, and David Finkelstein, {{this interpretation}} holds that quantum objects do possess innate attributes, {{but that the}} relationships between these attributes are governed by a non-distributive lattice, or [...] "wave logic", unlike the Boolean lattice governing classical objects. In {{the example of the}} [...] "three-polarizer paradox", two stacked, orthogonally-oriented polarizers will not allow any light to pass through (the meet of the sets of photons which will pass through each filter is null), yet the insertion of a diagonally-oriented polarizer between them allows some light to pass through the stack. The paradox can be understood by considering a <b>polarized</b> <b>beam</b> as a superposition, with diagonal components that interfere destructively.|$|E

2500|$|Natural light, {{and most}} other common sources of visible light, are incoherent: {{radiation}} is produced independently by {{a large number of}} atoms or molecules whose emissions are uncorrelated and generally of random polarizations. In this case the light is said to be unpolarized. This term is somewhat inexact, since at any instant of time at one location there is a definite direction to the electric and magnetic fields, however it implies that the polarization changes so quickly in time that it will not be measured or relevant to the outcome of an experiment.

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of <b>polarized</b> proton <b>beams</b> in circular accelerators {{is complicated by}} the presence of numerous depolarizing spin resonances. Careful and tedious minimization of polarization loss at each of these resonances allowed {{acceleration of}} <b>polarized</b> proton <b>beams</b> up to 22 GeV.

First tests at IUCF with a full Siberian Snake showed that the spin dynamics with a Snake can be understood in detail.
