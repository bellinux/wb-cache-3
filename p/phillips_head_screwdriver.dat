5000|$|Officially {{licensed}} knives {{from the}} film, based on Jimmy Lile's designs {{were made by}} both United Cutlery and Master Cutlery. Master Cutlery fabricated both a standard and Limited Edition version. The Master Cutlery versions are push tang construction, have a hollow aluminum cord gripped handle that contains an emergency survival kit, and a precision compass mounted in the pommel. The stainless guards incorporate standard and <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver</b> points in the design. They are 1/4" [...] thick 420 J2 stainless blades.|$|E
50|$|One America Plaza is {{the tallest}} {{building}} in San Diego, California and a prominent {{fixture in the}} waterfront district of the downtown San Diego skyline. The 34-story, 500 ft, 623000 sq ft, obelisk-shaped tower was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn Architects and KMA Architecture. The top of the building bears {{a striking resemblance to}} the end of a <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver</b> and has a similar appearance to Two Liberty Place in Philadelphia also designed by Jahn, which is a year older. The building is the maximum height permitted by the US Federal Aviation Administration for a structure in downtown San Diego due to its close proximity to San Diego International Airport.|$|E
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the knurled adjustment nut. Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 Phillips head screws as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the hose barbs, if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the hose barbs, be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample hose is wrapped with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c. Remove the 2 screws (3 on some instruments) on the back side of the handle, as shown in Figure 3, using a # 1 <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> Figure 1. Remove the 3 screws on the sensor head bottom cover...|$|E
50|$|The balls have {{holes on}} {{them so they}} would be slotted into wires in frames for later presentation. When a major prize is drawn, both {{children}} repeat their singing multiple times, and show the balls to a committee, {{and then to a}} fixed camera with two <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver</b> <b>heads</b> mounted at the front, all before being inserted into a frame as the others. Although the drawing is by chance, the children who draw the higher prizes are applauded. Apart from the prizes drawn from the vessel, some prizes are calculated from the winning numbers (view the table with prizes above).|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type cam follower is a slot, for use with a flat <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in blind holes. Hex socket cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the cam follower. RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the hex socket.|$|R

50|$|By design, Torx head screws resist cam-out {{better than}} <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> or slot <b>head</b> screws. Whereas <b>Phillips</b> <b>heads</b> were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R
