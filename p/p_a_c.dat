500|$|Swayamvaram (...) is a 1972 Indian Malayalam-language drama film co-written and {{directed}} by Adoor Gopalakrishnan, starring Madhu and Sharada in the lead roles. Notable smaller roles were played by Thikkurisi Sukumaran Nair, Adoor Bhavani, K. <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> Lalitha, and Bharath Gopi. The film depicts {{the life of a}} couple—Vishwam (Madhu) and Sita (Sharada)—who have married against their parents' wishes and want {{to start a new life}} at a new place. The title is an allusion to the ancient Indian practice of a girl of marriageable age choosing a husband from among a list of suitors.|$|E
500|$|Vishwam, an educated, {{unemployed}} youth, is {{an aspiring}} writer {{and had some}} of his short stories published in the newspapers earlier. He dreams of having his novel, titled Nirvriti (Ecstasy), published in the newspaper. He meets one of the newspaper editors (Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair), who agrees to read his novel but declines to publish it as Vishwam does not have many writings to his credit. Sita is offered {{a job as a}} sales girl but cannot accept it because she is unable to pay the required security deposit of [...] 1,000. With several unsuccessful attempts to get a job, the increasing financial pressure forces them to shift to a slum. With an old lady named Janaki (Adoor Bhavani) and a prostitute named Kalyani (K. <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> Lalitha) as their neighbours, things do not work as desired for the couple and they end up selling Sita's jewellery.|$|E

The study sought to establish whether the similarities represent African retentions and conscious adaptations within the <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> O. <b>C.</b> C. Five aspects were considered in the analysis of African Religion and the <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> O. <b>C.</b> C. They are: revelation, god, humanity, savior/messiah and church. The researcher found that within the theology of the <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> O. <b>C.</b> C. there exist significant African retentions and learned adaptations of African religion that parallel Mbiti 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of African religion. The <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> O. <b>C.</b> <b>C.</b> consider themselves <b>a</b> theological institution with Afrocentric practices and tradition.

Through both private donations and a federal grant from the State Justice Institute, <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> E. has increased in both size and scope since its inception.

(Parent Education and Custody Effectiveness) is an {{interdisciplinary}} volunteer effort by Hofstra University, lawyers, {{and mental health}} professionals, {{in cooperation with the}} New York court system, to help divorcing parents manage conflict for the benefit of their children. Numerous people have contributed to this volunteer research and development effort and deserve recognition for it. So as not to burden the reader with a lengthy acknowledgement at this point, I have placed it at the conclusion of this Article. <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> E. recently received a grant for further pilot programs and a curriculum development project from the State Justice Institute, a federally-funded agency which makes grants to projects it believes show potential for significant improvement of the administration of justice in the state courts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to review the Primary Extension and Challenge Programme (<b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.)</b> in <b>a</b> Metropolitan District, from a parent, classroom teacher and student perspective. <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> has been operating in Western Australian primary schools for approximately 8 years, yet to date, only one evaluation of the <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> programme has been conducted. This was carried out in the Swanbourne District in 1990. It appears vital that the programme is evaluated and that feedback is gained from all those involved - parents, classroom teachers and students. The sample of 106 subjects consisted of students from Years 5, 6 and 7 attending <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> in the metropolitan district, as well as their respective classroom teachers and parents. Views on the effectiveness of the programme were obtained by the implementation of a questionnaire devised by the researcher and given to the sample. The questionnaire itself contained 30 fixed-format questions and 5 open-ended questions. The fixed-format questions were categorised into 5 variables - Expectations, Future Directions, Identification, Outcomes and Knowledge. These variables were derived from the literature review and from the aims of the <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> programme as stated by the Ministry of Education. Interviews following a semi-structured format were also conducted with the co-ordinator and teachers of <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> in the metropolitan district. The data has been analysed by collating and tabulating the results of the completed questionnaires. The {{means and standard deviations of}} each variable have been calculated and comparisons made across variables and between groups. Frequencies of responses to the open-ended questions have been categorised and tallied and general comments regarding common trends were made. Common themes arising from the interviews have also been discussed. Any areas of need will be brought to the attention of the co-ordinator and teachers of <b>P.</b> E. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> in the metropolitan district...|$|R
