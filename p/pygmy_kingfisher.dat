25|$|There is an {{alternate}} strategy for identifying fit mates {{which does not}} rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is probably generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a non-silent mutation will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged {{is made up of}} fit attributes that have attained their plurality through natural selection, while less well adapted attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare. Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features. This will have the effect of a sexual population rapidly shedding peripheral phenotypic features, thereby canalizing the entire outward appearance and behavior of all of its members. They will all very quickly begin to look remarkably similar to one another in every detail, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph of the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> Ispidina picta. Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviors will also be rendered evolutionarily stable, including any cooperative, altruistic and social interactions. Thus, in the example above of the selfish individual who hangs back {{from the rest of the}} hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate. Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.|$|E

50|$|The Mount Selinda area {{is home to}} a {{staggering}} array of indigenous African flora, fungi, birds, butterflies, insects and reptiles. This is mainly due to its position adjoining the Chirinda Forest Botanical Reserve which is protected by law.Among the hundreds of indigenous trees found in Mount Selinda are Red mahogany, Brown mahogany, Natal mahogany, Albizia, White stinkwood, Chirinda stinkwood, Ironwood and colossal specimens of strangling figs. The largest Red Mahogany tree in southern Africa, a 1,000- to 2,000-year-old leviathan with a trunk diameter of some 6 metres stands at Mount Selinda.Other smaller flora include thousands of specimens of the yucca-like Dracaena fragrans, numerous ferns, creepers, vines, epiphytes, montbretia, orchids and flame lilies.Due to its proximity to the botanical reserve, Mount Selinda boasts a dazzling array of bird life, with Trumpeter hornbills, Livingstone's turaco, African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfishers,</b> Firefinches, Sunbirds, African green pigeons, Owls, Nightjars, Eagles and Bee-eaters.The sheer variety and brilliant colours of butterflies in the area is also noteworthy.Samango monkeys are often seen in the area.The reptile population consists of, amongst others, pythons, cobras, vipers, mambas, adders, chameleons, geckos, skinks and lizards. The endemic chameleon Marshall's leaf chameleon, Rhampholeon marshalli, is found within the forest and at the forest margin and it is scattered sparsely in suitable forest habitat throughout the mountains of the Eastern Highlands.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is known}} to be {{inhabited}} by a diverse wildlife species such as the water monitor, Philippine long-tailed macaque, Philippine deer, Philippine <b>pygmy</b> woodpecker, Philippine <b>kingfisher</b> and Brahminy kite. Its forest harbors an important flora consisting predominantly of dipterocarp tree species such as Shorea polysperma (tanguile), Shorea squamata (mayapis), Shorea contorta (white lauan), Shorea negrosensis (red lauan), Parashorea malaanonan (bagtikan), and Syzigium nilidium (makaasim).|$|R
5000|$|Human {{interventions}} {{have created}} a unique cultural landscape {{with a large number}} of typical biotopes which are worthy of protection such as mountain meadows and wetlands [...] Today, even old mining spoil heaps offer a living environment for a variety of plants and animals. 61% of the area of Ore Mountains/Vogtland Nature Park is covered with woodland. In particular in the western Ore Mountains, huge contiguous woodlands spread {{all the way to the}} highest altitudes and are used for forestry. Moreover, in this area several rain water fed bogs are found. Many of these protected areas offer a retreat for rare species with special environmental adaptations such as different species of orchids and gentian, the Eurasian <b>pygmy</b> owl and <b>kingfishers.</b> Some alpine species of plants and animals that have been found at higher altitudes of the Ore mountains are otherwise only known from more distant places in the Sudeten mountains or the Alps. After conditions improved, once displaced species such as Eagle owls and Black storks have returned in the early 21st century.|$|R
50|$|A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study published}} in 2006 found that the American <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was a sister species to a clade containing the green-and-rufous kingfisher (C. inda) and the green kingfisher (C. americana).|$|E
50|$|The first formal {{description}} of the Madagascan <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Alcedo madagascariensis.|$|E

5000|$|Ispidina is a genus {{of small}} insectivorous African river kingfishers. The genus was {{introduced}} by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. The type species is the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Ispidina picta).|$|E
50|$|The green-and-rufous {{kingfisher}} {{resembles the}} American <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> which shares its range, {{but it is}} much larger than its relative, and four times as heavy. It lacks the white lower belly shown by the smaller species, and has more white spots on the wings.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} includes 35 species {{divided into}} four genera. The African dwarf kingfisher is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Myioceyx, and sometimes with the pygmy kingfishers in Ispidina. Molecular analysis suggests that the Madagascan <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is most {{closely related to the}} malachite kingfisher.|$|E
50|$|These similar small kingfishers can be {{distinguished}} by the blue crown of the African pigmy kingfisher. They have different habit preferences and have mostly non-overlapping ranges. The slightly smaller African dwarf kingfisher occurs in tropical rainforests while the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> occurs in dry grassy woodland.|$|E
5000|$|The first formal {{description}} of the American <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 under the binomial name Alcedo aenea.

50|$|The river's {{upper reaches}} form the {{northern}} {{border of the}} Carara Biological Reserve. It is a habitat for American crocodiles, while the marshes located at the river's mouth have many waterfowl and wading birds. Among the many herons and egrets are the boatbill and bare-throated tiger heron, and other birds found here include double-striped thick-knee, mangrove warbler and American <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The African <b>pygmy</b> <b>{{kingfisher}}</b> is [...] in length. The sexes are alike. It is {{very small}} kingfisher with rufous underparts and a blue back extending down to the tail. The dark blue crown of the adult separates it from the African dwarf kingfisher. The smaller size and violet wash on the ear coverts distinguish it from the similar malachite kingfisher.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Chloroceryle aenea) is a {{resident}} breeding kingfisher which {{occurs in the}} American tropics from southern Mexico south through Central America to western Ecuador, and then around the northern Andes cordillera in the east to central Bolivia and central Brazil. The species occupies the entire Amazon basin and the Tocantins River drainage adjacent in Pará state Brazil. It also occurs on Trinidad.|$|E
50|$|They {{have the}} typical {{kingfisher}} shape, {{with a short}} tail and long bill. All are plumaged oily green above, and the underpart colour shows an interesting pattern insofar as the smallest and second largest, American <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> and green-and-rufous kingfisher, have rufous underparts, whereas the largest and second smallest, Amazon kingfisher and green kingfisher, have white underparts with only the males also having a rufous breast band.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} covered by {{secondary}} growth of seasonal semi-deciduous forest, arboreal/shrub/herbaceous formations in the várzea areas, and areas of riparian palms.Vegetation includes the vulnerable Euterpe edulis (Jussara palmito).Vulnerable, threatened or endangered fauna include horned screamer (Anhima cornuta), wood stork (Mycteria americana), black-collared hawk (Busarellus nigricollis), jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), American <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Chloroceryle aenea), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) and South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris).|$|E
5000|$|The African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is {{distributed}} widely in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, where {{it is a common}} resident and intra-African migrant. It is absent from much of the horn of Africa, and also the drier western regions of Southern Africa. It is found in woodland, savanna and coastal forest, it is not bound to water. It is usually found either singly or in pairs and is secretive and unobtrusive.|$|E
50|$|Rarity {{brings with}} it other costs. Rare and unusual {{features}} are very seldom advantageous. In most instances, they indicate a (non-silent) mutation, which {{is almost certain to}} be deleterious. It therefore behooves sexual creatures to avoid mates sporting rare or unusual features. Sexual populations therefore rapidly shed rare or peripheral phenotypic features, thus canalizing the entire external appearance, as illustrated in the accompanying illustration of the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> Ispidina picta. This remarkable uniformity of all the adult members of a sexual species has stimulated the proliferation of field guides on birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and many other taxa, in which a species can be described with a single illustration (or two, in the case of sexual dimorphism). Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species (and is illustrated in the photograph of the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher),</b> its members will avoid mating with members of other populations that look different from themselves. Thus, the avoidance of mates displaying rare and unusual phenotypic features inevitably leads to reproductive isolation, one of the hallmarks of speciation.|$|E
5000|$|A {{description}} of the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher</b> without a scientific name was published in 1780 by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. The binomial name Todus pictus was coined by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. [...] The genus Ispidina [...] was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. The specific epithet picta is from the Latin pictus meaning [...] "painted". Some texts refer to this species as Ceyx pictus.|$|E
50|$|Some {{bird species}} {{commonly}} seen are the hook-billed vanga, Madagascar <b>pygmy</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> crested coua, white-breasted mesite and Madagascar ibis. Raptors sighted in the reserve include the Madagascar harrier-hawk and the Madagascar scops owl. Other avafauna occurring here include red-capped coua and Coquerel's coua, and the vangas Van Dam's vanga, rufous vanga and sickle-billed vanga. Vangas are significant in Madagascar, as 15 of the 16 vanga species are endemic to Madagascar. The greater vasa parrot and Madagascar green pigeon are also indigenous. An important endangered species, the Madagascar fish eagle, {{has a number}} of breeding pairs located in the Ankarana Reserve.|$|E
5000|$|The American <b>pygmy</b> <b>{{kingfisher}}</b> is [...] {{long and}} weighs [...] It has the typical kingfisher shape, {{with a short}} tail and long bill. It is oily green above, with a yellow-orange collar around the neck, rufous underparts and a white belly. The female has a narrow green breast band. Young birds resemble the adults, but have paler rufous underparts, no breast band, and speckled wings and flanks. The nominate southern C. a. aenea has two lines of white spots on the wings, while the northern C. a. stictoptera has three or four lines of spots and a concealed white patch of feathers on the undertail. The two forms intergrade in central Costa Rica.|$|E

Various bird races were first described from this location: a strikingly coloured race of red-necked spurfowl (P. a. swynnertoni), a fulvous-coloured race of wailing cisticola (C. l. mashona), {{a race of}} bar-throated apalis (A. t. arnoldi), the smallish, dusky and streaky-throated Swynnerton's thrush (T. o. swynnertoni) which is endemic to the Eastern Highlands, and a race of olive sunbird (C. o. sclateri). The forest is situated too low for orange thrush, Roberts's warbler, malachite or bronze sunbirds, and too high for yellow-spotted nicator, white-eared barbet or grey waxbill. Crested guineafowl however inhabits its lower elevations and green malkoha recently populated the forest from lower altitudes. Blue-mantled flycatchers occupy the lower altitudes or fringing thickets, but remain segregated from white-tailed flycatchers which occupy the forest proper or higher canopy.|$|E

40|$|Mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks {{were studied}} at Kichwa Tembo Camp {{on the edge}} the Masia Mara National Reserve in Kenya between July and September 2004. Observations were made on 29 mixed-species flocks, in which 24 species participated. African Paradise Flycatcher Terpsiphone viridis, Black-backed Puffback Dryoscopus cubla, Grey-backed Cameroptera Camaroptera brachyura, Collard Sunbird Hedydipna collaris and Cabanis’s Greenbul Phyllastrephus cabanisi were the most common participants in mixed-species flocks, as well as among the most frequently encountered bird species overall. The Black-backed Puffback was identified as the nuclear species in flocks due to their abundance and frequency {{with which they were}} followed by other species. Mixed-species flocks represent another niche dimension in this diverse bird community, but few of these species could be described as flock specialists; most of the birds observed in mixed-species flocks in this study were opportunistic attendant species, including the African <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> Ispidina picta, not previously described as joining mixed-species flocks...|$|E
