40|$|Climate {{change and}} global warming have become a {{challenging}} issue affecting not only humanity but also flora and fauna due to an intense increase of CO 2 emission in the atmosphere which has gradually led to amplification in the average global temperature. Hence, a number of mechanisms have been promoted to diminish the atmospheric commutation of carbon dioxide. One of the well-known techniques is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) which mechanism is based on capture and storage vast quantities of CO 2, as well as Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) which mechanism is based on CO 2 conversion to liquid fuels (e. g. methanol, hydrocarbons, dimethyl <b>carbonate,</b> <b>propylene,</b> dimethyl ether, ethylene, etc.).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{reduction}} of malaria parasite transmission by preventing human-vector contact {{is critical in}} lowering disease transmission and its outcomes. This underscores the need for effective and long lasting arthropod/insect repellents. Despite the reduction in malaria transmission and outcomes in Tanzania, personal protection against mosquito bites is still not well investigated. This study sought to determine the efficacy of menthol <b>propylene</b> glycol <b>carbonate</b> (MR 08), Ocimum suave {{as compared to the}} gold standard repellent N, N-diethyl-methylbenzamide (DEET), either as a single dose or in combination (blend), both in the laboratory and in the field against Anopheles gambiae s. l and Culex quinquefasciatus. Methods In the laboratory evaluations, repellents were applied on one arm while the other arm of the same individual was treated with a base cream. Each arm was separately exposed in cages with unfed female mosquitoes. Repellents were evaluated either as a single dose or as a blend. Efficacy of each repellent was determined by the number of mosquitoes that landed and fed on treated arms as compared to the control or among them. In the field, evaluations were performed by human landing catches at hourly intervals from 18 : 00 [*]hr to 01 : 00 [*]hr. Results A total of 2, 442 mosquitoes were collected during field evaluations, of which 2, 376 (97. 30 %) were An. gambiae s. l while 66 (2. 70 %) were Cx. quinquefaciatus. MR 08 and DEET had comparatively similar protective efficacy ranging from 92 % to 100 for both single compound and blends. These findings indicate that MR 08 has a similar protective efficacy as DEET for personal protection outside bed nets when used singly and in blends. Because of the personal protection provided by MR 08, DEET and blends as topical applicants in laboratory and field situations, these findings suggest that, these repellents could be used efficiently in the community to complement existing tools. Overall, Cx. quinquefasciatus were significantly prevented from blood feeding compared to An. gambiae s. l. Conclusion The incorporation of these topical repellents for protection against insect bites can be of additional value in the absence or presence of IRS and ITNs coverage. However, a combination of both the physical (bed nets) and the repellent should be used in an integrated manner for maximum protection, especially before going to bed. Additional research is needed to develop repellents with longer duration of protection. </p...|$|R

The chemical composition, morphology, and detailed nanostructure of the BiZn 2 VO 6 nanocompounds were characterized. They exhibit rice-like morphology, are highly dense on the substrate and possess a good crystalline quality. Photoelectrochemical characterization in 0. 1 M lithium perchlorate in <b>carbonate</b> <b>propylene</b> shows that BiZn 2 VO 6 nanocompounds are highly suitable as anodes for solar-driven photoelectrochemical applications, providing significantly better performance than with only ZnO NBs. This performance could be attributed to the heterogeneous catalysis effect at nanocompound and ZnO NB interfaces, which have enhanced the electron transfer process on the electrode surface. Furthermore, the charge collection efficiency could be significantly improved through PEG doping of nanocompounds. The photocurrent density of PEG-doped BiZn 2 VO 6 nanocompounds reached values of 2 mA cm− 2 at 1. 23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), over 60 % larger than that of undoped BiZn 2 VO 6 nanocompounds. Photoluminescence emission experiments confirmed that PEG plays a crucial role in lowering the charge carrier recombination rate. The presented BiZn 2 VO 6 nanocompounds are shown to provide highly competitive performance compared with other state-of-the art photoelectrodes.

Also included from literature is a selective review focusing on the mechanistic aspects in the carboxylation of epoxides by metal (salen) complexes. Some applications of iron (salen) complexes as catalyst are mentioned. In the experimental part, the bis(phenoxyiminato) chlorido iron(III) complexes are synthesized, characterized and applied on carbon dioxide/epoxide coupling reactions. Characterization is done by UV-vis, infra-red, nuclear magnetic resonance and electron impact mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis for C, H, and N. Thermogravimetric analysis for the complexes, DFT calculation for the most active species (L 11) 2 Fe(III) Cl and X-ray for (L 6) 2 Fe(III) Cl are also presented. X-ray crystallography reveals the space group of (L 6) 2 Fe(III) Cl to be orthorhombic, Pbcn; a = 29. 0038 (14) Å, b = 8. 6123 (8) Å, c = 10. 7843 (9) Å; α = β = γ = 90 o. The ML 2 Cl complexes are observed to have M-O and M-N bonds involving the phenolic oxygen and azomethine nitrogen. Correlation study between spin state and the Fe-N bond length indicates a high-spin state for Fe(III) nucleus. The geometry around the metal nucleus is distorted square pyramidal. Reaction conditions for catalytic activity were fine-tuned envisaging the exclusive production of cyclic <b>carbonates.</b> <b>Propylene</b> and styrene oxides show high reactivity. The ketiminato complexes show better activity over the aldiminato complexes. Optimal result is obtained in dimethyl formamide at a temperature of 145 oC and carbon dioxide pressure of 10 bars in the presence of tetrabutylphosphonium bromide as co-catalyst. A TOF of 572 /h is observed for propylene oxide. Three reaction mechanisms are proposed. Comparatively the Co(III) analogues are more active, and iodide as a halogen ligand produces a more active complex than chloride. Improving nucleophilicity of Fe(III), elimination of intramolecular H-bond and improving on solubility could yield a more active complex. Iron is a cheap and environmentally benign metal. The use of iron complexes is an attractive alternative to other transition metals which are expensive and/or toxic. The complexes are robust and show high thermal stability. Surprisingly, oligomers of styrene carbonate were noticed at the reaction temperature and pressure known to favor exclusive production of cyclic carbonates. These observations suggest the complexes for a promising study and application in future research for copolymerization. Such copolymers may have useful charateristics for diverse applications.
