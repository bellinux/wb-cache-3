40|$|Abstract. Privacy {{related to}} context {{information}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important issue due to {{the wide range of}} new applications using computational, location and personal context information. In this article, we propose a <b>privacy</b> <b>service,</b> called Context <b>Privacy</b> <b>Service</b> (CoPS), to control how, when and to whom disclose a user’s context information. In order to identify the end-user privacy concerns, we carried out a survey where we asked approximately 100 people about their willingness to use context-aware services and to disclose their context information. Based on the results of this survey and experience reported by other research groups, we identified the main service requirements and designed CoPS aiming flexibility, generality, simplicity and fine-grained privacy control. CoPS is supposed to aid the end-user to define and manage his privacy policies regarding his context information. Keywords: Privacy, Context Service, Context-awareness, Middleware, Collaboration.

30|$|The {{potential}} loss of privacy {{due to the}} use of location based applications {{may be one of the}} greatest obstacles to their wider acceptance. Nevertheless, most research about privacy management to-date has not taken into consideration the complexity in the utilization of collaborative applications that may require users’ location sharing among participants. In this article, we propose a <b>privacy</b> <b>service</b> that helps users to maintain their privacy policy in a flexible and incremental way. We also carried out a qualitative evaluation study whose results illustrate several challenges that should be handled in the design of such a service.|$|E

Besides outlining the guid-ing principles of the interpreter, we show how secure services can be realized based on the classical service triangle and prove its security based on a formal definition of information flow security for functional active objects.

Through the use of an independent <b>Privacy</b> <b>Service</b> (PS), the privacy policies of a service consumer and provider can be compared to create an agreed upon privacy contract. In this paper we further define a metamodel for privacy policy creation and comparison. A trust element is developed as an additional criterion for a privacy policy. We define the PS, outline what operations it must perform to accomplish its goals and present how the PS operates in different scenarios.

40|$|Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a {{computer}} systems design concept which aims to achieve reusability and inte-gration in a distributed environment {{through the use of}} autonomous, loosely coupled, interoperable abstractions known as services. In order to interoperate, communication between services is very important due to their autonomous nature. This communication provides services with their functional strengths, but also creates the opportunity for the loss of privacy. In this paper, a Privacy Protection Framework for Service-Oriented Architecture (PPFSOA) is described. In this framework, a <b>Privacy</b> <b>Service</b> (PS) is used in combination with privacy policies to create privacy contracts that out-line what can and cannot be done with a consumer’s personally identifiable information (PII).
