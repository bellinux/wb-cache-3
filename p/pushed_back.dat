5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E
5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} {{that he was to}} answer to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually <b>pushed</b> <b>back.</b> It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> to August and then again to November.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that airport surface traffic {{congestion}} at major airports is responsible for increased taxi-out times, fuel burn and excess emissions and there is potential to mitigate these negative consequences through optimizing airport surface traffic operations. Due to a highly congested voice communication channel between pilots and air traffic controllers and a data communication channel that is used only for limited functions, one of the most viable near-term strategies for improvement of the surface traffic is issuing a <b>push</b> <b>back</b> advisory to each departing aircraft. This dissertation focuses on the optimization of a <b>push</b> <b>back</b> time window for each departing aircraft. The optimization takes into account both spatial and temporal uncertainties of ramp area aircraft trajectories. The uncertainties are described by a stochastic kinematic model of aircraft trajectories, which is used to infer distributions of combinations of <b>push</b> <b>back</b> times that lead to conflict among trajectories from different gates. The model is validated and the distributions are included in the <b>push</b> <b>back</b> time window optimization. Under the assumption of a fixed taxiway spot schedule, the computed <b>push</b> <b>back</b> time windows can be integrated with a higher level taxiway scheduler to optimize the flow of traffic from the gate to the departure runway queue. To enable real-time decision making the computational time of the <b>push</b> <b>back</b> time window optimization is critical and is analyzed throughout...|$|R

5|$|For two days, the 34th Infantry {{fought the}} {{advancing}} North Koreans in bitter house-to-house fighting. North Korean soldiers continued to infiltrate the city, often disguised as farmers.

At one point, he personally attacked a tank with a hand grenade, destroying it. Large columns of North Korean forces began marching on the city from the south roads, reinforcing those that had crossed the river. American forces pulled back after suffering heavy losses, allowing the North Korean 3rd and 4th divisions to move on the city freely from the north, south, and east roads. The 24th Infantry Division repeatedly attempted to establish its defensive lines, and was repeatedly <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> by the numerically superior North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October the British 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps {{attacked}} {{the east end}} of Poelcappelle. XIV Corps on the left attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division northwards into Houthulst Forest, supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counterattacks also <b>pushed</b> <b>back</b> the 35th Division in the centre as the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments, soaked by rain and churned into deep mud, the British had struggled to advance in places and could not move quickly to outflank pillboxes. Troops of the British 35th Division, reached the edge of Houthulst Forest but in several other places were <b>pushed</b> <b>back.</b> Counterattacks made by the Germans after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army or from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared to attack Passchendaele Ridge.|$|E
