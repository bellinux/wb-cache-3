5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of <b>particles</b> in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas <b>particles</b> move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other <b>particles.</b> Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of <b>particles</b> onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of <b>particles</b> that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker <b>particles</b> in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more <b>particles</b> may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new <b>particles</b> in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing <b>particles</b> below it on both sides (the lighter <b>particles</b> in the figure).|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of <b>particle</b> dynamics is important when determining material erosive wear in any erosion tester, because <b>particle</b> impact conditions are primarily influenced by <b>particle</b> acceleration. Abetter {{understanding of}} <b>particle</b> dynamics in the testers will aid {{the control of}} erosion test conditions and therefore improve the accuracy of measurement. In this paper, <b>particle</b> dynamics in the two most popular erosion testers, the centrifugal erosion tester and the gas-blast erosion tester, has been discussed in detail. Mechanisms of <b>particle</b> acceleration in {{the two types of}} testerswere explored and computational models of <b>particle</b> dynamics were described briefly. A review of the experimental determination of important characteristics of <b>particle</b> dynamics (such as <b>particle</b> velocity, <b>particle</b> trajectory, <b>particle</b> dispersion and <b>particle</b> rotation) showed how they influenced <b>particle</b> movement and therefore the <b>particle</b> impact conditions. In addition, comparison of the <b>particle</b> dynamics in the two types of erosion testers showed that differences of <b>particle</b> acceleration may lead to significantly different results at identical pre-set test conditions. It may be concluded that {{it is not possible to}} directly compare the results obtained in different types of erosion testers even under notionally identical test conditions...|$|R

5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse <b>particles</b> fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash <b>particles</b> may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds.

5|$|Dust <b>particles</b> tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the {{formation}} of larger <b>particles</b> up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust <b>particles</b> grow larger.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic distinguishes three open word classes: nouns, verbs and <b>particles.</b> Verbs inflect for {{person and}} number of subject and object {{as well as for}} mood. Nouns inflect for {{possession}} and for case. <b>Particles</b> do not inflect.|$|E

40|$|<b>Particle</b> {{impingement}} velocity {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters in solid <b>particle</b> erosion. <b>Particle</b> impingement velocity depends on erosion test parameters such as <b>particle</b> acceleration pressure, erodent <b>particle</b> size and standoff distance. Over the past decades many experimental studies have been conducted to examine the effects of these parameters on the <b>particle</b> impingement velocity. In this study, the effects of <b>particle</b> acceleration pressure, erodent <b>particle</b> size and standoff distance on the <b>particle</b> impingement velocity have been investigated by using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, FLUENT. In order to achieve these goals solid <b>particle</b> erosion tests are simulated under various test parameters and the effects of these parameters are examined in detail. The effect of <b>particle</b> velocity on the flow field is characterized with method geometrics. Two-dimensional plane symmetrical models are utilized to reduce the computation time. Plots of gas pressure and <b>particle</b> velocity contours at the XY symmetrical plane from nozzle inlet to substrate were given. CFD analysis showed that all erosion test parameters have dramatically affected <b>particle</b> impingement velocity. <b>Particle</b> impingement velocity was increased with increases in acceleration pressure while it was decreased with increases in both erodent <b>particle</b> size and standoff distance...|$|R

Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha <b>particles,</b> and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha <b>particles</b> to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha <b>particles</b> experienced heavy deflection.
