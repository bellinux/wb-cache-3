2500|$|Tartaric acid is {{the most}} {{prominent}} acid in wine {{with the majority of}} the concentration present as <b>potassium</b> <b>bitartrate.</b> During fermentation, these tartrates bind with the lees, pulp debris and precipitated tannins and pigments. While there is some variation according to grape variety and climate, usually about half of the deposits are soluble in the wine, but on exposure to low temperature they may crystallize out unpredictably. The crystals, though harmless, may be mistaken for broken glass, or simply reckoned unattractive by consumers. To prevent this the wine may undergo [...] "cold stabilization", in which it is cooled to near its freezing point to provoke crystallization before bottling.

50|$|In wine, tartrates are the {{harmless}} crystalline deposits {{that separate}} from wines during fermentation and aging.

50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>bitartrate,</b> {{also known}} as {{potassium}} hydrogen tartrate, with formula KC4H5O6, is a byproduct of winemaking. In cooking it is known as cream of tartar.

50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>bitartrate</b> can {{be mixed}} with an acidic liquid such as lemon juice or white vinegar {{to make a}} {{paste-like}} cleaning agent for metals such as brass, aluminum or copper, or with water for other cleaning applications such as removing light stains from porcelain.This mixture is sometimes mistakenly made with vinegar and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which actually react to neutralize each other, creating carbon dioxide and a sodium acetate solution.|$|E

50|$|Tartaric acid {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} {{organic acid}} that occurs naturally in many plants, most notably in grapes.

It is commonly mixed with sodium bicarbonate and is sold as baking powder used as a leavening agent in food preparation. The acid itself is added to foods as an antioxidant and to impart its distinctive sour taste.|$|E
5000|$|These {{crystals}} also precipitate out {{of fresh}} grape juice {{that has been}} chilled or allowed to stand for some time. [...] To prevent crystals forming in homemade grape jam or jelly, the prerequisite fresh grape juice should be chilled overnight to promote crystallization. The <b>potassium</b> <b>bitartrate</b> crystals are removed by filtering through two layers of cheesecloth. The filtered juice may then be made into jam or jelly.

50|$|Slowing the {{set time}} of plaster of Paris {{products}} (most {{widely used in}} gypsum plaster wall work and artwork casting) is typically achieved by the simple introduction of almost any acid diluted into the mixing water. A commercial retardant premix additive sold by USG to trade interior plasterers includes at least 40% <b>potassium</b> <b>bitartrate.</b> The remaining ingredients are the same plaster of Paris and quartz-silica aggregate already prominent in the main product. This means that the only active ingredient is the cream of tartar.|$|E
50|$|During the {{secondary}} fermentation and aging process, which takes {{three to six}} months, the fermentation continues very slowly. The wine is kept under an airlock to protect the wine from oxidation. Proteins from the grape are broken down and the remaining yeast cells and other fine particles from the grapes are allowed to settle. <b>Potassium</b> <b>bitartrate</b> will also precipitate, a process which can be enhanced by cold stabilization to prevent the appearance of (harmless) tartrate crystals after bottling. The result of these processes is that the originally cloudy wine becomes clear. The wine can be racked during this process to remove the lees.|$|E

50|$|A {{balanced}} chemical leavening such sodium bicarbonate, {{along with}} an acidifier is another common ingredient.

A variety of acidifiers can be used, including <b>potassium</b> <b>bitartrate,</b> tartaric acid, and disodium phosphate. The type of acidifier used depends on when the preferred release of CO2 is. If the release would be most beneficial when the batter is forming, citric acid would be ideal because it is fast acting. The amount of acidifier depends on which agent, such as sodium bicarbonate, is used because they have varying neutralization points.|$|E
