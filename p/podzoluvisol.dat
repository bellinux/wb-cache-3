Aurora planted in hop garden in Croatia, {{near the village of}} Gregurovec (close to Križevci), during the six {{vegetation}} years (2001 [*]–[*] 2006, Srečec et al. 2008). The soil type of examined hop garden is an eutric pseudogley or eutric <b>podzoluvisol.</b> Content of physiological active phosphorus and potash, analysed by the AL-method, was medium. Average content of P 2 O 5 and K 2 O during the all six experimental years was 19.1 and 15.4  mg per 100 grams of soil, respectively. Content of humus in soil was very low, only 1.48 %. Fertilization was provided on the basis of plant uptake for phosphorus and potash and in three splits of nitrogen (50 [*]+[*] 70 [*]+[*] 50  kg/ha N on 20 th May, 10 th June and 5 th July) in all 6 experimental years. Meteorological data in Croatia were collected in Agro Meteorology Station in Križevci, placed five kilometres far away from the hop garden.|$|E
40|$|Humic acids (HA) from soils of very {{different}} origin and bioclimatic conditions (<b>podzoluvisol,</b> phasozem, chernozem, and ferralsol) were fractionated by coupling size-exclusion chromatography and {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} (tandem SEC-PAGE). From each HA, three fractions-A, B, and C+D, with different molecular sizes and electrophoretic mobilities-were obtained and analysed by thermochemolysis, the products being identified subsequently by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Regardless of HA origin, fraction A contained considerably more n-fatty acids and n-alkanes derived from plant waxes than did fractions B and C+D. Lignins accumulated mainly in fractions B and C+D. These results show that tandem SEC-PAGE allowed the separation of soil HA into fractions enriched in different structural components whose distribution was independent of HA genesis.

40|$|Three-year {{investigations}} (2007 - 2009) {{of water}} quality in hydroameliorated agricultural areas {{were carried out}} at the experimental amelioration field “Jelenščak” Kutina, on hydroameliorated Gleyic <b>Podzoluvisol.</b> Soil was drained in four different drainpipe spacing variants (15 m, 20 m, 25 m and 30 m), set up in four replications. The areas of spacing variants were: 1425 m 2, 1900 m 2, 2375 m 2 and 2850 m 2. The same crop was grown in each research year in all variants and the same agricultural management practices were applied. Winter wheat was grown in 2007 and in 2009 and soybean in 2008. Samples of drainage water were taken at drainpipe outlets into the canal. The following parameters were determined in the samples: nitrate concentration and concentration of chlortoluron. Based on the drainage water analysis, it was established that nitrate concentration as well as chlortoluron concentration exceeded the prescribed MAC values (10 mg. dm- 3 NO 3 -N) in each year and in all variants. Nitrogen concentration in drainage water exceeded the MAC in five months (2006 / 07), in two months (2008) and in seven months (2008 / 09). Concentration of chlortoluron in drainage water exceeded the MAC (100 ŋg. dm- 3) in five months (2006 / 07) and in seven months (2008 / 09). Maximum nitrate concentration was up to 28. 42 mg. dm- 3, and that of chlortoluron up to 365 ŋg. dm- 3...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) is of big {{importance}} in the global carbon cycle. Distribution patterns of SOC in various regions of Tunisia constitute a baseline for studies on soil carbon changes. This paper presents Tunisian SOC stock calculated using soil profile descriptions defined by FAO/UNESCO classification, and the digital soil map 1 : 500 000. A soil database has been compiled, containing data from 5024 horizons and 1483 profiles. SOC stocks have been calculated for each profile by a classical method for a given depth, it consists of summing SOC stocks by layer determined {{as a product of}} bulk density (Db), organic carbon (OC) content, and layer thickness. Db values were calculated from pedotransfer functions when we have missing values. SOC stocks by profiles were calculated and linked by soil type to polygons of a digital soil map of Tunisia. In total, Tunisian SOC stocks are 1. 006 Pg C in the 0 to 100 cm soil depth, and 0. 405 Pg C in the upper layer 0 - 30 cm. The surface horizon (0 – 30 cm) stored 40 % of the soil organic carbon stock. OC stocks were higher in Luvisols 71. 6 and 159. 2 t/ha in 0 – 30 and 0 - 100 cm soil depth, respectively. In <b>Podzoluvisols</b> there are 6. 19 and 138. 8 t/ha, but amounts are lower in Lithosols at 18. 4 and 40. 4 t/ha...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSoil mapping in Denmark has a {{long history}} and a series of soil maps based on {{conventional}} mapping approaches have been produced. In this study, a national soil map of Denmark was constructed based on the FAO–Unesco Revised Legend 1990 using digital soil mapping techniques, existing soil profile observations and environmental data. This map was developed using soil-landscape models generated with a decision tree-based digital soil mapping technique. As input variables in the model, more than 1170 soil profile data and 17 environmental variables including geology, land use, landscape type, area of wetlands, digital elevation model and its derivatives were compiled. The predicted map showed that Podzols and Luvisols were the most frequent soil groups, covering almost two-thirds of the area of Denmark. Geographically, Podzols occupied a major portion of western Denmark, where the soils have developed on sandy parent material, whereas eastern Denmark mostly contained Luvisols developed on loamy basal till. The occurrence of the predicted soil groups was assigned using several variables, of the most important was clay content in the topsoil and subsoil, elevation, geology and landscape type. The overall prediction accuracy based on a 20 % hold-back validation data was 60 %, but increased to 76 % when prediction accuracy of similar soil groups was considered. <b>Podzoluvisols</b> and Alisols were among the weakly predicted groups (70 %). Overall, the average prediction uncertainty was less than 34 %. Compared to the existing conventional soil map, the new map showed promising predictions. Validation of the predicted map with different techniques (point validation, prediction confidence analysis, and map-to-map comparison) confirmed that the output is reliable and can be used in various soil and environmental studies without major difficulties. This study also verified the importance of GlobalSoilMap products and a priori pedological information that improved prediction performance and quality of the new FAO soil map of Denmark...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization is {{responsible}} for large environmental changes worldwide. Although traditionally urbanization was related to negative environmental impacts, recent research also highlights positive impacts like the potential of urban areas to store soil organic carbon. The net effect of urbanization on soil organic carbon is poorly understood. Negative influences of construction and soil sealing may be compensated by the establishment of green areas. Possible net effects of future urbanization on soil organic carbon stocks were explored for the Moscow Region, based on the soil survey and land conversion model. The regional urbanization was modelled {{as a function of}} environmental, socio-economic and neighbourhood factors. This yielded three alternative scenarios for urbanization: i) including neighbourhood factors; ii) excluding neighbourhood factors and focusing on environmental drivers; and iii) considering the New Moscow Project that includes the establishment of 1500 km 2 of new urbanized area following governmental regulation. The three scenarios showed substantial expansion of urban areas on 30, 10 and 80 %. The model, considering neighbourhood effect was the most accurate with 91 % of correct predictions. Urbanization in the region mainly converted forests, fallow and arable lands. The negative effect of urbanization (i. e soil sealing and excavation of topsoil for building construction) was compensated by positive effect (e. i. urban greenery and “cultural layers”). In result an increase of soil organic carbon stocks of 4. 2 ± 1. 7 to 11. 0 ± 2. 6 Tg C was shown for all three scenarios. The highest increases in soil organic carbon stocks occurred on the less fertile Orthic Podzols and Eutric <b>Podzoluvisols,</b> whereas SOC stocks in Orthic Luvisols, Luvic Chernozems, Dystric Histosols and Eutric Fluvisols increased less. Subsoil C-stocks were much more affected with an extra 4 ± 1. 6 to 10 ± 2. 4 Tg soil organic carbon than those in the topsoils. The highest increase of both topsoil and subsoil soil organic carbon stocks occurred in the New Moscow scenario with the highest urbanization. Even when the relatively high uncertainties of the absolute C-stocks are considered, the outcomes highlight the potential of cities to enhance soil organic carbon storage. This will progressively become more important in the future following the increasing world-wide urbanization. </p...|$|R
