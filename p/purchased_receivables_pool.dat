50|$|The most {{traditional}} ABCP {{program is a}} multi-seller program, in which a conduit <b>purchases</b> <b>receivables</b> and loans from multiple firms. The sponsor is typically a financial institution that provides the conduit with a committed liquidity line, administers its daily operations, and sometimes also provides the conduit with credit enhancement through a letter of credit that absorbs credit losses. At the end of July 2007, just before the widespread turmoil, there were 98 multi-seller programs in the U.S. ABCP market with outstanding of $525 billion, about 45 percent of total ABCP outstanding.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{commercial}} banks established asset backed commercial paper conduits (ABCP conduits) to finance corporate customer receivables. The ABCP conduit <b>purchased</b> <b>receivables</b> {{from the bank}} customer and issued asset-backed commercial paper to finance that purchase. The bank “advising” the ABCP conduit provided loan commitments and “credit enhancements” that supported repayment of the commercial paper. Because the ABCP conduit was owned by a third party unrelated to the bank, {{it was not an}} affiliate of the bank. Through ABCP conduits banks could earn “fee income” and meet “customers’ needs for credit” without “the need to maintain the amount of capital that would be required if loans were extended directly” to those customers.|$|R

The forfaiter may also be immunized from certain risks if the transaction involves payment by negotiable instrument. The forfaiting is a transaction involving the sale of one of the firm's transactions. Factoring is also {{a financial}} transaction involving the purchase of financial assets, but factoring involves the sale of any portion of a firm's receivables.|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} risks {{involved}} with master trusts specifically. One {{risk is that}} timing of cash flows promised to investors might be different from timing of payments on the receivables. For example, credit card-backed securities can have maturities of up to 10 years, but credit card-backed receivables usually pay off much more quickly. To solve this issue these securities typically have a revolving period, an accumulation period, and an amortization period. All three of these periods are based on historical experience of the receivables. During the revolving period, principal payments received on the credit card balances are used to <b>purchase</b> additional <b>receivables.</b> During the accumulation period, these payments are accumulated in a separate account. During the amortization period, new payments are passed through to the investors.|$|R
50|$|A master {{trust is}} a type of SPV {{particularly}} suited to handle revolving credit card balances, and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times. In a typical master trust transaction, an originator of credit card <b>receivables</b> transfers a <b>pool</b> of those <b>receivables</b> to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables. Often there will be many tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables. After this transaction, typically the originator would continue to service the receivables, in this case the credit cards.|$|R
50|$|First National Bank of Kansas (FNBK) was {{chartered}} in 1993 when FNNI purchased approximately $80 million deposits from {{a failed}} financial institution. The bank purchased additional deposits approximating $220 million from another financial institution in 1994. To profitably invest this large deposit base, FNBK <b>purchased</b> credit card <b>receivables</b> from an affiliated bank. Most of the receivables originated outside the bank's assessment area. While credit card receivables still represent {{a large percentage}} of bank assets, credit card lending is not a strategic goal for the bank.|$|R
50|$|Heller was {{a pioneer}} {{of the use of}} {{factoring}} and developed it into a more sophisticated form of finance of company business accounts receivable, thus providing capital for businesses to grow by giving them cash to expand the business cycle by <b>purchasing</b> an account <b>receivable</b> at a discount, with or without recourse to the seller. Then, by owning it, he would collect the balance of the receivable in full. The profit was derived by the amount of discount collected by the factor. As the factoring business expanded, it was done in bulk with contractually obligated clients selling their receivables by assignment to the factoring company. Advances against these <b>receivables</b> <b>purchased</b> were made and the client paid a fee to the factor. As American businesses became more sophisticated and manufacturing became more prominent after World War II, certain industries primary used factoring as a form of business finance and credit insurance on the credit risk of its customers. These industries were primarily involved with the manufacturing of textiles and carpeting, although other businesses used this type of financing model for their own credit needs. Capital for businesses was not then available from banks because the banks felt business loans were too risky.|$|R

Czech Consolidation Agency (CKA) has been called the [...] "bad bank" [...] of the state, into which the problem loans from the privatization of large banks after debt relief were redirected. EC Group, which was then owned by former collaborators of Pavel Tykač Jan Dienstl and Pavel Šimek paid 3.4 billion CZK for a package of receivables.. The group overpayed such renowned consortiums as Goldman Sachs / Flow East or PPF / CS First Boston, by about half a billion CZK. In 2003, the EC Group sued ČKA and demanded the return of about 570 mil CZK against portions of the claims that ČKA never owned due to legal shortcomings and therefore the claims could not even be sold. ČKA eventually returned about 440 mil CZK based on a judicial verdict..|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{there has}} been a pivot back to Receivables Financing Factoring (finance) programs, {{primarily}} driven by enhancements in technology which has increased the efficiency and attractiveness of Receivables-based programs. In a Supplier Financing model there is a heavy administrative burden caused by the need to negotiate <b>Receivables</b> <b>Purchase</b> Agreements with each individual Supplier, whereas in Factoring (finance) programs only one RPA is required with the Vendor. In addition, traditionally there was a larger effort involved in calculating the Funders credit risk exposure in a Receivables-based program due to the many Buyers which needed to be credit evaluated on an ongoing basis. Technology has now automated much of the credit evaluation process allowing program Funders access to real-time Buyer risk ratings across their portfolio. This transparency generates increased credit appetites from program Funders and Credit Insurers and benefits the Vendor through attractive rates and increased program credit limits on their Buyers. Vendors can also use the receivables-based approach to increase competitiveness by extending payment terms to their Buyers Off-balance-sheet. Examples of solution providers include Global Supply Chain Finance Ltd.|$|R
40|$|Otis Elevator, France, {{a leader}} in the sale and service of {{elevators}} and related products in the French market, started reviewing the managerial and operational procedures surrounding the processing of a customer order in 1986. The resulting 'Master Plan' project aimed at simplifying these procedures, from the initial contact with the customer through the installation of the elevator, with decentralization of responsibility driving the design. Central to the Master Plan was the need to adjust the organizational structure to the decentralization of responsibility and to develop new IT applications to support business and management activities. These applications, developed between 1986 and 1992, concerned negotiation, sales/contract management, invoicing/accounts <b>receivable,</b> <b>purchasing</b> management, and accounting. Tawfik Jelassi describes a case study of the 'Master Plan' project at Otis Elevator, France, the development methodology used and the role played by different groups within the company. A special emphasis is put on the identification of new IT applications, their inter-dependence with the organizational changes, and the subsequent implementation process. An underlying issue that the case addresses is the business value of information technology and the strategic advantage that it can provide to a company. ...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} small {{businesses}} are suffering from a credit crunch, 'niche' financial institutions are filling the void left by more traditional sources of financing, such as commercial banks. The authors argue {{that the most important}} of these niche players are community-based factor companies, which are rapidly expanding from their client base in apparel and textiles to finance a range of firms in everything from electronics to health care. The <b>purchase</b> of accounts <b>receivable</b> by factors enhances the balance sheets of their clients, making it easier for the clients to obtain bank financing. Also, because factors are more interested in the creditworthiness of a client's customers than of the client itself, they are willing to extend loans in excess of collateral to rapidly growing businesses. Because factors are becoming an increasingly important source of financing for small and start-up businesses, the authors propose that factors be encouraged to play a broader role in financing firms in distressed communities by (1) making some factors eligible for funding and assistance under legislation regulating community development financial institutions and (2) by allowing investments by banks in factors to count toward compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act...|$|R
40|$|Factoring is the {{contract}} negotiated continuous purchase of short-term debts, incurred by supplier {{due to the}} provision of unsecured credit supply. Factoring is a method of financing that can offer a lot to businesses, especially with its added value. This method mainly includes protection before customers’ insolvency, management of receivables, {{as well as the}} opportunity to dispose with the funds {{before the end of the}} maturity of receivables. Forfeiting is the <b>purchase</b> of export <b>receivables</b> on credit at the time of delivery. It is related to receivables with the future maturity denominated in freely convertible currency, and secured with a bank aval bill, letter of credit with deferred payment or a bank guarantee. The conditions, under which each company provides forfeiting, depend essentially on the creditworthiness of the applicant and customer, as well as creditworthiness of the bank that issued the payment instrument.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my work will be the {{introduction}} of factoring {{as a method of}} financing short-term loans. Factoring is the <b>purchase</b> of short-term <b>receivables</b> to maturity under the factoring agreement, which establishes the rights and obligations of the parties. Factoring is implemented in two basic ways, either to themselves factoring company transfers the risk of failure to pay debts (without the possibility of reverse recourse), or the risk is left to the original owner receivable (with the possibility of re-recourse). From the form of factoring is then derived its price, which consists of two components, the components of risk and administrative costs. Through factoring the original owner receivable obtains most of the nominal value of the claim immediately and these financial funds may be used freely. The aim of the work will assess the financial situation of Kasalova pila, Ltd., which to finance their debts began to use factoring services in 2009. The central focus will therefore be placed on the use of factoring, but since we take into account the opportunity costs to company {{from the fact that the}} part of the funds held in the form of receivables (receivables not progress to factoring), receivables financing options will be supplemented by the use of business credit. This loan will therefore cover the portion of receivables that will not be progressing to the factor, thus ensuring the possibility of any use of the funds that would otherwise be bound by the claims. Subsequently, the current status in society compared with other variants of the layout of finance receivables, which find that the opportunity for your company represent the least expensive form of this funding...|$|R
