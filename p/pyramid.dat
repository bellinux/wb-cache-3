5|$|<b>Pyramid</b> B6 {{enclosed}} {{the southern}} {{portion of the}} west side of the Group B plaza. It is very poorly preserved and the top of the <b>pyramid</b> has collapsed, leaving only the lower walls. Archaeological investigation revealed that the final version of the <b>pyramid</b> had been built over a preceding version.|$|E
5|$|The Layer <b>Pyramid</b> (known locally in Arabic as el haram el midawwar, , meaning 'rubble-hill pyramid') is {{a ruined}} step <b>pyramid</b> {{dating to the}} 3rd Dynasty of Egypt (2686 BC to 2613 BC) and located in the {{necropolis}} of Zawyet El Aryan. Its ownership is uncertain and may be attributable to pharaoh Khaba. The <b>pyramid</b> architecture, however, {{is very similar to}} that of the Buried <b>Pyramid</b> of king Sekhemkhet and for this reason is firmly datable to the 3rd Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The West <b>Pyramid</b> of the E-Group {{produced}} ceramic evidence dating the Late Preclassic, Early Classic and Late Classic. Although {{the limestone}} blocks used for its construction are very poorly preserved, the West <b>Pyramid</b> {{is believed to}} have been a radial <b>pyramid</b> dating to the Late Preclassic Period.|$|E
25|$|Nubian <b>pyramids</b> were {{constructed}} (roughly 240 of them) at three sites in Sudan {{to serve as}} tombs for the kings and queens of Napata and Meroë. The <b>pyramids</b> of Kush, also known as Nubian <b>Pyramids,</b> have different characteristics than the <b>pyramids</b> of Egypt. The Nubian <b>pyramids</b> {{were constructed}} at a steeper angle than Egyptian ones. <b>Pyramids</b> were still being built in Sudan as late as 200 AD.|$|R
5000|$|Nubian <b>Pyramids</b> were {{constructed}} on three major sites: El-Kurru, Nuri, and Meroë. More <b>pyramids</b> {{were constructed}} {{and for the}} longest time in Nubia than in Egypt. Nubia contains 223 <b>pyramids.</b> They were smaller than Egyptian <b>pyramids.</b> Nubian <b>pyramids</b> were for kings and queens. The general construction of Nubian <b>pyramids</b> consisted of steep walls, a chapel facing East, stairway facing East, and a chamber access via the stairway.|$|R

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the layer <b>pyramid</b> allows it to be securely dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the {{architecture of}} the layer <b>pyramid</b> with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer <b>pyramid</b> to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer <b>pyramid</b> exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer <b>pyramid</b> is a clearly advanced version of the buried <b>pyramid</b> of Sekhemkhet.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} <b>pyramid</b> is made {{of roughly}} hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main <b>pyramid.</b> These were disposed in two layers and finally clad with fine Tura limestone which fell victim to stone robbers. Consequently, the poor quality <b>pyramid</b> core was exposed and degradated rapidly with only the two lowest layers of the <b>pyramid</b> still visible today.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of funerary monuments {{began in the}} reign of Djoser, who built his complex entirely of stone {{and placed in the}} enclosure a step <b>pyramid</b> under which he was buried: the <b>Pyramid</b> of Djoser. For the rest of the Old Kingdom, tomb and temple were joined in elaborate stone <b>pyramid</b> complexes. Near each <b>pyramid</b> complex was a town that supplied its needs, as towns would support temples throughout Egyptian history. Other changes came in the reign of Sneferu who, beginning with his first <b>pyramid</b> at Meidum, built <b>pyramid</b> complexes symmetrically along an east–west axis, with a valley temple {{on the banks of the}} Nile linked to a <b>pyramid</b> temple at the foot of the <b>pyramid.</b> Sneferu's immediate successors followed this pattern, but beginning in the late Old Kingdom, <b>pyramid</b> complexes combined different elements from the axial plan and from the rectangular plan of Djoser. To supply the <b>pyramid</b> complexes, kings founded new towns and farming estates on undeveloped lands across Egypt. The flow of goods from these lands to the central government and its temples helped unify the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The <b>pyramid</b> core was {{constructed}} in a step-like structure, a construction technique {{similar to that of}} the 4th dynasty although the building material was of a significantly lower quality. The outer casing of the <b>pyramid</b> was made of fine Tura limestone which certainly ensured Userkaf's construction an appearance {{similar to that of the}} glorious 4th Dynasty pyramids. There was however no red granite paneling over the lower part of the <b>pyramid</b> as in the case of the <b>Pyramid</b> of Menkaure.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pyramid</b> {{does not}} have {{internal}} chambers, the chambers being located underground. These were constructed in a deep open ditch dug before the <b>pyramid</b> construction started and only later covered by the <b>pyramid.</b> The entrance to the underground chambers is located north of the <b>pyramid</b> from a pavement in the court {{in front of the}} <b>pyramid</b> face. This is different from the 4th dynasty pyramids for which the entrance to the internal chambers is located on the <b>pyramid</b> side itself. The entrance was hewn into the bedrock and floored and roofed with large slabs of white limestone, most of which have been removed in modern times.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pyramid</b> has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof. Similarly to the main <b>pyramid,</b> the substructure was constructed in a shallow open pit dug into the ground before the <b>pyramid</b> construction started and is therefore located just below ground-level.|$|E

5|$|The {{temple and}} <b>pyramid</b> were also {{surrounded}} by a brick wall. Likely for reasons of economy, the causeway leading to the mortuary temple {{at the foot of}} the <b>pyramid</b> was never built, no satellite <b>pyramid</b> was added to the mortuary complex, and the valley temple was left unfinished. Consequently, the priest of the mortuary cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises, in dwellings of mud-bricks and rushes, rather than in the <b>pyramid</b> town closer to the Nile valley.|$|E
5|$|The tomb of Amenemhat IV has {{not been}} identified. He is {{nonetheless}} often associated with the ruined Southern Mazghuna <b>pyramid.</b> No inscriptions have been found within the <b>pyramid</b> to ascertain the identity of its owner, but its architectural similarity with the second <b>pyramid</b> of Amenemhat III at Hawara led egyptologists to date the <b>pyramid</b> to the late 12th or early 13th Dynasty. Less likely, Amenemhat IV could have been interred in Amenemhat III's first <b>pyramid</b> in Dashur, since his name has been found on an inscription in the mortuary temple.|$|E

5|$|A {{minority}} of modern Egyptologists think that Khaba might be identical to a Ramesside cartouche name known as Huni. This name can be credited to a king who is handed {{down by the}} Ramesside scribes as the last ruler of the 3rd dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Nicolas Grimal, Wolfgang Helck, and Toby Wilkinson point to a step <b>pyramid</b> at Zawyet el'Aryan, called the Layer <b>Pyramid.</b> This monument is assigned to Khaba (see section below) and since Stadelmann and Wilkinson hold that the <b>pyramid</b> was finished, they believe that a long-reigning king, such as king Huni, would have been necessary to oversee the project. Huni is attested in the Turin Canon to have reigned for 24 years. In addition, Stadelmann points to the seal impressions found at Elephantine: they come from a site very close to a stepped <b>pyramid</b> which {{is said to have}} been built by Huni.|$|E
