There are others to whom such a lantern device has been attributed, such as Giambattista della Porta, and Cornelis Drebbel: the <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> is the use of a lens for better projection.

[...] The Supreme Court observed that the sole <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> was whether the Constitution entitled women to vote despite state laws limiting this right to men only. [...] The state of Missouri did not send counsel to defend its decision before the Supreme Court, choosing instead to justify its decision in a three-sentence demurrer.|$|E

2500|$|... …Of course {{even if the}} {{implication}} of the dictum in Gerstein were what the Court says, that would be poor reason for keeping a wrongfully arrested citizen in jail contrary to the clear dictates of the Fourth Amendment. What is most revealing of the frailty of today's opinion is that it relies upon nothing but that implication from a dictum, plus its own (quite irrefutable because entirely value laden) [...] "balancing" [...] of the competing demands {{of the individual and}} the State. With respect to the <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> here, different times and different places — even highly liberal times and places — have struck that balance in different ways. Some Western democracies currently permit the Executive a period of detention without impartially adjudicated cause. In England, for example, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, 14(4), 5, permits suspects to be held without presentation and without charge for seven days. 12 Halsbury's Stat. 1294 (4th ed. 1989). It was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to put this matter beyond time, place and judicial predilection, incorporating the traditional common-law guarantees against unlawful arrest. The Court says not a word about these guarantees, and they are determinative. Gersteins approval of a [...] "brief period" [...] of delay to accomplish [...] "administrative steps incident to an arrest" [...] is already a questionable extension of the traditional formulation, though it probably has little practical effect and can perhaps be justified on de minimis grounds. [...] To expand Gerstein, however, into an authorization for 48-hour detention related neither to the obtaining of a magistrate nor the administrative [...] "completion" [...] of the arrest seems to me utterly unjustified. Mr. McLaughlin was entitled to have a prompt impartial determination that there was reason to deprive him of his liberty — not according to a schedule that suits the State's convenience in piggybacking various proceedings, but as soon as his arrest was completed and the magistrate could be procured.” ...|$|E
