40|$|This project {{examines}} the challenges for U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion and its {{strategies in the}} cases of Jordan and Tunisia. First, the project analyzes the U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion strategy, investigating what projects have been conducted in Jordan and Tunisia. The project argues, that U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion is flawed on a conceptual-, priority- and strategic level, and we find that in order to reconceptualize the democracy promotion strategy, a stronger inclusion of the voices of the Arab people needs to be incorporated. Then, the project maps out the opinions of Jordanians and Tunisians alike, using data from the Arab Barometer. The project finds that democracy is desired, but that the views on the concept are highly varied. Finally, the project discusses the findings using Banai’s three principles for achieving democratic solidarity. By combining the voices population with the flaws in the democracy promotion framework, the project discusses different ways to reconceptualize democracy promotion, so that a democratization process happens {{on the basis of the}} people who live it, and not U. S. strategic interests in the region...|$|R
40|$|China {{represents}} an uncomfortable thorn in U. S. {{efforts to promote}} democracy around the world. While some projects have been successful, a large gap exists between the increasing U. S. funding in China and its “limited impact. ”  Moreover, U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion in China has contributed to strategic distrust between China and the United States; Beijing perceives it as a strategic move to destabilize the rise of China and sabotage the Communist Party 2 ̆ 7 s leadership.  At the same time, China 2 ̆ 7 s growing power while maintaining one-party rule and rejecting democratic change generates fear and distrust among many Americans. The scholarship on U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion is largely and understandably dominated by U. S. scholars with U. S. perspectives. Chinese officials’ and scholars’ responses and perspectives are, however, often overlooked, particularly by democracy-promotion professionals, and are largely omitted from literature on the subject. This paper attempts {{to understand how the}} complex and multilayered U. S. democracy-promotion program in China has contributed to this strategic distrust. It examines China 2 ̆ 7 s responses to U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion and explains the confrontational dynamic between Washington and Beijing. The paper also explores whether and how Beijing and Washington can create mutual trust rather than suspicions. Some skeptics may consider this naïve, but on historical and political grounds it is actually a realistic possibilit...|$|R

40|$|Ghana 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>democracy</b> {{has been}} hailed by scholars, practitioners, and the {{international}} community in recent years as a shining example in the West African subregion {{as a result of the}} country 2 ̆ 7 s record of organizing successive elections with minimal or no violence. However, the evaluation of Ghana 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>democracy</b> has predominantly focused on the elections and disproportionately captures the views of the political elite; conspicuously missing is the perspective of the ordinary Ghanaian. This presents an incomplete picture of Ghana 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>democracy,</b> given the relevance of citizens 2 ̆ 7 participation in democratic societies. To address this gap in knowledge, this qualitative case study explored the practice of democracy in Ghana under the fourth republic from the perspective of the citizenry. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with purposefully sampled ordinary Ghanaian citizens (n = 15), observation, and documents review. The data were then subjected to thematic and content analysis to reveal themes, categories, and patterns. The results revealed that the participating Ghanaians had dichotomous views, opinions, and experiences of democracy. Their experiences and opinions of the electoral system were generally positive, while their experiences and opinions of governance in the intervening years were generally negative. The study 2 ̆ 7 s results should inspire a paradigm shift in the responsiveness of government to citizens and how the government engages with citizens on policy formulation and implementation. This study 2 ̆ 7 s results can encourage positive social change with respect to the manner in which democratic performance is evaluated in Ghana by scholars, practitioners, {{and the international}} community...|$|R

It was conducted from the on-going project on sustainable energy system for the provision of rural electrification services under PITRO. This project is a min grid photovoltaic system, producing and distributing solar electricity to around 68 households and lighting the village streets with street lights. The study aimed at analysing the contribution and effectiveness of PV solar electricity on rural livelihood transformation, together with <b>people</b> <b>s</b> sense of project ownership, perceptions and attitude over the effectiveness of PV solar electricity on their livelihood transformation.

40|$|Democratic {{principles}} {{have traditionally}} {{not been an}} important aspect of the EU s foreign policy in the Mediterranean region, yet, with the launch of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), promotion of political reforms and norms appears to take on a more prominent role in the EU s Mediterranean policy. This analysis seeks to explain this emerging emphasis on democracy promotion in the Mediterranean region. Based on an analytical distinction between pragmatic, ethical-political, and moral arguments, this study suggests that the EU <b>s</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion is founded on more than utility considerations. In fact, it indicates that a sense of liaison-based duty to assist close neighbours is particularly important in understanding the focus on democratic principles in the ENP, and finally, that moral commitments appear to play a role, even if only an adjusting one. Hence, in light of the literature on the EU s foreign policy, and in particular its so-called normative dimension, these findings present a nuanced picture and suggest that the EU <b>s</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion is neither a purely interest-based nor norm-based policy, rather it has elements of both, yet with a greater emphasis upon the latter...|$|R

40|$|The Egyptian Revolution of 2011 was an {{internal}} movement {{fueled by the}} conviction that change was necessary and could not happen within the existing government system. Although {{it is not yet}} clear how much democratic and developmental progress will result from the sudden regime change, international optimism abounds that the Egyptian people will achieve greater freedom. While {{it is clear that the}} Egyptian people took their destiny in their own hands, it is less clear what role, if any, other international actors played in this revolution. This presentation will investigate the role of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion in Egypt 2 ̆ 7 s political system in the final years of Mubarak 2 ̆ 7 s regime by focusing on the USAID Office of Democracy and Governance as the main vehicle for democracy assistance. In the last decade, the U. <b>S.</b> increased <b>democracy</b> promotion in Egypt, but democracy ratings stagnated. Every country presents different constraints and requires a unique approach to democracy promotion. In Egypt constraints included bureaucracy within USAID, obstruction by the Egyptian government, and public antagonism to U. S. engagement. In addition, the U. S. 2 ̆ 7 s strategic economic and security interests in Egypt contradicted democracy promotion. In response to these constraints, USAID 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Office of <b>Democracy</b> and Governance was designed to foster limited democratic change from within the authoritarian government. USAID Democracy and Governance programs were not intended to cause or facilitate a popular movement. The actions carried out by USAID were limited, symbolic, and ultimately, reinforced the legitimacy of Mubarak 2 ̆ 7 s regime. Ignoring the actual demands of the people and the conditions for change necessary for democratic progress in Egypt served neither moral nor practical interests and undermined the foundations of U. <b>S.</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion...|$|R
