40|$|American taxpayers {{spend more}} than $ 100 billion per year on federal {{construction}} projects. Yet massive construction delays, huge budget overruns, and unorganized contractors increase the cost of construction for the federal government. Passed in 1935, the Miller Act attempted to protect {{the federal government in}} the event that the contractor defaulted or was unable to complete the project. By requiring contractors to enlist third party “sureties” as guarantors on projects, the Miller Act provides the government with the assurance that another party will step in to complete projects if need be. Contractors are typically paid via periodic <b>progress</b> <b>payments,</b> with monthly invoices paid for work completed. If a contractor defaults, forcing a surety to take over on the project, the doctrine of equitable subrogation entitles the surety to all remaining <b>progress</b> <b>payments</b> due to the contractor. Fearing that default may be imminent and eager to receive any payments it can, a surety may be inclined to warn the federal government of imminent contractor default, {{at the same time that}} the contractor assures the federal government that it can perform. A series of Federal Circuit cases allows the surety to sue the federal government to recover <b>progress</b> <b>payments</b> that were already made to the contractor, even though those payments were made prior to the contractor defaulting, in accordance with federal regulations. Given an opportunity to reduce this risk of double payment, the Federal Circuit instead created an incoherent and unworkable progress-payment framework in Balboa Insurance Co. v. United States, complicating a government official’s regulatory mandate to provide <b>progress</b> <b>payments</b> to contractors. The court misinterpreted a standard that is normally extremely deferential to the federal government, and created a complex eight-factor behemoth that unreasonably burdens the federal government. This Note proposes new regulations to replace Balboa, which focuses on whether the federal government received reasonable assurances from the contractor that it would complete performance...|$|R

40|$|Like {{constructing}} a building, performance on many contracts occurs in phases. As time passes, the promisor sinks more costs into performance and less expenditure remains.

We show that <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> contracts, which are commonplace in some industries, are materially equivalent to decreasing liability contracts.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{research work}} has been conducted on cash flow forecast, planning, and management, the objective is constantly the maximization of profit/final cash balance, or minimization of total project cost. This paper presents a multi-objective fuzzy linear programming model (FLP) for resolving the optimization problem of three conflicting objectives: final cash balance, cost of money, and initial cash balance. The proposed model depends on Jiang et al. (2011) Model. In the new formulation, both the advanced payment and delay of owner's <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> one period were considered. Literature concerned with cash flow studies and models for construction projects was reviewed. Fuzzy linear programming applications in literature was presented and it's concept was then described. Jiang et al. (2011) Model is presented. The proposed model development was then presented. The proposed model was validated using an example project. An optimization of each individual objective was performed with a linear programming (LP) software (Lindo) that gave {{the upper and lower}} bounds for the multi-objective analysis. Fuzzy linear programming was then applied to optimize the solution. Four cases are considered: considering advanced payment and delay of owner's <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> one period simultaneously, then separately, and neglecting advanced payment and delay of owner's <b>progress</b> <b>payment.</b> Penalty of delayed payment have been also considered. Analysis of the results revealed that the model is an effective decision making tool to be used by industry practitioners with reasonable accuracy...|$|E

Analysis {{is devoted to the}} <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> method recommended by the Navy Task Group to Study Shipbuilding Progress Payments. An examination is made of both Government profit policy and contract financing as they relate to the shipbuilding industry. A computer model was developed which makes explicit the discounted cash flow in a given contract and displays all government payments to the contractor as well as the contractor's share of contract financing. The time-adjusted rate of return which is implied by the terms and conditions of the contract is computed by the model. A decision process for computing a profit negotiation position is developed which integrates (1) the IAC profit computation system, (2) the proposed shipbuilding <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> method, and (3) the prevailing market conditions.

This also added to the final costs, which were around £33,000.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{focus of our}} MBA project is in Earned Value Management System (EVMS). This MBA project objectively and quantitatively portrays EVMS risk {{in a way that}} supports a monetary withhold decision and can withstand push-back (to include litigation) from the defense contractor. The government is authorized to withhold 5 % of <b>progress</b> <b>payments</b> from the contractor to mitigate the risk of significant deficiencies. We evaluated the rank order of severity for 13 EVMS guidelines that the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) requested we focus on and consider high risk to the government. Results show that the rank order of severity for the 13 EVMS guidelines provides a means for the DCMA to focus their limited resources on the surveillance of high risk guidelines. By gathering EVMS corrective action data, we were able to apply the operational value at risk (VaR) model in which a monetary risk value was calculated to withhold contractor <b>progress</b> <b>payments.</b> The results suggest that the operational VaR model could be used by DCMA personnel as a defensible risk value model for withholding contractor payments.

Using the event-based method the basic model of the problem is constructed {{and in terms of the}} different payment rules it is extended as the progress based, expense based, and time based models further. For the strong NP-hardness of the problem which is proven by simplifying it to the deadline subproblem of the discrete time-cost tradeoff problem, we develop two heuristic algorithms, namely simulated annealing and tabu search, to solve the problem. The two heuristic algorithms are compared with the multi-start iterative improvement method as well as random sampling on the basis of a computational experiment performed on a data set constructed by ProGen project generator. The results show that the proposed simulated annealing heuristic algorithm seems to be the most promising algorithm for solving the defined problem especially when the instances become larger. In addition, the effects of several key parameters on the net present value of the contractor are analyzed and some conclusions are given based on the results of the computational experiment.

The questionnaire method was used in this research. Randomly distributed questionnaire technique was applied to 120 contractors to evaluate the severity of the identified 29 direct dispute causes and 32 indirect dispute causes. The analysis of the identified causes indicates that the top five severe direct dispute causes are: delay in <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> by owner, unrealistic contract duration, change orders, poor quality of completed works, and labor inefficiencies respectively. While the top five severe indirect dispute causes are: inadequate contractor’s experience, lack of communication between construction parties, ineffective planning and scheduling of project by contractor, cash problems during construction, and poor estimation practices...|$|E

Of the eight Australian Acts, two distinct legislative models can be discerned – what have been termed the ‘East Coast’ and ‘West Coast’ models. This article compares the two models with respect to their payment systems and adjudication schemes, procedural justice afforded, incursion upon freedom of contract, uptake rates and efficiency. From this comparison, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the two models are identified.
