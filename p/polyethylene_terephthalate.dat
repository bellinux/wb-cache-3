40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to compare the healing {{response}} of biomechanically and biochemically different scaffolds in osteochondral defects created in rabbit medial femoral condyles. A block copolymer comprised of <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide <b>terephthalate)</b> and poly(butylene terephthalate) was used to prepare porous scaffolds. The 70 / 30 scaffold (70 wt % <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide <b>terephthalate))</b> was compared to the stiffer 55 / 45 (55 wt % <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide <b>terephthalate))</b> scaffold. Nine 6 -month-old rabbits were used. Osteochondral defects were filled with 55 / 45 scaffolds (n = 6); 70 / 30 scaffolds (n = 6); or left empty (n = 6). Defect sites were allowed to heal for 12 weeks. Condyles were macroscopically evaluated and analysed histologically using the O'Driscoll score for evaluating repair of osteochondral defects. Repair tissue in 70 / 30 scaffolds consisted of cartilage-like tissue on top of trabecular bone, whereas the tissue within the 55 / 45 scaffolds consisted predominantly of trabecular bone. O'Driscoll scores for 70 / 30 scaffolds were significantly better (p = 0. 024) in comparison to untreated osteochondral defects and 55 / 45 scaffolds. This study reveals that the biomechanical and biochemical properties of the scaffold {{play an important role}} by themselves, and can affect the healing response of osteochondral defects.

40|$|<b>Polyethylene</b> <b>Terephthalates</b> (PET) {{is one of}} {{the most}} plastic {{containers}} that are normally being discarded by people, which resulted in environmental pollution. One of the best ways to reduce the environmental pollution is by recycling PET as a ringshaped PET (RPET) fiber in concrete. Therefore, it is appropriate to investigate the RPET fiber in term of pullout strength of RPET fiber concrete. A rotal of 30 cubes for the fiber pullout test were made with three embedded fiber length sizes, namely l 5 mm, 20 mm, and 25 mm. The RPET- 10 fiber exhibited the highest pullout load of 103. 6 % compared with RPET- 5 fiber at l 5 mm embedded length. This finding shows a similar pattern for 20 mm and 25 mnr ernbedded lengths RPET- 10 fiber obtained 77. 2 % and l 3. 7 % increases in pullout strength compared with RPET-S flber, at 20 to 25 mm embedded lengths.

Because a fabric should be soft and comfortable, so antibacterial materials {{need to be very}} small in size to graft on the fabric. This work used nanosized antibacterial solution or powder, Nylon and PET fibers, as starting materials to prepare antibacterial fabric products.

[9] obtained nanoscale biomimetic wool fibers by electrospinning PAN and TPU using a side-by-side co-electrospinning arrangement. Chen et al. [10] utilized three kinds of co-electrospinning spinnerets to produce nanosprings from PU and Nomex. Using side-by-side electrospinning, Zhang et al. [11] reported the generation of fibers with curled and helical morphologies from <b>poly(ethylene</b> glycol <b>terephthalate)</b> (HSPET) and <b>poly(ethylene</b> propanediol <b>terephthalate)</b> (PTT). In the above researches, the helical nanofibers obtained are described as three-dimensional and spring-like structures with nano- to microscale helix diameters. The authors attributed the generation of helical fibers {{to the fact that}} the two components involved in co-electrospinning display different shrinkages after electrospinning. But there is no detailed analysis and explanation of the formation mechanism of helical fibers. Based on the concept that an elastomeric and a stiff polymer in co-electrospinning may introduce longitudinal stress and result in coiled shapes of the bicomponent fibers, our previous studies [12] reported the fabrication of helical nanofibers via co-electrospinning. We compared three component systems, Nomex/TPU, PAN/TPU, and PS/TPU, which represent three kinds of polymer composition arrangements in co-electrospinning, and explored the role of polymer chain rigidity, miscibility, and hydrogen bonding on the formation of helical fibers. It has been experimentally verified that Nomex/TPU system can form fine helical fibers. However, Nomex is a non-hydrophilic polymer, which limited its application in biological tissue and adsorption filtration [13].|$|R

Moreover, the gloss retention, colour aberration and the surface morphologies of the composites during accelerated UV ageing (1500  hours) were investigated. The results demonstrated much less degree of ageing degradation for the nanocomposites, indicating an important role of the nano-TiO 2 in improving the ageing-resistant properties of synthetic polymer composites.|$|R

Scaffolds consisting of 55 wt% <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide <b>terephthalate)</b> and 45 wt% poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEOT/PBT) with different pore sizes and interconnectivities were made, using a compression moulding (CM) and a three-dimensional fibre (3 DF) deposition technique. In these scaffolds, allogenic chondrocytes were seeded, cultured for 3 weeks and implanted in osteochondral defects of skeletally mature rabbits. At 3 weeks no difference in cartilage repair between an empty osteochondral defect, CM or 3 DF scaffolds was found. Three months post-implantation, cartilage repair was significantly improved after implantation of a 3 DF scaffold compared to a CM scaffold. Although not significant, Mankin scores for osteoarthritis (OA) indicated less OA in the 3 DF scaffold group compared to empty defects and CM-treated defects. It is concluded that scaffold pore size and pore interconnectivity influences osteochondral repair and a decreased pore interconnectivity seems to impair osteochondral repair.

30|$|Magnussen et al. [11] {{recently}} published data suggesting that smaller hamstring graft size {{was linked to}} higher failure in ACLR, {{and this has been}} confirmed by others [12]. While graft constructs of quadrupled semitendinosus are theoretically larger in diameter than doubled semitendinosus–gracilis (ST/G) grafts, reported matched-pair analysis to date surprisingly does not support this [13]. Quadrupled semitendinosus (Quad ST) grafts are also much shorter [14], making them unable to be fixed to the tibia with interference screws. While the shorter Quad ST grafts can be fixed with adjustable suspensory fixation devices on the tibia as well as the femur, concerns have been published over elongation of adjustable suspensory fixation devices under cyclic loading, with vigorous recent debate in literature [15 – 19]. In addition, tibial fixation in ACLR remains more problematic than femoral fixation, being described as the weak link in ACL fixation [20, 21]. Interference screw and <b>polyethylene</b> braided <b>terephthalate</b> (PET) tape fixation has been promoted as an alternative method for both tibial and femoral fixation of short quadrupled ST grafts, with supportive biomechanical data [14, 22, 23] for methods using partial length inside-out created tunnels, however this tape–screw method cannot be utilized with a fixed suspensory fixation loop on the femur.|$|R
