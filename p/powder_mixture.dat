2500|$|Solid samples can be {{prepared}} {{in a variety of}} ways. One common method is to crush the sample with an oily mulling agent (usually mineral oil Nujol). A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured. The second method is to grind a quantity of the sample with a specially purified salt (usually potassium bromide) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> is then pressed in a mechanical press to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass. [...] A third technique is the [...] "cast film" [...] technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic solvent. A drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for qualitative analysis. The final method is to use microtomy to cut a thin (20–100µm) film from a solid sample. This {{is one of the most}} important ways of analysing failed plastic products for example because the integrity of the solid is preserved.|$|E

50|$|It {{is helpful}} to {{understand}} how light is processed in a multivariate optical computer, as compared to how it is processed in a spectrometer. For example, if we are studying the composition of a <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> using diffuse reflectance, a suitable light source is directed at the <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> and light is collected, usually with a lens, after it has scattered from the powder surface. Light entering a spectrometer first strikes a device (either a grating or interferometer) that separates light of different wavelengths to be measured. A series of independent measurements is used to estimate {{the full spectrum of}} the mixture, and the spectrometer renders a measurement of the spectral intensity at many wavelengths. Multivariate statistics can then be applied to the spectrum produced.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of various dispersion methods {{on the evolution}} of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in titanium (Ti) metal matrix composites (TMCs) prepared via spark plasma sintering (SPS) have been investigated. The synthesis procedures included sonication, high energy ball milling (HEBM), and rapid consolidation of <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> at different sintering temperatures. The impact energy provided to the <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> during HEBM process was optimized to disperse 0. 5 wt% MWCNTs into Ti matrix in two controlled ball milling processes: with and without in-situ formation of TiC during HEBM. The interfacial reactions between MWCNTs and Ti matrix were controlled by retaining the crystallinity and sp 2 carbon network of the MWCNTs even at high sintering temperature of 800 °C, which enhanced their compressive strength up to 1056 MPa with a compressive strain of 27. 31 %. The mechanical and tribological properties of the composites consolidated from the <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> with in-situ TiC formation during HEBM and pre-sonicated MWCNTs were significantly enhanced as opposed to the composites consolidated from the <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> without formation of TiC during HEBM...|$|R
40|$|Segregation and {{chemical}} inhomogeneity are well-known problems in powder metallurgy {{and are also}} an issue for new applications of <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures,</b> for example as starting materials for severe plastic deformation. In this study, Cu-coated Fe powder was prepared via immersion deposition, inductively hot-pressed and subsequently deformed using high-pressure torsion.

During severe plastic deformation, higher hardness was observed for the coated powder as compared to <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> even after low strains. In the saturation state, the coated powder was found to result in a hardness of about 600 HV, which is significantly harder than for the <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures.</b> This is attributed to the greater amount of impurities introduced by the coating process.
