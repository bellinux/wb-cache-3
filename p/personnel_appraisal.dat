40|$|This study {{examined}} the existing levels of effectiveness and efficiency in local government with the application of performance management systems {{in the provision of}} municipal services. The provision of district-wide water services in Cacadu District Municipality in the Province of the Eastern Cape, South Africa is used for particular reference. Local government reforms after 1994 {{led to the creation of}} the district municipality (which groups together a number of local municipalities) to drive district-wide services provision, the introduction of systematic services provision standards and performance management as part of management reforms in municipalities. The problem for the research deals with how the Cacadu District Council and the councils of the local municipalities within the district are collaborating in using performance management systems, what effects this could have on programmes and services provision and how communication of performance information would improve service provision. Conceptual and practical difficulties encountered in effective and efficient utilisation and some obstacles that contribute to impeding progress in the use of performance management systems in municipalities were analysed. The qualitative research included a review of documents from the public administration and management literature; discourse analysis of interviews with municipal councilors and appointed officials, community members and provincial managers. The document review included a review of municipal documents that incorporated performance management or described development and use of performance management systems. It also included the legal frameworks and statutory requirements for municipal government and administration. All the responding municipal councils within the Cacadu District Municipality reported using performance management over the past five years yet little empirical evidence explains usage for district-wide programmes and services provision. Research shows that a comprehensive performance management approach to programmes and services has a more effective and efficient impact on service improvement than utilisation of personnnel appraisal (Ammons and Rivenbark, 2005). Despite the expected benefits, personnel performance appraisal is often flawed and the need exists in the district municipal model to develop and utilise performance management systems that validly assess the work performance of personnel (Hindo, 2010). Performance management system utilisation in decision making management is more related to the long-term benefits of effectiveness and efficiency than <b>personnel</b> <b>appraisal</b> for performance rewards and reporting. To overcome and address a situation of managing performance without a performance management system the study proposes a programme performance measurement and management system which incorporates information on management inputs, programme-specific data and citizens' feedback for outcomes and impact of the service. The suggested design for district-wide and specific municipal services provision elicit and provide relevant and appropriate performance information for management, decision-making and accountability to community. The effectiveness of the proposed system is to provide information for decision-making, long-term planning, strategic management and accountability reporting. The proposal is built on the exisiting method and thus efficient in the utilisation of resources. This has implications both for the theory of Public Administration and Management and the practical application of performamce management in public institutions. The study explicity provides a Public Administration perspective on management in a multi-municipal district context with different authorities. The study contributes to the theory of administrative policy and management context of the municipality with special attention to functions for which different authorities are responsible and the role of a performance system for better insught into managing overlapping authority, gaps and duplications. A central purpose of public management research is to theorise and influence practice. The practical utilisation of the proposed method is intended to assist managers and politicians with better understanding of a sustainable performance management syste...|$|E
40|$|Facing the {{increasing}} environmental degradation locally and globally, the Chinese government sets mandatory goals of 10 % reduction of SO 2 emission and 20 % reduction of energy intensity in its 11 th Five-Year Plan period (FYP, 2006 - 2010). This study uses Shanxi Province {{to show the}} health effects of air pollution and health benefits resulting from various air pollution control scenarios in Shanxi province, illustrate how policies and measures have been implemented in practice in the province {{as a response to the}} National Environmental Five Year Plan issued by the central government, and demonstrate how the various responses have contributed to meeting targets. The study shows that the economic costs of air pollution in Taiyuan in the base year 2000 were large, and that control strategies especially targeting area sources (low level distributed sources) could lead to substantial health benefits for the population in Taiyuan and that the gain is greater the earlier control actions are taken. The results in Paper I have been updated, using exposureresponse functions from the most recent publications on the topic. Although there are large uncertainties in the estimates of health benefits and the implementation of air pollution control measures, the study shows that scenario-based and pollution source-oriented health benefit evaluation of air pollution in Taiyuan can be very useful. Even though selection of optimal control scenarios for Taiyuan requires further cost-benefit analysis and regional considerations, this study does provide decision-makers with evidence about not only the significance of control and prevention of environmental pollution, but also gives indications of what measures are most effective locally. The national air quality standard Grade II is a bit less strict than the WHO guidelines, and the study implies that there are large health benefits to be gained by setting stricter standards for the future in China. China has already in 2012 set a new ambient air quality standard which lowers the previous threshold value of PM 10 (Grade II: annual average from 100 μg/m 3 to 70 μg/m 3) and includes an index (standard) for PM 2. 5 (Grade II: annual average 35 μg/m 3) for the first time. The achievements in energy saving and emission reduction in Shanxi have been substantial in the 11 th five-year plan period (2006 - 2010). The provincial and local governments have put energy efficiency and environment protection very high on its policy agenda, and devoted a considerable amount of effort to achieving the goals. Very detailed requirements and regulations have been issued. The most important measures so far seem to be in the industrial sector. Particularly, the Top- 200 Program and phasing out outdated capacity contributed, respectively, 63 % and 30 % of the total energy savings. The reduction by FGD in the power sector dominated the total SO 2 reduction. However, Shanxi has still a long way to go to achieve satisfactory energy use and limit the emissions of pollutants such as SO 2, NOx, CO 2 and PM. Further improvement of energy intensity and environment will require continuing efforts to optimize the economic structure, in particular a shift to low-carbon economy and reduction in the dependence on heavy industry. The <b>personnel</b> <b>appraisal</b> system should also be improved to provide stronger incentives for achieving further energy intensity and pollution reductions...|$|E
40|$|The project's main {{objectives}} were {{to facilitate the}} establishment of a planning capacity to enable the Ministry of Agriculture to foresee future manpower requirements and give policy guidance with respect to agricultural education and training; assist in the improvement of trained personnel management and career structures; and strengthen agricultural supervisory management to meet the agricultural sector's needs and organize relevant training. Assistance was provided to the Government in identifying the types and level of training most required in the agricultural sector, and a suitable data collection system was proposed for the future monitoring of manpower activities in the sector. A manpower data base was designed, in consultation with officers from the Ministry of Agriculture, and then made operational through the utilization of appropriate forms and tabular data entered in the software of the training management system. This allowed the identification of professional posts and the definition of technical competencies required in the Ministry. Project staff formatted the information available in the Learning Resources Centre (LRC) and entered it into the software, thus making it possible to obtain an up-to-date list of equipment and teaching aids existing in the LRC {{as well as of the}} courses available. In order to more clearly define the responsibilities of the Ministry's Personnel and Training Divisions and strengthen communication capacities, an information system was established, with information on job descriptions being collected by the Training Division and basic job requirements data being provided by the Personnel Division. Under this system, the preparation of the inventory of skills would remain the responsibility of the Training Division, which would periodically update it through annual appraisal reports received from the Personnel Division. In consultation with ministry staff, a manpower training plan was elaborated, which was in line with the Ministry's new policy, i. e., liberalization of the economy through allocation of certain functions and activities to the private sector, and promotion of agricultural exports. The specific aims of the training plan are, inter alia, to facilitate the process of computerization of the relevant manpower data and promote the exchange of information. This will be possible if it is complemented by a personnel policy aimed at improving work efficiency and productivity. It is recommended that the Training Division elaborate a clear set of rules and procedures for training, identification of training priorities and dissemination of relevant information to the units concerned. The role and functions of the Training Division vis--vis the technical divisions in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Public Service should be clarified. The organizational structure and functions of the Personnel Division within the Ministry of Agriculture should also be reviewed, with a view to increasing its output and efficiency. It is further suggested that the <b>personnel</b> <b>appraisal</b> system be reviewed and improved. In particular, the format and contents of the appraisal reports should be redesigned to include a performance plan showing progress over time, and specific proposals for remedial action. Managers and supervisors should be given appropriate training on the scope and modalities of the appraisal exercise. In order to promote the integration of functions and activities performed by the Ministry of Agriculture with those carried out by the Rural Authority for Agricultural Development (RADA) and other statutory bodies and development agencies operating in the agricultural sector, it is recommended that these agencies be informed of the methodology of the training analysis undertaken by the Training Division, as well as of the scope and structure of the new training plan, so as to facilitate information exchange and overall coordination of activities. An inventory of teaching aids (audiovisual or written material) already available (existing) in the Learning Resource Centre, or in other training institutions or development agencies, should be compiled, to improve the efficiency of training and avoid the duplication of activities. It is also recommended that the Training and Personnel Divisions within the Ministry take appropriate steps to improve the manpower planning functions and activities and put into operation the training management system...|$|E

The three research questions guiding this study were: Why is performance appraisal of middle level leaders important in New Zealand secondary schools? What are the current performance appraisal purposes and experiences of middle level leaders in New Zealand secondary schools in terms of what constitutes effective appraisal? How can schools improve the performance appraisal experiences of middle level leaders in New Zealand secondary schools? In this qualitative study, 26 middle level leaders completed an electronic questionnaire and five middle level leaders participated in semi structured interviews. Concurrently, each school‟s <b>personnel</b> policy and <b>appraisal</b> process was analysed. Using an interpretive approach, findings of this research exposed that middle level leaders perceive that they are not effectively appraised by senior leaders.
