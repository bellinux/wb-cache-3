40|$|A marked {{inhibition}} of {{the incorporation of}} S 35 -sulfate by normal calf costal cartilage was produced by <b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> {{in the presence of}} catalytic amounts of cupric ions. The effect of the various components of the ascorbic acid oxidizing system (<b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbate,</b> cupric ions, cuprous ions, hydrogen peroxide, dehydroascorbic acid) was investigated. The results of experiments in which hydrogen peroxide, catalase, or sodium azide were used singly or in combination suggest that the inhibition produced by the ascorbic acid oxidizing system is due, to a considerable extent, to the production of hydrogen peroxide. Dehydroascorbic acid was also found to inhibit the incorporation of S 35 -sulfate by cartilage slices. However, the gradual fall in pH which resulted from the addition of dehydroascorbic acid could account to a large extent for the inhibitory effect observed because the incorporation of S 35 -sulfate by cartilage slices decreases sharply as the pH is lowered. The incorporation of S 35 -sulfate by cartilage slices is inhibited also by increasing the concentration of phosphate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genomic {{imprinting}} disorder characterized by overgrowth and {{increased risk of}} malignancy. We studied the oxidative stress (OS) pattern of our patients with BWS and administered, for the first time, <b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> with ribose (PAR) once a day as long-term therapy in order to correct the effects induced by free radicals. Patients and Methods: We describe the clinical features of three patients examined every three months in our clinic. OS was ascertained by measuring a panel of OS biomarkers: non-protein-binding iron, total hydroperoxides, advanced oxidation protein products, isoprostanes, carbonyl groups and thiols. After the presence of OS was established, treatment with PAR was started at the dosage of 300 mg of Potassium Bicarbonate and 150 mg of Ascorbic Acid in aqueous solution and change...|$|E
40|$|Ascorbic {{acid and}} calcium {{ascorbate}} are used commercially in dip solutions to inhibit {{the development of}} browning {{on the surface of}} fresh-cut apple slices. A sodium chloride dip has also been shown to inhibit browning and this study examined its interaction with various forms of ascorbate on the postharvest life of apple slices. Comparison of the effectiveness of ascorbate moieties showed that the concentration of ascorbic acid required to achieve any desired postharvest life was twice that of calcium ascorbate, but calcium, sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbates</b> were equally effective in inhibiting browning. The inclusion of 0. 1 mol/l sodium chloride into a dip requires only half the concentration of ascorbate to maintain the same postharvest life. The very low cost of sodium chloride means that materials in such a dip are about half the cost of an ascorbate-only solution. Since 0. 1 mol/l sodium chloride does not affect the taste of apple slices and is an allowable food additive, it should be considered as a cost effective partial replacement of ascorbate in commercial dips. There also seems to be a cost advantage of sodium ascorbate over calcium ascorbate...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical pencil leads {{were studied}} as disposable, {{low-cost}} electrodes. Lateral surfaces of mechanical pencil leads branded as “polymer” show high electron transfer rates for hexaamineruthenium chloride, <b>potassium</b> ferricyanide, <b>ascorbate,</b> ferric chloride and dopamine electrochemical probes, and are significantly better electrode materials than either classic woodcase clay–graphite pencil compositions or non-polymer mechanical pencil leads. Best polymer leads outperform glassy carbon, basal and edge graphite and boron-doped diamond electrodes. In addition to electrochemical experiments, the studied pencil leads {{were characterized by}} scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. High content of sp 3 hybridized carbon (up to 80 %) with a low degree of surface oxidation and occurrence of silicon monoxide (SiO) on the surfaces of the polymer pencil leads were found using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Low double layer capacitance values of similar magnitude as that found for boron-doped diamond electrodes are at the origin of favourably low background currents on the polymer pencil lead electrodes. SiO containing polymer pencil lead electrodes allow electrochemical analysis that is more sensitive than common carbon electrodes, as demonstrated by voltammetry of adenine and xanthine. © 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|Oxidative stress (OS) is {{involved}} in several human diseases, including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis, as well as genetic diseases. We previously found that OS occurs in Down Syndrome {{as well as in}} Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS). Here we describe the clinical case of a female patient with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS), a genomic imprinting disorder, characterized by obesity, atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus type 2, pathologies in which a continuous and important production of free radicals takes place. We verified the presence of OS by measuring a redox biomarkers profile including total hydroperoxides (TH), non protein-bound iron (NPBI), thiols (SH), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and isoprostanes (IPs). Thus we introduced in therapy an antioxidant agent, namely <b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> with ribose (PAR), in addition to GH therapy and we monitored the redox biomarkers profile for four years. A progressive decrease in OS biomarkers occurred until their normalization. In the meantime a weight loss was observed together with a steady growth in standards for age and sex...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Costello {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} genetic condition characterized by coarse facies, short stature, loose folds of skin especially on hands and feet, severe feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. Other features include cardiac anomalies, developmental disability and increased risk of neoplasms. Given the link between oxidative stress (OS) and carcinogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that OS occurs in this syndrome, supposing its role both in cancer development and in other clinical features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe four cases with Costello syndrome in which we verified the presence of OS by measuring a redox biomarker profile including total hydroperoxides, non-protein-bound iron, advanced oxidation protein products, thyols, carbonyl groups and isoprostanes. Thus, we introduced an antioxidant agent, namely <b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> with ribose (PAR) into the therapy and monitored the redox profile every three months to verify its efficacy. RESULTS: A progressive decrease in OS biomarkers occurred, together with an improvement in the clinical features of the patients. CONCLUSION: OS was proven in all four cases of Costello syndrome. The antioxidant therapy with PAR demonstrated positive effects. These promising results need further research to confirm the relevance of OS and the efficacy of PAR therapy in Costello syndrome...|$|E
40|$|While {{surgery is}} the {{definitive}} treatment for early-stage melanoma, the current therapies against advanced melanoma {{do not yet}} provide an effective, long-lasting control of the lesions and a satisfactory impact on patient survival. Thus, research is also focused on novel treatments that could potentiate the current therapies. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of <b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> with ribose (PAR) treatment on the human melanoma cell line, A 375, in 2 D and 3 D models. In the 2 D model, {{in line with the}} current literature, the pharmacological treatment with PAR decreased cell proliferation and viability. In addition, an increase in Connexin 43 mRNA and protein was observed. This novel finding was confirmed in PAR-treated melanoma cells cultured in 3 D, where an increase in functional gap junctions and a higher spheroid compactness were observed. Moreover, in the 3 D model, a remarkable decrease in the size and volume of spheroids was observed, further supporting the treatment efficacy observed in the 2 D model. In conclusion, our results suggest that PAR {{could be used as a}} safe adjuvant approach in support to conventional therapies for the treatment of melanoma. © 2017 Carlotta Cavicchio et al...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The postharvest life of fresh-cut apples {{is limited}} by the {{development}} of browning on cut surfaces. The effect of dipping in solution of inorganic salts on surface browning of ‘Granny Smith’ apple slices was examined. This led to a more extensive study on the effect of various halide salts on browning and other biochemical factors associated with the surface browning of apple slices. Dipping in ascorbic acid (AscH) and calcium ascorbate (CaAsc) has long been used to inhibit browning of fresh-cut apple slices but these compounds are comparatively expensive. In order to develop a cost-effective method to inhibit browning, the combined effects of sodium chloride (NaCl) with various forms of ascorbate on the postharvest life of ‘Granny Smith’ apple slices were examined. Results from dipping apple slices in solutions of a range of inorganic salts showed that the relative inhibitory effect on browning was chloride = phosphate > sulfate > nitrate = nitrite with no difference between sodium, potassium and calcium salts. The effectiveness of halide salts on browning was found to be fluoride > chloride = bromide > iodide = control. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) from ‘Granny Smith’ apples showed a maximum activity at pH 4 - 5, with activity at pH 5 > 4 > 3 > 6 > 7 > 8. The PPO activity of tissue extracted from halides-treated slices was not different to control tissue but when halides were added into the assay solution, both sodium fluoride (NaF) and NaCl significantly decreased PPO activity at pH 3 – 5. The levels of individual (epicatechin, chlorogenic acid) and total polyphenols in halide treated slices were NaF > NaCl > control. Exogenous application of chlorogenic acid to slices enhanced browning but the addition of NaCl and NaF counteracted this effect. The halide salts showed no effect on respiration, ethylene production, ion leakage or antioxidant activity. It is proposed that the mode of action of NaCl and NaF is thus considered to be through decreasing PPO activity and subsequently reducing the oxidation of polyphenols. The concentration of AscH required to achieve a desired postharvest life was twice that of CaAsc but calcium, sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>ascorbates</b> were equally effective in inhibiting browning. The inclusion of 0. 1 mol/l NaCl into an ascorbate dip reduced by half the concentration of ascorbate needed to maintain the same postharvest life. Since 0. 1 mol/l NaCl does not affect the taste of apple slices and is an allowable food additive with a much lower cost, it should be considered as a cost effective partial replacement of ascorbate in commercial dips. There may also be a cost advantage of using sodium ascorbate (NaAsc) over CaAsc...|$|R

No primary or secondary neoplastic disease was observed in 9 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is the first report showing OS occurring in BWS. No drug until this report has been published showing efficacy against OS in any cancer. Given the limited number of patients, care must be taken to mitigate enthusiasm. We are collecting data for a large number of BWS patients to confirm these preliminary results. PMID: 22110229 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE...|$|E
