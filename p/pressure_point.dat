5|$|Initially {{the film}} was to be {{released}} in 2000, rumoured to be titled Bond 2000. Other rumoured titles included Death Waits for No Man, Fire and Ice, <b>Pressure</b> <b>Point</b> and Dangerously Yours. The title The World Is Not Enough is an English translation of the Latin phrase Orbis non sufficit, which in real life was the motto of Sir Thomas Bond. In the novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service and its film adaptation, this is revealed to be the Bond family motto. The phrase originates from the epitaph of Alexander the Great.|$|E

However since those days he has {{corrected}} his ways {{and gave up}} fighting and picked up medical skill (holistic medical skills {{are very close to}} <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> based martial arts).|$|E
25|$|Redemption, {{the opening}} episode of Series Two, was {{broadcast}} on Tuesday, 9 January 1979 at 7:20pm with subsequent episodes following {{at about the}} same time each Tuesday. <b>Pressure</b> <b>Point</b> was broadcast at 8:10pm because of coverage of the Variety Club Awards. Competition on ITV came from the popular US programme Charlie's Angels. BBC Wales opted out of transmission, broadcast regional programming instead and showed Blake's 7 on Sunday afternoons. Ratings averaged 7 million; although two million lower than the previous series, a third series was assured.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> {{spread through the}} Tamil martial art called Varma kalai, which is a martial art that {{concentrates}} on the body's <b>pressure</b> <b>points.</b> The concept of <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> is also present in the old school Japanese martial arts; in a 1942 article in the Shin Budo magazine, Takuma Hisa asserted {{the existence of a}} tradition attributing the first development of pressure-point attacks to Shinra Saburō Minamoto no Yoshimitsu (1045 - 1127).|$|R

25|$|On January 5, 2006, {{within the}} first two hours of Anderson's first day at the camp (where he had been {{committed}} for stealing his grandmother's car, curfew violation during probation, and theft of candy), camp officials forced him to continue exercising after he stopped exercising. Drill instructors grabbed Anderson and applied numerous uses of force, including holding Anderson by the arms, take-downs, <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> applications, and covering his mouth while forcing him to inhale ammonia. Anderson became unresponsive during this episode, and eventually died {{the next day in}} Pensacola, Florida after his parents elected to remove him from life support.|$|E
25|$|The {{order in}} which the episodes were {{broadcast}} was rather different. Death Squad by Pip and Jane Baker – in which Blake, Gan and Jenna would infiltrate a Federation facility attempting to create 'super-soldiers' by administering drugs to humans, leading to Blake and Gan becoming exposed to the drugs and Jenna being held by Servalan as an inducement for the scientist behind the plan – was abandoned. This was ostensibly on cost grounds, although Boucher had concerns {{about the quality of}} the script. The episodes were re-ordered; Horizon, Allan Prior's 'Ugandan' script replaced Death Squad, while Holmes' script, Killer, became the seventh episode. <b>Pressure</b> <b>Point,</b> Terry Nation's Storm Mountain script, became the fifth and Trial, the Travis court-martial story, was moved to sixth.|$|E
25|$|Anna's {{fighting}} {{style is}} based on Hapkido, a martial art that {{is known for its}} efficient joint locks, throws, and <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> strikes and timed defensive tactics. Despite this, she and Nina have both incorporated other fighting arts into their personal styles. She begins sharing mostly the same moveset with Nina, but has developed her own moveset overtime to the point that as of Tekken 5, she only shares several moves with Nina and even then they have different properties. Anna's grappling moves have also changed over the series, reflecting less of her bone breaking martial arts. In Tekken 3, Anna only appears as a playable character in the console version; in the arcade version, she is just an alternate costume for Nina, and therefore has the same exact moveset as her sister.|$|E

500|$|The unusual {{stability}} of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains {{the fact that in}} the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the [...] "soup" [...] of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{references to}} Chinese martial arts {{are found in}} the Spring and Autumn Annals (5th century BCE), where a hand-to-hand combat theory, one that integrates notions of [...] "hard" [...] and [...] "soft" [...] techniques, is mentioned.

2500|$|In {{situations}} where direct pressure and elevation are either not possible or proving ineffective, {{and there is}} a risk of exsanguination, some training protocols advocate the use of pressure points to constrict the major artery that feeds the point of the bleed. [...] This is usually performed at a place where a pulse can be found, such as in the femoral artery. [...] There are significant risks involved in performing <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> constriction, including necrosis of the area below the constriction, and most protocols give a maximum time for constriction (often around 10 minutes). [...] There is particularly high danger if constricting the carotid artery in the neck, as the brain is sensitive to hypoxia and brain damage can result within minutes of application of pressure. Pressure on the carotid artery can also cause vagal tone induced bradycardia, which can eventually stop the heart. Other dangers in use of a constricting method include rhabdomyolysis, which is a buildup of toxins below the <b>pressure</b> <b>point,</b> which if released back into the main bloodstream may cause renal failure.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a new way}} to integrate flow rate history and pressure history data in well-test analysis. The method used is an extension of the aleconvolution principle to a chosen period of time before the well-test. It is based on the recovery of missing parts of the pressure history by taking into account the flow rate history and the available sections of measured pressure history. The method has the advantage of working without making any assumption about the reservoir by using the data itself to define the "model". A real example with 71 <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> and 70 corresponding flow rate points shows how it is possible to recover the first 20 <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> correctly considering that only the flow rate history and the last 51 <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> are known...|$|R

Upper <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> of Well- 9, which were taken after little pressure depletion, showed an oil pressure gradient of 0.32 psi/ft, while lower <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> of Well- 6 and Well- 9 showed a water pressure gradient of 0.49 psi/ft. Because not many <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> were taken below XX 120, uncertainties ensued. But combining the points with test data helped us to better position the FWL. Similar to what was mentioned in Area A, Well- 5, Well- 11, and Well- 12 produced a thousand barrels of oil with no water cut and supported the fact that XX 80 –XX 120 was located in the oil zone. Fluid analyzer coupled with WFT in Well- 9 showed water with a trace amount of oil, while production test produced 100 % water. Then, the FWL was observed to lie in the interval between XX 120 and XX 140 and selected close to XX 140 due to more uncertainties around this interval.|$|R
