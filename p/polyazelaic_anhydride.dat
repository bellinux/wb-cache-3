40|$|Epoxy prepolymers were {{synthesized}} from alcoholysis lignin (AL) and lignin-related phenols such as p-hydroquinone (HQ) and methoxy-p-hydroquinone (MHQ) by reaction with epichlorohydrin. Epoxy resins were synthesized {{from the}} above prepolymers by reaction with <b>poly(azelaic</b> <b>anhydride).</b> The molar ratios of acid anhydride groups to epoxy groups ([AA/EPOXY] ratios) were varied at 10 / 10 and 12 / 10. The thermal properties of the obtained prepolymers and epoxy resins were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TG) and TG- Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The values at glass transition temperatures (T_g's) of epoxy resins decreased {{in the order of}} epoxy resins from HQ > AL > MHQ. Thermal degradation temperatures (T_d's) of epoxy resins were a]most constant regardless of [AA/EPOXY] ratios, suggesting that the curing of prepolymers with <b>poly(azelaic</b> <b>anhydride)</b> does not affect T_d values. The intensities of absorption peaks at 2900 cm- 1 (CH) and 1730 cm- 1 (C= 0) in IR spectra of the evolved gases during thermal degradation increased with increasing [AA/EPOXY] ratios...|$|E
