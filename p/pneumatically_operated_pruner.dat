40|$|Remotely operated, {{semi-automatic}} machines, {{designed to}} effect the mechanical disassembly (i. e., decanning) of spent fuel elements from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, were developed. The machines described are laboratory models which successfully decanned simulated fuel elements. They are electrically or <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> and are capable of decanning three fuel elements per minute without the routine use of manipulators. Each machine {{is made up of}} functional units which are sequentially placed to eliminate handling between steps of the decanning operation and which are easily removable for replacement or maintenance. In the first of the two machines described, <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> devices prepare the fuel element for a rotary shearing operation which cuts the tubing jacket along a helical circumferential path as it is being removed. The alternate machine removes the jacket by means of a series of shearing rolls. Both machines are served by auxiliary mechanisms, such as inspection jigs, fuel and scrap choppers, and transfer magazines. (auth...|$|R
50|$|The Tonophone, {{played by}} a pinned {{cylinder}} instead of being operated by direct mechanical linkages, was <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated.</b> The cylinder pins lifted levers which opened valves to a pneumatic mechanism which operated the piano. First shown at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, the Tonophone {{won a gold medal}} at the exhibition, and went on to be a commercial success. Today, there are thought to be fewer than four complete and working Tonophones left in the world.|$|R
50|$|The G-27 was {{the only}} Gribovsky design {{with more than one}} engine. It was a wooden {{multi-purpose}} monoplane, intended to provide training in navigation and photo-reconnaissance for its crew of three as well as filling light transport and air ambulance rôles. In plan its wing had a rectangular centre section and straight tapered, two spar outer panels with rounded tips. The outer panels carried slotted ailerons and the centre section <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> split flaps.|$|R
50|$|The organ {{includes}} pallets (valves) in the windchest and {{a mechanical}} tracker action built by Röver. The stop action is <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated.</b> Since the organ {{had never been}} converted to Baroque style the casing, the pipe material and the technical premises are still completely original. The organ thus preserved its original riches of tone. In June and July 2007 Katrin Haspelmath cleaned and overhauled the organ and her company takes continuously care of the instrument.|$|R
50|$|The {{unit was}} {{controlled}} via resistors {{over which the}} voltage was dropped in a configuration of series and parallel electrical circuits. The circuit breakers that switched these circuits worked under very high power and voltage and were therefore all <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> for insulation purposes. Compressed air was required to open or close the switch actions and air was also used for the weak-field cam switch that also switched under very high currents.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, {{business}} was slowly restarted and the destroyed buildings were gradually raised again. With the aid of Wilhelm's son, Helmut Bälz, the company developed heat exchangers and electrically and <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> valves mainly for steam and thermal oil applications, developing the closed steam/condensate circuit back then.

50|$|The gas {{generator}} control valve was a <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> poppet-type that was spring-loaded to the closed position. The fuel and oxidizer poppets were mechanically linked by an actuator. The valve controlled {{the flow of}} propellants through the {{gas generator}} injector. When the mainstage signal was received, pneumatic pressure was applied against the gas generator control valve actuator assembly which moved the piston and opened the fuel poppet. During the fuel poppet opening, an actuator contacted the piston that opened the oxidizer poppet. As the opening pneumatic pressure decayed, spring loads closed the poppets.|$|R
