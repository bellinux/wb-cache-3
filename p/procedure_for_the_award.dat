40|$|In this essay, {{after an}} {{examination}} of the regulatory framework about compensation claims on public contracts (art. 124 Code of Administrative Process), we will focus on some important and recent judgments on <b>the</b> liability <b>for</b> unlawful <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> of public contracts. The study outlines a particularly aggravated liability. On the one hand, the Court of Justice of the European Union clearly declares that <b>the</b> liability <b>for</b> <b>the</b> violation of rules on <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> of public contracts must leave out of consideration the guilt requisite, thus turning it into an objective liability. On the other hand, the Court of Cassation recognises the possibility to compensation for damages also to the enterprises to which unlawful <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> of public contracts have been annulled, since the P. A. has violated the general behaviour duties, such as skilfulness, prudence, diligence, as well as correctness, advancing that in such cases the sphere of jurisdiction lies with ordinary courts. However, the legal assessment of the Supreme Court on jurisdiction cannot be shared, since – without considering the rest – it seems that an irreconcilable contrast occurs with the rules of the Code of Administrative Process on exclusive jurisdiction of the administrative courts and compensation for damage.

40|$|This chart {{compares the}} EC Procurement Directives and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Construction and Services. Most {{central and eastern}} European {{countries}} used the Model Law {{as the basis of}} their public procurement laws in the early 1990 s. Now that many countries of the region are candidates for EU accession, they must adapt their laws to EC Directives. The aim of the chart is to assist in that process. The EC Procurement Directives were introduced into the European Union to further the EU’s policy of enabling enterprises from all EU states to compete fairly in public procurement markets. The most important objective of this policy is to prevent discrimination by procuring entities in favour of their own national enterprises. The EC Directives support this by, inter alia, requiring major contracts to be advertised, open to competition, and awarded through transparent procedures. These conditions make it difficult to disguise discrimination. The UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Construction and Services sets out <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> of public contracts. It is designed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of countries introducing procurement laws, or reforming their procurement systems, with the aims of achieving economy and efficiency in public procurement and reducing corruption. The Model Law also seeks to promote international competition in public procurement markets. States should in general seek these objectives by advertising and holding a competition for procurements, and awarding contracts through transparent procedures. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether {{opportunities}} for fraud and corruption might be reduced or increased by rules governing public procurement. The focus is on specific European legislation – Procurement Directive 2004 / 18 on <b>the</b> coordination of <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>award</b> of contracts <b>for</b> public works, public supply and public services by public bodies within all EU Member States – however similar issues would arise in other jurisdictions. Design/methodology/approach – The procurement process is examined in relation to three stages of procedure: preparation of specifications, selection of tenderers, and execution of contracts, within each of which some specific risks (red flags) are identified. Findings – Particular risks that may not have been sufficiently addressed, in terms of research or legislation, arise at the first of these stages; accordingly this paper focuses there. Generally, risks are summarised in terms of insider-driven specifications, low visibility of procurement processes, and ample opportunities for renegotiation of terms. Risks may be increased by innovative procurement practices that have the effect of extending the manoeuvring between tenderers and public bodies, such as competitive dialogue. Research limitations/implications – Fraud and corruption risk in public procurement is an area deserving detailed and comparative study, with special attention to the pre-contracting stage. Research on this topic within EU Member States should go hand in hand with enquiry into international procurement, and into the EC's own rules as applied by its institutions and bodies. Practical implications – Suggestions for risk-reduction are put forward in relation to quality standards and pre-award publicity. Originality/value – After some time as the Cinderella of crime policies, large-scale frauds attract greater interest. This paper gives grounds for asking whether, in relation to procurement fraud, a combination of traditional practices and modernisation may outpace anti-fraud measures...|$|R

In order to complement the legal definition of state, the political role and powers of the Danish and British monarchies are examined. Lastly, royal warrants are discussed in relation to the free movement of goods (Article 34 TFEU) and the effect of ethnocentric campaigns on the internal market. It will be demonstrated that monarchies fall within the concept of ‘emanations of the state’ and that they are therefore obliged to comply with EU provisions on state aid and free movement of goods. The examination of the economic effect of royal warrants points to the fact that royal warrants distort competition and affect trade on the internal market because they are likely to provide selected businesses with a disproportionate advantage over their competitors. The paper concludes that the Danish and British monarchies’ awards of royal warrants contravene the provisions on state aid and free movement of goods under EU law. The paper additionally demonstrates that monarchies favour products of their own national origin, which constitutes a discriminatory measure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} present an {{overview}} of the developments of policies and practices for national (Irish) and international recognition of qualifications. The recognition of formal learning in the form of qualifications is a key focus point in the area of higher educational policy especially under the remit of recognition of prior learning initiatives, a part of the lifelong learning approaches adopted in large part by policy-makers and practitioners alike. At the meta-policy level from UNESCO to the various European Declarations from Bologna in 1999 down to Leuven in 2009, and at national and individual levels, the focus has been placed on the comparability and compatibility of qualifications, by way of the development of a European Higher Education Area, national qualifications frameworks, and sectoral as well as professional body <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> recognition of <b>awards.</b> <b>The</b> development of policies and practices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> recognition of qualifications Policy-makers, institutions of higher education and practitioners alike have increasingly embraced recognition of prior learning, especially in the form of recognition of qualifications. The importance now attached to lifelong learning and learning routes has renewed attention on qualifications systems. The various UNESCO Conventions on the Recognition of Qualifications (6 Regional, 2 European, and 1 interregional) are expressly aimed at recognising qualifications for academic purposes. They do not discount recognition for professional purposes, which is explicitly offered by the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials (CICIC), the Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE) in th...|$|R
30|$|The {{reform of}} {{vocational}} education {{began with the}} EU (PHARE) programmes in 1995, which initiated the development of modular curricula and in-service training of curricular developers (Loogma 2010; Rekkor 2014). In 1995, the Vocational Education Institutions Act was approved. This considered more the administrative side of school management (Kutseõppeasutuse seadus 1995). Then the Vocational Teacher Statute was adopted, introducing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time the term “vocational teacher” and eliminating separate teachers positions for teaching theory (previously known as professional teacher) and practical application (previously known as training master). This document also established the pedagogical requirements and work content for vocational teachers, which for many teachers meant in-service studies or studies in vocational pedagogy at degree level (Kutseõpetaja statuudi kinnitamine 1995). In 1996, <b>the</b> requirements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> qualification of vocational teachers and their verification procedures were introduced. According to the pedagogical qualifications, there were now separate professional levels—young teacher, teacher, senior teacher and teacher-educationalist (Kutseõppeasutuse pedagoogide atesteerimine ja kutseõppeasutuse ning rakenduskõrgkooli töö tasustamine 1996). Also during the same year, the reorganization of the vocational school network was launched, which meant consolidating schools into VET centres to provide better quality and more effective use of resources in VET. In 1998, the conceptual bases of VET were approved, which established certain purposes and activities for VET development and the Vocational Education Institutions Act was improved (Haridusministeerium, Kutsehariduse ja Tööhõive Seirekeskus 2001). In the same year, the new general qualification attestation stipulation and <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> pedagogues were adopted, {{and the content of}} the new regulation was the same as in the previous document in 1996 (Pedagoogide atesteerimise tingimused ja kord 1998). In 2000, the Professions Act provided <b>the</b> basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of professional qualification requirements and set out <b>the</b> conditions and <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> assessment and <b>awarding</b> of professional qualifications (Kutseseadus 2000). Consequently, {{at the end of the}} period, the development of professional standards and national curricula for professional areas began (Rekkor 2014).|$|R
