50|$|A <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> {{is a type}} of gene {{involved}} {{in the development of the}} segmented embryos of insects. Pair-rule genes are expressed as a result of differing concentrations of gap gene proteins, which encode transcription factors controlling <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Pair-rule genes are defined by the effect of a mutation in that gene, which causes the loss of the normal developmental pattern in alternating segments.|$|E

5000|$|Once the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> {{had been}} {{identified}} {{at the molecular level}} it was found that each gene is expressed in alternate parasegments - regions in the embryo that are closely related to segments, but are slightly out of register. Each parasegment includes the posterior part of one (future) segment, and an anterior part of the next (more posterior) segment. The bands of expression of the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> correspond to the regions missing in the mutant.

50|$|The {{expression}} of the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> translate into the {{expression of}} the segment polarity genes in 14 stripes. The role of the segment polarity genes is to define to boundaries and the polarity of the segments. The means to which the genes accomplish this is believed to involve a wingless and hedgehog graded distribution or cascade of signals initiated by these proteins. Unlike the gap and the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes,</b> the segment polarity genes function within cells rather than within the syncytium. Thus, segment polarity genes influence patterning though signaling rather than autonomously. Also, the gap and <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed transiently while segment polarity gene expression is maintained throughout development. The continued {{expression of the}} segment polarity genes is maintained by a feedback loop involving hedgehog and wingless.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGenetic {{studies of}} the fruit fly Drosophila have {{revealed}} a hierarchy of segmentation <b>genes</b> (maternal, gap, <b>pair-rule</b> and HOX) that subdivide the syncytial blastoderm into sequentially finer-scale coordinates. Within this hierarchy, the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> translate gradients of information into periodic stripes of expression. How <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> function during the progressive mode of segmentation seen in short and intermediate-germ insects is an ongoing question. Here we report that the nuclear receptor Of'E 75 A is expressed with double segment periodicity {{in the head and}} thorax. In the abdomen, Of'E 75 A is expressed in a unique pattern during posterior elongation, and briefly resembles a sequence that is typical of <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes.</b> Depletion of Of'E 75 A mRNA caused loss of a subset of odd-numbered parasegments, as well as parasegment 6. Because these parasegments straddle segment boundaries, we observe fusions between adjacent segments. Finally, expression of Of'E 75 A in the blastoderm requires even-skipped, which is a gap gene in Oncopeltus. These data show that the function of Of'E 75 A during embryogenesis shares many properties with canonical <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> in other insects. They further suggest that parasegment specification may occur through irregular and episodic pair-rule-like activity...|$|R

50|$|The enhancers {{determining}} early segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster embryos {{are among}} the best characterized developmental enhancers. In the early fly embryo, the gap gene transcription factors are responsible for activating and repressing a number of segmentation genes, such as the pair rule genes. The gap genes are expressed in blocks along the anterior-posterior axis of the fly along with other maternal effect transcription factors, thus creating zones within which different combinations of transcription factors are expressed. The pair-rule genes are separated from one another by non-expressing cells. Moreover, the stripes of expression for different pair-rule genes are offset by a few cell diameters from one another. Thus, unique combinations of <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> expression create spatial domains along the anterior-posterior axis to set up each of the 14 individual segments. The 480 bp enhancer responsible for driving the sharp stripe two of the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> even-skipped (eve) has been well-characterized. The enhancer contains 12 different binding sites for maternal and gap gene transcription factors. Activating and repressing sites overlap in sequence. Eve is only expressed in a narrow stripe of cells that contain high concentrations of the activators and low concentration of the repressors for this enhancer sequence. Other enhancer regions drive eve expression in 6 other stripes in the embryo.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the Drosophila {{segmentation}} hierarchy, periodic {{expression of}} <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> translates gradients of regional information from maternal and gap genes into the segmental expression of segment polarity genes. In Tribolium, homologs {{of almost all}} the eight canonical Drosophila <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed in pair-rule domains, but only five have pair-rule functions. even-skipped, runt and odd-skipped act as primary <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes,</b> while the functions of paired (prd) and sloppy-paired (slp) are secondary. Since secondary <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> directly regulate segment polarity genes in Drosophila, we analyzed Tc-prd and Tc-slp {{to determine the extent}} to which this paradigm is conserved in Tribolium. We found that the role of prd is conserved between Drosophila and Tribolium; it is required in both insects to activate engrailed in odd-numbered parasegments and wingless (wg) in even-numbered parasegments. Similarly, slp is required to activate wg in alternate parasegments and to maintain the remaining wg stripes in both insects. However, the parasegmental register for Tc-slp is opposite that of Drosophila slp 1. Thus, while prd is functionally conserved, the fact that the register of slp function has evolved differently in the lineages leading to Drosophila and Tribolium reveals an unprecedented flexibility in pair-rule patterning...|$|R

50|$|The gap genes work to {{activate}} the pair-rule genes. Each <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> is expressed in seven stripes {{as a result of}} the combined effect of the gap genes and interactions between the other pair-rule genes. The pair-rule genes can be divided into two classes: the primary pair-rule genes and the secondary pair-rule genes. The primary pair-rules genes are able to influence the secondary pair-rule genes but not vice versa. The molecular mechanism between the regulation of the primary pair-rule genes was understood through a complex analysis of the regulation of even-skipped. Both positive and negative regulatory interactions by both maternal and gap genes and a unique combination of transcription factors work to express even-skipped in different parts of the embryo. The same gap gene can act positively in one stripe but negatively in another.|$|E

To examine {{the application of the}} model to other taxa, I studied the expression and function of pair-rule genes in Bombyx mori, together with a Bombyx homolog of Krüppel (Bm-Kr), a known gap gene. Knockdown embryos of Bombyx homologs of eve, run and odd (Bm-eve, Bm-run and Bm-odd) exhibited asegmental phenotypes similar to those of Tribolium knockdowns. However, <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> interactions were similar to those of both Tribolium and Drosophila, which, different from Tribolium, shows a hierarchical segmentation mode. Additionally, the Bm-odd expression pattern shares characteristics with those of Drosophila pair-rule genes that receive upstream regulatory input. On the other hand, Bm-Kr knockdowns exhibited a large posterior segment deletion as observed in short-germ insects. However, a detailed analysis of these embryos indicated that Bm-Kr modulates expression of pair-rule genes like in Drosophila, although the mechanisms appear to be different. This suggested hierarchical interactions between Bm-Kr and pair-rule genes. Based on these results, I concluded that the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> circuit model that describes Tribolium development is not applicable to Bombyx...|$|E
50|$|Just as Hox genes {{regulate}} realisator genes, {{they are}} in turn regulated themselves by gap <b>genes</b> and <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes,</b> which are in their turn regulated by maternally-supplied mRNA.

For example, high concentrations of one maternal protein and low concentrations of others will turn on {{a specific set of}} gap or <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes.</b> In flies, stripe 2 in the embryo is activated by the maternal proteins Bicoid and Hunchback, but repressed by the gap proteins Giant and Kruppel.

50|$|A {{segmentation}} gene is a gene {{involved in}} the early stages of pattern formation that define repeated units (metameres) in a segmented organism, usually the embryo.

The expression of gap genes result in the formation of gaps in the normal pattern of structure in the embryo.

40|$|The pair-rule {{segmentation}} gene even skipped (eve) {{is required}} to activate engrailed stripes and to organize odd-numbered parasegments (PSs). The protein product Eve {{has been shown to}} be an active repressor of transcription, and recent models for Eve function suggest that activation of engrailed is indirect, but these models have not been fully tested. Here we identify the forkhead domain transcription factor Sloppy-paired as the key intermediate in the initial activation of engrailed by Eve in odd-numbered parasegments. We also analyze the roles of the transcription factors Runt and Odd-skipped in this process. Detailed analysis of engrailed and <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> expression in various mutant combinations shows how eve activates engrailed by repressing these engrailed repressors, and further indicates that mutual repression among pair-rule genes plays an important role in establishing parasegment boundaries.

40|$|The Drosophila embryo transiently {{exhibits}} a double-segment periodicity, {{defined by the}} expression of seven 'pair-rule' genes, each in a pattern of seven stripes. At gastrulation, interactions between the pair-rule genes lead to frequency doubling and the patterning of 14 parasegment boundaries. In contrast to earlier stages of Drosophila anteroposterior patterning, this transition is not well understood. By carefully analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> expression, we demonstrate that frequency-doubling is precipitated by multiple coordinated changes to the network of regulatory interactions between the pair-rule genes. We identify the broadly expressed but temporally patterned transcription factor, Odd-paired (Opa/Zic), {{as the cause of}} these changes, and show that the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries relies on Opa-dependent regulatory interactions. Our findings indicate that the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> regulatory network has a temporally modulated topology, permitting the pair-rule genes to play stage-specific patterning roles.

50|$|<b>Pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> {{were first}} {{described}} by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus in 1980. They used a genetic screen to identify genes required for embryonic {{development in the}} fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In normal unmutated Drosophila, each segment produces bristles called denticles in a band arranged {{on the side of}} the segment closer to the head (the anterior). They found five genes - even-skipped, hairy, odd-skipped, paired and runt - where mutations caused the deletion of a particular region of every alternate segment. For example, in even-skipped, the denticle bands of alternate segments are missing, which results in an embryo having half the number of denticle bands. Later work identified more <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> in the Drosophila early embryo - fushi tarazu, odd-paired and sloppy paired.|$|R

40|$|Delta/Notch (Dl/N) {{signalling}} {{is involved}} in the gene regulatory network underlying the segmentation process in vertebrates and possibly also in annelids and arthropods, leading to the hypothesis that segmentation may have evolved in the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals. Because of seemingly contradicting results within the well-studied arthropods, however, the role and origin of Dl/N signalling in segmentation generally is still unclear. In this study, we investigate core components of Dl/N signalling by means of gene expression analysis in the onychophoran Euperipatoides kanangrensis, a close relative to the arthropods. We find that neither Delta or Notch nor any other investigated components of its signalling pathway are likely to be involved in segment addition in onychophorans. We instead suggest that Dl/N signalling may be involved in posterior elongation, another conserved function of these genes. We suggest further that the posterior elongation network, rather than classic Dl/N signalling, may be in the control of the highly conserved segment polarity gene network and the lower-level <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> network in onychophorans. Consequently, we believe that the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> network and its interaction with Dl/N signalling may have evolved within the arthropod lineage and that Dl/N signalling has thus likely been recruited independently for segment addition in different phyla...|$|E
40|$|In the short-germ beetle Tribolium castaneum, {{waves of}} <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} propagate from the posterior {{end of the}} embryo towards the anterior and eventually freeze into stable stripes, partitioning the anterior-posterior axis into segments. Similar waves in vertebrates are assumed to arise due to the modulation of a molecular clock by a posterior-to-anterior frequency gradient. However, neither a molecular candidate nor a functional role has been identified to date for such a frequency gradient, either in vertebrates or elsewhere. Here we provide evidence that the posterior gradient of Tc-caudal expression regulates the oscillation frequency of <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> expression in Tribolium. We show this by analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of Tc-even-skipped expression in strong and mild knockdown of Tc-caudal, and by correlating the extension, level and slope of the Tc-caudal expression gradient to the spatiotemporal dynamics of Tc-even-skipped expression in wild type {{as well as in}} different RNAi knockdowns of Tc-caudal regulators. Further, we show that besides its absolute importance for stripe generation in the static phase of the Tribolium blastoderm, a frequency gradient might serve as a buffer against noise during axis elongation phase in Tribolium as well as vertebrates. Our results highlight the role of frequency gradients in pattern formation...|$|E
50|$|The {{expression}} {{patterns of}} the final class of segmentation genes, the segment polarity genes, are then fine-tuned by interactions between the cells of adjacent parasegments (see the example, engrailed, Figure 7). The Engrailed protein is a transcription factor (yellow in Figure 7) that is expressed in one row of cells {{at the edge of}} each parasegment. This expression pattern is initiated by the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>genes</b> (like even-skipped) that code for transcription factors that regulate the engrailed gene's transcription in the syncytial blastoderm.|$|R
40|$|THE {{segments}} in long germ-band insect embryos, like Drosophila, are all determined at syncytial blastoderm stage. This {{is in contrast}} to short germ-band embryos which show an early determination of only the anterior head segments, whereas the more posterior thoracic and abdominal segments are sequentially added after formation of a primary germ anlage (reviewed in ref. 1).

We show here that hairy is expressed in several stripes at blastoderm stage and later on in two stripes in the growth zone of the developing embryo. Kruppel expression overlaps hairy stripe three and four expression, very similar to Drosophila.

40|$|AbstractDuring Drosophila embryogenesis, {{a genetic}} cascade {{establishes}} repeating developmental units, the parasegments, along the anterior-posterior axis. Anterior and posterior boundaries of parasegments {{are defined by}} narrow stripes of cells expressing the segment polarity genes engrailed and wingless, respectively. Through single and double mutant analysis, we describe genetic interactions regulating the precise activation of engrailed and wingless in alternate parasegments. The <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> odd-skipped and the segment polarity gene naked are both required to restrict engrailed expression. odd-skipped represses expression of fushi tarazu, a known activator of engrailed. naked prevents activation of engrailed by fushi tarazu, without affecting fushi tarazu expression. engrailed expression is thus limited to narrow stripes of cells at the anterior boundaries of these parasegments. wingless expression is regulated by both odd-skipped and the <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> paired. odd-skipped represses wingless expression, while paired restricts the domain of expression of odd-skipped. wingless expression is thus allowed in narrow stripes of cells at the posterior boundaries of these parasegments. Accurate expression of engrailed and wingless is also required for cells within each parasegment to assume their proper positional identity. In odd-skipped mutants, the positional identities of particular cells are changed, creating mirror-image duplications of the body pattern. We present a model describing how the altered expression patterns of fushi tarazu, engrailed, and wingless generate the mutant phenotype...|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila, a {{hierarchy}} of maternal, gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity gene interactions regulates virtually simultaneous blastoderm segmentation. For the last decade, {{studies have focused on}} revealing the extent to which Drosophila segmentation mechanisms are conserved in other arthropods where segments are added sequentially from anterior to posterior in a cellular environment. Despite our increased knowledge of individual segmentation genes, details of their interactions in non-Drosophilid insects are not well understood. We analyzed the Tribolium orthologs of Drosophila pair-rule genes, which display pair-rule expression patterns. Tribolium castaneum paired (Tc-prd) and sloppy-paired (Tc-slp) genes produced pair-rule phenotypes when their transcripts were severely reduced by RNA interference. In contrast, similar analysis of T. castaneum even-skipped (Tc-eve), runt (Tc-run), or odd-skipped (Tc-odd) genes produced severely truncated, almost completely asegmental phenotypes. Analysis of interactions between pair-rule components revealed that Tc-eve, Tc-run, and Tc-odd form a three-gene circuit to regulate one another as well as their downstream targets, Tc-prd and Tc-slp. The complement of primary pair-rule genes in Tribolium differs from Drosophila in that it includes Tc-odd but not Tc-hairy. This gene circuit defines segments sequentially in double segment periodicity. Furthermore, this single mechanism functions in the early blastoderm stage and subsequently during germ-band elongation. The periodicity of the Tribolium <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> interactions reveals components of the genetic hierarchy that are regulated in a repetitive circuit or clock-like mechanism. This <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> circuit provides insight into short-germ segmentation in Tribolium that may be more generally applicable to segmentation in other arthropods...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDevelopmental {{mechanisms}} of segmentation {{appear to be}} varied among insects {{in spite of their}} conserved body plan. Although the expression patterns of the segment polarity genes in all insects examined imply well conserved function of this class of genes, expression patterns and function of the pair-rule genes tend to exhibit diversity. To gain further insights into the evolution of the segmentation process and the role of pair-rule genes, we have examined expression and function of an ortholog of the Drosophila <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> even-skipped (eve) in a phylogenetically basal insect, Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera, intermediate germ cricket). We find that Gryllus eve (Gb'eve) is expressed as stripes in each of the prospective gnathal, thoracic, and abdominal segments and as a broad domain in the posterior growth zone. Dynamics of stripe formation vary among Gb'eve stripes, representing one of the three modes, the segmental, incomplete pair-rule, and complete pair-rule mode. Furthermore, we find that RNAi suppression of Gb'eve results in segmentation defects in both anterior and posterior regions of the embryo. Mild depletion of Gb'eve shows a pair-rule-like defect in anterior segments, while stronger depletion causes a gap-like defect showing deletion of anterior and posterior segments. These results suggest that Gb'eve acts as a <b>pair-rule</b> <b>gene</b> at least during anterior segmentation and also has segmental and gap-like functions. Additionally, Gb'eve may be involved in the regulation of hunchback and Krüppel expression. Comparisons with eve functions in other species suggest that the Gb'eve function may represent an intermediate state of the evolution of pair-rule patterning by eve in insects...|$|E
