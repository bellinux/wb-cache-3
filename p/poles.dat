5|$|According to some sources, the <b>Poles</b> resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, <b>Poles</b> had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What to the majority of <b>Poles</b> was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic <b>Poles</b> such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish <b>Poles.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Nazi {{occupation}} of Poland {{was among the}} most brutal of the war, resulting in death of more than 3 million ethnic <b>Poles</b> and about 3 million Polish Jews. The six million Jewish, Roman Catholic and Orthodox <b>Poles</b> represented nearly 17 percent of the country's population. <b>Poles</b> were one of Hitler's first extermination targets, as he outlined in an August 22, 1939 speech to Wehrmacht commanders before the invasion. Intelligentsia, socially prominent and influential people were primarily targeted, although ethnic <b>Poles</b> and other Slavic groups were also killed en masse. Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic and Orthodox <b>Poles</b> were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other concentration camps, and the intelligentsia were the first targets of the Einsatzgruppen death squads. The anti-Polish campaign culminated in the near-complete destruction of Warsaw, ordered by Hitler and Himmler in 1944.

5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the <b>poles</b> {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the <b>poles.</b> This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the <b>poles</b> and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the <b>poles,</b> this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E
