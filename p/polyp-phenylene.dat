25|$|Typical {{polymers}} used in pleaded displays include derivatives of <b>poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene) and polyfluorene.

25|$|While unsubstituted <b>poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene) (PPV) is {{typically}} insoluble, {{a number of}} PPVs and related poly(naphthalene vinylene)s (PNVs) that are soluble in organic solvents or water have been prepared via ring opening metathesis polymerization.

25|$|Research into polymer {{electroluminescence}} {{culminated in}} 1990 with J. H. Burroughes et al. at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, UK, reporting a high efficiency green light-emitting polymer based device using 100nm thick films of <b>poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene). Moving from molecular to macromolecular materials solved the problems previously encountered with the long-term {{stability of the}} organic films and enabled high-quality films to be easily made. Subsequent research developed multilayer polymers and the new field of plastic electronics and OLED research and device production grew rapidly.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{the most}} basic polymer OLEDs {{consisted}} of a single organic layer. One example was the first light-emitting device synthesised by J. H. Burroughes et al., which involved a single layer of <b>poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene). However multilayer OLEDs can be fabricated with two or more layers {{in order to improve}} device efficiency. As well as conductive properties, different materials may be chosen to aid charge injection at electrodes by providing a more gradual electronic profile, or block a charge from reaching the opposite electrode and being wasted. Many modern OLEDs incorporate a simple bilayer structure, consisting of a conductive layer and an emissive layer. [...] More recent developments in OLED architecture improves quantum efficiency (up to 19%) by using a graded heterojunction. In the graded heterojunction architecture, the composition of hole and electron-transport materials varies continuously within the emissive layer with a dopant emitter. The graded heterojunction architecture combines the benefits of both conventional architectures by improving charge injection while simultaneously balancing charge transport within the emissive region.|$|E

50|$|It {{is used as}} a disinfectant, pesticide, and deodorant, most familiarly in mothballs {{in which}} it is a {{replacement}} for the more traditional naphthalene because of naphthalene's greater flammability (though both chemicals have the same NFPA 704 rating).

Applications of PPS include automotive, microwave oven component, coating for cookware when blend with fluorocarbon polymers and protective coatings for valves, pipes, electromotive cells, etc.|$|E
50|$|Conductive {{polymers}} {{are often}} typically intrinsically conductive {{or at least}} semiconductors. They sometimes show mechanical properties {{comparable to those of}} conventional organic polymers. Both organic synthesis and advanced dispersion techniques can be used to tune the electrical properties of conductive polymers, unlike typical inorganic conductors. The most well-studied class of conductive polymers include polyacetylene, polypyrrole, polyaniline, and their copolymers. <b>Poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene) and its derivatives are used for electroluminescent semiconducting polymers.

5000|$|However, {{compression}} molding often provides poor product consistency and difficulty in controlling flashing, {{and it is}} not suitable for some types of parts.

50|$|Thermally {{activated}} reactions {{have been}} triggered in proteins, organic semiconductors, electroluminescent conjugated polymers, and nanoribbon resistors. Deprotection of functional groups (sometimes involving a temperature gradients), and {{the reduction of}} graphene oxide has been demonstrated. The wettability of a polymer surface at the nanoscale has been modified, and nanostructures of <b>poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene) (a electroluminescence conjugated polymer) have been created. Nanoscale templates on polymer films for the assembly of nano-objects such as proteins and DNA have also been created and crystallization of ferroelectric ceramics with storage densities up to 213 Gb/in2 have been produced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene) (PPV, or {{polyphenylene}} vinylene) is a {{conducting polymer}} of the rigid-rod polymer family. PPV {{is the only}} polymer of this type that can be processed into a highly ordered crystalline thin film. PPV and its derivatives are electrically conducting upon doping. Although insoluble in water, its precursors can be manipulated in aqueous solution. The small optical band gap and its bright yellow fluorescence makes PPV a candidate in applications such as light-emitting diodes (LED) and photovoltaic devices. Moreover, PPV can be doped to form electrically conductive materials. Its physical and electronic properties can be altered by the inclusion of functional side groups.|$|E
50|$|Polymer {{light-emitting}} diodes (PLEDs), similar to SM-OLED, emit light under an applied electric current. Polymer-based OLEDs {{are generally more}} efficient than SM-OLEDs requiring a comparatively lower amount of energy to produce the same luminescence. Common polymers used in PLEDs include derivatives of <b>poly(p-phenylene</b> vinylene) and polyfluorene. The emitted color can be tuned by substitution of different side chains onto the polymer backbone or modifying {{the stability of the}} polymer. In contrast to SM-OLEDs, polymer-based OLEDs cannot be fabricated through vacuum evaporation, and must instead be processed using solution-based techniques. Compared to thermal evaporation, solution based methods are more suited to creating films with large dimensions. Zhenan Bao. et al. at Stanford University reported a novel way to construct large-area organic semiconductor thin films using aligned single crystalline domains.|$|E
50|$|The thermal-oxidative {{degradation}} of a polymer starts at lower temperatures than the merely thermal degradation. Both types of degradation proceed via a radical mechanism. Aromatics offer a good protection against {{both types of}} degradation, because free radicals can be delocalized through the π-system of the aromatic and stabilized. In this way the thermal stability is strongly increasing. <b>Poly(p-phenylene)</b> can serve as an example, it consists exclusively of aromatics and provides extremely stability, even at temperatures above 500 °C. On the other hand the rigidity of the chains makes it more or less inprocessible. To find a balance between processability and stability, flexible units {{can be incorporated into}} the chain (e.g., O, S, C(CH3). Aromatics can also be substituted by other rather rigid units (e. g. SO2, CO). By mixing these different elements the diversity of high-performance plastics is created with their different characteristics.|$|E
