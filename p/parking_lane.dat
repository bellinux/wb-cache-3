2500|$|MD 147 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 1 (North Avenue) in Baltimore. [...] The south {{leg of the}} intersection is one-way northbound Harford Avenue; southbound Harford Avenue toward Downtown Baltimore is accessed via southbound Aisquith a few blocks to the west. [...] MD 147 heads northeast from US 1 as a five-lane road (three lanes northbound and two lanes southbound) that crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision. [...] Upon crossing 25th Street, the state highway widens to a six-lane divided street, passing along {{the western edge of}} Clifton Park. [...] As it does so, it meets the southern ends of MD 542 (The Alameda) and MD 41 (Hillen Road). [...] Within the Mayfield neighborhood, MD 147 narrows to four lanes undivided and passes by Lake Montebello and through Herring Run Park, where the highway crosses the namesake stream. [...] Beyond Argonne/Parkside Drive, the state highway dualizes once again and gains a northbound <b>parking</b> <b>lane,</b> with one southbound lane doubling as a <b>parking</b> <b>lane,</b> as it then passes through Lauraville, where the highway intersects Cold Spring Lane and Moravia Road. [...] Becoming undivided once again, MD 147 widens to accommodate two full-time parking lanes at Echodale Avenue before intersecting the southern end of Old Harford Road and then Northern Parkway in Hamilton. [...] Upon entering Baltimore County, the parking lanes close, and MD 147 continues as the main street of Parkville, narrowing further to two traffic lanes and two bike lanes just north of Taylor Avenue. [...] The state highway widens once again to four lanes just before Putty Hill Avenue and meets Interstate 695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
2500|$|The Seward Highway {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Railway Avenue, in Seward, less than [...] from the Gulf of Alaska. At this point, the Seward Highway is two lanes, with a <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> on each side. The Seward Highway is designated as AK-9 {{at this point}} of the route. The highway continues through central Seward, passing several small businesses, houses, the Seward Museum, {{as well as several}} hotels and motels. The highway continues past the Seward Airport, before entering the unincorporated community of Bear Creek. Just after entering Bear Creek, a series of tracks belonging to the Alaska Railroad comes alongside the roadway. These railroad tracks continue on with the Seward Highway until Moose Pass, return near a junction with the Portage Glacier Highway, and remain until the highway becomes a freeway, in southern Anchorage. The Seward Highway proceeds through central Bear Creek, passing Bear Lake, until entering Chugach National Forest.|$|E

50|$|When {{enough space}} is available, larger roads are {{fitted with a}} {{parallel}} fietspad (bike path) that is physically separated — for example {{by means of a}} verge, hedge, or <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> — from the roadway. In most cases, these bike paths are also physically separated from an adjacent footpath.|$|E
5000|$|The road {{currently}} {{consists of}} six vehicular lanes: four driving lanes, a <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> with turning bays southbound and a bus lane northbound. Previously existing bicycle lanes were removed in 2010 [...] "without any discernible public process". Northbound and southbound traffic is divided by a grassy center median.|$|E

Despite its name, its official address is on Piccadilly and overlooks Green Park rather than Hyde Park.|$|R
5000|$|As of February 2009, about 170 mi of Class II bike lanes run in streets, and {{the network}} is growing. Class II and Class III bike lanes are often blocked by trucks {{unloading}} and by double parked cars. A few, as in the westernmost block of Tillary Street between Adams Street and Cadman Plaza West in Brooklyn, replace the <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> and are separated from motor traffic by concrete barriers. The 8th and 9th Avenue bike lanes in Chelsea, Manhattan were rebuilt in late 2008 as Class II bike lanes between the curb and a new <b>parking</b> <b>lane,</b> {{and are expected to}} provide more safety. [...] Similar layouts were used in the reconstructions of 1st and 2nd Avenues in 2010, and in that of Columbus Avenue in 2011.|$|E
50|$|On {{the north}} side of Bishop Avenue, {{slightly}} east of the station (along the southern edge of the GO bus terminal) is a <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> for taxicabs. This is best accessed by exiting the subway station at the stairs/escalator to the north-east corner of Yonge and Bishop (the GO bus terminal).|$|E
50|$|Many streets, {{especially}} {{side streets}} in residential areas, {{have an extra}} lane's width on one or both sides for parallel parking. Most minor side streets allowing free parallel parking do not have pavement markings designating the <b>parking</b> <b>lane.</b> Main streets more often have parking lanes marked. Some streets are too busy or narrow for parking on the side. Sometimes parking {{on the sides of}} streets is allowed only at certain times. Curbside signs often state regulations about parking. Some streets, particularly in business areas, may have parking meters into which coins must be paid to allow parking in the adjacent space for a limited time. Other parking meters work on a credit card and ticket basis or pay and display. <b>Parking</b> <b>lane</b> markings on the pavement may designate the meter corresponding to a parking space. Some wide streets with light traffic allow angle parking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> College Leeds was {{the largest}} further {{education}} college in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, and provided further, higher and adult education to over 45,000 students.

50|$|Peak-only bus lanes are {{enforced}} only {{at certain}} times of the day, usually during rush hour, reverting to parking a general purpose or <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> at other times. Peak-only bus lanes may be in effect only in the main direction of travel, such as towards a downtown during morning rush hour traffic, with the buses using general purpose lanes in the other direction.|$|E
5000|$|A curb {{extension}} (or also neckdown, kerb extension, bulb-out, bump-out, kerb build-out, nib, elephant ear, curb bulge,"curb bulb" [...] and blister) is {{a traffic}} calming measure, primarily used {{to extend the}} sidewalk, reducing the crossing distance and allowing pedestrians about to cross and approaching vehicle drivers {{to see each other}} when vehicles parked in a <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> would otherwise block visibility.|$|E
50|$|Bus bulbs also retain more parking when {{compared}} to a bus stop located in a <b>parking</b> <b>lane,</b> as a bus stop so located requires run-in and run-out tapers. Together these tapers may take up as much space as the actual stop, requiring parking to be prohibited over a longer length of road than with a bulb, where cars can park immediately {{on either side of}} the bus stop itself.|$|E
50|$|There is {{access to}} the site from <b>Park</b> <b>Lane,</b> off Newbridge Road. Tiptree Parish Field is {{the eastern half of}} the larger <b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> Nature Reserve.|$|R
50|$|For the 1964 model year, the Mercury <b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> {{made its}} return as the Mercury {{division}} expanded its model line. Above the Monterey and newly reintroduced Montclair, the <b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> again topped the Mercury line. In {{contrast to the}} previous generation, the <b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> used the same wheelbase as other Mercury lines, differing primarily in trim.|$|R

Bike signals are installed at intersections to control safe crossing of cyclists in the separated lanes and regulate motor vehicle left turns across the bikeway.|$|E
50|$|A bus bulb, {{also called}} a bus boarder, bus border, bumpout or a bus cape, is an {{arrangement}} {{by which a}} sidewalk or pavement is extended outwards for a bus stop; typically the bus bulb replaces roadway {{that would otherwise be}} part of a <b>parking</b> <b>lane.</b> With bus bulbs or boarders, a bus can stay in its traffic lane to discharge and pick up passengers, instead of having to pull over to the curb.|$|E

50|$|Sharing its chassis {{with the}} Colony Park station wagon (and Edsel Citation/Corsair), the <b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> had a 125-inch {{wheelbase}} (3 inches {{longer than the}} standard Mercury chassis). In 1959, the <b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> wheelbase was stretched to 128 inches (2 inches longer than other Mercurys). For 1960, the <b>Park</b> <b>Lane</b> wheelbase was again changed, matching the 126 inches of the standard Mercury line.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of bike lanes on New York City streets: Class I, Class II and Class III. Class I bike lanes are {{typically}} physically separated from vehicular/pedestrian paths. Class II bike lanes are simply marked with paint and signage, and lie between a <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> and a traffic lane. Class III bike lanes are shared vehicular/bike lanes, usually only marked by signage. The majority of bike lanes in New York are Class II or Class III bike lanes.|$|E
50|$|Forsyth Street is {{interrupted}} north of Canal Street for one block {{due to a}} 20th-century schoolhouse, now housing Pace University High School and I.S. 131, built on the former route. From there it runs parallel to Chrystie Street that lies to its west, with Sara D. Roosevelt Park separating the two. Starting in October 2008, the parallel <b>parking</b> <b>lane</b> {{on the west side}} of the street lies not along the curbstone, but is separated from it by a bike lane carrying traffic north from the Manhattan Bridge. The street traverses the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.|$|E
5000|$|Many more {{computers}} and other technologies were implemented in vehicles throughout the decade such as: Xenon HID headlights, GPS, DVD players, self-diagnosing systems, memory systems for car settings, back-up sensors and cameras, in-car media systems, MP3 player compatibility, USB drive compatibility, keyless start and entry, satellite radio, voice-activation, cellphone connectivity, HUD (Head-Up-Display) and infrared cameras.
