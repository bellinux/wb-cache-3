25|$|The Enigma was an {{electro-mechanical}} {{rotor machine}} {{used for the}} encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implemented a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher, which turned plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contained rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverted the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flowed through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turned it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.|$|E

A brute-force attack is possible: one could imagine using 100 code clerks who each tried to decode a message using 1000 distinct rotor settings. The Poles developed card catalogs so they could easily find rotor positions; Britain built [...] "EINS" [...] (a common German word) catalogs. Less intensive methods were also possible. If all message traffic for a day used the same rotor starting position, then frequency analysis for each position could recover the <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitutions.</b> If different rotor starting positions were used, then overlapping portions of a message could be found using the index of coincidence. Many major powers (including the Germans) could break Enigma traffic if they knew the rotor wiring. The German military knew the Enigma was weak.|$|R

2500|$|In a {{groundbreaking}} 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed {{the notion of}} public-key (also, more generally, called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a public key and a private key. A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), {{even though they are}} necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair. The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as [...] "the most revolutionary new concept in the field since <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> emerged in the Renaissance".|$|E

5000|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, {{electro-mechanical}} machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution,</b> {{and a kind of}} [...] "additive" [...] substitution.

Keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British Bombe were invented to crack these encryption methods.|$|E

50|$|The Enigma {{machines}} {{produced a}} <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher. During World War I, inventors {{in several countries}} realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would, in principle, make a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher unbreakable. This {{led to the development}} of rotor cipher machines which alter each character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, by means of a scrambler comprising a set of rotors that alter the electrical path from character to character, between the input device and the output device. This constant altering of the electrical pathway produces a very long period before the pattern—the key sequence or substitution alphabet—repeats.|$|E
5000|$|Simple ciphers were {{replaced}} by <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers (such as the Vigenère) which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter. For example, [...] "GOOD DOG" [...] can be encrypted as [...] "PLSX TWF" [...] where [...] "L", [...] "S", and [...] "W" [...] substitute for [...] "O". With even {{a small amount of}} known or estimated plaintext, simple <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers and letter transposition ciphers designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack. It is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on a one-time pad though, but the usual disadvantages of one-time pads apply.|$|E
50|$|The Enigma rotor {{cipher machine}} was {{potentially}} an excellent system. It generated a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher, with a period before {{repetition of the}} substitution alphabet that was much longer than any message, or set of messages, sent with the same key.|$|E
50|$|A {{polyalphabetic}} cipher is any cipher {{based on}} substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The Vigenère cipher {{is probably the}} best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, {{though it is a}} simplified special case.

50|$|In cryptanalysis, Kasiski {{examination}} (also {{referred to}} as Kasiski's test or Kasiski's method) is a method of attacking <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers, such as the Vigenère cipher.

5000|$|Another {{example of}} a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher that is much more {{difficult}} to decode is the Vigenère square, an innovative encoding method. With the square, there are 26 different cipher alphabets that are used to encrypt text. Each cipher alphabet is just another rightward Caesar shift of the original alphabet. This is what a Vigenère square looks like: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} cryptography, {{the running}} key cipher {{is a type}} of <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher in which a text, typically from a book, is used to provide a very long keystream. Usually, the book to be used would be agreed ahead of time, while the passage to be used would be chosen randomly for each message and secretly indicated somewhere in the message.|$|E
50|$|The Alberti cipher disk, {{also called}} formula, is a cipher disc which was {{described}} by Leon Battista Alberti in his treatise De Cifris of 1467. The device embodies the first example of <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> with mixed alphabets and variable period, and {{is made up of}} two concentric disks, attached by a common pin, which can rotate one with respect to the other.|$|E
50|$|The grill method (metoda rusztu), in cryptology, was {{a method}} used chiefly early on, {{before the advent}} of the cyclometer, by the mathematician-cryptologists of the Polish Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów) in decrypting German Enigma machine ciphers. The Enigma rotor cipher machine changes {{plaintext}} characters into cipher text using a different permutation for each character, and so implements a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher.|$|E
50|$|By itself, a rotor {{performs}} only a {{very simple}} type of encryption—a simple substitution cipher. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter E might be wired to the contact for letter T on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher.|$|E
50|$|Rotor {{machines}} {{build on}} this idea by, in effect, changing the wiring with each key stroke. The wiring is placed inside a rotor, and then rotated with a gear {{every time a}} letter was pressed. So while pressing A the first time might generate a Q, the next time it might generate a J. Every letter pressed on the keyboard would spin the rotor and get a new substitution, implementing a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher.|$|E
50|$|The Alberti cipher by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 is {{believed}} to be the first polyalphabetic cipher. Alberti used a mixed alphabet to encrypt a message, but whenever he wanted to, he would switch to a different alphabet, indicating that he had done so by including an uppercase letter or a number in the cryptogram. For this encipherment Alberti used a decoder device, his cipher disk, which implemented a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> with mixed alphabets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers {{were first}} {{described}} in 1467 by Battista Alberti {{in the form}} of disks. Trithemius, in his book Steganographia (Greek for [...] "hidden writing") introduced the now more standard form of a tableau (see below; ca. 1500 but not published until much later). A more sophisticated version using mixed alphabets was described in 1563 by Battista della Porta in his book, De Furtivis Literarum Notis (Latin for [...] "On concealed characters in writing").|$|E
50|$|The Alberti Cipher Disk {{described}} by Leon Battista Alberti in his treatise De Cifris embodies {{the first example}} of <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> with mixed alphabets and variable period. This device, called Formula, {{is made up of}} two concentric disks, attached by a common pin, which can rotate one with respect to the other. The larger one is called Stabilis or fixed, the smaller one is called Mobilis movable. The circumference of each disk is divided into 24 equal cells.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{component}} {{is a set}} of rotors, also termed wheels or drums, which are rotating disks with an array of electrical contacts on either side. The wiring between the contacts implements a fixed substitution of letters, replacing them in some complex fashion. On its own, this would offer little security; however, after encrypting each letter, the rotors advance positions, changing the substitution. By this means, a rotor machine produces a complex <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher, which changes with every keypress.|$|E
50|$|Because both ciphers classically {{employed}} novels as part {{of their}} key material, many sources confuse the book cipher and the running key cipher. They are really only very distantly related. The running key cipher is a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution,</b> the book cipher is a homophonic substitution. Perhaps the distinction is most clearly made by the fact that a running cipher would work best of all with a book of random numbers, whereas such a book (containing no text) would be useless for a book cipher.|$|E
50|$|As a concept, polygraphic {{substitution}} {{contrasts with}} monoalphabetic (or simple) substitutions in which individual letters are uniformly substituted, or polyalphabetic substitutions in which individual letters are substituted {{in different ways}} depending on {{their position in the}} text. In theory, there is some overlap in these definitions; one could conceivably consider a Vigenère cipher with an eight-letter key to be an octographic substitution. In practice, this is not a useful observation since it is far more fruitful to consider it to be a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} examples {{were all}} examples of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, where just one cipher alphabet is used. It {{is also possible}} to have a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher, where multiple cipher alphabets are used. The encoder would just make up two or more cipher alphabets using whatever techniques he or she chooses, and then encode their message, alternating what cipher alphabet is used with every letter or word. This makes the message much harder to decode because the codebreaker would have to figure out both cipher alphabets.|$|E
50|$|To avoid merely {{implementing}} a simple (and easily breakable) substitution cipher, every key press caused {{one or more}} rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher. The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model. The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is clear}} from Yardley's {{description}} that Hyakutake's new system was not very effective. The system used 10 charts, each with 26 rows and columns labeled from [...] to [...] This gives 626 two-letter code groups. Most words and phrases {{will not be in}} the code and must be spelled out in kana. In this respect it is similar to, but larger than, the first Japanese code that Yardley broke in 1919. The difference is that this time however there were ten codes instead of just one.Basically, Hyakutake created a poly-code system where the code changes every few words. This is just a code version of a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher. Polyalphabetic ciphers use several different enciphering alphabets and change between them at some interval, usually after every letter. The strength of a polyalphabetic cipher comes from how many alphabets it uses to encipher, how often it switches between them, and how it switches between them (at random or following some pattern for example). The Vigenere is probably the most famous example of a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> cipher. The famous cipher machines of World War II encipher in a polyalphabetic system. Their strength came from the enormous number of well-mixed alphabets that they used and the fairly random way of switching between them.|$|E
5000|$|In 1863, Kasiski {{published}} a 95-page book on cryptography, Die Geheimschriften und die Dechiffrir-Kunst (German, [...] "Secret {{writing and the}} Art of Deciphering"). This was the first {{published a}}ccount of a procedure for attacking <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> ciphers, especially the Vigenère cipher (although it is possible Charles Babbage was already aware of a similar method but had not published it). The method relied on the analysis of gaps between repeated fragments in the ciphertext; such analysis can give hints as {{to the length of}} the key used. This technique is known as Kasiski examination.|$|E
