(ll.181–216). This is thought to be a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8AD.|$|E

25|$|Within {{six months}} of their marriage, Gustavus Adolphus left to command the siege of Riga, leaving Maria Eleonora {{in the early stages}} of her first pregnancy. She lived {{exclusively}} in the company of her German ladies-in-waiting and had difficulty in adapting herself to the Swedish people, countryside and climate. She disliked the bad roads, sombre forests and wooded houses, roofed with turf. She also <b>pined</b> for her husband. A year after their wedding she had a miscarriage and became seriously ill. She was tempestuous, excessive, neurotic and jealous. She was often given to harsh language, and she did not spare her husband, even when strangers were present. Her emotional life lacked balance, and everything Maria Eleonora undertook on her own initiative needed careful watching. Soon Gustavus Adolphus' intimates knew that his married life was a source of grief and anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Harley Quinn - Completely {{loyal to}} the Joker in her first appearances, even though he mistreats her. She starts to develop {{feelings}} for the Green Goblin, which is briefly hinted at when she accepts Goblin's offer {{to go out on}} a date for coffee at the end of After Hours. At the end of Happy Hour she had been living with Goblin, but in Zero Hour it was shown that she still <b>pined</b> for the then presumed-dead Joker, much to Goblin's dismay. At the conclusion of Zero Hour she chooses to give up on the Joker and joins the Goblin in the parallel reality that Darkseid intended to house a 'rebooted' version of the world of the combined universe which Stan's Place inhabited. Both she and the Goblin are apparently replaced by their 'reboot' counterparts in the main reality at the end of Zero Hour. The reboot versions appear to have no romantic feelings towards one another. The fate of the original versions, presumably still in the 'rebooted' universe are currently unknown.|$|E

The show's head writer Bradley Bell said, [...] "Hope's presence at Forrester Creations, as well as in Brooke and Ridge's home, sparks an intense competition between Hope and her step-sister Steffy as well as creates new conflict between long-time rivals Brooke and Taylor as each woman is determined to protect her own daughter." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{her time}} at Chanhassen, Adams acted {{in her first}} filma {{black-and-white}} short satire named The Chromium Hook. Soon after, while she was off work nursing a pulled muscle, she attended the locally held auditions for the Hollywood film Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), a satire on beauty pageants starring Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, and Kirstie Alley. Adams was cast in the supporting part of a promiscuous cheerleader. She felt that her character's personality was far removed from her own and worried about how people would perceive her. The production was filmed locally, which enabled Adams to shoot for her role while also performing Brigadoon on stage. Encouragement from Alley prompted Adams to actively pursue a film career, and she moved to Los Angeles in January 1999. She described her initial experience in the city as [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "bleak", and she <b>pined</b> for her life back in Chanhassen.|$|E

500|$|By 1949, Feynman was {{becoming}} restless at Cornell. He never {{settled into a}} particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends [...] "until these arrangements became sexually volatile". He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends. He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and <b>pined</b> for a warmer climate. Above all, at Cornell, he {{was always in the}} shadow of Hans Bethe. Feynman did, however, look back favorably on the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as [...] "a group of boys [...] have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it's there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize.|$|E
500|$|Louise Watson, {{writing for}} Screenonline, felt the film's costume and make-up help [...] "convey the full Cinderella {{transformation}} of Austen's heroine. At first the undervalued family martyr, Anne is the wallflower {{who has lost}} her 'bloom'. Her loose-fitting costumes hint at how she has <b>pined</b> away since refusing Wentworth... As she regains her confidence, she blossoms; she dresses becomingly, her eyes sparkle and her features become animated". Paulette Richards argues that the film's [...] "unreliable" [...] male characters, such as Sir Walter, are identified as such by the flamboyant nature of their clothing. This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers, {{who live in a}} culture where [...] "real men" [...] are expected to care little for their clothing. Conversely, the film's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms, which is a contrast to Bryan Marshall's version of the character in the 1971 adaptation. This uniform helps set Wentworth apart from many of the other male characters, allowing him to appear romantic but isolated. Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film, writing that it accurately captures Austen's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy. The naval men's profession is emphasised by the frequency of wearing their uniforms, in contrast to other adaptations of the novel.|$|E
500|$|A quiet, social bird, the huia was monogamous, and pairs {{probably}} paired for life. The {{bird was}} usually found in breeding pairs, although sometimes {{groups of four}} or more were encountered. Walter Buller records that a tame pair would always keep close to each other, constantly uttering a [...] "low affectionate twitter", even when in captivity. There are records of this same pair and a further, wild pair [...] "hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails, then meeting to caress each other with their bills" [...] and uttering these noises. The male {{is said to have}} fed the female in courtship. It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display. The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest [...] "lacks evidence". When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed, the female [...] "manifesting the utmost distress <b>pined</b> for her mate and died 10 days afterwards". A Māori man in the 19th century recalled: [...] "I was always told by my old people that a pair of huia lived on most affectionate terms... If the male died first, the female died soon after of grief". The huia had no fear of people; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest, and birds could easily be captured by hand.|$|E
