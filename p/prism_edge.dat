Here, we realize low-symmetry achiral and chiral elastic colloids in the nematic liquid crystals using colloidal polygonal concave and convex prisms.

The controlled localization of the disclinations at the <b>prism's</b> <b>edges</b> significantly influences anisotropy of the diffusion properties of prisms dispersed in liquid crystals and allows one to modify their self-assembly. We show that elastic interactions between polygonal prisms can be switched between repulsive and attractive just by controlled re-pinning the disclinations at different edges using laser tweezers.

One can then suggest that similarly to the layered high-T, superconductors the conductivity in NbSe 3 is localized in highly conducting atomic layers well isolated from each other.

As seen from Fig. 1 b the elementary prisms in the bc-plane are assembled into the coupled bi-layers where <b>prism</b> <b>edges</b> are oriented and shifted towards each other. That provides conducting layers with higher density of conducting chains (shaded layers in Fig. lb) which are separated from neighbor conducting layer by double barrier of insulating prism bases, It has been suggested [7] that the CDW condensation occurs mostly in elementary conducting layers. That results in the modulation of the amplitude of the CDW order parameter across the layers providing the possibility of interlayer tunneling as in layered high-Tc superconductors.

40|$|We {{consider}} core-shell nanowires with conductive {{shell and}} insulating core, and with polygonal cross section. We investigate {{the implications of}} this geometry on Majorana states expected in the presence of proximity-induced superconductivity and an external magnetic field. A typical prismatic nanowire has a hexagonal profile, but square and triangular shapes can also be obtained. The low-energy states are localized at the corners of the cross section, i. e. along the <b>prism</b> <b>edges,</b> and are separated by a gap from higher energy states localized on the sides. The corner localization depends on the details of the shell geometry, i. e. thickness, diameter, and sharpness of the corners. We study systematically the low-energy spectrum of prismatic shells using numerical methods and derive the topological phase diagram as a function of magnetic field and chemical potential for triangular, square, and hexagonal geometries. A strong corner localization enhances the stability of Majorana modes to various perturbations, including the orbital effect of the magnetic field, whereas a weaker localization favorizes orbital effects and reduces the critical magnetic field. The prismatic geometry allows the Majorana zero-energy modes to be accompanied by low-energy states, which we call pseudo Majorana, and which converge to real Majoranas in the limit of small shell thickness. We include the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a phenomenological manner, assuming a radial electric field across the shell. Comment: 14 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in Phys.

Such materials exhibit a large Faraday rotation which make them advantageous for application in compact mag­netic field sensors. After an introduction, in which fibre optic sensors and optical methods to measure electric current are reviewed, the original research work is summarized. A system for the measurement of the magneto-optic properties of trans­parent materials is described. Measurement results, showing the influence of temperature, magnetic field direction and sample treatment on the magneto-optical proper­ties of YIG-crystals, are presented. The proper­ties of thin magneto-optical waveguiding films have also been studied using different light coupling methods. Measurement results obtained for holo­graphic grating, <b>prism</b> and <b>edge</b> (end-fire) light coupling to different substituted YIG films are presented. It is shown that the launching method may affect the properties to be measured. The design and performance of several versions of extrinsic guided wave fibre optic magnetic field sensors are then reported. The sensors employ substi­tuted YIG (Yttrium Iron Garnet, Y 3 Fe 5 O 12) thin film waveguides as sensing elements. Polari­zation maintaining fibres were used as feed and return to provide two signal channels. The signals were combined in a balanced measure­ment system, providing insensitivity to both fluctuations in optical power and loss. Sensors have been made both with separate fibres to guide the light {{to and from the}} sensing element and with a single fibre for both functions. The two fibre version, although less ”elegant”, is found to have a better performance. This version also makes it possible to determine both the magnitude and sign of the magnetic field. Measurement results indicate a usable measurement range of at least several mT with a noise equivalent magnetic field level of less than 8  nT/root(Hz).

40|$|Earth dam with {{impervious}} {{element in}} the form of asphaltic concrete core is currently the most promising type of earth dams (due to simple construction technology and universal service properties of asphaltic concrete) and is widely used in the world. However, experience in the construction and operation of high dams (above 160 m) is not available, and their work is scarcely explored. In this regard, the paper discusses the results of computational prediction of the stress-strain state and stability of a high earth dam (256 m high) with the core. The authors considered asphaltic concrete containing 7 % of bitumen as the material of the core. Gravel was considered as the material of resistant prisms. Design characteristics of the rolled asphaltic concrete and gravel were obtained from the processing of the results of triaxial tests. The calculations were performed using finite element method in elastoplastic formulation and basing on the phased construction of the dam and reservoir filling. The research shows, that the work of embankment dam with vertical core during filling of the reservoir is characterized by horizontal displacement of the lower resistant prism in the tailrace and the formation of a hard wedge prism descending along the core in the upper resistant prism. The key issue of the safety assessment is to determine the safety factor of the overall stability of the dam, for calculation of which the destruction of the earth dam is necessary, which can be done by reducing the strength properties of the dam materials. As a results of the calculations, the destruction of the dam occurs with a decrease in the strength characteristics of the materials of the dam by 2. 5 times. The dam stability depends on the stability of the lower resistant prism. The destruction of its slope occurs on the classical circular-cylindrical surface. The presence of a potential collapse surface in the upper resistant <b>prism</b> (on the <b>edges</b> of the descending wedge) does not affect the overall stability of the dam...|$|R
