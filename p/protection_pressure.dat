However, many of ecological environmental have been severely damaged by human being’s irrational activities, such as mining, deforestation, excavation herbs, etc. Faced with ecological and environmental <b>protection</b> <b>pressure,</b> it’s urgent to carry out ecological restoration projects according to the local conditions. Remote sensing technology is widely used in terrestrial ecosystems restoration because of its objectivity, real-timing, accuracy, covering a wide area and other unique advantages. This article discusses the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems based on remote sensing technology. At last, it analyses development trends of this research area...|$|E
40|$|I-WARP {{is based}} upon a nonhomogeneous Poisson {{approach}} to model breakage rates in individual water mains. The structural deterioration of water mains and their subsequent failure are affected by many factors, both static (e. g., pipe material, pipe size, age (vintage), soil type) and dynamic (e. g., climate, cathodic <b>protection,</b> <b>pressure</b> zone changes). I-WARP allows for the consideration of both static and dynamic factors in the statistical analysis of historical breakage patterns. This paper describes the mathematical approach and demonstrates its application {{with the help of}} a case study. The research project within which I-WARP was developed, was jointly funded by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), and the Water Research foundation (formerly known as the American Water Works Association Research Foundation – AwwaRF) and supported by water utilities from USA and Canada...|$|E
40|$|Formulation of {{different}} ecological zone plans {{according to the}} corresponding protection targets {{and the necessity of}} proper conservation policy is one of the measures to achieve the goal of ecological conservation in China. In order to clarify the interrelation among key ecological zone plans, this paper carried out the research on spatial relation of priority areas of biodiversity conservation and three key ecological areas (key ecological function areas, key regions of ecological service function, national nature reserves) and the research on ecological conditions, based on multi-scale ecological spatial theme information, which incorporates elements like ecological quality and type, and by the aid of spatial information analysis and GIS modeling. The results showed a contrastively fine spatial consistency with 68. 8 % of priority areas of biodiversity conservation overlapping with three key ecological areas. Although the environment in priority areas of biodiversity conservation were in good conditions, <b>protection</b> <b>pressure</b> is also increasing, powerful supervision and protection should not be ignored. The environmental conditions in the overlapping areas, as a whole, were superior to those in the non-overlapping areas. Since two areas have different characteristics, targeted protection measures should be formulated based on this difference, which will be very important for biodiversity conservation in priority areas of biodiversity conservation...|$|E

40|$|Centralized {{and group}} well {{deployment}} and factory-like fracturing techniques are adopted for low-permeability tight sandstone reservoirs in the Sulige Gasfield, Ordos Basin, {{so as to}} realize its efficient and economic development. However, environmental protection is faced with grim situations because fluid delivery rises abruptly on site {{in a short time}} due to centralized fracturing of the well group. Based on the characteristics of gas testing after fracturing in this gas field, a fracturing flowback fluid recovery and treatment method suitable for the Sulige Gasfield has been developed with the landform features of this area taken into account. Firstly, a high-efficiency well-to-well fracturing flowback fluid recovery and reutilization technique was developed with multi-effect surfactant polymer recoverable fracturing fluid system as the core, and in virtue of this technique, the treatment efficiency of conventional guar gum fracturing fluid system is increased. Secondly, for recovering and treating the end fluids on the well sites, a fine fracturing flowback fluid recovery and treatment technique has been worked out with “coagulation and precipitation, filtration and disinfection, and sludge dewatering” as the main part. Owing to the application of this method, the on-site water resource utilization ratio has been increased and environmental <b>protection</b> <b>pressure</b> concerned with fracturing operation has been relieved. In 2014, field tests were performed in 62 wells of 10 well groups, with 32980  m 3 cumulative treated flowback fluid, 17160  m 3 reutilization volume and reutilization ratio over 70 %. Obviously, remarkable social and economical benefits are thus realized...|$|E
40|$|A pilot {{power system}} formed by {{photovoltaic}} panels, alkaline electrolyser and fuel cell stacks {{was designed and}} set up to supply the heating system of an experimental greenhouse. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyse the main safety aspects of this power system connected to the management of the pressured hydrogen, such as the explosion limits of the mixture hydrogen-oxygen, the extension of the danger zone, the <b>protection</b> <b>pressure</b> vessels and the system to make unreactive the plant. The electrolyser unit is the core of this plant and from the safety point of view has been equipped with devices able to highlight the malfunctions before they cause damages. Alarm situations are highlighted and the production process is cut off in safe conditions in the event that the operational parameters have an abnormal deviation from the design values. Also the entire power system has been designed so that any failure to its components does not compromise the workers’ safety even if the risk analysis is in progress because technical operations are being carried out for enhancing the plant functionality, making it more suitable to the designed task of supplying electrically the greenhouse heating system during cold periods. Some experimental data pertinent to the solar radiation and the corresponding hydrogen production rate are also reported. At present it does not exist a well-established safety reference protocol to design the reliability of these types of power plants and then the assumed safety measures even if related to the achieved pilot installation, can represent an original base of reference to set up guidelines for designing the safety of power plants in the future available for agricultural purposes...|$|E

BUILDING COMMUNITY BASED INITIATIVES IN RURAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES In rural coastal communities, the trade offs between conserving and developing environmentally sensitive resources are particularly acute.

50|$|For liquid-packed vessels, {{thermal relief}} valves are {{generally}} {{characterized by the}} relatively small size of the valve necessary to provide <b>protection</b> from excess <b>pressure</b> caused by thermal expansion. In this case a small valve is adequate because most liquids are nearly incompressible, and so a relatively small amount of fluid discharged through the relief valve will produce a substantial reduction in pressure.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{limitations}} of the technology a distinction is made between handgun protection and rifle protection. See NIJ levels 3 and 4 for typical requirements for rifle resistant armor. Broadly rifle resistant armor is of three basic types: ceramic plate-based systems, steel plate with spall fragmentation protective coating, and hard fiber-based laminate systems. Many rifle armor components contain both hard ceramic components and laminated textile materials used together. Various ceramic materials types are in use, however: aluminum oxide, boron carbide and silicon carbide are the most common. The fibers used in these systems are the same as found in soft textile armor. However, for rifle <b>protection</b> high <b>pressure</b> lamination of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene with a Kraton matrix is the most common.|$|R

50|$|A high-integrity <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> system (HIPPS) {{is a type}} {{of safety}} {{instrumented}} system (SIS) designed to prevent over-pressurization of a plant, such as a chemical plant or oil refinery. The HIPPS will shut off the source of the high pressure before the design pressure of the system is exceeded, thus preventing loss of containment through rupture (explosion) of a line or vessel. Therefore, a HIPPS is considered as a barrier between a high-pressure and a low-pressure section of an installation.|$|R

40|$|Are {{the wide}} bands {{adopted in the}} summer of 1993 too large? The {{official}} answer is that wide bands offer a <b>protection</b> against speculative <b>pressure,</b> while exchange rates may be kept within narrower margins at the discretion of the authorities. Yet if exchange rate fixity and predictability are desirable, as implicitly assumed by the mere existence of the system, there must exist a trade-off between <b>protection</b> against speculative <b>pressure</b> and predictability. In that case, the bandwidth chosen should be as narrow as possible and yet unlikely to be challenged by the markets. This paper offers estimates of 'safe' bandwidths. For the long-term member currencies (French franc, peseta, Danish krone and escudo), the existing 15 % bands are found to be unnecessarily wide: narrower 3. 5 % bands would capture at least 95 % of expected exchange rate realizations over a three-month horizon. For the lira, Finnish markka and Swedish krone, wider bands of 5 - 6 % would capture a similar amount of the exchange rate distribution. The pound's exchange rate expectations are the most dispersed, requiring 8. 4 % bands to capture 95 % of exchange rate expectations.
