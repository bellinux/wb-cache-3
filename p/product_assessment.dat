Determining the concurrent validity of process and <b>product</b> <b>assessments</b> is important to address the predictive utility of motor competence for health. The current study aimed to: (1) compare process and <b>product</b> <b>assessments</b> of the standing long jump, hop and throw across age groups and (2) determine the capacity of process assessments to classify levels of MC. Participants included 170 children classified into three age groups: 4 – 5, 7 – 8 and 10 – 11  years old. Participants’ skills were examined concurrently using three process assessments ((Test of Gross Motor Development- 2 nd edition [TGMD- 2]), Get Skilled; Get Active, and developmental sequences) and one product measure (throw speed, jump and hop distance). Results indicate moderate to strong correlations between (1) process assessments across skills and age groups (r range = . 37 – 70) and (2) process and <b>product</b> <b>assessments</b> across skills and age groups (r range = . 26 –. 88).

40|$|Abstract. As the {{existence}} of creativity is a judgment, relative to personal or group norms {{it is helpful to}} understand what factors inform that judgment. Creativity can be assessed using either the designed product or the design process. Judging the process is much more problematic than judging the product. Besemer’s Creative Product Semantic Scale for <b>product</b> <b>assessment</b> provides three dimensions, with nine attributes {{that can be used for}} judgments. As expected, “novelty ” is one of the dimensions, but its three attributes provide more subtlety. This paper discusses how creative <b>product</b> <b>assessment</b> scales might provide important clues about how computational systems can be built or controlled in order to produce creative products. 1...|$|E

The samples were people in Bangkok and Metropolitan Area (BMA), who intended to purchase eco cars within the next six months. Survey research with structured questionnaire was a method used for data collection. Multiple regressions were applied to test the research hypotheses, and the sample size required 500 respondents. The findings revealed that country of corporate ownership (COC), country of manufacture (COM), country of parts (COP), and Country of Brand (COB) had the effects on <b>product</b> quality <b>assessment</b> of eco cars while <b>product</b> quality <b>assessment</b> also had an effect on purchase intention. Moreover, COP and COM had the effects on perception of product value of eco cars whereas the perception of value also had an effect on purchase intention of eco cars.

Such <b>product</b> <b>assessment</b> is better handled by a team of experts possessing the required experience and technical knowledge to define the material and performance issues and the required assessment protocol to establish the suitability for use of the product, including its conformance to the applicable codes and standards. The team of experts needs to be from a number of technical fields to properly define the required performance criteria and test methods for the assessment protocol, as the new products increasingly consist of composite materials and they are often proposed for different applications. The new products may not provide the built-in redundancy that practice have been relying on from traditional materials over the years. The impact of the new products on the long term performance of building assemblies and components may be quite significant given their different physical properties and proposed applications. In addition, the requirements defined in codes and standards were not developed for these new products and these need to be addressed in terms of their intent.
