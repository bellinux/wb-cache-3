40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine the {{mediator}} and moderator role of self-compassion on the relationship between <b>psychological</b> suffering <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being among Palestinian widowed women. The participants were 160 Palestinian widowed women ranging in age from 30 - 55 and benefited from social affairs services in the southern governorates of Gaza. The participants responded to questionnaire measuring self-compassion, <b>psychological</b> suffering <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being. The results showed that the relationship between <b>psychological</b> suffering <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being was fully mediated by self-compassion. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that self- compassion also moderated the relationship between <b>psychological</b> suffering <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being. This study presents an empirical framework for the research through investigating the relationship between <b>psychological</b> suffering, self-compassion, <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being for Palestinian widowed women...|$|R

Theory has linked the level of engagement, meaningfulness <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety of employees to the leadership structure within an organisation. Disengaged employees have considerable cost implications for organisations. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the relationship between work engagement, <b>psychological</b> meaningfulness <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety amongst leaders within the workplace. This study further investigated the possible moderating role of job level on <b>psychological</b> meaning <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety on work engagement. Using non-probability sampling, a quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was administered to a sample of individuals from several organisations in the Gauteng province (N = 587). The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES- 9 item), the Psychological Conditions Scale (PCS), the Psychological Meaningfulness Scale (PMS), and Kahn’s method of measuring psychological safety were utilised. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients between work engagement, <b>psychological</b> meaningfulness <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety were determined. Moderated multiple regression analysis was used to determine if the levels of leadership explained variance in the variables measured. In addition, a MANOVA was performed to determine the difference in means between the levels of leadership <b>and</b> work engagement, <b>psychological</b> meaningfulness <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety respectively. Further to this, one-way ANOVA were then conducted for work engagement, <b>psychological</b> meaningfulness <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety with regards to each level of leadership respectively. Results confirmed that a significant positive relationship exists between work engagement <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> meaningfulness, between work engagement <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety <b>and</b> between <b>psychological</b> meaningfulness <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> safety respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the relationship of mindfulness with <b>psychological</b> well-being <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> distress <b>and</b> assessed the role of self-regulation and autonomy as mediating variables and mechanisms of mindfulness. Participants were 717 students (Mean age= 17 / 3 yr., SD= 0 / 56) completed the Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS; Cardaciotto et al., 2008), the Self- Regulation Inventory (SRI - 25; Ibanez et al., 2008), the Mental Health Inventory (MHI- 28; Besharat, 2009) and the Autonomy Scale (AS; Parto, 2010). Mindfulness was negatively and highly correlated with <b>psychological</b> distress <b>and</b> was positively and highly correlated with psychological well-being. Autonomy was mediated relationships of mindfulness with <b>psychological</b> well- being <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> distress, whereas, self-regulation was mediated only the relationship between mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being. The findings provided evidence for the mediating mechanisms through which autonomy and self- regulation mediated the relationship between mindfulness with <b>psychological</b> well-being <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> distress...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between work-home <b>and</b> home-work interference, <b>psychological</b> conditions <b>and</b> employee engagement. A cross-sectional survey design was used. The participants were 292 employees of a uranium mine in Namibia residing in towns distant from their workplace. The following measuring instruments were used: Survey Work-Home Interaction – Nijmegen, <b>Psychological</b> Conditions Scale <b>and</b> Employee Engagement Questionnaire. Negative work-home interaction (work-home/home-work spillover) was negatively related to psychological meaningfulness, <b>psychological</b> availability, <b>and</b> employee engagement.

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E

Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O.

Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> behavioural sciences.
