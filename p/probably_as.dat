5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} abbey began to lease out its land (most <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a {{solution}} to their falling income). By 1477 only the demesne lands in Leicester, Stoughton and Ingarsby remained un-leased, and were directly farmed by the abbey.|$|E

5|$|Carbon was {{discovered}} in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations. Diamonds were known <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> early as 2500BCE in China, while carbon {{in the form of}} charcoal was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a pyramid covered with clay to exclude air.|$|E

In 1799, in Mantua he {{passed in the}} Austrian service, taking on garrison duties in Passau until, in 1803, the city {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Bavaria. In 1804, in Wien, he married Wilhelmina Franziska von Koskull, daughter of a noble Curlandian family.|$|E
5|$|John Horsefield died on 6 March 1854, aged 62, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a {{consequence}} of a strangulated hernia that had been masked by a tumour. He was buried on 10 March 1854 at the St. Mary's Church, Prestwich, although {{at some point in}} his life it seems that he had upset the authorities of the established church for reasons unknown. His table tomb was listed as a Grade II monument by English Heritage in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean {{domestic}} architecture originates {{mainly from}} earlier Middle Helladic traditions (c. 2000–1650 BC) both in shape, {{as well as}} in location of settlement. The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a result of a shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine. Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings.|$|E

5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, {{swallowed}} head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after food has been swallowed, the Gila monster immediately resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E
5|$|The cannon {{appeared}} in 12th century China, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a parallel development or {{evolution of the}} fire-lance, a short ranged anti-personnel weapon combining a gunpowder-filled tube and a polearm of some kind. Co-viative projectiles such as iron scraps or porcelain shards were placed in fire lance barrels at some point, and eventually, the paper and bamboo materials of fire lance barrels were replaced replaced by metal.|$|E
5|$|The moors {{had been}} used as a source for {{domestic}} fuel, in the form of peat, since at least the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> early as the Roman or pre-Roman periods. In the early 1800s, peat was still being formed: William Harrison reported that a short time after moving to Thorne, a rise in the surface of the moors has obscured Crowle Church, previously visible from his home.|$|E

5|$|The third Persian army, {{under the}} command of Otanes and Artaphernes, {{attacked}} Ionia and Aeolia. They re-took Clazomenae and Cyme, probably in 497 BC, but then seem to have been less active in 496 BC and 495 BC, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a result of the calamity in Caria.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran {{east to the}} Euphrates where it {{connected}} at the city of Hīt. The route then ran south along the river toward the port of Charax Spasinu on the Persian Gulf, where Palmyrene ships traveled {{back and forth to}} India. Goods were imported from India, China and Transoxiana, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a result of the Roman–Parthian Wars. Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian troops {{suffered}} 126 {{dead and}} 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting, and killed between 1,122 and 3,500 civilians, including some Volksdeutsche. Many civilians {{were arrested and}} tortured. On 14 April 1941, around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a warning to others not to resist. During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted {{that he had not}} wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka, but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E

5|$|In 1989 {{a project}} {{commenced}} to re-introduce the country's rarest amphibian, the natterjack toad, to Hengistbury Head. The natterjack was last recorded on the headland in the 1950s before its extinction, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> {{the result of}} a lack of suitable ponds. The project has been a great success, and today there are thriving populations at various locations. The ideal time to witness their mating rituals is in May as dusk approaches, when the distinctive call of the natterjack can be heard for miles around.|$|E
5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during the Wars of the Roses. The Clifford family {{was one of}} the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E
5|$|Red deer have a stronghold on the moor {{and can be}} seen on quiet hillsides {{in remote}} areas, {{particularly}} in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler and ring ouzel. Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a result of a reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E

5|$|The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, {{compiled}} in the 9th century, mentions cubeb as {{a remedy}} for infertility, showing it was already used by Arabs for medicinal purposes. Cubeb was introduced to Arabic cuisine around the 10th century. The Travels of Marco Polo, written in late 13th century, describes Java as a producer of cubeb, along with other valuable spices. In the 14th century, cubeb was imported into Europe from the Grain Coast, {{under the name of}} pepper, by merchants of Rouen and Lippe. A 14th-century morality tale exemplifying gluttony by the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis describes the eating habits of a worldly cleric who consumes a bizarre concoction of egg yolks with cinnamon and cubeb after his baths, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> an aphrodisiac.|$|E
5|$|The Prince Consort's and Queen Victoria's {{rooms in}} the keep are named after their use during the royal visit of 1842, {{although}} their decoration today dates from the interwar period. The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. These rooms feature a range of pink and purple window glass, which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep was located in an avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates leading from the outer courtyard to the inner rooms of the keep. The keep itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is almost totally ruined, <b>probably</b> <b>as</b> a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, this is perhaps because they were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E
