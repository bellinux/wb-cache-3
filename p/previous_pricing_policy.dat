40|$|Most {{studies that}} compare price and {{quantity}} controls for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} under uncertainty find that price mechanisms perform substantially better. In these studies, the benefits from reducing emissions are proportional {{to the level of}} reductions, and such linear benefits strongly favor <b>price</b> <b>policies</b> (Weitzman 1974). Catastrophic damages, however, challenge that intuition as consequences become highly nonlinear. Catastrophe avoidance offers huge benefits, and incremental adjustments {{on either side of the}} associated threshold are relatively unimportant, suggesting a strong preference for quantity controls. This paper shows that with catastrophic damages, both price and quantity mechanisms offer large gains over the business-as-usual alternative, and the difference between policies is never more than 10 %. Catastrophe avoidance is much more important than efficient catastrophe avoidance. Although <b>previous</b> studies favoring <b>price</b> <b>policies</b> in the presence of uncertainty have worried that catastrophes would reverse their results, this analysis indicates that such concerns are not borne out. climate change, global warming, prices versus quantities, stock externalities, integrated assessment, uncertainty...|$|R
30|$|This section {{describes}} {{the basis of}} our model simulations to examine the impact of different BAMs. The Australian government’s <b>previous</b> carbon <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> used the carbon tax at the rate of A$ 23 per tonne of CO 2 equivalent with the exemption of agriculture, road transport and household sectors. In our experiments, we have used this carbon tax rate in each simulation scenarios. The government proposed a number of compensation plans outlining the ways the revenue collected through the tax will be used. They included compensation to selected manufacturers and exporters, reform of income tax thresholds and family tax benefits such as a clean energy advance, clean energy supplement and single income family supplement. These measures were quite complex, and it is hard to capture them all in a single model. In the model simulations, we adopt a modest and simplified compensation plan. We use in each scenario a revenue-neutral straightforward household compensation plan; that is, we transfer all of the carbon tax revenue in equal lump sums to households of the poorest six income deciles of the Australian economy.|$|R

We analyse this problem by considering continuous privately known trader types. Furthermore, we consider two typical pricing policies: equilibrium k <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> and discriminatory k <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> We firstly investigate how to determine the transaction prices to reach the maximal allocative efficiency in an isolated marketplace when the traders adopt Bayes-Nash equilibrium bidding strategies. We find that when the marketplace adopts discriminatory k <b>pricing</b> <b>policy,</b> the maximal allocative efficiency is reached by setting k = 0. 41 or 0. 59. We find that equilibrium k <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> provides higher allocative efficiency than discriminatory k <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> We further discuss how different <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> can affect traders' Bayes-Nash equilibrium bidding strategies. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the setting with two marketplaces competing against each other to attract traders.

40|$|Transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} {{effective}} strategies to affect people’s car use, but, {{due to a lack}} of public support, these policies are often not implemented. Therefore, we examined which factors influence the acceptability of these <b>pricing</b> <b>policies.</b> First, the acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> was shown to be strongly related to the revenue allocation: acceptability increased when revenues were allocated to car users. Second, the acceptability was also shown to increase when people expected car-related problems, such as congestion, pollution and parking problems, to reduce. Reductions in car-related problems will benefit society as a whole, but also individual car users, for example when their travel times decrease or local air quality improves. The acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> increased particularly when people actually experience that car-related problems were solved or decreased. Third, acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> was shown to be strongly related to the extent to which people consider the costs and benefits of these policies to be fairly distributed. We found that transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> were particularly perceived to be fair and acceptable when the distribution of costs and benefits would benefit nature, the environment and future generations and when everybody would be equally affected. This study has important practical implications: the acceptability of transport <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> can be enhanced when it is clearly communicated that <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> will result in a reduction of car-related problems. In addition, the acceptability is also likely to increase when people experience the positive effects of policies, for example via trials. ...|$|R

Thisse and Vives (1988) show that spatial price discrimination is a dominant strategy when the mill pricing firm is the leader and the discriminatory firm is the follower. When the leader-follower roles are reversed we find that equilibrium <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> depend on the consumer's reservation value. The <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> game has two equilibria in pure strategies, either both firms price uniformly (f. o. b.) or both firms price discriminate, when the reservation value is low.

40|$|Road <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> {{have been}} a subject of {{research}} for many decades. Even though until now examples of actual implication {{in the real world}} are limited, many different road-pricing measures have been considered, both in literature {{as well as in the}} political debate in several countries. However, most literature focuses on economic aspects, more or less ignoring spatial consequences. In this paper we will concentrate on the spatial effects of <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> and introduce the typical geographic concept of accessibility into the discussion about <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> The paper firstly gives some backgrounds of <b>pricing</b> <b>policies.</b> Some objectives of road pricing in general are given. Furthermore some examples of already implemented pricing measures in countries all over the world are mentioned. General literature concerning <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> aims specifically on economic effects. This is mainly because of the typical economic aspects, which can be found in the theory of <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> such as the pricing of a scarce good as infrastructure capacity, related to time aspects. Also studies concerning acceptability of road <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> are discussed, because acceptance plays an important role in the implementation of <b>pricing</b> <b>policies.</b> The paper shortly addresses some of the economic and acceptability related literature. But the literature review of the paper focuses specifically on the geographical aspects of <b>pricing</b> <b>policies.</b> These geographical aspects have received much less attention so far although road-pricing measures may cause important spatial effects. Therefore the second part of the paper focuses on these geographical aspects. A specific research field in geography is accessibility. Accessibility is a concept that connects infrastructure and land-use. The research fields of accessibility and <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> in isolation are well elaborated. However, the link between road <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> and accessibility (measures) forms a new research field. The paper explains the importance of the concept of accessibility. In practice accessibility can be computed with accessibility measures. These measures form quantifications of accessibility. Different types of accessibility measures exist differing in concept as well as complexity. All these measures have in common that transport costs are not included at all or at least not in a realistic way. After explaining the concept of accessibility different categories of accessibility measures are explained and their general advantages and disadvantages are given. Furthermore possibilities to adapt or improve accessibility measures are discussed. After this discussion the actual link between road <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> and accessibility measures is explained. The discussion begins with the presentation of a conceptual model of the accessibility (and spatial) effects of road pricing. Subsequently an observation is made where current measures fall short to include <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> costs in a realistic way. This observation will lead to the determination of directions for improvement. Besides the general possibilities to adjust different accessibility measures, each measure is specifically evaluated on the ability to improve the way of describing accessibility effects of road pricing. ...|$|R

The customer arrival process is assumed to be piecewise deterministic and Markovian with an unknown parameter. Homogeneous customers have an iso-elastic demand function and do not behave strategically. We study full information, non-learning, passive learning and active learning <b>pricing</b> <b>policies,</b> all of which take the form of a product of a series of indices and a power function of on-hand inventory. We find that prices generated by different <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> can follow a super/sub/martingale, depending on an observer’s information structure. We find that without learning the optimal inventory path is deterministic, but it becomes stochastic when learning is considered. Through computational experiments, we find that passive learning <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> can approximate the optimal active learning <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> well, but that non-learning <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> often perform very poorly. Finally, we observe that the values of information and learning are magnified by coordination of pricing with the inventory decision. 1...|$|R
40|$|Geographic price {{discrimination}} {{is generally considered}} beneficial to firm profitability. Firms can extract higher rents by varying prices across markets to match consumers' preferences. This paper empirically demonstrates, however, that a firm may instead prefer a national <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> that fixes <b>prices</b> across geographic markets, foregoing the opportunity to customize prices. Under appropriate conditions, a national <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> helps avoid intense local competition due to targeted prices. I examine the choice of national versus local pricing under multimarket retail chain competition using extensive data from the digital camera market. I estimate a highly flexible model of aggregate demand that incorporates additional micro purchase moments and semi-parametric heterogeneity. Counterfactual analyses show the major retail firms should employ a national <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> to maximize profits, rather than target prices in each local market. Fixing prices across markets allows the retailers to soften otherwise intense local competition by subsidizing competitive markets with profits from less competitive markets.
