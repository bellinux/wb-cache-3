25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> of the skin.|$|E

These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> of the skin.Although darkly pigmented skin absorbs about 30 to 40% more sunlight than lightly pigmented skin, dark skin does not increase the body's internal heat intake in conditions of intense solar radiation. Solar radiation heats up rather the body's surface and not the interior. Furthermore, this amount of heat is negligible compared the heat produced when muscles are actively used during exercise. Regardless of skin colour, humans have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat through sweating. Half of the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is in the form of infrared light and is absorbed similarly regardless of skin coloration.|$|E
40|$|PhD (Electrical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 The {{rotor shaft}} of a {{synchronous}} machine can experience severe mechanical stress due to torque pulsations during a pole-slip condition. All pole-slip protection relays {{currently on the}} market use the impedance pole-slip protection method to detect a pole-slip. No commercial relay currently available can predict accurately when a generator is about to experience a damaging pole-slip. All the relays will only trip a generator after it has pole-slipped one or more times. Severe mechanical damage could be caused to a machine after only one pole-slip. It is therefore essential to enhance pole-slip protection relays {{to such an extent}} that it can trip a generator before it pole slips. The proposed pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> must predict when a generator will become unstable during a network fault. As soon as instability is predicted, the generator must be tripped before the fault is cleared to avoid damaging post-fault torque effects. Conventional impedance pole-slip protection methods are are also discussed and the shortcomings of impedance pole-slip protection are investigated. The new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> was designed by using PSCAD. Detailed PSCAD simulations on different network configurations proved that the new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> will trip a generator before a damaging pole-slip occurs. The new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> was also implemented on an ABB REM 543 multifunctional protection relay and tested on a RTDS. The concept of the new pole-slip function was successfully demonstrated on the protection relay. The operation of conventional impedance scheme relays was compared with the proposed pole-slip function for different fault conditions. Although the new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> is more complex than the existing impedance functions, it was concluded that similar skills are required to test and commission the new <b>protection</b> <b>function.</b> The new pole-slip function outperforms the impedance protection methods, since the new <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> can trip the generator before it pole-slips.
