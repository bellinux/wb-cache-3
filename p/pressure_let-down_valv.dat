5000|$|ITM Power has {{supplied}} its HGas electrolyser {{units in}} several power-to gas projects. The first plant to inject electrolytic generated hydrogen into the gas distribution network in Germany was with Thüga. This operates at an overall efficiency of over 70% and {{participates in the}} market for secondary control ("grid balancing"). It makes a contribution to maintaining grid stability while outputting [...] "hydrogen" [...] to the [...] "gas grid". The second plant was deployed by RWE in Germany at a <b>pressure</b> <b>let-down</b> station in the gas grid. By implementing a heat recovery system an overall efficiency of 86% was achieved.|$|R
40|$|The Rapid Thermal Decomposition of {{precursors}} in Solution (RTDS) Process is a flow-through hydrothermal powder synthesis method {{capable of}} producing nanophase oxide and oxyhydroxide catalysts and catalyst precursors. The RTDS technique utilizes a brief exposure of dissolved precursors to high pressure/high temperature aqueous conditions to initiate crystallite nucleation. The resulting nanocrystalline suspension {{is removed from the}} hydrothermal environment through a <b>pressure</b> <b>let-down</b> device before significant crystallite growth can occur. The RTDS process is discussed as a method to produce nanocrystalline iron oxide and oxyhydroxide powders that exhibit high activity as carbon-carbon bond cleavage catalyst precursors. Nanocrystalline TiO{sub 2 } and ZrO{sub 2 } powders having prospective catalytic applications are also produced by the RTDS process...|$|R
5|$|During {{periods of}} low demand gas {{is taken from}} the National Transmission System (NTS) at Beltoft, North Lincolnshire and {{transferred}} via a 12-inch diameter 15km pipeline to the Lindholme Compression Site. Here gas is heated in a water bath heater then through a <b>pressure</b> <b>let-down</b> skid and via a 16-inch 1.5km pipeline to the Hatfield Moor well site for injection into the reservoir for storage. The sandstone reservoir has a capacity of about 4.1 billion cubic feet (116 million cubic metres). During periods of high demand gas is withdrawn from the reservoir and through the 16-inch pipeline to the Lindholme site. Here the gas is dehydrated with glycol and compressed using a gas-turbine driven compressor to a pressure suitable for export to Beltoft and into the NTS.|$|R
500|$|The column can be fed in {{different}} ways. [...] If the feed {{is from a}} source at a pressure higher than the distillation column pressure, it is simply piped into the column. Otherwise, the feed is pumped or compressed into the column. The feed may be a superheated vapor, a saturated vapor, a partially vaporized liquid-vapor mixture, a saturated liquid (i.e., liquid at its boiling point at the column's pressure), or a sub-cooled liquid. If the feed is a liquid {{at a much higher}} pressure than the column pressure and flows through a <b>pressure</b> <b>let-down</b> valve just ahead of the column, it will immediately expand and undergo a partial flash vaporization resulting in a liquid-vapor mixture as it enters the distillation column.|$|R

5000|$|At Brent A, the {{pipeline}} {{is connected with}} the Northern Leg and Western Leg transmission systems, carrying gas {{from a number of}} nearby fields. [...] The 20-inch Northern Leg Gas Pipeline (NLGP) runs for 80 km from Magnus to Brent A with spurs to Thistle A, Murchison and Statfjord B. It originally served as the gas export route for these installations and delivered gas to Brent A for onward transmission to St Fergus via FLAGS. As some of these installation have become gas deficient it has served as their gas supply route. The pipeline has depressurisation facilities at Magnus. Gas from the NLGP is heated before flowing via manual <b>pressure</b> <b>let-down</b> valves to the HP and LP flare systems. Pre-heating the gas ensures that it remains within the temperature limits of the flare pipework after Joule-Thomson cooling across the let-down valves.|$|R
40|$|The Biphase turbine is {{a device}} for {{effectively}} producing shaft power from two-phase (liquid and gas) <b>pressure</b> <b>let-downs</b> and for separating the resulting phases. No other device is currently available for simultaneously performing these tasks. The {{performance of the}} Biphase turbine and its advantages over single-phase, energy-conversion devices has been demonstrated with subscale and commercial scale steam/water (geothermal wellhead) operations. Its development and application to two-phase process streams is now being pursued and {{is the subject of}} this paper. The two-phase working fluid may be a single component, two-phase stream, as in a steam/ water combination, or it may be a multicomponent, two-phase process stream which may also include foam and/or entrained solids. Performance data from initial tests using a subscale Biphase turbine on a two-phase, expanding, gas-cleaning application (Selexol/C 02 mixture) are presented. Turbine designs for tests scheduled for gas/oil wellhead applications are described...|$|R
40|$|On-line {{systems for}} {{monitoring}} mercury in liquid and gaseous production and waste streams have been developed, utilising atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) {{as the basis}} for detection. Instrumentation has been designed for unattended continuous operation. Laboratory chemistries for the vapour generation of mercury, normally performed off-line in batch mode, have been adapted and optimised for continuous, flow-injection analysis for varying sample types and chemical forms of mercury. The system has typical analysis cycle of 7 minutes, a limit of detection of 10 pg ml ˉ¹ a linear range up to 100 µg ml ˉ¹ and has been applied in industrial environments for the continuous monitoring of mercury in incineration wastewater and sulphuric acid. The system was validated by on-site trials for periods of one week, during which time comparative off-line laboratory measurements showed good agreement. An automated system for monitoring mercury in natural gas streams has also been developed and validated by laboratory and on-site industrial trials. A heated <b>pressure</b> <b>let-down</b> system was designed in order to facilitate sampling of high-pressure gas streams without condensation of heavier fractions. The heated sampling line was interfaced with an automated system for trapping mercury, from variable volumes of gas, onto gold amalgamation traps, with subsequent desorbtion and analysis by AFS. The method detection limit for a 58 litre sample of natural gas was 30 pg m ˉ³ which was sufficient to determine residual mercury in natural gas streams even after mercury scrubbing had been performed. The system was validated by laboratory trials and spiking experiments during on-site trials at a gas processing facility, which resulted in complete installation and commissioning. P. S.

40|$|Control valves {{are used}} under severe service {{conditions}} {{for a wide range}} of applications. These valves are installed with X-Stream cage trims in order to control the flow rate and the pressure drop within the valve. The X-Stream cage trims have a specific capacity rating, commonly known as Flow Coefficient (or Cv). These values of the X-Stream are important as far as customer’s requirements are concerned as are other features of the trim like reduction in erosion via velocity control and the prevention of cavitation via controlled <b>pressure</b> <b>let-down.</b> The X-Stream is a complex geometry part and is traditionally manufactured using a process called electric discharge machining. This is considered a relatively expensive and time consuming process and as a result control valves industry has been extensively reviewing other methods of manufacture. A process known as selective laser melting has been identified as a high potential for cost reduction and competiveness for the business, however early tests have seen issues during the manufacturing process and significant reductions in the Cv of the X-Stream. This study reviews the SLM method of manufacture and evaluates improvements in performance of the X-Stream when reviewing the process of manufacture and the design of the X-Stream component. Extensive flow loop testing of X-Streams have been carried out to calculate Cv of the trims. Then, Computational Fluid Dynamics based techniques have been incorporated to find out the same. The results have been compared and validated. Further tests at higher pressures of water have been conducted to evaluate Cv at severe service conditions This report includes details of the test procedures, CFD modelling and full set of results for each flow condition and the effect of manufacturing constraints like surface roughness on the final Flow Coefficient (Cv) and other performance characteristics to improve the potential for SLM specifically for application with X-Stream...|$|R
