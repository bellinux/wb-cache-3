The thesis could be used as supporting document for business decisions made by management of company and {{could be used as a}} value determination for not predetermined buyer. The value of the company is calculated on 1. 1. 2015 by application of income methods. Specifically, the valuation is processed by method of discounted cash flow method DCF entities and the economic value added method EVA. The starting <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> is the strategic analysis, financial analysis and the analysis of value drivers.

40|$|Voltage {{unbalance}} (VU) {{management of}} power systems requires {{the development of}} well researched engineering practices to maintain acceptable VU levels while utilising the total VU absorption capacity of the power system. In this regard, IEC/TR 61000 - 3 - 13 : 2008 prescribes a VU emission allocation methodology based on a stochastic approach which uses a general summation law in order to aggregate numerous sources of unbalance {{to take into account}} their random variations. On the other hand, recent deterministic studies on VU emission assessment at the post-connection stage of unbalanced installations present a complex VU factor based approach to determine constituent components of the post-connection VU emission at a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation.</b> The primary objective of the work presented in this paper is to develop statistical approaches for compliance assessment using the outcomes of the deterministic methodologies on VU emission assessment, thus refining the existing general summation law. A revised general summation law is established, introducing weighting factors to evaluate the influences made by different sources of unbalance separately, in order to assess VU emission in radial networks...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the informational content of ex post and ex ante predictors of periods of excess stock (market) valuation. For {{a cross section}} comprising 10 OECD economies and a time span of at most 40 years alternative binary chronologies of price bubble periods are determined.

Overall, the degree of ex ante predictability is limited if an analyst targets the detection <b>of</b> particular turning <b>points</b> <b>of</b> market <b>valuation.</b> The set <b>of</b> 13 potential predictors is classified in measures of macroeconomic or monetary performance, stock market characteristics, and descriptors <b>of</b> capital <b>valuation.</b> The latter turn out to have strongest in-sample and out-of-sample explanatory content for the emergence of price bubbles.

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} The key {{objective}} is to study whether analysts partly anchor their recommendation revisions to the 52 -week high and low stock prices {{as well as to}} the median forward-looking consensus valuation multiples, particularly to the 2 -year high and low P/E ratios. The potential anchoring effects <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> multiples have previously been left without academic attention even though analysts often justify their recommendation revisions by stating P/E and PEG ratios, indicating that they may use these valuation multiples to reach their recommendation decisions. As recommendations are forward-looking predictions, uncertainty and intuition are involved making analysts prone to use simple heuristics not only to communicate with investors but also to revise their recommendations. Data and methodology My sample consists of 35, 270 analyst recommendation revisions from 5, 193 analysts for 1, 454 unique US stock-listed companies. The dataset covers time period from November 1993 to September 2015. Analyst stock recommendations and earnings estimates data were gathered from IBES database, stock exchange data from CRSP database, accounting data from Compustat database, institutional ownership of stocks from Thomson Reuters and idiosyncratic volatility from Kenneth R. French’s database. To study the effects <b>of</b> reference <b>points</b> on recommendation downgrades, I employ a series of conditional fixed effects logistic regression models by controlling price and earnings momentum effects, valuation, fundamental and growth indicators as well as company and analyst specific factors related to analyst stock recommendation decisions. Findings Partly consistent with prior literature, I find that analysts tend to downgrade recommendations near the 52 -week high and 52 -week low stock prices. Furthermore, from the most common relative valuation multiples used by analysts, only P/E ratio and PEG ratio show some statistically significant evidence <b>of</b> anchoring to <b>valuation</b> multiples. With all control variables included, the odds of being downgraded by analysts are over 40 % higher for companies approaching the 52 -week high or low than that for other companies. In the case of approaching the 2 -year high and 2 -year low P/E ratios, the odds of being downgraded by analysts are 15 % and 20 % higher, respectively, although the evidence on the statistical significance is mixed. Provided evidence suggests that the 52 -week high and low stock prices are more important reference points for analysts than high and low <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> multiples. Despite these anchors, my main results suggest that two other factors create by far the largest effects on revisions: price momentum in the recent weeks increases the odds and a high number of earnings forecast revisions decreases the odds of downgrading the most...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} discounted cash flow (DCF) in accountancy, and study the meaning of the DCF accounting as an accounting system. Although it has the advantage that DCF accounting to some extent enable investment decision-making and corporate valuation, it also has the problem simultaneously. The problems are that it does not have a realistic cost of capital in this accounting system, the performance evaluation function is lacking, and the valuation method is not flexible. A trend of DCF is not necessarily in agreement with a trend of corporate earnings, and DCF accounting cannot grasp a trend of corporate earnings. Furthermore, neither assets nor a project may be flexibly estimated by this accounting system, as a result it may be underestimated. APV (adjusted present value) accounting, CFROI (cash flow return on investment) accounting, EVA (economic value added) accounting and real option accounting are advocated as what conquers such a fault of DCF accounting and inherits an advantage. However, DCF accounting is the starting <b>points</b> <b>of</b> corporate <b>valuation</b> and current finance accounting, and is bearing a role of the foundation of the current accounting system...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} domain-theoretic {{framework}} for measure theory {{and integration of}} bounded real-valued functions with respect to bounded Borel measures on compact metric spaces.

We use this setting to define a new notion of integral of a bounded real-valued function {{with respect to a}} bounded Borel measure on a compact metric space.

40|$|One of {{the recent}} {{advances}} in property valuation is to view a property or the right to develop it as a call option. Shilling et al. (1985) {{were among the first}} to apply option pricing theory in this way. For real estate development, although not explicitly said so in his paper, Titman (1985) was the first to treat vacant lots of land as options to wait to develop. A frequently cited paper by Quigg (1993) presents the first empirical effort to support the real option pricing <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. The <b>valuation</b> framework <b>of</b> Quigg (1993) is in one sense a specialization and in another sense a generalization of the framework of Williams (1991). Unfortunately, the works of both Williams and Quigg are technically flawed, but surprisingly their errors have gone unnoticed for over 15 years and are still propagating in the literature (e. g. in Yamaguchi et al., 2000 and Patel and Paxson, 2001). In the following, we will first address the flaws of Quigg (1993). Then we will examine the problems in Williams' (1991) work.
