5|$|Lead metal resists sulfuric and {{phosphoric acid}} but not {{hydrochloric}} or nitric acid; the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation {{of the product}} salt.

5000|$|There {{are three}} oxides known: PbO, Pb3O4 (sometimes called [...] "minium"), and PbO2. The former has two allotropes: α-PbO and β-PbO, both with layer {{structure}} and tetracoordinated lead. The alpha allotrope is red-colored {{and has the}} Pb-O distance of 230 pm; the beta allotrope is yellow-colored and has the Pb-O distance of 221 and 249 pm (due to asymmetry). Thanks to the similarity, both allotropes can exist under standard conditions (beta with small (10−5 relative) impurities, such as Si, Ge, Mo, etc.). PbO reacts with acids to form salts, and with alkalies to give <b>plumbites,</b> Pb(OH)3− or Pb(OH)42−.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The paper {{presents}} {{results for}} the speciation analysis of lead in dusts derived from dedusting of technological gasses from metallurgical processes of non-ferrous metals with different elementary content, made in accordance with two equal sequential extractions. Analytical procedure A provided possibilities for determination of fraction of Pb 2 +, metallic lead and fraction containing mainly lead sulfides. The second procedure (procedure B) was sequential extraction in accordance with Tessier. The results obtained in accordance with procedure A indicate that, regardless of the dust origin, the dominant group of Pb compounds is composed of lead salts which are soluble under alkaline conditions or lead compounds that form <b>plumbites</b> in the reaction with NaOH...|$|R

5000|$|In chemistry, <b>plumbite</b> is the [...] oxyanion or {{hydrated}} forms, or any salt containing this anion. In these salts, lead {{is in the}} {{oxidation state}} +2. It is the traditional term for the IUPAC name plumbate(II).|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, a {{plumbate}} is a salt {{having one}} of the several lead-containing oxoanions. Although the term plumbate can refer either to plumbate(II) or plumbate(IV), it traditionally refers specifically to plumbate(IV), whereas plumbate(II) is referred to as <b>plumbite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{described}} {{chemistry is}} also {{the basis of the}} doctor test for the sweetness or sourness of gasoline (i.e., the extent of sulfur contamination). A gasoline is described as doctor sweet if, after shaking with sodium <b>plumbite</b> solutions, the addition of powdered sulfur fails to produce a dark precipitate of lead sulfide.|$|E

Lead sulfide is a semiconductor, a photoconductor, and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector. The other two chalcogenides, lead selenide and lead telluride, are likewise photoconducting. They are unusual in that their color becomes lighter going down the group.|$|E

40|$|A {{phase diagram}} of the Na 2 O-PbO-H 2 O system at 130 degrees C was studied using Schreinemakers's method, to provide {{fundamental}} data for producing PbO via hydrometallurgical process. In the phase diagram, saturated solubility of PbO has two maximum values vs the sodium hydroxide concentration in the solution. The equilibrium solid phases of lead oxide (PbO), sodium <b>plumbite</b> hydroxide (Na 2 O center dot PbO center dot H 2 O) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were identified in the different alkali concentration regions, which {{is different from that}} at low temperature presented in literature.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{reduction of}} cadmium ion on a mercury electrode part ly covered by n-butanol, thymol, and leucoriboflavin and of <b>plumbite</b> ion {{in the presence}} of n-butanol was examined by the method of faradaic impedance with polarographic generation of reactants. Exchange currents and rate con-stants were lower than expected {{on the basis of a}} l inear dependence on cov-erage. A small increase in the transfer coefficient for the reduction of cad-mium was observed with partial coverage by leucoriboflavin. Slopes of the im-pedance plots were independent of coverage. Changes in polarographic log plots and El~ 2 values with decreasing rate constant were in line with the ac-cepted criterion for polarographic reversibil ity. Several authors have examined the kinetics of elec-trode reactions on surfaces partly covered by ad-sorbed films of uncharged electroinactive species (1 - 5).

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the Raman spectra of {{metallic}} hydroxo complexes. However, it seems that there are no published data on the Raman spectra of the hydroxo complexes of tin (II) and lead (II) formed in very concentrated alkali solutions. Such ions (the so-called stannite and <b>plumbite</b> ions) were described formerly as [MO_ 2]^, and more recently as [M(OH) _ 4]^, but recent literature tends to formulate them as [HMO_ 2]^- or [M(OH) _ 3]^-. The last formulation seems to be the most reasonable, in view of a number of stability and solubility data. It is also in conformity with the structural expectation, that the inert electron pair (ns^ 2) of Sn^ or Pb^ will tend to occupy a coordination site and favor the formation of the pyramidal (i. e. NH_ 3 -like) [M(OH) _ 3]^- complex in strongly alkaline solutions. We have tried to observe the Raman spectra of such complexes, and, for the sake of comparison, also those of antimony (III) fluoride, which is isoelectronic with [Sn(OH) _ 3]^-, in aqueous and organic solutions...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time a {{detailed}} structural model has been determined which shows how the lone-pairs of electrons are arranged relative to each other in a glass network containing lone-pair cations. High energy X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns of a very high lead content silicate glass (80 PbO· 20 SiO 2) have been used to build three-dimensional models using empirical potential structure refinement. Coordination number and bond angle distributions reveal structural similarity to crystalline Pb 11 Si 3 O 17 and α- and β-PbO, and therefore strong evidence for a <b>plumbite</b> glass network built from pyramidal [PbOm] polyhedra (m [similar] 3 – 4), with stereochemically active lone-pairs, although with greater disorder in the first coordination shell of lead compared to the first coordination shell of silicon. The oxygen atoms are coordinated predominantly to four cations. Explicit introduction of lone-pair entities into some models leads to modification of the local Pb environment, whilst still allowing for reproduction of the measured diffraction patterns, thus demonstrating the non-uniqueness of the solutions. Nonetheless, the models share many features with crystalline Pb 11 Si 3 O 17, including the O–Pb–O bond angle distribution, which is more highly structured than reported for lower Pb content glasses using reverse Monte Carlo techniques. The lone-pair separation of 2. 85 Å in the model glasses compares favourably with that estimated in α-PbO as 2. 88 Å, and these lone-pairs organise to create voids in the glass, just as they create channels in Pb 11 Si 3 O 17 and interlayer spaces in the PbO polymorphs...|$|E
