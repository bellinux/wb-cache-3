5|$|The Romanians {{boarded the}} SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930; and the Belgians {{embarked}} at Barcelona. The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy {{and the three}} designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian {{who may have been}} English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July. Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the film were entirely low-budget. Nearly every effect in the film was done via things <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a make-up and Halloween store located close to where the film was shot. The effects in the film were notably more {{intricate}} than the simple ones featured in Raimi's prior projects, and contained mutilated bodies, stabbed body parts and demonic possession skin-attachments. Tom Sullivan {{was one of the}} primary make-up supervisors on set, and he found it difficult working presentable effects out of such low budgets. One notable example involved a chest stabbing rig that had to be attached to Spiegel's chest by straps and duct tape.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plutonium}} core, {{along with}} its polonium-beryllium urchin initiator, was transported {{in the custody of}} Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper. The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.|$|E

5|$|De Soto {{withdrew the}} next day as well, {{carrying}} the wounded British sailors to Jamaica before putting into Port-au-Prince, to debark the many foreign refugees <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Cape Haiten. After consultations with the American Consul, Capt. Walker took De Soto back to Cap-Haïtien on 7 November. There, he negotiated with a British squadron under Captain Macguire in HMS Galatea {{in the hopes of}} averting a retaliatory bombardment of the town, particularly as the Americans feared such an act would provoke widespread unrest and attacks on foreigners throughout Haiti. These talks failed and on 9 November, the British squadron bombarded the town in conjunction with an attack by President Geffrard's forces. With the defensive works destroyed and the town falling to government forces, the rebel leaders took refuge on De Soto. Capt. Walker then carried them to Monte Christo in the Dominican Republic. De Soto returned to Cape Haiten {{to keep an eye on}} events until 13 December when she sailed for home, arriving in Hampton Roads on 19 December.|$|E
5|$|Mac {{shows her}} work to Beaver, which {{involves}} his new business project. Veronica, under a disguise, meets with the prom baby's temporary foster mom. Veronica learns that the baby's foster mother committed suicide {{and her father}} was in jail, hinting that the baby is Trina Echolls. Veronica talks to Trina and tells her the news of her parentage. Trina actually wants her story {{to go to the}} tabloids. However, a deaf lunch lady storms in and says that she's actually Trina's mother. The lunch lady says that Lianne was a friend who covered up her pregnancy to protect her. Trina's father is Principal Moorehead, and Trina confronts him about leaving her at the prom in front of many faculty. Veronica finds the dead rat that Keith <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the bus. Veronica finds out that Principal Clemmons deliberately gave Veronica her detention task so that she would find her mother's permanent file and frame Principal Moorehead. Veronica picks up Abel Koontz's (Christian Clemenson) belongings and walks into Meg's (Alona Tal) room and discovers that Meg is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Passenger traffic {{started on}} 10 October 1825, after the {{required}} licence was purchased, using the Experiment coach hauled by a horse. The coach was initially timetabled {{to travel from}} Stockton to Darlington in two hours, with a fare of 1s, and made a return journey {{four days a week}} and a one-way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In April 1826 the operation of the coach was contracted for £200 a year; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to hours and passengers were allowed to travel on the outside for 9d. A more comfortable coach, Express, started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside. Innkeepers began running coaches, two to Shildon from July, and the Union, which served the Yarm branch from 16 October. There were no stations: in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing, whereas in Stockton they <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> different places on the quay. Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827.|$|E

5|$|The {{components}} for the bomb code-named the Fat Man arrived by air the same day. The bomb's plutonium core (encased in its insertion capsule) and the beryllium-polonium initiator were transported from Kirtland to Tinian by C-54 {{in the custody}} of Project Alberta couriers. Three Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies designated F31, F32, and F33 were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s, two from the 509th and one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving 2 August. The B-29s were Luke the Spook and Laggin' Dragon of the 509th, and 42-65386, a phase 3 Silverplate of the 216th AAF Base Unit. F33 was expended during the final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.|$|E

The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 26 July, and arrived at North Field on Tinian on 28 July. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s; two, Luke the Spook and Laggin' Dragon, from the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on 2 August. Upon arrival, F31 was partly disassembled in order to check all its components. F33 was expended near Tinian during a final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.|$|E
