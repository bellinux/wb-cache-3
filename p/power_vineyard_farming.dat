40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the levels of technical efficiency of a sample of wine producer farms, belonging to the Portuguese Alentejo region, and to relate these efficiency levels to some characteristics of the farms such as: physical and economic size, farmers’ age, land property, irrigation, labour use, and area and product specialization. The methodology chosen to measure the individual levels of efficiency was non-parametric due to the advantage of not defining a functional form for the production technology. The results show that for <b>vineyard</b> <b>farms</b> there is space for an increase of efficiency levels in input use. The scale and congestion inefficiencies are responsible for most of the observed technical inefficiency. It was verified an increase in technical efficiency when vineyard specialization occur...|$|R

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} {{decision}} to adopt organic farming practices. We use Duration Analysis (DA) to determine why farmers adopt organic farming practices and what influences the timing of adoption. We extend previous studies by including farmers' objectives, risk preferences, and agricultural policies as covariates in the DA model. The Analytical Hierarchy Process {{is used as a}} multicriteria decision-making methodology to measure farmers' objectives. The empirical analysis uses farm-level data from a sample of <b>vineyard</b> <b>farms</b> in the Spanish region of Catalonia. Farmers' objectives are found to influence the conversion decision. Moreover, farmers who are not risk averse are more likely to adopt organic farming. Results point to the policy changes that have been most relevant in motivating adoption of organic practices.

Representation of wineries in tourism industry is insufficiently developed and sporadic, with no clear strategy at a national and local level. Their involvement in development of tourism should be encouraged primarily through the development of wine routes. By improving hospitality facilities in wineries, all the preconditions would be met for the successful development, not only of wine industry, but also of agritourism since during their stay, tourists could try out and experience <b>vineyard</b> <b>farm</b> life at firsthand...|$|R
