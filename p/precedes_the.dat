5|$|A {{chelator}} for binding a radioisotope can be attached. Pendetide, {{a derivative}} of pentetic acid, {{is used for}} example in capromab pendetide to chelate indium-111. If the drug contains a radioisotope, {{the name of the}} isotope <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> name of the antibody. Consequently, indium (111In) capromab pendetide is the name for the above example including indium-111.|$|E
50|$|A {{noun phrase}} in Marquesan is any phrase {{beginning}} {{with either a}} case marker or a determiner.

40|$|The key pecks of four pigeons were {{reinforced}} on a variable-interval 5 -min schedule which {{operated in}} each of the four components of a multiple schedule, indicated by red, green, yellow, and blue stimuli and presented in such an order that the red stimulus always <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> yellow and the green stimulus always <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> blue. After establishing baseline rates, the reinforcement schedule associated with the blue and yellow components was altered so that one was now an extinction schedule and the other was a variable-interval 1 -min schedule. In a second experimental stage, the blue stimulus was interchanged with the yellow so that <b>the</b> red stimulus <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> blue and <b>the</b> green stimulus <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> yellow. In both experimental stages the response rate in the variable-interval 5 -min component that <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> extinction component was higher than the response rate in the variable-interval 5 -min component that <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> variable-interval 1 -min component. The results were discussed in relation to the importance of stimulus ordering in experiments concerned with investigating behavioral contrast...|$|R

The second device in the Bold series, it succeeds the model 9000 and <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> Bold 9650. The device, which runs on the BlackBerry OS, features several improvements over the 9000, including introduction of an optical trackpad, and a reduced size overall. Other visual changes were carried out in order to appeal both men and women.|$|E
5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was not {{interested}} in this setting, but has remained open to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment on the condition that she likes the story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E
5000|$|Negation is {{expressed}} by <b>the</b> particle ui, <b>preceding</b> <b>the</b> verb. A prohibitative particle, also <b>preceding</b> <b>the</b> verb, is mi. mi {{is also the}} conjunction [...] "but", whereas e'ə is [...] "and (also)", and unə is [...] "or".|$|R
50|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying so' must <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order}} to avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> predicate.|$|R
50|$|Khwe lacks a {{separate}} class of adjectives. Pronouns, nouns and verbs, especially state verbs, {{can be used}} attributively. Khwe has a modifier-head order, in which manner adverbs <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> verb, and adjectives and possessors attributes <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> noun.|$|R
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans {{exhibit a}} number of larval forms, of which the {{earliest}} and most characteristic is the nauplius. This has three pairs of appendages, all emerging from the young animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the zoea (pl. zoeæ or zoeas). This name was given to it when naturalists believed {{it to be a}} separate species. It follows the nauplius stage and <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> post-larva. Zoea larvae swim with their thoracic appendages, as opposed to nauplii, which use cephalic appendages, and megalopa, which use abdominal appendages for swimming. It often has spikes on its carapace, which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming. In many decapods, due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first larval stage. In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage, and in others, by the megalopa stage, depending on the crustacean group involved.|$|E
5|$|Still {{travelling}} {{alongside a}} power transmission corridor, Highway407 crosses a complex rail wye which {{provides access to}} the CN freight yards to the north. After interchanging with Keele Street (York Regional Road6), the route gently curves northward, passing under the CN Newmarket Subdivision, which carries the GO Transit Barrie Line and crossing the Don River. It curves back eastward as it interchanges with Dufferin Street (York Regional Road53), travelling adjacent and south of Highway7. After interchanges with Bathurst Street (York Regional Road38) and Yonge Street (York Regional Road1), the Vaughan–Markham boundary, Highway407 crosses the CN Bala Subdivision, which carries the GO Transit Richmond Hill Line. After an interchange with Bayview Avenue (York Regional Road34), the highway swerves south.

5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|The final {{project for}} his great patron Eusebi Güell was {{the church for}} the Colònia Güell, an {{industrial}} village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (1890–1918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What {{would have been the}} colony's church was designed by Gaudí in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the crypt (known today as Crypt of the Colònia Güell) was built, as Güell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaudí designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> crypt, the first time that Gaudí used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture. In the crypt the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
