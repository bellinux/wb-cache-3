Today, small wind turbine industries are extensively focusing on blade performance, reliability, materials and cost. The wind turbine blade designers are required to give emphasis on accurate analysis of flows around the blade and loads on wind turbine blades. Low Reynolds number airfoils suited for small wind turbine applications must be designed {{to have a high}} degree of tolerance in avoiding high leading suction peaks and high adverse pressure gradients that lead to flow separation. This paper presents a study to investigate the effect of leading edge radius and leading edge blending on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine airfoils. In the present work NACA 4412 airfoil is considered as base airfoils. In this work six modified airfoils having different new to the old ratio of leading edge radii are considered for performance analysis. The performance of these six profiles is compared with basic airfoil performance. In this paper, the effect of blending distance from leading edge of airfoil on aerodynamic performance is also determined.

40|$|The {{performance}} of small, H-Darrieus {{vertical axis wind turbine}}s {{has been investigated}} numerically and experimentally with particular attention paid to turbine performance at low tip speed ratios (low Reynolds number) and to turbine self-starting. Comprehensive wind tunnel measurements have been performed to provide accurate aerofoil data at low Reynolds numbers and high angles of attack; a unique requirement for vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) starting studies. Two-dimensional CFD models and blade element momentum (BEM) models were created and assessed to provide new insight into turbine performance for different wind conditions and into different turbine geometries in order to guide the design of the experimental investigation. The experimental and numerical studies have demonstrated that design parameters including turbine solidity, blade <b>profile,</b> <b>blade</b> pitch angle and blade surface roughness have strong influences on turbine performance and turbine self-starting capability. Although other authors have conducted numerical studies of the effect of these parameters, this work represents the first experimental validation for turbine performance at low tip speed ratios. In contrast to some previous studies it is shown that there is no advantage to be gained from the use of cambered blades and that symmetrical blades set at small negative incidence provide the best design solution. It is also shown that increasing the turbine’s solidity can significantly improve self-starting capability and that for a given solidity, increasing the rotor radius with a corresponding increase of blade chord improves performance further. However, these starting performance gains are achieved at the expense of a small loss of peak power output. In addition, bio-inspired blades with tubercle leading edges are demonstrated to be able to significantly improve the turbine self-starting capability by introducing a more gradual stall characteristic. These results are the only reported measurements of the effect of tubercle leading edges on vertical axis wind turbines. Finally, a novel, real-time on-board pressure measurement system was developed and employed to examine the instantaneous blade pressure distribution and its variation when the turbine is rotating. The complex flow physics including dynamic stall, laminar separation and flow curvature were successfully recorded and provide unique, unsteady data to increase our knowledge and understanding of the transient aerodynamics of the H-Darrieus wind turbine. The experimental results were also compared with the available CFD and BEM predictions. It is demonstrated that BEM based approaches are highly sensitive {{to the quality of the}} aerofoil data that is provided as input to the model. This thesis provides validation of previous work on the question of whether H-Darrieus wind turbines can start without external assistance and in the light of this research a set of revised design rules are proposed to achieve self-starting turbines. ...|$|E

The flightworthiness of the cyclorotor concept was also demonstrated through two cyclocopters capable of tethered hover.

Force measurements showed the presence of a significant sideward force on the cyclorotor (along with the vertical force), analogous to that found on a spinning circular cylinder. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements made {{in the wake of the}} cyclorotor provided evidence of a significant wake skewness, which was produced by the sideward force. PIV measurements also captured the blade tip vortices and a large region of rotational flow inside the rotor. The thrust produced by the cyclorotor was found to increase until a blade pitch amplitude of 45 was reached without showing any signs of blade stall. This behavior was also explained using the PIV measurements, which indicated evidence of a stall delay as well as possible increase in lift on the blades from the presence of a leading edge vortex. Higher blade pitch amplitudes also improved the power loading (thrust/power) of the cyclorotor. When compared to the flat-plate blades, the NACA 0010 blades produced the highest values of thrust at all blade pitching amplitudes. The NACA blades also produced higher power loading than the flat plate blades. However, the reverse NACA 0010 blades produced better power loadings at lower pitching amplitudes, even though at high pitch amplitudes, regular NACA blades performed better. Among the three NACA sections (NACA 0006, NACA 0010 and NACA 0015) tested on the cyclorotor, NACA 0015 had the highest power loading followed by NACA 0010 and then NACA 0006. The power loading also increased when using more blades with constant chord (increasing solidity); this observation was found over a wide range of blade pitching amplitudes. Asymmetric pitching with higher pitch angle at the top of the blade trajectory than at the bottom produced better power loading. The chordwise optimum pitching axis location was approximately 25 - 35 % of the blade chord. For a constant solidity, the rotor with fewer number of blades produced higher thrust and the 2 -bladed rotor had the best power loading. Any significant bending and torsional flexibility of the blades had a deleterious effect on performance. The optimized cyclorotor had slightly higher power loading when compared to a conventional micro-rotor when operated at the same disk loading. The optimum configuration based on all the tests was a 4 -bladed rotor using 1. 3 inch chord NACA 0015 blade section with an asymmetric pitching of 45 at top and 25 at bottom with the pitching axis at 25 % chord. The aeroelastic analysis was performed using two approaches, one using a second-order non-linear beam FEM analysis for moderately flexible blades and second using a multibody based large-deformation analysis (especially applicable for extremely flexible blades) incorporating a geometrically exact beam model. An unsteady aerodynamic model is included in the analysis with two different inflow models, single streamtube and a double-multiple streamtube inflow model. For the cycloidal rotors using moderately flexible blades, the aeroelastic analysis was able to predict the average thrust with sufficient accuracy over a wide range of rotational speeds, pitching amplitudes and number of blades. However, for the extremely flexible blades, the thrust was underpredicted at higher rotational speeds and this may be because of the overprediction of blade deformations. The inclusion of the actual blade pitch kinematics and unsteady aerodynamics was found crucial in the accurate sideward force prediction...|$|E

Rapid manufacturing technology was used to create complex impeller <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> for testing as part of a regenerative pump optimisation process. Regenerative pumps are the subject of increased interest in industry. Ten modified impeller <b>blade</b> <b>profiles,</b> from the standard radial configuration, were evaluated with the use of computational fluid dynamics and experimental testing.

The manufacture of the complex <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> using conventional milling techniques is a considerable challenge for skilled machinists. The complexity of the modified <b>blade</b> <b>profiles</b> would normally necessitate the use of expensive CNC machining with 5 axis capability.
