40|$|ABSTRACTExperimental ulcers {{were created}} in {{domestic}} pigs and treated with gold leaf and polyethylene occlusion while <b>plain</b> <b>gauze</b> dressings served as controls. Entire wounds were excised at 3, 6, 9, and 12 days and observed histologically. 1. The polyethylene treated wounds reepithelialized completely by 9 days. 2. Both the control and gold leaf treated wounds failed to heal completely at the twelfth day. 3. Gold leaf fragments were seen embedded within the ulcer cavity, within the granulation tissue at the ulcer base and within the migrating epidermis. These findings suggest that gold leaf provides a significant mechanical barrier to wound repair...|$|E

40|$|Uncontrolled {{bleeding}} from traumatic wounds {{is a major}} factor in deaths resulting from military conflict, accidents, disasters and crime. Self-assembling peptide nanofibers have shown superior hemostatic activity, and herein, we elucidate their mechanism by visualizing the formation of nanofiber-based clots that aggregate blood components with a similar morphology to fibrin-based clots. Furthermore, to enhance its direct application to a wound, we developed layer-by-layer assembled thin film coatings onto common materials used for wound dressings—gauze and gelatin sponges. We find these nanofibers elute upon hydration under physiological conditions and generate nanofiber-based clots with blood. After exposure to a range of harsh temperature conditions (− 80 to 60 °C) for a week and even 5 months at 60 °C, these hemostatic bandages remain capable of releasing active nanofibers. In addition, the application of these nanofiber-based films from gauze bandages was found to accelerate hemostasis in porcine skin wounds as compared to <b>plain</b> <b>gauze.</b> The thermal robustness, in combination with the self-assembling peptide’s potent hemostatic activity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cost of production, makes this a promising approach for a cheap yet effective hemostatic bandage.

40|$|Multidrug-resistant {{organisms are}} {{increasingly}} implicated in acute and chronic wound infections, thus compromising {{the chance of}} therapeutic options. The resistance to conventional antibiotics demonstrated by some bacterial strains has encouraged new approaches {{for the prevention of}} infections in wounds and burns, among them the use of silver compounds and nanocrystalline silver. Recently, silver wound dressings have become widely accepted in wound healing centers and are commercially available. In this work, novel antibacterial wound dressings have been developed through a silver deposition technology based on the photochemical synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The devices obtained are completely natural and the silver coatings are characterized by an excellent adhesion without the use of any binder. The silver-treated cotton gauzes were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to verify the distribution and the dimension of the silver particles on the cotton fibers. The effectiveness of the silver-treated gauzes in reducing the bacterial growth and biofilm proliferation has been demonstrated through agar diffusion tests, bacterial enumeration test, biofilm quantification tests, fluorescence and SEM microscopy. Moreover, potential cytotoxicity of the silver coating was evaluated through 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay (MTT) and the extract method on fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed {{in order to determine the}} silver release in different media and to relate the results to the biological characterization. All the results obtained were compared with <b>plain</b> <b>gauzes</b> as a negative control, as well as gauzes treated with a higher silver percentage as a positive control...|$|R
40|$|Lounge {{ensemble}} in pink silks. The pantsuit {{consists of}} a blouse and pants. The blouse is of pink silk, constructed as two layers. The inner lining layer is of <b>plain</b> pink <b>gauze.</b> The outer layer is of pink silk heavily decorated with patterns created by shibori technique dying. The blouse has long sleeves and a center-front zipper closure that runs almost {{the entire length of}} the garment and has a single hook-and-eye at throat. The collar, cuffs, hem, and flap over the zipper are a small ruffle of the same materials. The shibori patterns use green, yellow, blue, and the original white of the fabric to create bands of tiny "puckers", large circular forms, and abstract shapes. The pants are of pink silk taffeta, about ankle length, with elastic cuffs. Plain waistband, with zipper closure at center front and single hook-and-eye at waistband. Described in early records as harem pants, but lacking the fullness associated with that style. Both garments have the same series of labels.

40|$|Abstract Background Ankaferd Blood Stopper ® (ABS) is a folkloric {{medicinal}} plant extract {{used as a}} hemostatic agent in traditional Turkish medicine. This experimental study investigated the histopathological and immunohistochemical effects of ABS on vascular tissue in a rat model of aortic bleeding. Methods Four groups of 11 Wistar albino rats were used. The abdominal aortas of the rats were wounded; an ABS-soaked tampon was applied to rats in Groups 1 and 3, and a <b>plain</b> <b>gauze</b> tampon was applied to rats in Groups 2 and 4 until the bleeding stopped. The bleeding time was recorded. Immediately following sacrificing, the arteriotomy sites from Groups 1 and 2 were removed. The abdominal incisions in Groups 3 and 4 were closed following hemostasis. On Day 7 of the study, Group 3 and 4 rats were sacrificed and the abdominal aorta arteriotomy sites were removed for histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Results The mean bleeding time in 15 animals in Groups 2 and 4 was 4. 9 ± 0. 6 s, and in 22 animals in Groups 1 and 3 was 3. 1 ± 0. 6 s. Distal aortic occlusion was not observed on either Day 1 or 7 in any group. Significantly more widespread and dense endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) staining was observed in Group 1 animals than Group 2. On Days 1 and 7 after application of ABS, histopathological changes, consisting of necrosis, inflammation, and endothelial cell loss, in the rat abdominal aortas did not differ between Groups 1 and 2. The basophilic discoloration in the ABS group on the operation day {{was a result of}} a foreign body reaction and hemosiderin-loaded histiocyte accumulation, which occurred on Day 7. Conclusions In this study, hemostasis was successfully achieved with ABS in rat abdominal aortas. No histopathological change was found in the rat abdominal aortas between the ABS and control groups on Days 1 and 7. Further studies on the long-term effects of foreign body reactions and hemosiderin-loaded histiocyte accumulation are required. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{small but}} {{fascinating}} Chancay gauze fragment {{in the collection}} of the Michael C. Carlos Museum stands out as an exemplary object that embodies the symbolic associations and aesthetic principles of the Peruvian coastline during the Late Intermediate Period (Fig. 1). Its weave structure, production process, iconography, and polychromy unite in reinforcing the protective and regenerative purposes of the original headdress. Consisting of variably spun threads knotted together, its unique discontinuous warp relates to its function in funerary and ceremonial contexts. Significantly, its weaver pushed beyond technical limitations to bring together the laborious techniques of gauze weaving and discontinuous warping in a single textile. The result of this ingenious yet unpublished technical combination was a “jumping” serpentine figure on an indigo background. The allusion to serpent movement, enabled by the use of a discontinuous warp made whole through the tying of tiny knots, recalls both the corporeal process of the cloth’s creation as well as the physical exertion of snakes. Moreover, the cloth’s overall polychrome patterning evokes the vivid dorsal patterning of snakes that have just shed their skin and emerged headfirst into the environment as regenerated beings. Although no other published gauze headdresses have been recognized as having discontinuous warps, and very few are polychromatic, the Carlos Museum gauze nevertheless shares many features with other Chancay gauzes. Commonalities include the organic abstract patterning created by complex gauze weaves, serpentine iconography, elasticity due to slightly over-spun threads, and the wearing of gauzes on the head in transformative ritual contexts. Moreover, the forceful repetitive motions exerted by the weaver during production may also be considered as contributing to the reception of the textile, as process and product are interconnected in Andean worldview. These combined attributes support the interpretation that many other gauze headcloths were meant to evoke the powerful properties of serpents. Gauze weaving requires a special technique, in which the weaver forces some warp threads to cross over or under other warp threads. These gauze crosses are held in place by the insertion of weft threads. This method of warp-crossing, contrasts with standard back-strap weaving, where the warp threads do not interact with each other but remain in a fixed position. Different types of gauze weave are classified by the various interactions of the warp threads. The simplest structure is that of <b>plain</b> <b>gauze</b> weave, in which the same warp threads pass over or under each other. More complex gauze weaves are created when variation is introduced into the interworking of warps and interlacing of wefts. In Textiles of Ancient Peru and Their Techniques, Raoul d’Harcourt illustrates how several complex openwork gauzes may be created through the omission of the crossing of certain warp threads. These types of gauzes are effective in conveying a sense of movement through their undulating serpentine patterns. The organic shapes created in gauze openwork, often simply labeled “ovular” or “gourd-shaped,” appear to mimic the scale patterning on snakes, a subject to which I will later return...|$|E
