40|$|Presented at the DLF Forum on Monday, October 27, 2014 at 3 : 45 p. m. at the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center. Bassem Elsayed is the Oracle Applications Project Manager at Bibliotheca Alexandrina. Ahmed Samir is the Enterprise Applications and Integrated Solutions Department's Director at Bibliotheca Alexandrina. Managing the {{digitization}} {{of press}} material {{is quite a}} challenge; {{not only in terms}} of quantity, but also in terms of text and material quality, designing the workflow system which organizes the operations, and handling the metadata. This challenge has been the focus of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina’s digitization work during the past year in the course of its partnership with the Center for Economic, Judicial, and Social Study and Documentation (CEDEJ). Having more than 800, 000 pages of press articles to be digitally preserved and publicly accessed, triggered an inevitable need to design a workflow that can manage such a massive collection and handle its attributes proficiently. The deployment of this endeavor required simultaneous intervention of four main aspects; data analysis of the collection, developing a digitization workflow for the collection at hand, implementing and installing the necessary software tools for metadata entry, and finally, publishing the digital archive online for researchers and public access. The presentation will demonstrate the workflow system which is being implemented to manage this massive press collection, which has yielded to date more than 400, 000 pages. It will shed some light on the BA’s Digital Assets Factory (DAF), which is the nucleus upon which the digitization process of CEDEJ collection has been built. Additionally, the presentation will discuss the tools implemented for ingesting data into the digitization process starting form indexing until the creation of batches that are ingested into the system. The outflow will also be discussed in terms of organizing and grouping multipart <b>press</b> <b>clips,</b> in addition to the reviewing, validation and correction of the output. Light will also be shed on the challenges encountered to associate the accessible online archive with a powerful search engine supporting multidimensional search while maintaining a user-friendly navigation experience...|$|R

Panels with the density of 1. 200 kg/m³ were made, using cement CP V ARI as mineral bonding and wood particles without treatment and treated with immersion in cold water, hot water and sodium hydroxide. The panels were pressed at the pressure of 40 kgf/cm², room temperature and <b>press</b> / <b>clipping</b> time of 24 hours and maturation time of 28 days. The evaluation of the properties of water absorption, thickness swelling, internal bond, modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture, showed that Schizolobium amazonicum “Paricá” and Cecropia hololeuca “Embaúba” wood are technically feasible for wood-cement board manufacture. It was {{also found that the}} panels of embaúba exhibit some properties superior to those of the paricá, and the particles do not necessarily need treatment...|$|R
