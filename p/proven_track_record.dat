The band eventually quit the sessions early amidst creative acrimony, although the personal relationships had actually been good.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1935, rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} that Carl Laemmle, {{the president of}} Universal, was considering offers {{for the sale of}} the studio. Apparently, these were nothing new. [...] However, by the end of February, the rumors were still persisting, despite vehement denials by Laemmle; Warner Bros. also issued a denial that they were interested in buying the studio. Just two weeks later it was being reported that a sale of the studio had been consummated, however, once again Laemmle issued strident denials. By June it was confirmed that there had been several offers made, but they were declined due to Laemmle's insistence that key personnel at the studio be guaranteed to remain in their positions. In July 1935 it was reported that Rogers was acting as an intermediary on Warner Bros.' behalf in an attempt to purchase Universal. Although Laemmle acknowledged the offer, the latest of five such, Rogers denied that he was in any way involved, although it was reported that Rogers was promised a major position at the acquired studio if the negotiations were successful. On November 2 it was reported that Rogers, in conjunction with Standard Capital, had reached an agreement with Laemmle to provide financing for the studio, which included a three-month option to purchase Universal. [...] As part of the deal, Laemmle received assurances that key personnel would be kept, as long as they had a <b>proven</b> <b>track</b> <b>record.</b> Rogers would be head of the new studio, but he could not assume that mantle immediately, since his commitment to Paramount still had two more films remaining on it.
