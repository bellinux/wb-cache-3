40|$|The {{behavior}} of the <b>plain</b> <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> of Epoxy Resin under the tension load are studied qualitatively by photoelastic showing the fringe order, the isochromatic lines and the isoclinics. As the results, the distribution curves of the fringe order are greatly influenced by the length, the width and {{the shapes of the}} gauge arm. Some singular points are observed in an U notch type, and double notch type has one more singular point compare with a single notch type. The expanse of several types in practical materials under the tension load are measured by strain meter and micro meter. As the results the authors find that U notch type has minimum value in testing pieces. ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>gauges</b> {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part. A correctly machined part will pass {{the first set of}} jaws and stop at the second [...] - [...] end of test. In this manner, a part may be checked in one action, unlike the plug gauge that needs to be used twice and flipped to access the second gauge. The first go/no-go snap gage for checking thread rolls was invented in 1943 to speed production of parts during WWII.|$|R
5000|$|Limit mics {{have two}} anvils and two spindles, {{and are used}} like a <b>snap</b> <b>gauge.</b> The part being checked must pass through the first gap and must stop at the second gap {{in order to be}} within specification. The two gaps {{accurately}} reflect {{the top and bottom of}} the tolerance range.|$|R

50|$|Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT):It {{is normal}} {{for a man}} to have five to six erections during sleep, {{especially}} during rapid eye movement (REM). Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> and strain gauge. A significant proportion of men who have no sexual dysfunction nonetheless do not have regular nocturnal erections.|$|R

Snaps on 613 are <b>plain.</b> <b>Snaps</b> for fur collar back on 618/118. Style 118 is updated to a fuller fit, 613/618 retain {{original}} slim fit. Schott NYC chrome main zipper, IDEAL sleeve zippers and bigger square belt buckle (by Century Canada) are introduced. Side pockets {{are at an}} approx. 60° angle and breast pocket at a 45° angle.|$|R

Genuine Horsehide Front Quarter - Style Quality printed in gold letters. TALON main and cuff zippers and 'Miter' belt buckle (rectangular with mitered corners). Side pockets are at an approx. 60° angle and breast pocket at a 50° angle, zippers close up.

Stitching on collar is placed further in than it is on lapels. Lining is black with grid stitching. Straight lower back panel and underside of sleeves are one piece.

40|$|When a shaft is {{measured}} with a <b>plain</b> <b>snap</b> guage, the diameter of guage is usually expanded by a wedge action due to measuring pressure. The authors made single purpose snap guages of several shapes as testing pieces and compared and examined respective allowable expanse with one another. They obtained the following results. 1) The nearer the guage diameter the position to be measured is, the larger is the allowable expanse with increasing measurement errors. 2) The length of a guage arm should be kept within the necessary minimum limit. 3) The expanse results in appearance of fillet of the guage arm and in relief of the guage surface. The expanse is greatly influenced by the shape and size of undercut. 4) As the coefficient of friction varies with different materials and conditions of pieces to be measured, the expanse varies too and the accuracy of measurement becomes changeable. Accordingly {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of measurement, it is essential further to know the relation of the working tolerance with the abrasion allowance and the optimum application scope of snap guages in practical use. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{surfaces}} which {{define the}} edges of the aperture are the anvils, which may be made of separate pieces of hard material such as tungsten carbide for wear resistance. Two apertures are frequently used to provide Go/No-Go testing and are often arranged such that a part being measured can pass through the two apertures in sequence; a part that is within tolerance will pass through the first maximum size limit aperture but {{will not be able to}} pass through the minimum size limit aperture. A <b>snap</b> <b>gauge</b> usually has a [...] "C" [...] shaped frame with the aperture(s) at the opening of the [...] "C". Snap gages may be machined and ground out of a single block of metal or adjustable snap gages, which have movable anvils that may be adjusted over a limited range of sizes, may be used. They may also be of built up construction in which one or more gage blocks or feeler gauges are sandwiched between two anvils. Adjustable snap gages may be reset to compensate for wear or re-tasked for measuring a different dimension and can be purchased off the shelf and set rather than needing to be fabricated from scratch when a new gage is needed. Gauge blocks would typically be used to initially set the width of the measuring aperture(s).|$|R
40|$|We {{probe the}} {{buckling}} of elastic metabeams {{by means of}} experiments and simulations. We show that sufficiently wide elastic <b>plain</b> beams exhibit <b>snap</b> through buckling, an unstable form of buckling where the stiffness is negative. We demonstrate that wider beams experience stronger nonlinear deformations and geometric stiffening. Therefore, the distribution of stresses across the beam is distorted and the postbuckling behavior altered. In a second part, we tailor a strain-softening nonlinearity in the material by designing an ordered microstructure close to a pattern transformation, {{in such a way}} that we can rationally design the postbuckling behavior of arbitrarily thin beams...|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} the Valmet M62/76 series rifles is the flash suppressor. It resembles an {{enlarged}} version of the suppressor on the original M16. Directly under the flash suppressor is a bayonet lug to accommodate the knife-style bayonet manufactured by Fiskars and Hackman. The flash suppressor has some sharp edges along its longitudinal cuts for wire cutting. A soldier slides the barbed wire into the flash suppressor and simply rotates his rifle around until it <b>snaps</b> the small <b>gauge</b> wire. For thicker wire, the soldier inserts the wire, gives a half turn and fires the rifle, which will snap the wire. On the M16 the prong type flash suppressor was abandoned for the bird cage type because the prongs tended to snag on vegetation in the field. While {{this is still a}} problem with the M62/76, the sharper edges help to cut through some of the vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{distribution}} and {{natural history of}} amphibians and reptiles have been little studied in the northern states of the great plains. Relative to other vertebrate groups, the herpetofauna of grasslands is depauperate particularly at higher latitudes where temperature becomes a limiting factor to poikilotherms. Nevertheless, certain species of amphibians and reptiles are common in specific habitats and thus form a conspicuous component of the prairie fauna. The purposes {{of the present study}} were to document the distributions of herpetiles in a specified region of western Nebraska and to describe general aspects of their natural history. We hope such information will stimulate additiona work as well as provide a baseline reference for future studies on the herpetofauna of the northern great plains. Previous work on herpetiles in western Nebraska are either in need of updating (e. g. Hudson, 1942) or are anecdotal or not comprehensive (Heyl and Smith, 1957; Gehlbach and Collette, 1959; Iverson, 1975; Lynch, 1978). Summary: The herpetofauna of the seven county study area in western Nebraska may be characterized in general by a preponderance of organisms exhibiting both wide geographical and wide ecological distributions and tolerances. Species exhibiting little microhabitat specificity and which are found widely throughout the region include the tiger salamander, spadefoot toad, rocky mountain toad, striped chorus frog, lesser earless lizard, fence lizard, racerunner, common racer, bullsnake, red-sided garter snake, <b>plains</b> garter snake, <b>snapping</b> turtle and painted turtle. Those ecologically restricted species that enter the area include the plains leopard frog, common water snake, black-headed snake, yellow mud turtle, Blanding 2 ̆ 7 s turtle, and spiny soft-shelled turtle...|$|R
