50|$|A. alnifolia is {{susceptible}} to cedar-apple rust, entomosporium leaf spot, fireblight, brown rot, cytospora canker, powdery mildew, and blackleaf. Problem insects include aphids, thrips, mites, bud moths, Saskatoon sawflies, and <b>pear</b> <b>slug</b> sawflies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pear</b> <b>slug</b> or cherry slug is the larva of the sawfly, Caliroa cerasi, {{a nearly}} {{worldwide}} pest. They are not slugs but are {{a kind of}} sawfly of the family Tenthredinidae. The <b>pear</b> <b>slug</b> is an important pest that eats leaves of cherry, pear, and plum trees, leaving behind a skeleton of veins. The larvae cover themselves in green slime, making themselves unpalatable to predators. When the larvae are fully grown, they drop off the tree on the ground and pupate underground. The adult sawfly emerges from the pupal case and climbs from the soil to mate and lays eggs on the leaves of the host plant, completing the lifecycle.|$|E
50|$|Introduced insects {{have become}} pests. The green {{vegetable}} bug, {{shaped like a}} shield, dark green and 12 mm long, attacks tomatoes and beans. The green caterpillars of cabbage white butterflies eat brassicas. The codling moth caterpillar eats apples and pears. European earwigs eat leaves and petals. Fermentation flies eat rotting fruit. The Queensland fruit fly can be active in Canberra in late summer, eating apples, stone fruit, tomatoes and capsicums. Mandatory controls apply to infestations. Mealybugs have white hairs covered with a mealy coating. They are up to 8 mm across and suck sap from many plants, especially indoor plants. The <b>pear</b> <b>slug</b> or cherry slug is a sawfly larva. The larvae cover themselves with dark glossy slime to make themselves unpalatable. They skeletonize the leaves of cherry, pear, plum or hawthorn trees.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{codling moth}} {{insecticide}} programs have increasingly relied on pheromone mating disruption {{and the use}} of softer, pest-specific insecticides. The discontinued use of Guthion in some orchards has led to reduced pest pressure from some pests, such as mites and psylla, but it has also led to increases in secondary pests, such as leafrollers, leaf miners, and <b>pear</b> <b>slugs,</b> and possibly other non-pest insects, including predators and flies. Along with the softer insecticide programs in recent years have come fairly serious outbreaks of fire blight, particularly in May and June, after antibiotic sprays have ceased. Many growers and PCAs have questioned whether the increased presence of flies and other flying insects as a result of softer insecticide programs has led to increased potential for the spread of blight. Surround Â® WP (kaolin clay) is used by several organic growers for control of codling moth and other insect pests. It works in part by repelling insects by making the surface of the fruit and foliage less hospitable. Surround was shown to strongly repel glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) nymphs and adults on lemon trees in the San Joaquin Valley (Puterka et al. 2003). In a related field study conducted in three vineyards, Surround WP was as effective as dimethoate and methomyl in the reduction of GWSS adult density and oviposition (Puterka et al. 2003) ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pear</b> <b>slug.</b> Caliroa cerasi was {{collected}} and reared to adulthood on flowering quince and three species of Cotoneaster. This {{is the first}} record of C. cerasi attacking {{any member of the}} genus Chaenomeles and the first confirmation of feeding on Cotoneaster in North America. Adult emergence, oviposition, and larval development were evaluated under both laboratory and field conditions. Females lay an average of 48 eggs, with about two-thirds of the oviposition occurring during their first 24 hours. A method for monitoring adult emergence in the field was developed...|$|E
