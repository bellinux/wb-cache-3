40|$|Local anesthetics such as dibucaine, QX 572, tetracaine, and <b>phenacaine,</b> as well {{as other}} drugs with local anesthetic-like {{properties}} (e. g., mepacrine, propranolol, and SKF 525 A) inhibit the specific calmodulin-dependent stimulation of erythrocyte Ca 2 +-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3. 6. 1. 3) and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (3 ', 5 '-cyclic-nucleotide 5 '-nucleotidohydrolase, EC 3. 1. 4. 17) from brain and heart. Basal activities of these enzymes in the absence of calmodulin are relatively unaffected by concentrations of local anesthetics that strongly inhibit the specific stimulation by calmodulin. Increasing calmodulin, but not Ca 2 +, overcomes the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics on brain phosphodiesterase. However, excess calmodulin does not fully restore activity of erythrocyte CA 2 +-stimulated ATPase. Although the mechanism(s) by which the local anesthetics act is unclear, they inhibit binding of 125 I-labeled calmodulin to the erythrocyte membrane. Antagonism of calmodulin provides a molecular mechanism that may explain the inhibition of many Ca 2 +-dependent cellular processes by local anesthetics [...] e. g., Ca 2 + transport, exocytosis, excitation-contraction coupling, non-muscle-cell motility, and aggregation...|$|E
