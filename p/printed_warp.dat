40|$|Proto-Meisen The term meisen {{generally}} {{refers to}} plain-weave silk cloth patterned with woven (not printed) stripes or kasuri and made into kimono, haori, and nen 2 ̆ 7 neko (literally 2 ̆ 7 jacket sleeper, 2 ̆ 2 a padded coat worn during the autumn and winter months for carrying babies on the back). In {{the first half}} ofthe twentieth century, almost all Japanese women were familiar with meisen- as ordinary, everyday wear for the upper and middle classes and as dress-up kimono for working- class and country women. In the twenty four years between 1913 and 1937, according to the census, 200 million bolts (tan) of meisen kimono cloth was produced. Meisen originated in the silk and cotton producing centers including Isesaki, Chichibu, Kiryu, Hachioji, and Ashikaga in the Kanto region. The textile makers were very industrious in devising new methods and new effects to capture the market. Around 1907 (Meiji 40), many weaving centers tried to perfect pictorial or print-like ikat (moyo gasuri), which was most effectively executed with <b>printed</b> <b>warp</b> ikat (hogushi gasuri). The tenn hogushi {{is derived from the}} verb hogusu, meaning to unravel or to take apart, and it implies the process where a long warp thread (50 meters or more) is sparsely woven with a temporary weft to keep the warp threads in order during the printing. After steam setting of the dye on the warp and before the warp is woven, the temporary weft has to be taken out on the loom-hence the name hogushi...|$|E

40|$|This work {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the contribution that Ikat weaving and <b>warp</b> <b>printing</b> could make to contemporary textile design. To do this the research first considered the historical background to Ikat weaving and <b>warp</b> <b>printing</b> by examining'the visual and structural characteristics involved and the definitions used historically. Then by studying in some detail the methods of manufacture, dyestuffs, and design imagery of warp Ikats from South America and Central Asia, and weft and double Ikats from Indonesia and Japan a particular was made with a detailed study comparison of these Ikat techniques in The first volume of this work concluded with a detailed study of warp, weft and double Ikats in Japan. From this historic basis {{and analysis of the}} various techniques used experiments were devised to understand more clearly the effect of fibre, structure, colouration, warp design and its positioning on the image produced in the fabric. In investigating this a series of practical experiments was carried out on <b>warp</b> <b>printed</b> wool, cotton and silk fabrics and measurements made {{of the effects of the}} variables. These results were used to undertake a second series of experiments using slub weft yarns, <b>warp</b> <b>printed</b> silk and <b>warp</b> <b>printed</b> cotton fabrics made from a double warp. The work established from an historical viewpoint that the Ikat weavers were familiar and well practised within the traditional design limits of their craft but that these limits were differently defined for the various types of Ikat produced throughout the world. From the technological experiments the factors controlling the image, its size, position. and effect were determined so that ultimately exemplar design effects were created which suggested ways in which this technique could be developed in the future...|$|R
50|$|The Warp {{projects}} were started in 1984 by H. T. Kung at Carnegie Mellon University. The Warp projects yielded research results, publications and advancements in general purpose systolic hardware design, compiler design and systolic software algorithms.There were three distinct machine designs {{known as the}} WW-Warp (Wire Wrap <b>Warp),</b> PC-Warp (<b>Printed</b> Circuit <b>Warp),</b> and iWarp (integrated circuit Warp, conveniently also a play on the “i” for Intel).|$|R

5000|$|<b>Warp</b> <b>printing</b> is {{a fabric}} {{production}} method which combines textile printing and weaving {{to create a}} distinctively patterned fabric, usually in silk. [...] The warp threads of the fabric are printed before weaving to create a softly blurred, vague pastel-coloured pattern. It was particularly fashionable {{in the eighteenth century}} for summer wear.|$|R
50|$|Kapton and ABS {{adhere to}} each other very well, {{which has led to}} {{widespread}} use of Kapton as a build surface for 3D printers. Kapton is laid down on a flat surface and the ABS is extruded on to the Kapton surface. The ABS part being printed will not detach from the build platform as it cools and shrinks, a common cause of <b>print</b> failure by <b>warping</b> of the part.|$|R
5000|$|Mountain Banshee (Ikran in Naʼvi) - The Mountain Banshee is an {{airborne}} predator which {{lives in}} mountainous territory on Pandora. Naʼvi warriors attempt {{to bond with}} a Banshee, a dangerous and required rite of passage. They are cousins to the Great Leonopteryx and they are scientifically known by Xenobiologists as Pterodactylus giganteus. A Banshee bonds to a Naʼvi warrior for life. They are four-winged creatures that, like the Leonopteryx and Direhorse, have a biologically produced carbon fiber flexing on the skin. Neytiri had a Banshee named Seze (translated from {{the language of the}} Naʼvi roughly as [...] "blue flower"). Page spent the most time designing the Banshee for the film so it would be convincing when it flew or perched. The designer said, [...] "The hardest thing of all was having a Naʼvi on top of it and flying it. You had to backwards engineer it. It was like designing and engineering an aircraft." [...] Barlowe, who contributed to the Banshee's design, was influenced by manta rays and skates as well as relatively little-known pterosaurs and plesiosaurs that had [...] "many, unique aerodynamic and hydrodynamic" [...] characteristics. Like the color scheme for the Great Leonopteryx, color schemes based on Earth animals were used for various Banshees, though Page was inspired by Art Nouveau <b>prints</b> to <b>warp</b> the schemes so they would not look familiar to film audiences.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{efficient}} image warping technique to simulate arbitrary texture images onto real clothings. Till now lots of apparel modeling tools were announced to help clothing designers. Previous works were done mainly on modeling for the fabric dynamics to simulate a virtual clothing to a virtual model. However their systems require too much computations and additional interventions of human designer. Our system can warp a given textile image onto arbitrarily wrinkled clothes on which mesh patterns are <b>printed.</b> The proposed <b>warping</b> algorithm utilizes those mesh points to compute the wrinkles of cloths. For this work, one graph searching algorithm is applied to decide the topology of the mesh points appeared in cloth. Our experimental results show that this technique is highly effective to warp textile images to an arbitrary clothing without any manual works and 3 -D information for the cloth surface...|$|R
50|$|Most of Raverat's {{commissions}} for book illustrations {{date from}} the 1930s. The first was {{for a set of}} engravings for Kenneth Grahame's classic anthology The Cambridge Book of Poetry for Children (1932). This was published by the Cambridge University Press and printed at the press by Walter Lewis. The Cambridge University Press took almost as much care with their printing as a private press, and Lewis printed the wood engravings from the original blocks. He printed four more books for Raverat - Mountains and Molehills by Frances Cornford (1934), Four Tales from Hans Andersen, a new version by R. P. Keigwin (1935), The Runaway by Elizabeth A. Hart (1936) and The Bird Talisman by H. A. Wedgwood (her great-uncle) (1939). Four Tales and The Bird Talisman were illustrated with colour wood engravings. Brooke Crutchley, Lewis's successor at the press, was responsible for printing the collection of Raverat's work by Reynolds Stone and described the care taken over <b>printing</b> from old <b>warped</b> blocks.|$|R
40|$|Keywords: polyolefin, polypropylene, polyethylene, fused {{deposition}} modeling, 3 D <b>printing,</b> shrinkage, <b>warping</b> With the continuous developments, FDM has surpassed the status as rapid prototyping method, and matured {{to the point}} where it is widely applied in direct manufacturing of various end-use products. However, the end-use applications are partly limited due to most current feedstock materials being prone to degradation in high-temperature, humid and chemically aggressive environments. The goal of this thesis was to evaluate the per-formance of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) as alternative feedstock materi-als in the FDM process. PP and PE are prevalent polyolefin plastics and their principal value lies in the attractive balance of physical properties in the solid state and chemical inertness, and for the same reasons, they represent attractive FDM feedstock materials for the environmentally challenging conditions. However, as highly semi-crystalline plastics they show substantial solidification shrinkage upon cooling, and the shrinkage induced contractile stresses can deform the deposited parts. In this work, the performance of PP and PE as feedstock materials in FDM was evaluat-ed through several deposition experiments. The entire manufacturing chain from fila-ment fabrication to deposition of specimens was controlled. Bonding quality between deposited filament strands at varying deposition conditions was assessed by preparing and testing tensile specimens, and comparing the results to injection molded counter-parts. The effects of deposition conditions on the shrinkage and warp deformation were studied by depositing specimens with different geometrical features. Based on the results, FDM of PP and PE feedstock materials is feasible and holds a great potential, but requires special arrangements and awareness of the inherent chal-lenges. Bonding quality was highest at high temperature deposition conditions, and only roughly 10 % loss in yield strength was observed when compared to injection molded counterparts. All specimens, regardless of deposition conditions, showed poor ductility and little to no correlation was found between the elongation and deposition tempera-tures. Excessive heat flow to the specimen during deposition caused substantial shrink-age due to prolonged cooling of the deposited plastic, and consequently the most di-mensionally stable specimens were produced by limiting the deposition temperatures or increasing interlayer cooling time. Specimens with sharp protruding features showed higher tendency to peel off from the build platform than circular specimens did, due to differences in contractile stress distributions. Warp deformation became also more prom-inent when feature thickness was reduced. Nevertheless, the deposition performance under optimal conditions was for the most parts on par with many traditional feedstock materials...|$|R
