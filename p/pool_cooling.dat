50|$|The NRC Office of Inspector General {{investigated}} {{this episode}} and essentially agreed with Galatis in Case Number 95-771, {{the report of}} which tells the whole story: The Office of Inspector General (OIG), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), initiated this investigation based on information submitted to the NRC pursuant to a 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 2.206 petition filed on August 21, 1995, on behalf of George Galatis, a senior engineer with Northeast Utilities Services Company (NU), and We the People, Inc. The petition alleged that the NRC knowingly allowed NU to operate the Millstone Unit 1 Nuclear Power Station for 20 years in violation of its operating license and beyond its design basis. The petitioners maintained that during normal refueling outages at Millstone Unit 1, NU offloaded the entire fuel core.The OIG investigation developed evidence that NU operated Millstone Unit 1 outside of its design basis. The OIG investigation determined that the licensee may have violated the operating license for Millstone Unit 1 because of a failure to operate in accordance with its technical specification. One procedure required by the technical specifications is for {{the operation of the}} spent fuel cooling system. OIG uncovered information which indicates that for approximately 10 years, in order to handle the heat load from a full core offload, reactor operators at Millstone Unit 1operated the spent fuel <b>pool</b> <b>cooling</b> system in a configuration that was not covered by a plant operating procedure.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{operators}} had {{to prepare}} an alternate injection line for each unit, as the RCIC can run indefinitely only {{while there is}} sufficient pressure and steam in the reactor to drive its turbine; once reactor pressure drops below a certain level, the RCIC shuts down automatically. The normal AC driven Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) were {{for the most part}} unavailable due to the loss of ultimate heat sink and damage to some of the electrical infrastructure. Operators prepared for this and set up an alternate injection line using a non-emergency system known as the Makeup Water Condensate System to maintain water level which was an accident mitigation method TEPCO put in place at all its nuclear plants. The system was started and stopped in all 4 units, including unit 3, as needed to maintain the water level. The RCICs in each unit later shut down due to low reactor pressure. Operators had to also use the MUWC and the makeup water purification and filtering (MUPF) system to try to cool the suppression pool and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high. Operators were later able to restore the High Pressure Core Spray portion of the ECCS in unit 4 and switched emergency water injection for unit 4 from the MUWC system to the HPCS. While the water level was maintained in the three cores using emergency water injection, pressures in the containment vessel continued to rise due to lack of suppression <b>pool</b> <b>cooling</b> and the operators prepared to vent the containments making restoration of heat removal urgent. Unit 1 was prioritized as it had the highest drywell pressure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To achieve {{widespread}} cancer control, {{a better}} understanding is needed {{of the factors that}} contribute to successful implementation of effective skin cancer prevention interventions. This study assessed the relative contributions of individual- and setting-level characteristics to implementation of a widely disseminated skin cancer prevention program. Methods A multilevel analysis was conducted using data from the <b>Pool</b> <b>Cool</b> Diffusion Trial from 2004 and replicated with data from 2005. Implementation of <b>Pool</b> <b>Cool</b> by lifeguards was measured using a composite score (implementation variable, range 0 to 10) that assessed whether the lifeguard performed different components of the intervention. Predictors included lifeguard background characteristics, lifeguard sun protection-related attitudes and behaviors, pool characteristics, and enhanced (i. e., more technical assistance, tailored materials, and incentives are provided) versus basic treatment group. Results The mean value of the implementation variable was 4 in both years (2004 and 2005; SD = 2 in 2004 and SD = 3 in 2005) indicating a moderate implementation for most lifeguards. Several individual-level (lifeguard characteristics) and setting-level (pool characteristics and treatment group) factors were found to be significantly associated with implementation of <b>Pool</b> <b>Cool</b> by lifeguards. All three lifeguard-level domains (lifeguard background characteristics, lifeguard sun protection-related attitudes and behaviors) and six pool-level predictors (number of weekly pool visitors, intervention intensity, geographic latitude, pool location, sun safety and/or skin cancer prevention programs, and sun safety programs and policies) were included in the final model. The most important predictors of implementation were the number of weekly pool visitors (inverse association) and enhanced treatment group (positive association). That is, pools with fewer weekly visitors and pools in the enhanced treatment group had significantly higher program implementation in both 2004 and 2005. Conclusions More intense, theory-driven dissemination strategies led to higher levels of implementation of this effective skin cancer prevention program. Issues to be considered by practitioners seeking to implement evidence-based programs in community settings, include taking into account both individual-level and setting-level factors, using active implementation approaches, and assessing local needs to adapt intervention materials. </p...|$|R

40|$|All {{nuclear reactor}} plants include a {{spent fuel pool}} for the wet storage of spent fuel {{assemblies}}. The methods used to provide cooling {{for the removal of}} decay heat from the stored assemblies vary from plant to plant depending upon the individual design. The safety function to be performed by the system in all cases remains the same; that is, the spent fuel assemblies must be cooled and must remain covered with water during all storage conditions. Other functions performed by the system, not related to safety, include water cleanup for the spent fuel pool, refueling canal, refueling water storage tank and other equipment storage pools; means for filling and draining the refueling canal and other storage pools; and surface skim-ming to provide clear water in the storage pool. The ASB review of the spent fuel <b>pool</b> <b>cooling</b> and cleanup system covers the system from inlet to and exit from the storage pool and pits, the seismic Category I water source and piping used for fuel pool makeup, the cleanup system filter-demineralizers and the regenerative process to the point of discharge to the radwaste system. 1. The capability of the spent fuel <b>pool</b> <b>cooling</b> and cleanup system to provide adequate cooling to the spent fuel during all operating conditions is reviewed on one of two bases. The first basis requires the cooling portion of the sys-tem to be designed to seismic Category I, Quality Group C requirements. The second basis allows a non-seismic Category I, Quality Group C, spent fuel <b>pool</b> <b>cooling</b> system provided that the following systems are designed to seismic Category I requirements and are protected against tornadoes: the fuel pool make-up water system and its source; and, the fuel pool building and its ven-tilation and filtration system. The makeup, ventilation and filtration sys-tems must also withstand a single active failure. In addition; the transient temperature (Ta) used in evaluating combined load on structure...|$|E

This article describes {{the diffusion of}} an effective skin cancer prevention program called <b>Pool</b> <b>Cool</b> through available Web-based program materials. MethodsWe used self-administered surveys to collect information from program users about access to and use of Web-based program materials. We analyzed the content of e-mails sent to the official <b>Pool</b> <b>Cool</b> Web site to obtain qualitative information about spontaneous diffusion. ResultsProgram users were dispersed throughout the United States, most often learning about the program through a Web site (32 %), publication (26 %), or colleague (19 %). Most respondents (86 %) reported that their pool provided educational activities at swimming lessons. The Leader's Guide (59 %) and lesson cards (50 %) were the most commonly downloaded materials, and most respondents reported using these core items sometimes, often, or always.
