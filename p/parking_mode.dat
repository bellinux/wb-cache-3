40|$|Hybrid Solar Vehicles (HSV), {{derived by}} {{integration}} of Hybrid Electric Vehicles with Photo-Voltaic sources, {{may represent a}} valuable solution to face both energy saving and environmental issues, particularly in urban driving.

40|$|A linear {{stability}} {{analysis has}} been done to a magnetized disk under a linear gravity. We have reduced the linearized perturbation equations to a second-order differential equation that resembles the Schrodinger equation with the potential of a harmonic oscillator. Depending on the signs of energy and potential terms, eigensolutions can be classified into ''continuum'' and ''discrete'' families. When the magnetic field is ignored, the continuum family is identified as the convective mode, while the discrete family is identified as acoustic-gravity waves. If the effective adiabatic index gamma is less than unity, the former develops into the convective instability. When a magnetic field is included, the continuum and discrete families further branch into several solutions with different characters. The continuum family is divided into two modes: one is the original <b>Parker</b> <b>mode,</b> which is a slow MHD mode modulated by the gravity, and the other is a stable Alfven <b>mode.</b> The <b>Parker</b> <b>modes</b> can be either stable or unstable depending on gamma. When gamma is smaller than a critical value gamma(cr), the <b>Parker</b> <b>mode</b> becomes unstable. The discrete family is divided into three modes: a stable fast MHD mode modulated by the gravity, a stable slow MHD mode modulated by the gravity, and an unstable mode that is also attributed to a slow MHD mode. The unstable discrete mode does not always exist. Even though the unstable discrete <b>mode</b> exists, the <b>Parker</b> <b>mode</b> dominates it if the <b>Parker</b> <b>mode</b> is unstable. However, if gamma {{greater than or equal to}} gamma(cr), then the discrete mode could be the only unstable one. When gamma is equal gamma(cr), the minimum growth time of the unstable discrete mode is 1. 3 x 10 (8) yr, with a corresponding length scale of 2. 4 kpc. It is suggestive that the corrugated features seen in the Galaxy and external galaxies are related to the unstable discrete modeopen 131...|$|R
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} order to perform an aerodynamic frequency domain identification on a NACA 0015 airfoil with a simple flap. The experimental results revealed the existence of two flow noise sources; mainly a wind tunnel resonance, {{also referred to as}} a <b>Parker</b> <b>Mode,</b> and flow induced noise resulting from uncovered directed synthetic jet actuator cavities.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a prototype of Hybrid Solar Vehicle (HSV) with series structure. This activity has been also conducted in the framework of the European Union funded Leonardo project “Energy Conversion Systems and Their Environmental Impact”, a project with research and educational objectives. A study on supervisory control for hybrid solar vehicles and some preliminary tests performed on the road are presented. Previous results obtained by a model for HSV optimal design have confirmed the relevant benefits of such vehicles with respect to conventional cars in case of intermittent use in urban driving (city-car), and that economical feasibility could be achieved in a near future. Due to the series-powertrain adopted for the HSV prototype, an intermittent use of the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) powering the electric generator is possible, thus avoiding part-load low-efficient engine operations. The best ICE power trajectory is determined via genetic algorithm optimization accounting for fuel mileage as well as battery state of charge, also considering solar contribution during <b>parking</b> <b>mode.</b> The experimental set up used for data logging, real-time monitoring and control of the prototype is also presented, and the results obtained with different road tests discussed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} RF Tire Pressure and {{temperature}} Monitoring (TPM) systems for automotive. Currently, most systems {{are characterized by}} an unidirectional link from the RF TPM sensors on the wheels' rim to the receiving/processing unit on the vehicle chassis. This way the battery-powered transmitter is always active wasting power also in <b>parking</b> <b>mode,</b> when TPM is not required. Without a feedback channel, the TPM transmitters cannot be forced in power-on or off depending on the vehicle status; moreover there isn't an acknowledgment that the receiver has correctly interpreted the data and retransmission of erroneous packets can not be requested. We overcome such problems by inserting a low-complexity RF wake up circuitry on each TPM module, now acting as slave, whose power-state {{is driven by the}} processing unit on the chassis through UHF transmission. Power consumption in idle mode can be reduced in average by a factor 30. To increase system reliability a proper encoding of the wake up RF pulses is introduced. Collision between data transmitted by different TPM units is avoided through a time division policy by the vehicle processing unit now acting as master...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCompared to Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors (SCs) boast longer lifespan, {{higher power}} density, and wider {{operational}} temperature range. Nevertheless, SCs are expensive (almost 40 times more expensive per watthour than Li-ion batteries). SCs aging is critical. Two types of aging tests are usually performed. Floating aging tests apply constant constraints (voltage and temperature), and cycling aging tests apply multiple charges and discharges. We focus our study on floating aging [corresponding for instance to <b>parking</b> <b>mode</b> for electrical vehicles (95 % of the time) or uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) {{when they are}} not solicited (quite all the time) ]. All results in the literature conclude that voltage level is an acceleration factor for SC aging. According to the literature, {{it would be interesting to}} totally discharge the SCs {{when they are not}} in active use (i. e., when the UPSs or vehicles are turned off) to improve their lifespan. Contrary to the literature forecasts (i. e., lower voltage increases lifespan of SC), the results obtained in this paper by alternating voltage resets (0 V, 60 °C) and floating aging (2. 8 V, 60 °C) show that discharging even very few times the SCs shortens their lifespan drastically. Physical interpretations are presented to explain aging increase with voltage resets...|$|E

40|$|In last years, {{increasing}} fleet electrification, {{improvement in}} solar panel efficiency and reduction in their costs are concurring toward an increasing {{attention to the}} integration of photovoltaic in road vehicles. As in fixed plants, the adoption of solar tracking systems would allow to enhance the solar contribution. But a mobile solar systems for a car must have specific features, due to space constraints and to specific exigencies of a mobile application such as instabilities, energy and aerodynamic losses. Due to these reasons, they should operate only in <b>parking</b> <b>mode.</b> A kinematic model of mobile solar roof, as a parallel robot, has been developed and used to optimize the roof geometry; {{the benefits of a}} mobile roof, in terms of solar energy gain at different latitudes and months, have been assessed. A second prototype of solar tracking roof with two degrees of freedom has been then realized, to overcome some mechanical problems. In order to detect the relative position of the sun and to achieve the best roof orientation, a model based control strategy has been developed, using sky images detected by a small camera. The control system has been successfully validated over experimental data. In order to assess the economic feasibility of the project, a preliminary study on payback value has been performed. The comparison of a fixed horizontal roof and a solar tracking roof on a hybrid vehicle has shown that a significant reduction in payback occurs with the adoption of a mobile solar roof.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} a study of land use, <b>parking,</b> <b>mode</b> choice, and housing and jobs development in downtown Berkeley, CA, a medium-sized city with four decades of experience with parking management and transit-oriented development. The paper sheds light on the multiple roles that parking management, including reduced parking requirements and parking pricing, can play in a downtown area. It also illustrates the performance of transit-oriented development in smaller cities. Originally developed as a streetcar suburb, Berkeley has long supported high quality transit, restricted parking, and provided walking and biking facilities. This has resulted in transit, walk, and bike usage far higher than US averages. Nevertheless, traffic is heavy, parking is full, and concerns about infill development persist. Merchants are also concerned that parking constraints may limit economic development. Surveys of downtown shoppers, workers, and residents show that relatively few drive downtown. Workers and downtown residents are {{a large share of}} downtown commercial enterprises ' customers. Residents have intentionally chosen to live in a transit and pedestrian friendly area and own and use cars far less often than average. Parking shortages are caused in large part by overtime parking, facilitated by broken meters and by meter feeding by employees. Overall, transit-oriented development has been successful in reducing auto ownership and use, but is accompanied by tight parking and a certain amount of congestion. Parking enforcement and better use of off-street spaces would relieve the former problem. Many cities are contending with these issues, so the Berkeley case should provide useful insights. 250 words...|$|E
