25|$|On June 25, 1973, Dean {{began his}} {{testimony}} before the Senate Watergate Committee. The committee had voted to grant him use immunity (doing so in a divided vote in a <b>private</b> <b>session</b> that was then changed to a unanimous vote and announced that way to the public). In his testimony, Dean implicated administration officials, including Nixon fund-raiser and former Attorney General John Mitchell, Nixon, and himself. Dean's testimony attracted very high television ratings since he was breaking new ground in the investigation, and media attention grew apace, with more detailed newspaper coverage. Dean was the first administration official to accuse Nixon of direct involvement with Watergate and the resulting cover-up in press interviews. Such testimony against Nixon, while damaging to the president's credibility, had little impact legally, as it was merely his word against Nixon's. Nixon vigorously denied all accusations against {{him that he had}} authorized a cover-up, and Dean had no corroboration beyond various notes he had taken in his meetings with the president. It was not until information about secret White House tape recordings having been made by President Nixon (disclosed in testimony by Alexander Butterfield, on July 16, 1973) and the tapes having been subpoenaed and analyzed that many of Dean's accusations were largely substantiated. Earlier, Dean had had suspicions that Nixon was taping conversations, but had not known this for sure, and he tipped prosecutors to ask witnesses questions along this line, leading to Butterfield's revelations.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} Wheelwright {{was given a}} <b>private</b> <b>session</b> with the court at which time he asked who his accusers were. The court's answer was that his sermon was the accuser. That afternoon, the court was opened to the general public, and the colony's ministers were also present. One of the lines of attack used against Wheelwright was {{identifying}} his doctrine, and that of Cotton, as being [...] "False Doctrine" [...] because of its difference from that {{of all of the}} other New England ministers. Cotton's angry response to this was, [...] "Brother Wheelwright's Doctrine was according to God," [...] letting the court know that by going after Wheelwright they were going after him as well, and this essentially ended that line of attack. After some additional ineffective prosecutorial attempts, the court hit on the idea of asking the colony's ministers if they felt they were attacked by Wheelwright's sermon. Following an evening to discuss this among themselves, the ministers returned to the court the next day. With Cotton dissenting, the other ministers said that they did [...] "walk in" [...] and teach what Wheelwright called a covenant of works, and therefore they were the Antichrists alluded to in the sermon.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 December 2005, the {{statutory}} {{inquiry into the}} death of Brian Rossiter opened in Dublin. It was expected to last for three months and to hear from 120 witnesses in <b>private</b> <b>session.</b> The Rossiter family's solicitor, Cian O'Carroll of Lynch and Partners, spoke of his belief that the terms of reference would still not allow the inquiry {{to get at the}} key issue, which he said was whether Rossiter had died from injuries inflicted inside the garda station or not, and, if he had sustained these injuries inside the garda station, then who had caused them. Pat Rossiter spoke of feeling [...] "a bit anxious and a bit apprehensive" [...] {{at the start of the}} inquiry but he also [...] "hoped for the best". The Irish government had agreed to pay the family's out-of-pocket expenses, and for some of the preparatory work involved in the case.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of national primary schools, education lay mainly {{in the hands of the}} church. In Tobermore the Church of Ireland parish of Kilcronaghan has records of its school masters going as far back as Mr. Alex Trotter in 1686. The Parish School was originally built in the townland of Granny on the leading road between Tobermore and Draperstown. Despite being a Church of Ireland Parish School, it was open to children of all denominations. In 1836, there were 70 children recorded on the roll with 28 being described as Church of Ireland, 20 Presbyterian, 2 Roman Catholic, and 20 [...] "other denominations". Secular education such as arithmetic was taught as well as English. The local Presbyterian Church would also found its own school held in the Session House at the rear of the Presbyterian meeting house. <b>Private</b> <b>session</b> classes for adults would also be held twice a week in the Presbyterian Session House.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{historical}} accounts mention {{the crowd that}} gathered outside {{what is now the}} Palace of Iturbide in Mexico City to shout [...] "Viva Iturbide!" [...] and insist that he take the throne of Mexico in May 1822. [...] This crowd included Iturbide's old regiment from Celaya. Some detractors of Iturbide insist that this demonstration was staged by Iturbide himself or his loyalists. From a balcony of the palace Iturbide repeatedly denied his desire for the throne. One interesting twist to this story is reported by Mexico City daily La Jornada which states that Iturbide held the first popular referendum in Mexico. According to this article, Iturbide sent out a questionnaire to military and civilian leaders as to whether the people preferred a republic or a monarchy. The answer came back in favor of a monarchy. Iturbide asked the demonstrators that night to give him the night to think it over, and to respect the wishes of the government. The congress convened the next day to discuss the matter of Iturbide's election as Emperor. Iturbide's supporters filled the balconies overlooking the chamber. The congress confirmed him and his title of Agustín I, Constitutional Emperor of Mexico, by a vast majority. After Iturbide's abdication, Congress would state that it had elected Iturbide out of fear for their lives, as the common folk were present during the vote and loudly proclaimed Iturbide, despite the fact that no congressman voted against his crowning as Emperor. However, three days after Iturbide had been elected Emperor, Congress held a <b>private</b> <b>session,</b> in which only the congress was present, in which they ratified their decision, created titles for the royal family and declared Iturbide's title to be lifelong and hereditary.|$|E
