5|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of {{research}} into animal coloration, Edward Bagnall Poulton classified the forms of <b>protective</b> coloration, {{in a way which}} is still helpful. He described: <b>protective</b> resemblance; aggressive resemblance; adventitious protection; and variable <b>protective</b> resemblance. These are covered in turn below.|$|E
5|$|A field {{lacrosse}} player's equipment {{includes a}} lacrosse stick, and <b>protective</b> equipment, including a lacrosse helmet with face mask, lacrosse gloves, and arm and shoulder pads. Players are also required to wear mouthguards and athletic supporter with cup pocket and <b>protective</b> cup.|$|E

5|$|Personal <b>protective</b> {{equipment}} such as latex gloves, <b>protective</b> eye goggles, and chemical-resistant {{clothing and}} shoes will minimize risks when handling hydrochloric acid. The United States Environmental Protection Agency rates and regulates hydrochloric acid as a toxic substance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protective</b> helmets {{are also}} {{standard}} equipment for all batters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protective</b> {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} prey {{to avoid}} predation. It includes special <b>protective</b> resemblance, now called mimesis, where the whole animal looks like some other object, for example when a caterpillar resembles a twig or a bird dropping. In general <b>protective</b> resemblance, now called crypsis, the animal's texture blends with the background, for example when a moth's colour and pattern blend in with tree bark.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} <b>protective</b> against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This <b>protective</b> effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a <b>protective</b> factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is <b>protective.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a <b>protective</b> effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no <b>protective</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting <b>protective</b> effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be <b>protective.</b> A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, <b>protective,</b> surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the <b>protective</b> oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder valves must {{be closed}} whilst in transit and checked {{that there are}} no leaks. Where applicable, <b>protective</b> valve caps and covers should be fitted to {{cylinders}} before transporting. Cylinders should not be transported with equipment attached to the valve outlet (regulators, hoses etc.).|$|E

5|$|In {{variable}} <b>protective</b> resemblance, {{an animal}} {{such as a}} chameleon, flatfish, squid or octopus changes its skin pattern and colour using special chromatophore cells to resemble whatever background it is currently resting on (as well as for signalling).|$|E
