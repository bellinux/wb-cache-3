40|$|Throughout life, adult neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) produce new neurons and glia that {{contribute}} to crucial brain functions. Quiescence is an essential <b>protective</b> <b>feature</b> of adult NSCs; however, the establishment and maintenance of this state remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that in the adult zebrafish pallium, the brain-enriched miR- 9 is expressed exclusively in a subset of quiescent NSCs, highlighting a heterogeneity within these cells, and is necessary to maintain NSC quiescence. Strikingly, miR- 9, along with Argonaute proteins (Agos), is localized to the nucleus of quiescent NSCs, and manipulating their nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio impacts quiescence. Mechanistically, miR- 9 permits efficient Notch signaling to promote quiescence, and we identify the RISC protein TNRC 6 as a mediator of miR- 9 /Agos nuclear localization in vivo. We propose a conserved non-canonical role for nuclear miR- 9 /Agos in controlling the balance between NSC quiescence and activation, a key step in maintaining adult germinal pools...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHuman monocytes are {{susceptible}} to dengue virus (DV) infection through an FcR-dependent pathway known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In this study, infection enhancement was observed when purified monocytes were infected with DV serotypes {{in the presence of}} serially diluted immune serum antibodies. Analyzing binding of the DV-antibody immune complexes to monocytes by quantifying the amount of viruses attached to monocytes, we found that binding did not correlate with the input amount of antibodies; rather, it peaked at suboptimal antibody concentrations, correlating with the observed infection enhancement. These results suggested that immune complexes are involved in hindering DV from binding to FcR-bearing cells; when such a <b>protective</b> <b>feature</b> is weakened, enhancement of viral attachment and ADE are observed. Further, increased cytokine production (TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha), and costimulatory marker expression (CD 86 and CD 40), were found to be associated with infection enhancement, suggesting a pathological role of ADE-affected monocytes in dengue hemorrhagic diseases...|$|E

40|$|According {{to recent}} evoked {{potential}} studies, a fundamental, probably <b>protective,</b> <b>feature</b> of cortical information processing, ie, response habituation during stimulus repetition, is abnormal in migraine between attacks. The deficient habituation is found for different sensory modalities and experimental paradigms: pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (same stimulus {{at a constant}} intensity), cortical auditory evoked potentials (same stimulus at increasing intensities) and auditory event-related potentials obtained in a passive "oddball" paradigm (novel stimulus). The abnormal information processing is an interictal cortical dysfunction most likely due to inadequate control by the so-called "state-setting, chemically-addressed pathways" originating in the brain stem, in particular by the serotonergic pathway, leading to a low preactivation level of sensory cortices. We suggest that it may play {{a pivotal role in}} migraine pathogenesis in conjunction with the reported decrease of brain mitochondrial energy reserve, by favouring a rupture of metabolic homeostasis and biochemical shifts capable of activating the trigeminovascular system and thus capable of producing a migraine attack. We postulate that both the deficient habituation in information processing and the deranged oxygen metabolism may have behavioral correlates. Which of these abnormalities are inherited, acquired or both remains to be determined. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Interaction of {{the cell}} wall and plasma {{membrane}} is essential for proper cell functioning as it affects, for example, cell growth, water relations or pathogen penetration, and provides protection against external factors. This interaction may {{take the form of}} signal exchange or component transport and its necessary prerequisite is the contact between the two structures. The contact is ensured not only by turgor pressure but also by their direct connection. Experimental evidences have long been known to show that this connection indeed exists - for example, Hechtian strands that are visible in the plasmolyzed cell. Another example is band plasmolysis in cells of the endodermis and exodermis with the Casparian strips, where the plasma membrane is still attached to the cell wall {{at the site of the}} strip. This attachment contributes to the <b>protective</b> <b>feature</b> of the apoplastic barrier and allows maintaining it even during plasmolysis. The anatomic aspects of the phenomenon have long been investigated, but specific proteins providing this interaction at the molecular level have not yet been experimentally confirmed.

40|$|Diclofenac topical {{formulations}} {{are often}} preferred for drug administration {{to patients who}} experience serious GIT problems. Absorption of the drug through the skin, however, can be challenging due to the natural <b>protective</b> <b>feature</b> of the stratum corneum (SC). In this article, fluid gels prepared from gellan gum were explored as a topical drug delivery vehicle. Rheological analysis of the formulations showed {{that it was possible}} to produce a topical gel with a viscosity and the mechanical strength similar to that of the commercially available Voltaren® gel using 1 % w/w of a 50 : 50 low acyl/high acyl (LA/HA) gellan blend. Soft-tribology was used to assess the lubrication properties of gellan fluid gels. The lubrication of the gellan gum fluid gel formulations at high rubbing speeds was similar to the lubrication of the Voltaren® gel. The use of gellan gum dramatically increased skin permeation of diclofenac when compared with the commercially available formulation and could be controlled by changing the gellan gum concentration and/or sodium ion concentration in the formulation. This study highlights the potential use of fluid gels that can be easily tuned to have physical properties suitable for topical formulations with the added advantage of increasing drug permeation...|$|E

40|$|The nasal mucosa {{provides}} a potentially good route for local and systemic drug delivery. However, the <b>protective</b> <b>feature</b> {{of the nasal}} cavity make intranasal delivery challenging. The application of mucoadhesive polymers in nasal drug delivery systems enhances the retention of the dosage form in the nasal cavity. Several groups have investigated using low acyl gellan as a drug delivery vehicle but only limited research however, has been performed on high acyl gellan for this purpose, despite its properties being more conducive to mucoadhesion. High acyl gellan produces highly elastic gels below 60 °C which {{make it difficult to}} spray using a mechanical spray device. Therefore, in this study we have tried to address this problem by making fluid gels by introducing a shear force during gelation of the gellan polymer. These fluid gel systems contain gelled micro-particles suspended in a solution of un-gelled polymer. These systems can therefore behave as pourable viscoelastic fluids. In this study we have investigated the rheological behavior and mucoadhesion of fluid gels of two different types of gellan (high and low acyl) and fluid gels prepared from blends of high and low acyl gellan at a 50 : 50 ratio. The results demonstrated that by preparing fluid gels of high acyl gellan, the rheological properties were sufficient to spray through a standard nasal spray device. Moreover fluid gels also significantly enhance both high acyl and low acyl gellan mucoadhesion properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{transient}} {{increase in}} skin blood flow {{in response to}} an innocuous local pressure application, defined as pressure-induced vasodilatation (PIV), delays the occurrence of ischaemia, suggesting a <b>protective</b> <b>feature</b> against applied pressure. The PIV response depends on capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibres and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) {{has been shown to be}} involved. In these fibres, CGRP coexists with pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). Three distinct receptors mediate the biological effects of PACAP: VPAC 1 and VPAC 2 receptors binding with the same affinity for PACAP and vasoactive intestinal peptide and PAC 1 receptors showing high selectivity for PACAP. Because the receptors are widely expressed in the nervous system and in the skin, we hypothesized that at least one of them is involved in PIV development. To verify this hypothesis, we used [d-p-Cl-Phe 6,Leu 17]-VIP (nonspecific antagonist of VPAC 1 /VPAC 2 receptors), PG 97 - 269 (antagonist of VPAC 1 receptors), PACAP(6 – 38) (antagonist of VPAC 2 /PAC 1 receptors) and Max. d. 4 (antagonist of PAC 1 receptors) in anaesthetized rodents. The blockade of VPAC 1 /VPAC 2, VPAC 1 or VPAC 2 /PAC 1 receptors eliminated the PIV response, whereas PAC 1 blockade had no effect, demonstrating an involvement of VPAC 1 /VPAC 2 receptors in PIV development. Moreover, endothelium-independent and -dependent vasodilator responses were unchanged by the VPAC 1 /VPAC 2 antagonist. Thus, the absence of a PIV response following VPAC 1 /VPAC 2 blockade cannot be explained by any dysfunction of the vascular smooth muscle or endothelial vasodilator capacity. The involvement of VPAC 1 /VPAC 2 receptors in the development of PIV seems to imply a series relationship in which each receptor type (CGRP, VPAC 1, VPAC 2) is necessary for the full transmission of the response...|$|E
40|$|A genetically {{determined}} resistance or {{susceptibility to}} chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may make {{an important contribution}} to the course of liver disease and may be linked to the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the HLA class II genotype profile in chronic hepatitis C and to determine the HLA-hepatitis C association. The experimental population was composed of 49 unrelated chronic HCV patients (31 females, 18 males; mean age, 54. 4 ± 1. 7 years; range, 34 to 73 years). The control population consisted of 43 ethnically matched healthy donors. HLA-DR and -DQ alleles were studied for patients and controls by a PCR-sequence-specific-primer low-resolution method. Anti-HCV was investigated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay II, and HCV RNA was investigated with reverse transcriptase nested PCR. The HLA class II allele, DRB 1 * 11, was found at reduced frequency in 49 patients with chronic hepatitis C (anti-HCV and HCV RNA positive) compared to that for controls (22. 4 versus 51. 0 %; P < 0. 01, odds ratio = 0. 3, confidence interval = 0. 1 to 0. 7). No further HLA associations with chronic HCV infection were observed, and there was no correlation between the stage of disease and HLA. DRB 1 * 11 was also found at reduced frequency in all HCV antibody-positive patients compared to controls (corrected P = not significant). DRB 1 * 11 was associated with chronic HCV infection, and it is possible that HLA-DRB 1 * 11 may have a <b>protective</b> <b>feature</b> in chronic HCV infection. In addition, DRB 1 * 11 was associated with protection from HCV infection.
