It is the first Tamil film to be fully digitally restored, costing [...] and consuming an effort of three years. The effort was undertaken by film distributor Shanthi Chokkalingam, who stated, [...] "The sound negative was totally gone and the five to six reels from the <b>picture</b> <b>negative</b> were damaged to a great extent". The digital restoration of Karnan took place at Sangeetha Sound Studios in Chennai, after a failed attempt with the Mumbai-based Famous Studios, who earlier restored the 1960 Hindi film Mughal-e-Azam. Visual improvements and audio restoration were excessively worked upon, with Shanthi stating that the [...] "biggest challenge was to restore the background score". DVDs were also used to get the sound and music in its original form. To create awareness about the restoration of Karnan, a teaser trailer was launched on 21 February 2012, which received a positive response.|$|E

50|$|Negative cutting (also {{known as}} {{negative}} matching and negative conforming) {{is the process}} of cutting motion <b>picture</b> <b>negative</b> to match precisely the final edit as specified by the film editor. Original camera negative (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a film splicer and film cement. Negative cutting is part of the post-production process and occurs after editing and prior to striking internegatives and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process. Kodak introduced barcode on motion <b>picture</b> <b>negative</b> in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on keykode.|$|E

40|$|Emotionally {{negative}} stimuli {{serve as}} a mechanism of biological preparedness to enhance attention. We hypothesized that emotionally negative stimuli would also serve as motivational priming to increase attention resources for subsequent stimuli. To that end, we tested 11 participants in a dual sensory modality task, wherein emotionally <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> were contrasted with emotionally neutral pictures and each picture was followed 600 ms later by a tone in an auditory oddball paradigm. Each trial began with a picture displayed for 200 ms; half of the trials began with an emotionally <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> {{and half of the}} trials began with an emotionally neutral picture; 600 ms following picture presentation, the participants heard either an oddball tone or a standard tone. At the end of each trial (picture followed by tone), the participants categorized, with a button press, the picture and tone combination. As expected, and consistent with previous studies, we found an enhanced visual late positive potential (latency range= 300 - 700 ms) to the <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> stimuli. We further found that compared to neutral <b>pictures,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> resulted in early attention and orienting effects to subsequent tones (measured through an enhanced N 1 and N 2) and sustained attention effects only to the subsequent oddball tones (measured through late processing negativity, latency range= 400 - 700 ms). Number pad responses to both the picture and tone category showed the shortest response latencies and greatest percentage of correct picture-tone categorization on the <b>negative</b> <b>picture</b> followed by oddball tone trials. Consistent with previous work on natural selective attention, our results support the idea that emotional stimuli can alter attention resource allocation. This finding has broad implications for human attention and performance as it specifically shows the conditions in which an emotionally negative stimulus can result in extended stimulus evaluation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the relation between the phenomenological quality of memory (Tulving, 1985) and the realism (validity) in confidence judgement when using emotional pictures (I. A. P. S; Lang, Ohman, & Vaitl, 1988). A series of three experiments was completed where the participants judged the phenomenological quality of their memory and/or their confidence. The results showed facilitation for the <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> in a matrix search task in the encoding phase, where <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> were more easily and quickly detected, compared to positive ones. In the memory phase of the experiments a higher degree of recollective experience (a larger proportion of 'remember' responses) was found for <b>negative</b> <b>pictures.</b> A higher level of confidence for recognition of <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> than for positive ones was obtained, but no general valence dependent effect on the realism in the confidence judgement was found. However, when analysing only the remember responses, <b>negative</b> <b>pictures</b> showed higher overconfidence than the positive pictures. The results support that a recollective experience induces higher confidence and overconfidence. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
50|$|Metol is an {{excellent}} developing agent for most continuous tone developer applications, {{and it has been}} widely used in published developer formulas as well as commercial products. However, it is difficult to produce highly concentrated developer solutions using Metol, and therefore most Metol developers are supplied in dry chemical mix. A developer containing both Metol and hydroquinone is called an MQ developer. This combination of agents provide greater developer activity since the rate of development by both agents together is greater than the sum of rates of developments by each agent used alone (superadditivity). This combination is very versatile; by varying the quantities of Metol, hydroquinone, restrainer, and adjusting the pH, the entire range of continuous tone developers can be made. Therefore, Metol replaced most other developing agents except for hydroquinone, Phenidone (which is more recent than Metol), and derivatives of Phenidone. Notable formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion <b>picture</b> <b>negative</b> developer.|$|E

Elliott Gamson of Immaculate Matching (New York) developed a system using MS-DOS. Computamatch was one of the first MS-DOS-based systems developed and is still in use today in several countries.The first commercially available software product was OSC/R (pronounced [...] "Oscar"), a DOS-based application developed in Toronto, Canada by The Adelaide Works. OSC/R was very widely used and at the time was the only negative cutting software on the market until Adelaide Works ceased operation in 1993. OSC/R is still used today in some negative cutting facilities but has been mostly replaced by newer and more advanced systems. Excalibur was a later Windows 98 based product developed by FilmLab Engineering in Britain.

Electronic {{media have}} played and still {{play a major}} role in the popularization of certain sports. Such type of media very {{specifically}} single out what is important, selecting thus those aspects which seem to be most profitable and then transmit that information to the public. Seeing that electronic media are mass media as well, we could argue that mass sport is a part of the mass culture. Contemporary modern and popular sport has the characteristics of professionalism as well as of commercialization. Modern sport in terms of culture is in one way most similar to the music industry. Accordingly, the electronic media, together with any other mass media, determine what will be popular and to what extent will a certain sport be popular. However, sport has not always been in a state we know it to be today. Before the appearance of electronic media, sport occupied a role of entertainment regulated by certain rules. However, when the electronic mass media began reporting about sports on mass scale, broadcasting certain sport events and analyzing them, sport become the way we know it now. A lot is being done to make young people turn to sport due to health reasons as well as to educational purposes. Children and adults actually learn through sport as they gain new insights and skills. However, the popularity of sport brings into the <b>picture</b> <b>negative</b> consequences as well. Sport has in a way become a product that is bought as a kind of commodity in the marketplace. This would be fine if the rules were the same for everyone, but this is unfortunately not the case. It is not the same to be a professional football player, or for example, a professional kayaker. The athletes mentioned do not have the same conditions or the same predispositions for development, not to mention the meager chance of a professional kayaker to secure his minimum subsistence. In the past, sports were naturally more equally represented, but with the emergence and development of electronic media, the strict selection limited what will be advertised and published. Other entities appearing within the realm of sports acted accordingly, such as advertising agencies and manufacturers of sports equipment. They invested their funds and resources in the popular sports making them even more popular aside from the influence of the electronic media...|$|E
