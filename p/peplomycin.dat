40|$|<b>Peplomycin,</b> a {{derivative}} of bleomycin, {{was used in}} the treatment of 8 patients with stage D, 2 patients with stage C and one patient with stage B prostatic carcinoma. Newly-diagnosed 4 patients received <b>peplomycin</b> from the outset and other 7 patients had previously received anti-androgenic therapy for 4 months to 10 years. Based on the results of a response study using acid-phosphatase level, prostatic biopsy, urethrocystography and rectal palpation, there was no objective response in all of 4 patients given a total dose of 100 mg of <b>peplomycin.</b> Objective responses were elicited in 5 of 6 patients given a total dose of 165 to 200 mg of <b>peplomycin.</b> However, the response was gentle and not so beneficial because of anorexia, {{which was one of the}} severe adverse reactions caused by <b>peplomycin</b> and more or less correlated to the cause of death in 2 of the 6 patients averaging 78 years of age. To relieve the adverse reaction and enrich the beneficial effect, <b>peplomycin</b> was suggested to use in combination with other anticancer treatments including irradiation, hyperthermia and/or anticancer drugs...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePeplomycin, a bleomycin-related {{cytostatic}} agent, {{was tested}} on DNA polymerases and DNA ligase. These enzymes were purified from normal human immunocompetent cells (thymocytes and lymphocytes) and from peripheral blast cells from {{different kinds of}} acute lymphoblastic and acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia. At low concentration ranges (1 - 25 microM) this compound was found to strongly inhibit polymerase alpha and ligase from leukemic cells while being less effective on the enzyme activity from normal thymocytes and lymphocytes. At the DNA level, low concentrations of <b>peplomycin</b> resulted in the induction of dose-dependent single-stranded breaks. The incubation of <b>peplomycin</b> (5 microM) with plasmid DNA resulted in its degradation as observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Lowering the <b>peplomycin</b> concentration showed that ligase inhibition takes place prior to this phenomenon. The decreased formation of the ligase [...] adenylate complex under the effect of <b>peplomycin</b> {{is consistent with a}} direct interaction between the drug and the enzyme. These results are discussed in terms of possible selective cytostatic effects of <b>peplomycin</b> on leukemic cells...|$|E

40|$|A {{rare case}} of prostatic {{rhabdomyosarcoma}} in a 3 -year-old child is presented. He received a multimodal treatment of chemotherapy including vincristine, cyclophosphamide, actinomycin-D plus adriamycin, and linac irradiation followed by total prostatectomy with segmental resection of bladder. Despite no viable sarcoma {{cells in the}} surgical specimen, he showed relapse 4 months later. By the combination of cisplatin, vinblastine and <b>peplomycin</b> (PVP therapy), the bulky mass in the pelvis rapidly reduced by 95 %. Furthermore, cisplatin, etoposide and <b>peplomycin</b> (PEP therapy), instead of PVP therapy, were administered to the refractory disease. Although the residual tumor was salvaged after 7 courses of PEP therapy, abdominal dissemination and liver metastasis occurred 2 months postoperatively. The combined modality of vincristine, <b>peplomycin,</b> ifosfamide, methotrexate, adriamycin, melphalan plus nimustine, and irradiation of microtron were effective for the abdominal dissemination, but he died of cerebral hemorrhage 31 months {{after the start of}} treatment.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of pure yolk sac tumor of the left testis in a 22 -year-old male. He {{consulted}} a physician with left back pain and induration of his left scrotal content in December, 1992. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) revealed left hydronephrosis. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed para-aortic lymph node swelling and lung metastases. Left high inguinal orchiectomy was performed. Histopathological diagnosis was pure yolk sac tumor. After two courses of "COMPE" chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate, <b>peplomycin</b> and etoposide, two courses of "high dose "COMPE" chemotherapy and three courses of "high dose COME" chemotherapy without <b>peplomycin,</b> he achieved a partial response (the regression rate of the pulmonary metastases and the retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis were 100 % and 96. 0 % on CT, respectively) and the residual masses in the retroperitoneum were removed.

40|$|DNA repair {{synthesis}} induced in permeable mouse ascites sarcoma cells by <b>peplomycin,</b> an antitumor antibiotic, was studied. Mouse ascites sarcoma (SR-C 3 H/He) {{cells were}} permeabilized {{with a low}} concentration of Triton X- 100 in an isotonic condition. Permeable cells were treated with an appropriate concentration of <b>peplomycin</b> to introduce single-strand breaks in permeable cell DNA. DNA repair synthesis in peplomycin-treated permeable cells was measured by incubating the cells with four deoxynucleoside triphosphates in an appropriate buffer system. The DNA repair synthesis was enhanced by ATP and NaCl at near physiological concentrations. More than 90 % of DNA synthesis in the present system depended on the peplomycin-treatment. The repair nature of the DNA synthesis was confirmed by a BrdUMP density shift technique. The repair patches were largely completed and ligated {{in the presence of}} ATP.

40|$|In our department, 11 {{patients}} with prostatic carcinoma {{were treated with}} <b>peplomycin,</b> a derivative of bleomycin. They were aged from 62 to 84, and clinically classified (by the Whitemore classification) to 1 in stage A, 3 in stage B, 3 in stage C and 4 in stage D. <b>Peplomycin</b> was administered on the dosage schedule of 5 or 10 mg at a time, 3 times a week, to the target total dose of 180 mg. The effects of this drug against prostatic carcinoma were evaluated in terms of (1) changes {{in the size of}} the prostate, those in acid phosphatase activity and the trend of bone metastasis, (2) histopathological findings after the treatment, and (3) long-term survival. The adverse reactions to the treatment were also studied. The patients received <b>peplomycin</b> to the total doses of 80 to 190 mg (135 mg on the average). The drug was withdrawn from 5 of them for adverse reactions. At the end of the treatment, the prostate was found to have been reduced in size in 7, and unchanged in 3 of them. Acid phosphatase activity, which had been elevated in 5, was normal in all the 5 patients. Bone metastases had been noted in 4 of the 11 patients, but the clinical symptom (pain) had disappeared from all the 4 patients. The posttreatment histopathological findings of the prostate tissue specimens obtained by TUR were grade IIa in 1, grade IIb in 3, grade III in 4 and grade IVa in 3 of the patients by the Shimosato classification. Excluding 1 patient who died of an unknown cause 6 months after the end of the treatment and another of cerebral hemorrhage 7 months after the treatment, recurrence was noted 12 months after the treatment in one of the remaining 9 patients, while the other 8 have remained without any sign of recurrence for 2 to 25 months.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the preoperative chemotherapy, the retrospective study {{was performed on}} 168 patients with squamous cell carcinoma treated in our clinic from April 1980 to December 1990. Out of 168 patients, 99 were male and 69 were female giving a male female ratio of 1. 4 to 1. The age ranged from 23 to 92 years {{with a mean age}} of 61. 8 years. The patients were divided into four groups according to their therapies. Forty-three patients who underwent surgery alone belonged to Group I, 78 treated by both preoperative chemotherapy and surgery to Group II, 18 treated by preoperative chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy to Group III, and Group IV included 29 patients treated by the rest of treatrnent patterns. The preoperative chemotherapy consisted of three main regimens. The first was composed of bleomycin and its derivative, <b>peplomycin,</b> the second of tegafur, and the third of combination chemotherapy of <b>peplomycin,</b> cisplatin and so on. The 5 -year cumulative survival rate of all cases was 64, 5 %, and those in Group I ～ IV were 60. 6 %, 64. 5 %, 79. 1 % and 46. 4 %, respectively. Regarding to the regimens, the combination chemotherapy was considered to give rise to the most favorable result. Comparing the cases which belonged to Stage I and II between Group I and II, the 5 -year cumulative survival rate was 66. 3 % in Group I and 74. 1 % in Group II, which revealed that the preoperative chemotherapy, when combined with surgery, had resulted in the better curability than surgery alone. ...|$|E

In addition, tumor markers including alpha fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and carcinoembryonic antigen were within normal limits. Then, extirpation of supraclavicular mass was performed and pathological diagnosis was made as pure seminoma. Evaluation of testicle by ultrasonography revealed a diffuse calcification. However, histological examination of biopsy specimen of testicle revealed no malignancy. The mass was finally diagnosed as extragonadal or "burned-out" pure seminoma.

Remarkable regression of the tumor was identified by computed tomographic scan after one course of chemotherapy and the surgical specimen revealed no viable tumors. The patient has been very active in her daily life without evidence of local recurrence or metastasis {{for more than one}} year. Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder generally is regarded as having a poor prognosis with 5 -year survival rates ranging from 7. 4 to 26 % and effective chemotherapy has not yet been established.

On rectal examination the prostate was rough, hard and stony and larger than a chicken's egg in size. The serum prostatic acid phosphatase and prostatic specific antigen levels were elevated. A computerized tomography scan disclosed a large mass in the pelvis. Both a needle biopsy of the prostate and resection of an inguinal mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Bone scintigram disclosed multiple metastases. Treatment with diethylstilbestrol diphosphate, etoposide, <b>peplomycin</b> and ifosfamide was effective, resulting in regressed intrapelvic masses and decreased serum prostatic acid phosphatase and prostatic specific antigen levels close to the normal limits.

First, we performed chemotherapy of modified PVB regimen (cisplatinum, vinblastine, <b>peplomycin)</b> prior to the right orchiectomy, because a tumor lump was palpable from the right testis to the lower abdominal mass. After three courses of modified PVB chemotherapy, beta-HCG, HCG and LDH values became within normal limits and all tumors were necrotic on the CT scan. Then, we performed the right orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy simultaneously. After operation, two courses of VIP chemotherapy (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatinum) were performed since viable cells {{in one of the}} obturator lymph nodes were pathologically noticed. The patient has been free of recurrence of the tumor for 15 months after the treatment.

Among these patients 2 underwent combined chemotherapy with bleomycin or <b>peplomycin.</b> Malignant cells disappeared posttherapeutically and in August 1992, after an average of 5 years and 9 months (varying from 4 years 6 months to 6 years 10 months), the patients were free of recurrences. The one patient on stage IV had extensive invasion of the abdominal wall, but still recovered completely. One patient on stage III underwent combined chemotherapy and hyperthermotherapy, but heating had obviously been insufficient. There was a residue of malignant cells after the treatment and we {{performed a}} penectomy. Regarding functional preservation of the penis a multidisciplinary therapy incorporating hyperthermotherapy can be expected to increase the curativity. This indicates that it could induce in an advanced case, where an operation would be difficult, complete remission. </p...|$|E
40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (HSPs) {{are regarded}} as the proteins most related {{to the development of}} thermotolerance. Recently, not only their role in thermotolerance, but also their role in resistance to anticancer agents is gathering concern. In this study, the kinetics of hsp 72 in HeLa cells treated with heating and/or anticancer agents were studied. Hsp 72 was immuno-stained by the indirect fluorescent technique using a monoclonal anti-hsp 72 antibody (Amer-sham). The staining pattern was observed and analyzed using a laser cytometer, ACAS 570 (Meridian). Hsp 72 was normally found in the cytoplasm at 37 ℃ and moved rapidly into the nucleus with heating at 43 ℃ for 2 hours. It then returned to the cytoplasm 4 to 6 hours after heating. The hsp 72 content reached a peak at 8 hours after heating. Hsp 72 was induced in all cells treated with cisplation, adriamycin, <b>peplomycin,</b> or etoposide for 48 hours. In the cells treated with both heating at 43 ℃ for 2 hours and these anticancer agents, hsp 72 induction was most suppressed by adriamycin. However, translocation of hsp 72 to the nucleus was specific for heating and was not affected by the anticancer agents. By laser cytometry the intracellular localization of hsp 72 and the changes of its content were simultaneously detected, Moreover, the change pattern of hsp 72 content measured by laser cytomtry coincided with that measured by the Western blotting procedure...|$|E
40|$|Prostate cancer: Considering the {{stagnation}} in chemotherapy {{of prostate}} cancer in recent years, the following experiments were carried out to determine their clinical value. Surgical specimens from 6 patients, 2 permanent cell lines (EB 33 and PC 93) originated from human prostate cancer and a tumor line serially transplanted in nude mice (PC-NCC) were subjected to chemosensitivity tests such as human tumor cloning assay (HTCA) and/or in vivo tumor growth curve experiments using nude mice. The possible chemosensitive drugs screened by using surgical specimens and PC-NCC tumor were cisplatinum (CDDP), bleomycin (BLM), 5 -FU, vincristine (VCR), adriamycin (ADM) and methotrexate (MTX). Most of these drugs were also judged as "effective" by HTCA using a permanent cell line. The minimal discrepancy among them {{may lead to the}} conclusion that an in vitro assay using a cell line can substitute for the assay using surgical specimens which can not be obtained frequently. Partly based on the data obtained a chemotherapy regimen, VPM-CisCF, consisting of VCR, <b>peplomycin,</b> MTX, CDDP, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and 5 -FU, was designed. The effectiveness of this regimen was demonstrated experimentally. Testis cancer: Two different lines of experiments were performed. A human testicular cancer serially transplanted in nude mice was repeatedly exposed to CDDP in vivo to obtain hyposensitivity to this drug. The synergistic effect of CDDP and VP- 16 was demonstrated in the tumor thus obtained. One of its mechanisms has been suggested by partial accumulation of cancer cells in the G 1 -S and G 2 -M phase in which CDDP exerts its potential effect. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} investigated the diverse levels of disruption caused by Zn(II) BLMs with different C-termini to DNA hairpins containing 5 ′-GC- 3 ′ and 5 ′-GT- 3 ′ binding sites. The {{results of this}} investigation indicated that both the DNA-binding site and the bleomycin C-termini {{have an impact on}} the final conformation of the aforementioned hairpins in the drug-target complexes, as suggested by the different sets of intramolecular NOEs displayed by both oligonucleotides when bound to each Zn(II) BLM. The NMR signals elicited by 1 H nuclei in the oligonucleotide bases and sugar moieties were also affected differently (shifted upfield or downfield in various patterns) depending on the BLM C-termini and the binding site in the oligonucleotides. The overall conclusion derived from the precedent research is that the spatial conformation of target DNA segments in DNA-Zn(II) BLM complexes could be forged by interactions between drug and DNA that are guided by the DNA binding site and the BLM C-termini. The present study focuses on the structural alterations exhibited by Zn(II) bleomycin-A 2, -B 2, -A 5 and Zn(II) <b>peplomycin</b> molecules upon binding to the previously studied hairpins. Our main goal is to determine if different spatial conformations of the drugs in their DNA-bound forms are found in drug-DNA complexes that differ in the oligonucleotide binding site and BLM C-termini. Evidence that suggest that each Zn(II) bleomycin is structurally affected depending these two factors, as indicated by different sets of intramolecular NOE connectivities between drug protons and diverse patterns of shifting of their 1 H-NMR signals, is provided...|$|E
40|$|To analyse the {{mechanism}} by which a bleomycin derivative, <b>peplomycin</b> (PLM) induces pulmonary fibrosis, we investigated differentiation of rat pulmonary fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (MF). In intraperitoneally PLM (5 mg/kg/day) -injected rats, the peripheries of lungs adjacent to the pleura revealed advanced fibrosis with {{a small number of}} α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) -positive MF, which ultrastructurally possessed abundant microfilaments and cellular organelles. In the fibrotic tissue, the expression of α-SMA-mRNA was detected by in situ reverse transcription-polymerase (RT‐PCR). The message was strong just after a 2 -week administration of PLM then decreased thereafter, although fibrosis advanced. When pulmonary fibroblasts were separated from saline-injected rats (N-Fib) and cultivated for 7 days in the presence of 5 mg/mL PLM, α-SMA protein was weakly expressed, while the majority of pulmonary fibroblasts separated from PLM-injected rats (P-Fib) became positive for α-SMA in 7 -day cultivation and the expression of α-SMA in P-Fib was strongly increased by cultivation in the presence of PLM and transforming growth factor-β (TGF‐β), but not basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF), although the cell proliferation was most strongly enhanced by bFGF and only slightly by PLM and TGF-β. The α-SMA-positive cells expressed vimentin, but only weakly expressed desmin. Additionally, P-Fib generated larger amounts of TGF-β and bFGF than were generated by N-Fib. These results indicate that PLM induces pulmonary fibrosis by differentiating fibroblasts to α-SMA-positive MF, and that bFGF and TGF-β play each critical role in the different phases of PLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inducing fibroblast proliferation and transformation, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo chemosensitivity {{test for}} bladder cancer, using the human bladder cancer xenografts (BT- 8 and BT- 11 strains) in nude mice (BALB/c) and the BBN-BT- 1 bladder cancer strain in BALB/c hetero-mouse which was induced by peroral long-period {{administration}} of N-butyl-N-(4 -hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine and transplantable into the subcutaneous of mouse, were examined especially {{in respect to}} the difference of chemosensitivity between young and old straining and the prospective propriety for clinical application. The subrenal capsule assay (SRC), was also compared with subcutaneous transplantation. Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) and 5 -FU were effective for all three strains and adriamycin and cyclophosphamide were effective for the BT- 8 and BT- 11 strains. Bleomycin, <b>peplomycin</b> and vinca alkaloids were more effective for the BT- 11 strain than the BT- 8 strain. The chemosensitivity of several anti-cancer drugs for the young BT- 8 and BT- 11 strains was almost {{equal to that of}} the old. A 68 -year-old male with bladder cancer metastasized to lung and lymph nodes, whose primary tumor was transplanted to mice and established as the BT- 11 strain in 1980, was treated with the VPM-CisCF combination chemotherapy which was evaluated as an effective therapy for this strain experimentally, and responded well to this therapy. As in this case, the results of nude mice experiments are valuable in clinical application. The chemosensitivity test in vivo for individual primary tumors should be done by SRC, and in SRC nude mice should be used instead of conventional mice until immunoreactive rejection can be prevented...|$|E
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{clinical}} studies for intravesical instillation chemotherapy of <b>peplomycin</b> (PEP) were carried out, one {{to evaluate the}} direct antitumor activity in superficial bladder cancer (study I), {{and the other to}} evaluate the prophylactic effect on recurrence of bladder cancer after transurethral resection (study II). In study I, 22 patients with low stage bladder cancer were entered, and 16 of them were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Twelve patients were treated twice a week with intravesical instillation of 20 mg of PEP/ 20 ml of saline for 4 weeks. Four patients were treated in the same way with 40 mg of PEP/ 20 ml of saline. Among the patients treated with 20 mg of PEP, two showed complete remission and one showed partial remission. Of the patients treated with 40 mg of PEP, one showed partial remission. Thus, the overall response rate was 25 %. The tumors of the two complete responders were so tiny that they might have been damaged mechanically by the biopsy forceps. Therefore, we considered that the instillation chemotherapy of PEP at a dose of 20 or 40 mg/ 20 ml of saline had little effect on superficial bladder cancer. In study II, we performed a randomized trial designed to compare the recurrence rate after transurethral resection (TUR) alone with that after TUR followed by prophylactic instillation of PEP. Ninety-four patients newly diagnosed as having low stage bladder cancer were entered in the study. They were divided into three groups after TUR. Group A consisted of 38 patients who were treated with weekly instillation of 20 mg of PEP/ 20 ml of saline for 8 weeks. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
