The first building was the Western <b>Slab</b> <b>Mill.</b> Later buildings were added that included the Second <b>Slab</b> <b>Mill</b> opening in c.1830, a foundry, engineering facilities, a quarry railway and several slate mills. There are several other buildings on the site.|$|R
25|$|A slab is {{a length}} of metal that is {{rectangular}} in cross-section. It is created directly by continuous casting or indirectly by rolling an ingot on a <b>slabbing</b> <b>mill.</b> <b>Slabs</b> are usually further processed via flat rolling, skelping, and pipe rolling. Common final products include sheet metal, plates, strip metal, pipes, and tubes.|$|R

"Shaft smoothers" [...] {{were shaped}} stones {{which could be}} {{distinguished}} by abraded grooves occurring on one or more surfaces. 2 complete specimens were analyzed, both made of a pumice material, one was rectangular while the other was subrectangular with rounded edges. On the broadest edge of the second stone, there was a main groove that ran {{the full length of}} the edge. 5 specimens classified as [...] "grooved stone" [...] were found, one complete specimen and four fragments. The complete stone had an irregular shape of a pumice material with three shallow grooves. 8 nearly complete specimens and 262 fragments were classified as [...] "milling stones". These specimens were further divided into two categories: block and <b>slab</b> <b>milling</b> stones. One of the two nearly complete block milling stones, made of a quartzite material, was oval in shape with a circular depression, while the other block milling stone had no depression and had a rectangular shape. The six nearly complete <b>slab</b> <b>milling</b> stones were made of mainly mica schist, schist, conglomerate, gneiss, and sandstone. Traces of red and black pigments could be found on the sides and center of two nearly complete sab milling stones respectively.|$|R

40|$|Hardened {{underground}} {{structures are}} purposely constructed beneath the ground surface for additional protection. The protection and sustainability {{of such a}} structure {{is provided by the}} soil overburden, supported by the structure's roof slab, also called a <b>primary</b> <b>slab.</b> The soil overburden usually contains one or more layers of protective reinforced concrete slabs, defined as secondary slabs. Hardened sub-surface structures can experience a degree of damage from sub-surface explosions, caused by the detonation of airborne weapons at variable depths within the soil overburden layer. The research objective was to evaluate the degree to which material and geometric parameters influenced the magnitude of groundshock loading and hence the severity of damage to sub-surface positioned reinforced concrete slabs. The work was of an experimental nature, performed within a purposely built test cell. The experimental set-up involved positioning cylindrical charges within the soil overburden at variable standoffs from an initially positioned steel plate, then from a <b>primary</b> <b>slab,</b> which was subjected to a series of cumulative loadings. The structural response of both the steel plate and a reinforced concrete slab were evaluated using an energy balance procedure. A parametric study was performed, determining the influence each geometric parameter had to the magnitude of groundshock loading. The variability of data associated with the material parameters was analysed and compared to the published literature. Numerical simulations were performed {{at the end of the}} experimental stage (using the non-linear finite element programme AUTODYN 21)) to investigate phenomena that could not be investigated experimentally. A visual damage assessment in the form of a crack pattern analysis and chronological order of occurring mechanisms upon reinforced concrete slabs was performed. The severity of damage to the <b>primary</b> <b>slabs</b> was then associated with the cumulative load impulse history. The research yielded the following conclusions: I. An idealised half sine-wave load distribution approximated the pressure-time history profiles recorded by pressure gauges. 2. The steel plate and one concrete slab (for which conclusive data was obtained) responded impulsively to groundshock loading. 3. The magnitude of groundshock loading was most sensitive to a change in the charge standoff. 4. The reduction in the soil overburden above the top face of a secondary slab did not influence the groundshock loading induced into a <b>primary</b> <b>slab.</b> 5. The effect of the propagating groundshock wave overrode any initial form of soil compaction between the charge and target. This was due to the significantly high stresses induced into the soil, which were well above the initial insitu stresses. 6. Internal weakening of a <b>primary</b> <b>slab,</b> which was unidentifiable from the external damage, caused significant loss in structural strength and stiffness.

This paper presents geometric models of the machined workpiece in order to predict the surface microstructures of the peripherally milled flank structures as well as the surface resulting from the <b>slab</b> <b>milling</b> process with end-mills. After a brief explanation of the time domain simulation system used to calculate the tool vibration patterns, a surface model is presented which is able to predict the roughness depending on the spindle speed.

5000|$|VÖEST assets {{became the}} {{principal}} Austrian {{recipient of the}} Marshall Plan aid but access to American cash came only after a protracted political battle within Austrian establishment. Geoffrey Keyes had to recruit steel expert William E. Brewster to sort through the Austrian proposals. Brewster supported the Austrian four-year plan but its key opponent Franz Nemchak called it [...] "a colossal stupidity" [...] and demanded a halt on VÖEST program. The controversy spilled into the U. S. Senate, causing delays in Marshall Plan financing for VÖEST. VÖEST received its new <b>slabbing</b> <b>mill</b> but the new hot strip mill was delayed by the opposition of the Pentagon, which feared that VÖEST product would be sold to the Soviet bloc. The Pentagon removed their objections in January 1952, conforming to the consensus of other U. S. agencies. The hot and cold strip mills were, at last, put into operation in 1953.

Changes and modernisation at Scunthorpe were planned under several phases for Scunthorpe, under a scheme known as the [...] "Anchor Project", which had its basis in an £80 million proposal made by the Appleby-Frodingham company in 1966 to the regulating Iron and Steel Board for LD converter conversion with a capacity of around 2 million tons pa, plus a 2 million ton pa <b>slab</b> <b>mill</b> and investment increasing light plate production to 1 million tons pa; foreign ore would {{also be used to}} increase productivity. When accepted by BSC in 1969 the expanded project had a cost of £130 million (rising to £230 million by 1971), and included three 300 ton LD converters, as well as a continuous plate mill later rejected, and other improvements. During the formulation of the plan the option of relocating the Scunthorpe-based steel production to a coastal site (i.e. Port of Immingham) had been considered but rejected. Work on the 1000 acre former ore field site south and east of the older works began in early 1970. The new Anchor works including steelmaking, continuous casting and rolling mills was officially opened in 1974 by Queen Elizabeth II.|$|R

Two German museums turned it down as too expensive. A year later at the Hamburg Fossil and Mineral Fair in December 2006, the dealer asked Norwegian vertebrate palaeontologist Jørn Hurum, who had done some previous deals, to discuss something privately. The dealer showed Hurum three high resolution colour photographs of the fossil and told him that the asking price was $1 million. Hurum knew that it was a primate and according to Tudge's book [...] "was fast concluding that the specimen he was looking at {{could be one of the}} holy grails of science— the 'missing link' from the crucial time period." [...] He asked for time until after Christmas to organise funding to pay for the specimen and ensure that it had been legally collected, had an export permit and would be legitimately available for study. His first choice was the Natural History Museum of Oslo, but it was beyond their means and he began to think of other museums with sponsors available. He persuaded the Oslo museum to make half the funding available with the remainder to be paid only after X-ray scans proved conclusively that it was not a fake, a process which took several months. He put together a team including leading German experts on the Messel fossils, ensuring international ownership.|$|R

Trace element normalized patterns of Ms-bearing amphibolites are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) and evidence variable trace element transfer from the Proto-Caribbean subducting slab to the mantle wedge. Ms-bearing trondhjemites show LREE enrichment and HREE depletion and have geochemical features similar to adakites, including SiO 2 > 56 wt. %, high Na 2 O contents (5. 5 - 9. 0 wt. %) and high Sr/Y (16 - 644). We consider that the trondhjemites represent primary and natural melts formed by deep partial melting of the subducting slab which did not significantly react with the mantle wedge before intrusion in the subduction channel. The Ms-bearing trondhjemites show different geochemical and petrological signatures compared with the Ms-free tonalites-trondhjemites from Sierra del Convent, that are interpreted as <b>primary</b> <b>slab</b> melts.

40|$|The Steel <b>Mill</b> <b>Slab</b> Problem is an {{optimization}} benchmark {{that has}} been studied {{for a long time}} in the constraint-programming community but was only solved eciently in the two last years. Gargani and Refalo solved the problem using Large Neighborhood Search and Van Hentenryck and Michel made use of constraint programming with an improved symmetry breaking scheme. In the rst part of this paper, we build on those approaches, present improvements of those two techniques, and study how the problem can be tackled by Constraint-Based Local Search. As a result, the classical instances of CSPLib can now be solved in less than 50 ms. To improve our understanding of this problem, we also introduce a new set of harder instances, which highlight the strengths and the weaknesses of the various approaches. In a second part of the paper, we present a variation of the Steel <b>Mill</b> <b>Slab</b> Problem whose aim is to minimize the number of slabs.
