5|$|In 1984, the UK Ministry of Defence began {{studies for}} a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU). The update to GR4 standard, {{approved}} in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on {{lessons learned from}} the GR1's performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in <b>Phase</b> <b>B.</b>|$|E
5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with {{the integration of the}} Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in <b>Phase</b> <b>B.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} RW model cannot {{account for}} this effect. But the revised model can: In <b>Phase</b> 2, stimulus <b>B</b> is indirectly activated through within-compound-association with A. But instead of a positive learning parameter (usually called alpha) when physically present, during <b>Phase</b> 2, <b>B</b> has a negative learning parameter. Thus during the second <b>phase,</b> <b>B's</b> associative strength declines whereas A's value increases because of its positive learning parameter.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{controversial}} situation has arisen that orthogonal B and tilted <b>B</b> <b>phases</b> have been {{claimed to be}} miscible, while the analogous A and C phases are immiscible, {{and this has been}} a constant problem in phase assignment and identification. Recently, however, we have shown that two compounds that separately exhibit tilted <b>B</b> <b>phases</b> can show an orthogonal <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> in binary mixtures containing approximately 50 % of each component. Further to this, we investigated the mode of the progression with changing composition from one B modification to the other in various binary mixtures. For example, in a miscibility study involving TBBA and n-hexyl 4 '-ndodecyloxy-biphenyl- 4 -carboxylate, both of which exhibit tilted <b>B</b> <b>phases,</b> we found that mixtures containing approximately 50 % of each component exhibited an orthogonal <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> which then gave a transition to a tilted <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> on cooling. We also investigated various binary mixtures of which one component exhibited an orthogonal <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> and the other a tilted <b>B</b> <b>phase.</b> These miscibility studies invariably showed very small percentage composition ranges in which the two <b>B</b> <b>phases</b> appeared to be immiscible. Finally, we synthesised a pure ester that we believe exhibits an orthogonal B to a tilted <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> change. This type of phase change has also been observed by other workers in Schiff's bases such as N- 4 -n-heptyloxybenzylidene- 4 -n-pentylaniline. Thus, the evidence clearly directs us to reassign the tilted <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> as the smectic H phase...|$|R

The religious association of the dragon with the wolf or the lion is first found around the year 1120 BC, on a stela of Nebuchadnezzar I, where an exact representation of the symbol of the Dacian dragon is found in the fourth quarter. This indicates that the Dacian draco stems from the art of Asia Minor where the religious-military symbology of dragon extended both eastward to the Indo-Iranians and westward to the Thraco-Cimmeriano-Getians/Dacians.|$|E

2500|$|In Europe, Asia, Africa {{and most}} other locations, single phase is common for {{residential}} and small commercial customers. Single phase distribution is less-expensive, because one set of transformers in a substation normally serve a large area with relatively high voltages (usually 230 V) and no local transformers. These have a simple metering equation: Watts = volts x amps, with volts measured from the neutral to the phase wire. In the United States, Canada, and parts of Central and South America similar customers are normally served by three-wire single phase. [...] Three-wire single-phase requires local transformers, as few as one per ten residences, but provides lower, safer voltages at the socket (usually 120 V), and provides two voltages to customers: neutral to phase (usually 120 V), and phase to phase (usually 240 V). [...] Additionally, three-wire customers normally have neutral wired to the zero side of the generator's windings, which gives earthing {{that can be easily}} measured to be safe. These meters have a metering equation of Watts = 0.5 x volts x (amps of phase A - amps of <b>phase</b> <b>B),</b> with volts measured between the phase wires.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fe 2 B {{is a kind}} {{of typical}} {{intermetallic}} compound, which has good corrosion resistance in molten zinc. However, the fatal intrinsic brittleness limits its further application in the Hot-Dip Galvanizing Industry. Therefore, it is worthwhile to improve the toughness of Fe 2 <b>B</b> <b>phase.</b> In this study, the fracture toughness property of Fe 2 <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> with and without micro-addition chromium is investigated. In comparison with pure Fe 2 <b>B</b> <b>phase,</b> the intrinsic brittleness of Fe 2 <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> with chromium is lower. In addition, the valence electron structure of Fe 2 B containing various chromium content is calculated by the method of bond length difference (BLD).

40|$|We {{construct}} an exactly soluble spin-$\frac{ 1 } 2 $ model on a honeycomb lattice, {{which is a}} generalization of Kitaev model. The topological phases of the system are analyzed by study of the ground state sector of this model, the vortex-free states. Basically, there are two phases, A <b>phase</b> and <b>B</b> <b>phase.</b> The behaviors of both A and <b>B</b> <b>phases</b> may be studied by mapping the ground state sector into a general p-wave paired states of spinless fermions with tunable pairing parameters on a square lattice. In this p-wave paired state theory, the A phase is shown to be the strong paired phase, an insulating <b>phase.</b> The <b>B</b> <b>phase</b> may be either gapped or gapless determined by the generalized inversion symmetry is broken or not. The gapped B is the weak pairing phase described by either the Moore-Read Pfaffian state of the spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian state of holes depending on {{the sign of the}} next nearest neighbor hopping amplitude. A phase transition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states are found in the gapped <b>B</b> <b>phase.</b> Furthermore, we show that there is a hidden SU(2) gauge symmetry in our model.

ZnS is wide-gap semiconductor that is attractive material due to the polymorphic structural transformation and it is suitable semiconductor for applications in infrared optics, ultraviolet laser devices, electronic image display, high-density optical memory, solar cell etc. The goal is to evaluate mechanical and electrical properties of ZnS dunder pressure. Design/methodology/approach: We report ab-initio calculations of lattice constants, bulk modulus and elastic constants of the B 1 (rocksalt), B 3 (zincblende) and B 4 (wurtzite) structures of ZnS. Ab-initio calculations are based on the density functional theory (DFT) within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation potential.
