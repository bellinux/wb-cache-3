40|$|The {{views of}} {{teachers}} and directors in four Christian preschools and four Buddhist preschools are examined in this qualitative study of early childhood education in Japan. In Christian preschools, the guiding principle was that each child was a precious gift of God. This belief resulted in a play-oriented curriculum that maximized the choices available to children. Teachers also attempted to encourage childrens creativity {{and their ability to}} formulate thoughts and express them to others. A particular focus was helping children appreciate each other as individuals and learn to form relationships based upon that appreciation. In Buddhist preschools, the curriculum was designed to strengthen childrens virtue, intellect, and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> <b>Activities</b> were teacher structured, with an emphasis on attaining literacy and numeracy skills. Lessons were delivered in a whole group context, with an emphasis on absorbing content rather than encouraging personal exploration and expression. The clear implications of these different religious perspectives suggest that similar analyses be undertaken in the United States, where very little research has been conducted on church-based preschools...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the current}} study was to examine whether patient {{perceptions}} of autonomy support from the treatment team in a vocational rehabilitation program will be associated with change (increase) in need satisfaction, autonomous motivation, perceived competence, <b>well-being,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and return to work (RTW), and whether the self-determination theory (SDT) Model of Health Behavior will provide adequate fit to the data. Method: A total of 90 participants were enrolled in a longitudinal study and completed measures at four time points over 15 months. Results: Participants reported increases in all variables, and in general these changes were maintained at six weeks post-rehabilitation and at 15 months post-baseline. As well, the SDT Model of Health Behavior provided adequate fit to the data. Conclusions: These results underscore the importance of health care practitioners’ providing support for their patients’ autonomy, competence, and relatedness to improve <b>well-being,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and RTW in the context of vocational rehabilitation. Implications for Rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation that emphasizes physical activity is associated with increases in patients’ <b>well-being,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and return to work (RTW). It is important for health care practitioners to provide support for their patients’ autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the context of vocational rehabilitation, as doing so is associated with increases in patients’ autonomous motivation, perceived competence, and psychosocial outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Programmes {{based on}} the World Health Organization’s Health Promoting Schools {{framework}} (HPS) have been implemented in several countries but for evidence-based policy-making more research is required to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} HPS approach. Methods We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial. The units of randomisation were primary school classes recruited in May 2010. Eligible participants were Year 3 primary school classes in Lower Austria that had not participated in a similar programme during the last two years. After baseline assessment in September 2010, 53 classes from 45 primary schools in Lower Austria were randomly assigned to an intervention (n[*]=[*] 26 classes, 432 children) or waiting control arm (n[*]=[*] 27 classes, 493 children aged 8. 7  years +/- 4  months). Over the course of 1. 5 academic years, participating teachers received on-the-job training (20  h) and two workshops (8  h) to promote health related behaviour in students such as physical activity during the school day and {{to improve the quality of}} regular physical education classes. We assessed 15 outcomes grouped into five categories: Emotional and Social Experience in School, <b>Physical</b> <b>Activity,</b> <b>Well-being,</b> and Attention Performance measured by validated and standardised questionnaire and Motor Skills measured by validated and standardised motoric and coordination tests in the school gym. The primary outcome was Classroom Climate and part of the outcomecategory Emotional and Social Experience in School. The final assessment took place in April 2012. All assessors were blinded to the allocation of classes. Multilevel growth modelling was used to investigate programme effectiveness. Results We could not detect any statistically significant differences between groups for the outcomecategories Emotional and Social Experience in school (p[*]=[*] 0. 22 to 0. 78), <b>Physical</b> <b>Activity,</b> <b>Well-being,</b> and Attention Performance. Significant differences between groups were limited to the outcomecategory Motor Skills (Complex Reaction Ability, Spatial Orientation Skills, Coordination with Precision) which were higher in the intervention group (P[*]<[*]. 05). Conclusions Despite small statistically significant differences in Motor Skills, our study could not detect any clinically relevant improvements in the Emotional and Social Experience at School (including the primary outcome ClassroomClimate), <b>Physical</b> <b>Activity,</b> <b>Well-being,</b> Motor Skills and Attention Performance of students.

Therefore, the possible associations of <b>well-being</b> with <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and biomarkers of somatic health were studied in a sample of Swedish active seniors to determine the strength of these associations. Methods: Three hundred and eighty-nine community-dwelling senior citizens (127  men and 262  women) of mean age 74 ± 5  years were recruited for this cross-sectional population study. Serum samples were analyzed for lipoproteins and markers of inflammation. The Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) index was used to measure subjective <b>well-being.</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>activity</b> was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire modified for the elderly. Results: More than 50 % of men and women rated their physical activity as high; in the women, {{there was a significant difference}} between the age groups (younger and older than the median age [median = 74. 1 years], respectively). The mean PGWB index indicates a high degree of subjective well-being in this group of Swedish seniors. Of the PGWB subdimensions, general health had the strongest positive relationship with physical activity (r 2 = 5. 4 %). for the subdimensions of depressed mood, positive well-being, vitality, and PGWB index, physical activity had an r 2  ≤ 4 %, while the contributions of sex, age, and biomarkers were minor. Conclusion: We have estimated the contribution of physical activity to the variance of subjective well-being in active seniors. Physical activity appears to play a greater role as a determinant of subjective well-being than do biomarkers of somatic health, especially in females, but most of the variance remained unaccounted for by the studied variables.

40|$|Using a {{qualitative}} approach, {{the dimensions of}} subjective well-being of active older adults were outlined and ways identified through which they might be influenced by participation in physical activities. One-to-one and group interviews were used to collect the data. Using cross-case analysis, 17 main themes were identified. The following main dimensions emerged: developmental, material, physical, mental, and social well-being. The findings indicated that physical activity influences all dimensions of the subjective well-being of older adults, {{with the exception of}} material <b>well-being.</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>activity</b> appears to contribute to the mental health of older adults through maintenance of a busy and active life, mental alertness, positive attitude toward life and avoidance of stress, negative function, and isolation.

40|$|Functional bowel {{disorders}} such as irritable bowel syndrome {{are commonly}} experienced within the population, and have an adverse impact on emotions, <b>physical</b> <b>well-being,</b> social <b>activity,</b> and occupational output. Adherence to a restricted diet can reduce symptoms, which in turn leads to increased {{quality of life and}} well-being. The aim of this review was to assess the extent to which predictors of dietary adherence have been considered in studies relating to functional bowel disorders and following a restricted diet. This was done firstly by examining such studies which contained a measure or indicator of adherence, and then by examining predictors of adherence within and between studies. A search of PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was performed during July 2014, with the search criteria including relevant terms such as gastrointestinal disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, diet, and adherence. Of an initial 7927 papers, 39 were suitable for inclusion. Fourteen of the 39 studies included had a structured measure or indicator of dietary adherence, and the remaining 25 mentioned adherence without any structured levels of adherence. There was little investigation into the predictors of adherence, with symptom relief or induction being the primary goal of most of the studies. This review indicates that predictors of dietary adherence are rarely considered in research regarding functional bowel disorders. Further investigation is needed into the variables which contribute to rates of adherence to restricted diets, and more rigorous research is needed to characterise those individuals most likely to be non-adherent. Such research is necessary to ensure that people with these conditions can be provided with appropriate support and interventions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between coping, optimism, psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> The effectiveness of the different coping strategies and the role of optimism were investigated by analyzing how they predicted psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Altogether 136 municipal employees participated in a questionnaire study. The results showed that the most adaptive or effective coping strategy concerning psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> was acceptance, which can be classified as engagement coping. Ineffective strategies regarding psychological well-being included disengagement coping strategies such as sub- stance use, behavioral disengagement and self-blame. An ineffective strategy regarding physiological well-being was denial, which can be classified as a disengagement strategy. Optimism correlated significantly with both psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> However, when all the variables in the model were included in the regression analysis, optimism explained additional variance in <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> but not in psychological well-being...|$|R

Participants of the intervention condition received a four-month physical activity coaching based on the Self-Determination Theory. The coaching was limited to five individual contact moments with a bachelor in kinesiology specializing in health-related physical activity counseling. Self-reports on various intensities of physical activity and <b>physical</b> and psychological <b>well-being</b> were completed before (i. e. pre-test), immediately after (i. e. post-test) and one year after (i. e. follow-up-test) the intervention.

Purpose The degree to which conscientiousness contributes to well-being in Chinese cancer survivors and the mechanisms through which conscientiousness is associated with well-being remain unclear. Based on Lent’s restorative well-being model [1], the current study tested a mediation model of the contribution of conscientiousness, positive reappraisal, and hopelessness to fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> {{in a sample of}} 238 Chinese cancer survivors. Method Participants completed self-report questionnaires. Path analysis was used to analyze the linear relationships between the variables. Results The empirical model supported the mediator roles of positive reappraisal and hopelessness. Specifically, the results indicated that conscientiousness was first associated with positive reappraisal, which in turn was associated with decreased hopelessness, resulting in decreased FCR and improved <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> In addition, the results showed that conscientiousness was associated with decreased hopelessness, which was then associated with decreased FCR and greater <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Conclusion Conscientiousness confers benefits on FCR and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being</b> through the mechanisms of positive reappraisal and decreased hopelessness...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the long-term and mediation effects of a need-supportive physical activity program on <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>well-being.</b> Methods: Sedentary employees (n = 92) {{of the university of}} Leuven received four months of physical activity coaching, based on the self-determination theory, by coaches with a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology who are specializing in health-related physical activity (n = 30). The coaching program consisted of a limited number of individual contact moments (i. e. an intake session, three follow-up contacts and an outtake session), either face-to-face, by phone or by e-mail. Self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>well-being,</b> social support, self-efficacy and autonomous motivation were assessed in the coaching group (n = 92) and a control group (n = 34) at three moments: before the intervention (i. e. pre-test), after the intervention (i. e. post-test) and one year after pre-test measurements (i. e. follow-up-test). Results: Results revealed significant 3 (time) x 2 (group) interaction effects on strenuous and total physical activity. Moreover, whereas the control group remained stable from pre- to post-test, the coaching group increased significantly in moderate, strenuous and total physical activity. Additionally, the coaching group increased significantly in mild, moderate, strenuous and total physical activity from pre- to follow-up-test, whereas the control group did not change. Concerning well-being, significant 3 (time) x 2 (group) interaction effects were found on <b>physical</b> and general <b>well-being.</b> Furthermore, the coaching group increased significantly in <b>physical</b> and general <b>well-being</b> from pre- to post-test, while no changes emerged in the control group. No significant 2 (time) x 2 (group) interaction effects from pre to follow-up were identified. Bootstrapping analyses indicated that self-efficacy and autonomous motivation significantly mediated the intervention effect on physical activity from pre- to post-test, while social support significantly mediated the long-term effect. Furthermore, results showed that strenuous and total physical activity mediated the intervention effect on <b>physical</b> and general <b>well-being,</b> from pre to post as well as from pre to follow-up. Additionally, long-term changes in psychological well-being were mediated by changes in total physical activity. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the long-term effectiveness of a need-supportive physical activity program that might be efficient at community level. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the relation between coping strategies of inmates and their psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> General affective states such as optimism were related to both psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Moreover, inmates who experienced specific negative emotions such as regret, anxiety, and sadness reported more psychological and physical complaints. The way in which inmates coped with these negative emotions was also important. Inmates who used an active emotion-focused coping strategy were in better health than inmates inclined to keep their negative feelings to themselves. Emotion-focused coping by sharing negative emotions with people in one's social network can help to increase both psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>well-being.</b> Engaging in emotion management in a more cognitive way, by emphasizing positive aspects of the situation, can help to reduce the intensity of negative emotions. Possible research and policy implications of these results are discussed. © 2007 American Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology...|$|R
