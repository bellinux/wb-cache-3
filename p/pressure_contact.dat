The presented work deals {{with the results of}} adapted TLM measurement {{in order to determine the}} practical limitation of <b>pressure</b> <b>contacts</b> on cell and module level in regard to the solar cell rear side. The <b>pressure</b> <b>contacts</b> between interconnection ribbon and silver (Ag) show very low contact resistances in contrast to the resistance for <b>pressure</b> <b>contacts</b> to the aluminum (Al) rear side which were found to be at least one magnitude higher. Degradation tests verify that on module level these <b>pressure</b> <b>contacts</b> are not sufficient for reliable cell interconnection, neither to Al nor Ag.

50|$|A {{common use}} of {{dielectric}} grease is in high-voltage connections associated with gasoline engine spark plugs. The grease {{is applied to}} the rubber boot of the plug wire. This helps the rubber boot slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to seal the rubber boot, {{while at the same time}} preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally, spark plugs are located in areas of high temperature and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected. It can be applied to the actual contact as well, because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film. Doing so on such high <b>pressure</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces between different metals has the advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration from galvanic corrosion.|$|E
50|$|Additional to the {{traditional}} screw contacts the electrical connection between the module {{and other parts of}} the power electronic system can also be achieved by pin contacts (soldered onto a PCB), press-fit contacts pressed into PCB vias, spring contacts that inherently press on contact areas of a PCB or by pure <b>pressure</b> <b>contact</b> where corrosion-proof surface areas are directly pressed together.Press-fit pins achieve a very high reliability and ease the mounting process without the need for soldering. Compared to press-fit connections, spring contacts have the benefit of allowing easy and non-destructive removal of the connection several times, as for inspection or replacement of an module, for instance. Both contact types have rather limited current-carrying capability due to their comparatively low cross-sectional area and small contact surface. Therefore, modules often contain multiple pins or springs for each of the electrical power connections.|$|E

We performed a {{finite element analysis}} investigating the optimal reorientation of the acetabulum in PAO surgery based on simulated joint <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>contact</b> areas using patient specific cartilage model. Furthermore we investigated the influences of using patient specific cartilage model or constant thickness cartilage model on the biomechanical simulation results. Ten specimens with hip dysplasia were used in this study. Image data were available from CT arthrography studies. Bone models were reconstructed. Mesh models for the patient specific cartilage were defined and subsequently loaded under previously reported boundary and loading conditions. Peak <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>contact</b> areas were estimated in the original position. Afterwards we used a validated preoperative planning software to change the acetabular inclination by an increment of 5 ° and measured the lateral center edge angle (LCE) at each reorientation position. The position with the largest contact area and the lowest peak <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was defined as the}} optimal position. In order to investigate the influence of using patient specific cartilage model or constant thickness cartilage model on the biomechanical simulation results, the same procedure was repeated with the same bone models but with a cartilage mesh of constant thickness. Comparison of the peak <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> and the <b>contact</b> areas between these two different cartilage models showed that good correlation between these two cartilage models for peak <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> (r = 0. 634 ∈ [0. 6, 0. 8], p 0. 8, p < 0. 001).

Our study is the first study comparing peak <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>contact</b> areas between patient specific and constant thickness cartilage models during PAO planning.

40|$|AbstractIn {{pavement}} engineering a crude uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> over {{a circular}} contact area {{is used to}} generate key strains for an analytical design method. The use of a more advanced tyre <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement device {{has led to a}} situation where there is more information that is available to generate a more accurate uniform representation of <b>contact</b> <b>pressure.</b> This measurement device also offers the ability to measure non-uniform 3 -D tyre <b>contact</b> <b>pressure.</b> That is to say the vertical, transverse and longitudinal components of pressure generated by a tyre in contact with a pavement. A comparison of the key strains generated by this improved uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representation and the measured 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> is of great interest. Of course a tyre does not display the same <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> for different combinations of axle loading and inflation pressure. The combination of these two factors greatly affects the nature of the <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> observed. A finite element mesh of a 3 -layer thin pavement structure was created in CAPA- 3 D. This was used to model the uniform and 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representations of a wide based tyre. This was done for 3 inflation pressures and 3 tyre loads. The inflation pressures were for a recommended inflation pressure and then plus and minus 200 kPa. The tyre loading was for a maximum European axle loading and then greater and lower than this value. This gave a good spread of conditions that are relevant to the tyre operating conditions. The key strains at different locations in the pavement relevant to the major distresses of a pavement were assessed. The main distress mechanisms being top down cracking, asphalt cracking/rutting, traditional bottom up cracking and subgrade rutting. These gave a good spread of possible distresses that tyre <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> can contribute to. The results showed that there was a large effect on surface strains caused by 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> in comparison to uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> for all combinations of inflation pressure and tyre loading. The difference between the two <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representations diminished with depth in the pavement. Therefore, it was clear that 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> has an effect on the distress of a pavement surface. This means to accurately understand the deterioration of a pavement surface, 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> must be considered. In the case of the other distresses the uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> generated greater strains and would give a conservative pavement design. Both methods generated greatly different key strains depending on the combination of inflation pressure and tyre loading. If a complex highly accurate analysis is required, then a fully 3 -D representation in combination with finite element analysis is the best option. However, if a more routine analysis is required then the improved uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representation could be used with a simple modelling tool (e. g. BISAR) to get good results for a traditional analytical design...|$|R

A finite-element analysis {{model of a}} seat is developed in the LS-DYNA platform, where the material model is formulated {{on the basis of}} reported stress-strain properties of different polyurethane materials. The seat model is coupled with the finite-element models of the occupant based on the well-established frontal crash anthropomorphic test devices (ATD). The validity of the seat model is initially illustrated through simulation of a compression test model, which suggested that the hyperelastic stress-strain responses of the PUF materials can be reliably estimated using the explicit dynamic finite element platform, LS-DYNA®. The validity of the coupled seat-ATD model is also illustrated through comparisons of the <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>contact</b> area responses with the reported measured data. It is shown that the coupled occupant-seat finite element model can provide reasonable good predictions of the interface <b>pressure</b> and <b>contact</b> area, which have been correlated with occupant’s sensation of comfort.
