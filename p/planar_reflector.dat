The subjected Power Plant is designed with "Linear Fresnel Reflectors". The astronomic formulas are developed to focus the sunrays on a receiver continuously with the single axis orientation of multiple <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors.</b> Rotation axis of the <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors</b> are placed North / South direction. By means of this study {{it is possible to}} determine the exact position of the sunrays on the receiver that is reflected from the <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors.</b> Both conditions for the horizontal and inclined placement of the power plant are studied separately. Rotation angles are used by evaluating the formulas. Considering changing sun position, it is shown that changes in the rotation angle for all of the <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors</b> are equal for continuous focusing. By means of this once the system is adjusted it can be controlled with a single motor for entire year. With the help of the equations evaluated during the study a small model is projected. For scaling the model the parabola is chosen from the Fresnel design principle. Then the reflector amount, reflector widths and distance between their rotation axes have been determined.

A traditional installation on a horizontal surface results in largely spaced rows of modules with a relatively low tilt angle.

The “Aleph” (Amélioration de l'Efficacité Photovoltaïque) project aims to define clear rules for optimal settings of systems of PV rows with fixed inter-row <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors</b> in a given location and under a given climate.

40|$|Acoustic scene {{reconstruction}} is {{a process}} that aims to infer characteristics of the environment from acoustic measurements. We investigate the problem of locating <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors</b> in rooms, such as walls and furniture, from signals obtained using distributed microphones. Specifically, localization of multiple two- dimensional (2 -D) reflectors is achieved by estimation of the time of arrival (TOA) of reflected signals by analysis of acoustic impulse responses (AIRs). The estimated TOAs are converted into elliptical constraints about the location of the line reflector, which is then localized by combining multiple constraints. When multiple walls are present in the acoustic scene, an ambiguity problem arises, which we show can be addressed using the Hough transform. Additionally, the Hough transform significantly improves the robustness of the estimation for noisy measurements. The proposed approach is evaluated using simulated rooms under a variety of different controlled conditions where the floor and ceiling are perfectly absorbing. Results using AIRs measured in a real environment are also given. Additionally, results showing the robustness to additive noise in the TOA information are presented, with particular reference to the improvement achieved through the use of the Hough transform...|$|R

40|$|International audience[1] This paper {{considers}} {{the reflection of}} waves by multiscale interfaces {{in the framework of}} the wavelet transform. First, we show how the wavelet transform is efficient to detect and characterize abrupt changes present in a signal. Locally homogeneous abrupt changes have conspicuous cone-like signatures in the wavelet transform from which their regularity may be obtained. Multiscale clusters of nearby singularities produce a hierarchical arrangement of conical patterns where the multiscale structure of the cluster may be identified. Second, the wavelet response is introduced as a natural extension of the wavelet transform when the signal to be analyzed (i. e., the velocity structure of the medium) can only be remotely probed by propagating wavelets into the medium instead of being directly convolved as in the wavelet transform. The reflected waves produced by the incident wavelets onto the reflectors present in the medium constitute the wavelet response. We show that both transforms are equivalent when multiple scattering is neglected and that cone-like features and ridge functions can be recognized in the wavelet response as well. Experimental applications of the acoustical wavelet response show how useful information can be obtained about remote multiscale reflectors. A first experiment implements the synthetic cases discussed before and concerns the characterization of <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors</b> with finite thicknesses. Another experiment concerns the multiscale characterization of a complex interface constituted by the surface of a layer of monodisperse glass beads immersed in water. Citation: Le Gonidec, Y., D.

40|$|A seismic {{reflection}} and MT survey {{was carried out}} along a 27 -km long transect in northwestern Skellefte District, {{as part of a}} bigger 3 D modeling project. The main motivation for the data acquisition is to elucidate the geologic relationship between the known mineralizations in the Adak mining camp to the north and in the well studied Kristineberg area south of the transect. The seismic reflection data were acquired with a VIBSIST system, and show reflectivity down to 3  s. Apart from the conventional processing for crystalline environments, the seismic data was also subject to an azimuthal binning procedure and cross-dip analysis, allowing the orientation of <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors</b> in 3 D. Regarding the MT data, it is primarily of good quality along the 17 installed sites. The inversion of the determinant of the impedance tensor yielded a stable 2 D resistivity model, dominated by resistors corresponding to the postorogenic intrusions along the transect. Adding the location of the analyzed seismic reflectors in the MT inversion rendered an integrated model that facilitated a preliminary joint interpretation of the data sets. Overall, the results are in good agreement with surface observations and reveal a crude configuration of the geologic units below the transect. The most prominent outcomes are the lateral and depth extent of the large postorogenic intrusions in the area reaching to 5 - or 6 -km depth, the dimensions of the nearly vertical Brännäs gabbro extending to 6 -km depth, and the presence of enhanced conductivities along the transect at about 10  km depth.

40|$|Abstract. Echo methods {{combined}} with imaging evaluation allow for {{investigation of the}} inner structure of concrete members. Ultrasonic echo and impulse radar data are analysed with reconstruction calculation procedures like 3 D-SAFT (Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique) and 3 D-FT-SAFT (Fourier-Transform SAFT). From the representations of the 3 D-data sets (B-scans and C-scans) the location of reinforcement bars, tendon-ducts, air voids and honeycombing can be deduced. In order to localise ungrouted areas (air inclusions) in tendon ducts or to decide whether a reflector measured with radar is metallic (reinforcement) or air-like (void), up to now {{the interpretation of the}} results is based on the intensity of the reflection. This criterion is non unique in most cases, because the intensity of the backscattered waves is also influenced by the coupling conditions of the probes or by local variations of the concrete properties. A new approach is to take the phase information into account. The phase information contained in the impulse-like data or in the complex type reconstructed image can help to decide whether the wave pulses pass from concrete to a denser material (e. g. steel) or to a less dense material (e. g. air), even layer thicknesses can be characterized. Since the evaluation of the data usually does not consider single A-scans but reconstructed data, the phase analysis has to be integrated in the reconstruction procedure. In order to investigate and improve the method, a specimen with <b>planar</b> <b>reflectors</b> was used containing four steel-plates of different thickness partly covered with polystyrene (symbolising air-like reflection) and the wave propagation was simulated by the FIT (Finite Integration Technique) method...|$|R
