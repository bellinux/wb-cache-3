40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} MIRA, a distributed and scalable architecture for flow-based monitoring and traffic analysis. MIRA relies on data inspection to provide advanced monitoring {{services such as}} Acceptable User Policy auditing. It {{is based on a}} low cost hardware platform that can be deployed in both LAN and WAN environments. The distributed architecture of the measurement platform is designed to provide real-time global results from a complex network. Processing rate can be seamlessly increased by the addition of new hardware elements. The MIRA architecture has been thoroughly tested in a field trial on RedIRIS, the Spanish National Research Network. 1 Introduction 3 Network services are playing a capital role in our society, and this trend is steadily gaining momentum. As a consequence, demand for network resource monitoring is increasing to asses a given Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) in the network, to prevent, for example, the transport of inappropriate contents or the abuse of network bandwidth by certain users. In this article we present the architecture of MIRA, a distributed and scalable measurement platform based on a novel approach for IP traffic analysis. While most analysis tools rely on address and <b>port</b> <b>inspection,</b> MIRA incorporates real-time pattern search to inspect the transferred data applying user definable heuristics to obtain more elaborated information, for example, to classify the traffic into acceptable or non-acceptable...|$|E

Inspections performed during the first four years of operation showed evidence of some plasma surface interaction not only on the graphite tiles, but also on small portions of the vacuum vessel in the interspace between two tiles. Erosion phenomena were observed in the area which corresponds to the insulated poloidal gaps of the stabilizing shell that surrounds the vacuum vessel. New graphite tiles to be installed in these regions were designed, with a shape which completely closes the interspace in the poloidal direction between the tiles.

40|$|The IEEE Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics {{community}} {{has created a}} roadmap for producing unmanned systems that could be adopted by the Public Safety sector within 10 years, given appropriate R&D investment especially in human-robot interaction and perception. The five applications expected to be of highest value to the Public Safety community, highest value first, are: assisting with routine inspection of the critical infrastructure, “chronic emergencies” such as firefighting, hazardous material spills, <b>port</b> <b>inspection,</b> and damage estimation after a disaster. The technical feasibility of the applications were ranked, with the most attractive scenario, infrastructure inspection, rated as the second easiest scenario; this suggests the maturity of robotics technology is beginning to match stakeholder needs. Each of the five applications were {{discussed in terms of}} the six broad enabling technology areas specified in the current National Robotics Initiative Roadmap (perception, human-robot interaction, mechanisms, modeling and simulation, control and planning, and testing and evaluation) and nine specific capabilities identified by the community as being essential to commercialization (communication, alerting, localization, fault tolerance, mapping, manpower needs, plug and play capabilities, multiple users, and multiple robots). The community believes that perception and human-robot interaction are the two biggest barriers to adoption, and require more research, given that their low technical maturity (3 rd and 6 th rank respectively). However, each of the specific capabilities needed for commercialization are being addressed by current research and could be achieved within 10 years with sustained funding.   Accepted for Publication. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: The loss of an {{instrument}} during a surgical procedure is a potentially dangerous medical event. Retained surgical needles {{are reported to}} cause chronic pain, chronic irritation, and organ injury. Surgical needles lost during minimally invasive surgery are particularly difficult to retrieve because of their dimin-utive size and the camera’s limited visual field, often prompting protracted recovery attempts that can add to surgical costs. Few detailed recommendations exist for the recovery of a misplaced needle. Methods: A survey was administered to minimally inva-sive surgeons across the United States to glean observa-tions on the incidence of lost surgical needles and recov-ery techniques. Survey results were incorporated into an evidence-based protocol designed to expedite the recov-ery of lost surgical needles. Results: Three hundred five minimally invasive surgeons from 11 surgical subspecialties completed the survey. Six-ty-four percent of participants reported having experi-enced a lost surgical needle, {{with a minimum of}} 112 needles lost during the past 1 year alone. Urologists, pediatric surgeons, and bariatric surgeons reported higher rates of needle loss than surgeons practicing other sub-specialties (P. 001). Removal of a needle through a minimally invasive port and laparoscopic suturing were the 2 most common situations resulting in lost needles. A systematic visual search, abdominal radiography, fluoros-copy, and the use of a magnetic retriever were reported as the most successful strategies for needle recovery. Conclusions: On the basis of survey results and current literature, our protocol incorporates a camera survey of the abdomen, intraoperative fluoroscopic radiography, <b>port</b> <b>inspection,</b> and a quadrant-based systematic visual search for the recovery of needles lost during minimally invasive surgery...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLivestock export {{is vital}} to the Somali economy. To protect Somali {{livestock}} exports from costly import bans used to control the international spread of disease, better certification of livestock health status is required. We performed quantitative risk assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis on different health certification protocols for Somali livestock exports for six transboundary diseases. Examining stock at regional markets alone without <b>port</b> <b>inspection</b> and quarantine was inexpensive but was ineffective for all but contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia and peste des petits ruminants. While extended pre-export quarantine improves detection of infections that cause clinical disease, if biosecurity is suboptimal quarantine provides an opportunity for transmission and increased risk. Clinical examination, laboratory screening and vaccination of animals for key diseases before entry to the quarantine station reduced the risk of an exported animal being infected. If vaccination could be reliably performed weeks before arrival at quarantine its effect would be greatly enhanced. The optimal certification method depends on the disease. Laboratory diagnostic testing was particularly important for detecting infections with limited clinical signs in male animals (only males are exported); for Rift Valley fever (RVF) the probability of detection was 99 % or 0 % with and without testing. Based on our findings animal inspection and certification at regional markets combined with quarantine inspection and certification would reduce the risk of exporting infected animals and enhance disease control at the regional level. This is especially so for key priority diseases, that is RVF, foot-and-mouth disease and Brucellosis. Increased data collection and testing should be applied at point of production and export...|$|E

25|$|Owing to Ming loyalists like Koxinga, the regent Prince Rui resumed the ban {{on private}} foreign trade in 1647. In fact, like the Ming before it, the Qing Empire was {{dependent}} on foreign trade for the Japanese and South American silver that underpinned its monetary system, and the ban was not effective until a more severe order followed in 1661 upon the ascension of the Kangxi Emperor. Chinese in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and parts of Shandong were forcibly removed from the coast {{over the next three}} years in the Great Clearance. Ships were destroyed, and foreign trade was again limited to that passing through Macao. Following high-level memorials to the throne, the evacuation was no longer enforced after 1669 and, following the destruction of Tungning on Taiwan, the other bans were lifted in 1684. The year after that, customs offices were established in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Songjiang to deal with foreign trade. The enormous emigration that attended this policy – along with rumors of a Ming pretender in the Philippines – caused the Kangxi Emperor to ban trade in the South China Sea and order the émigrées return upon penalty of death in 1717; this was rescinded ten years later, but the attendant <b>port</b> <b>inspections</b> and restrictions continued.|$|R

40|$|Illegal, unreported, and {{unregulated}} (IUU) fishing {{contributes to}} overexploitation of fisheries, harms {{the recovery of}} fish populations, and causes large financial losses, especially for coastal developing countries with economies heavily reliant on fishing. Illicit fishing operations also are often linked to other crimes, such as tax evasion, money laundering, smuggling, and violation of labour standards, each of which takes an additional toll. The Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) is a cost-effective tool to combat IUU fishing. <b>Port</b> <b>inspections</b> are less expensive and safer than monitoring, pursuing, and inspecting vessels at sea. At the same time, inspections reduce the incentives for this illicit fishing because they {{make it more difficult}} to sell illegally caught fish. As more nations agree to abide by the treaty and harmonise their port State measures, IUU fishing will no longer be a lowrisk, high-reward business but a high-risk, low-reward enterprise. This is the FAO's ultimate goal for the PSMA. Becoming a party to this international agreement and implementing effective port State measures involves costs, but there are numerous direct and indirect economic benefits as well. At the core of the PSMA is the principle of cooperation; the benefits to individual nations will increase as more States join. Nations have had to make policy changes to implement PSMA requirements, but a review of what has been done so far by States that have ratified the agreement shows clear advantages as well. As the number of ratifications increases regionally and among neighbouring States, the effectiveness and impact of the PSMA will grow...|$|R
