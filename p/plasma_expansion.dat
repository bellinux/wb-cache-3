50|$|The OB mode is {{observed}} when a material {{is subjected to}} powerful laser pulses. It manifests a power threshold {{in the range of}} MW for the majority of dielectric materials, which depends on the duration and on the wavelength of the laser pulse. Optical breakdown is related to the dielectric breakdown phenomenon which was studied and modeled successfully {{towards the end of the}} 1950s. One describes the effect as a strong local ionization of the medium, where the plasma reaches densities beyond the critical value (between 1020 and 1022 electrons/cm³). Once the plasma critical density is achieved, energy is very efficiently absorbed from the light pulse, and the local plasma temperature increases dramatically. An explosive Coulombian expansion follows, and forms a very powerful and damaging shockwave through the material that develops on ns timescale. In liquids one talks about cavitation bubbles. If the rate of plasma formation is relatively slow, in the nanosecond time regime (for nanosecond excitation laser pulses), energy is transferred from the plasma to the lattice, and thermal damages can occur. In the femtosecond time regime (for femtosecond excitation laser pulses) the <b>plasma</b> <b>expansion</b> happens on a timescale smaller than the rate of energy transfer to the lattice, and thermal damages are reduced or eliminated. This is the basis of cold laser machining using high-power sub-ps laser sources.|$|E

Measurements were performed at inclusion, after 20 to 40 hours and after 65 to 100 hours. The control group consisted of 29 women with a normal pregnancy and 8 women who had late-onset preeclampsia after 34 weeks. Controls were measured at 32 weeks.
