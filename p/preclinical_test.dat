50|$|Preclinical {{studies in}} humans using {{nisoxetine}} {{were conducted in}} the 1970s, and side effects of the drug were examined. Doses ranging from 1 mg to 50 mg do not result in any changes in base line values in haematologic tests, routine blood chemistries, or coagulation parameters. Larger doses produce some side effects, but no electrocardiographic changes are observed in any doses. Injections with doses of tyramine in humans while receiving nisoxetine results in a decreased responsiveness to tyramine with increased duration of administered nisoxetine. Another effect of nisoxetine administration is that subjects require much smaller doses of norepinephrine to produce the same blood pressure responses as those who receive a placebo. In other words, subjects exhibit an increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after nisoxetine administration. <b>Preclinical</b> <b>test</b> conclude that the drug, in tested doses, appears to be safe for use in humans.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Since their {{introduction}} into {{clinical trials}} in the United States, endovascular aortic grafts have shown {{various types of}} problems. Although details of design and construction vary between different endovascular grafts and failure modes have had a variety of causes and clinical effects, the inability of <b>preclinical</b> <b>testing</b> to predict these failures remains common to all endovascular grafts. The need to improve <b>preclinical</b> <b>testing</b> {{in an attempt to}} reduce clinical device failures resulted in a Food and Drug Administration-sponsored workshop on endovascular graft <b>preclinical</b> <b>testing</b> held in Rockville, Md, from July 31 to August 1, 2001. Format: The workshop was not designed as a consensus conference. Instead, it provided a forum for bringing stakeholders together to define problems and identify areas of agreement and disagreement. The workshop had 34 invited participants who represented device manufacturers, the medical community, the Food and Drug Administration, and testing facilities, and international attendance was more than 120 people. Outcome: Discussion centered on: 1, defining the physiologic, anatomic, and morphologic characteristics of abdominal aortic aneurysms before and after endovascular graft treatment; 2, identifying the types of failures that have been observed clinically; and 3, determining which characteristics should be considered during preclinical modeling to better predict clinical performance. Attendees agreed to the need to better define and address anatomic characteristics and changes in the aneurysm after endograft treatment to optimize <b>preclinical</b> <b>testing.</b> Much discussion and little agreement occurred on the importance of flow-related forces on graft performance or the need or ability to define and model physiologic compliance during durability testing. The discussion and conclusions are summarized in this paper and are provided in detail at: [URL] Conclusion: The workshop raised awareness of significant performance issues and the challenges of modeling the extremely variable and relatively undefined environment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Materials and methods: Test anxiety was measured with Spielberger's state anxiety inventory. Preparation for the assessment and expectation to succeed were quantified with 4 -point Likert scales. The questionnaire was completed during an OSCE, a written examination, a preclinical crown and bridge preparation test and a non-examination situation. Results: The OSCE was a most anxiety-provoking assessment method and students prepared more for the OSCE than for the other examinations. The expectation to succeed was also higher for the OSCE. State anxiety during the OSCE was associated with the level of preparation but not with scores obtained. The state anxiety during a written examination showed a positive relation with the scores obtained, but not with preparation or expectation to succeed. During the <b>preclinical</b> <b>test,</b> state anxiety showed a positive association with the preparation and expectation to succeed, but not with the scores for this test.

40|$|Rationale: The {{combination}} of idazoxan, a specific alpha(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist with raclopride, a selective D- 2 /D- 3 receptor antagonist, has been recently proposed {{to produce an}} atypical antipsychotic profile {{comparable to that of}} clozapine, based on an animal study which analysed dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex and the <b>preclinical</b> <b>test</b> of conditioned avoidance response (CAR) for evaluation of antipsychotic potential. Accordingly, the {{combination of}} a typical antipsychotic with idazoxan has been proposed as an augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, although its therapeutic potential remains difficult to predict. Objectives: Given the momentum stimulated by these reports, the present study investigated whether the combination of idazoxan with raclopride is indeed sufficient to mimic the ability of clozapine to reverse prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits in rats, a behavioral paradigm that models PPI deficits observed in the schizophrenia spectrum, and currently the only test which reliably appears to distinguish between typical antipsychotics and compounds with atypical antipsychotic potential. Methods: The effects of the combination idazoxan/raclopride were examined in two PPI paradigms: 1) phencyclidine (PCP) -induced disruption of PPI, which {{has been shown to be}} preferentially reversed by atypical antipsychotics; 2) apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI which can be reversed by either typical high-potency D- 2 dopamine antagonists or atypical antipsychotics. Results: In contrast to clozapine, combining idazoxan with raclopride failed to reverse PCP-induced deficits in PPI In addition, there was no evidence of an enhancing effect of idazoxan on the blockade of apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI by raclopride. Conclusion: The present results challenge the hypothesis that simple alpha(2) /D- 2 blockade is sufficient to produce clozapine-like atypical antipsychotic activities, and support the consensus that the PPI paradigm represents the most sophisticated behavioral <b>preclinical</b> <b>test</b> for detecting selective atypical profile of antipsychotics...|$|E

40|$|Osteochondral grafts as a {{regenerative}} {{early intervention}} therapy provide {{a solution for}} the repair of osteochondral defects and in the long-term may prevent the requirement for total knee replacement. The successful application of osteochondral grafts and novel regenerative solutions is heavily reliant on the biomechanical, tribological and biological properties of the constructs. In order to successfully deliver novel early intervention solutions, there is a requirement to develop robust and stratified <b>preclinical</b> <b>test</b> methods. The aims of the project were twofold; firstly, using simple geometry biomechanical and biotribological models, investigate the stability, friction and wear of osteochondral grafts post implantation in the knee. Secondly, develop a method for the preclinical, functional assessment of friction and wear following osteochondral implantation in a natural knee simulation model. Initial biomechanical evaluation of osteochondral grafts indicated that the most significant factor determining graft stability post implantation was the ratio between graft and defect length and tissue species used. Porcine grafts and grafts implanted into defects longer than the graft length, were less inherently stable and subject to subsidence below congruency at lower loads. A simple geometry pin-on-plate reciprocating friction model was used to investigate the effects of osteochondral grafts on the tribology of the opposing articulating cartilage surface. Osteochondral grafts were compared with the native state (negative control), cartilage defects and stainless steel pins inserted both flush and proud of the cartilage surface (positive controls). The ability of osteochondral grafts to restore a congruent, low friction and wear articulation was evaluated. The simple geometry study demonstrated that osteochondral grafts {{have the potential to}} restore the articular surface without significantly disrupting the local tribology. A whole joint natural knee simulator capable of reproducing the physiological conditions in the knee was used to develop a novel <b>preclinical</b> <b>test</b> method to evaluate the friction and wear properties of osteochondral grafts in a porcine knee model. In summary, increased wear levels did not correlate with significant increases in shear force; osteochondral grafts demonstrated the potential to restore a low friction and wear articulation with no significant differences to the native state. The development of the simulation model represents a significant step in the preclinical testing of osteochondral grafts and may be applied to test regenerative osteochondral interventions, disease models and aid in the development of stratified interventions. ...|$|E
