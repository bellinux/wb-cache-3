Existing <b>PB</b> <b>schemes</b> are all built around the traditional client-server model. This paper proposes a radically different architecture where only end-user hosts are used to build the PB system, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} a central server or even a service provider. Two unique problems pertaining to this decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture are addressed: transmission scheduling and peer synchronization. A new decentralized synchronization algorithm is proposed and results obtained from simulations confirm the architecture’s feasibility and performance. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Fuzzy {{control is}} based on fuzzy logic, which {{provides}} an efficient method to handle inexact information as a basis of reasoning. With fuzzy logic {{it is possible to}} convert knowledge, which is expressed in an uncertain form, to an exact algorithm. In fuzzy control, the controller can be represented with if-then rules. The interpretation of the controller is fuzzy but the controller is processing exact input-data and is producing exact output-data in a deterministic way. However, Backoff time computation schemes, namely: pseudorandom backoff (PB) time, exponential backoff (EB) time and random backoff (RB) time that are applicable in waiting time re-arrangement in queue. They have proved to be inefficient in coping with the conflicting requirements, that is, low dropping frames and high conforming frames. This led us to explore alternative solutions based on artificial intelligence techniques, specially, in the field of fuzzy logic. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy control backoff scheme that aims at detecting violations of parameter negotiated. We evaluate and compare the performance of fuzzy control backoff scheme (FB) with namely, pseudorandom backoff <b>scheme</b> (<b>PB),</b> random backoff <b>scheme</b> (RB) and exponential backoff scheme (EB). The performance of four backoff schemes have been investigated by the fluctuation of telecommunication traffic stream (burst/silent type).

40|$|Abstract: The {{integration}} of reliable Video-on-Demand (VoD) broadcasting schemes in the DVB-h transmission system is studied, exemplary for Pyramid Broadcasting (PB). Sophisticated VoD broadcasting <b>schemes</b> such as <b>PB</b> allow receivers to tune into the ongoing transmission of a video-stream at arbitrary time, while still {{being able to}} receive the multimedia sequence {{from the beginning to}} end, after a short initial playout latency. Raptor coding, integrated in the FLUTE protocol, is combined with the traditional <b>PB</b> <b>scheme</b> in order to provide high service and presentation reliability. We give a short overview on the DVB-h transmission system {{as well as on the}} FLUTE protocol. We present and discuss options for the {{integration of}} VoD broadcasting schemes in combination with Raptor coding. We achieve backward-compatibility even with terminals not supporting Raptor coding. Simulation results show the benefits of the discussed VoD scheme compared to existing carousel approaches in DVB-h...|$|R

40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file-sharing {{systems have}} gained large {{interests}} among the internet users. However, wide-scale applications of P 2 P file-sharing technologies are {{constrained by the}} limitations associated with the sophisticated control mechanisms. Moreover, the decentralized and anonymous characteristics of P 2 P environments {{make it more difficult}} to control accesses on the shared resources, especially for using traditional access control methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a role-based access control architecture for P 2 P file-sharing systems that supports autonomous decisions and centralized controls. The architecture integrates policies of credential, identity and role-based access control models to provide scalable, efficient and fault-tolerant access control services. Furthermore, we employ the primary-backup (<b>PB)</b> <b>scheme</b> to preserve P 2 P decentralized structure and peers’ autonomy property while enabling collaboration between peers. In particular, we propose a method for setting up interoperating relationships between domains by role mappings and resolve two kinds of interoperability conflicts while mapping roles from foreign domain to local domain without centralized authority. We believe that the proposed architecture is realistic, efficient and can provide controlled communications between peers...|$|R
40|$|The {{broadcast}} {{operation is}} {{perhaps one of}} the most fundamental services utilized frequently by other communication mechanisms in MANETs. It is the key element for exchanging control packets to support some services such as those provided by management and routing protocols. The dynamic nature of such network topologies and also the limited resources available, introduce a wide range of challenges when trying to design and implement a broadcast scheme that would function adequately in MANETs. Simple Flooding (FL) is a basic approach to broadcasting without global information; in which a broadcast packet is forwarded exactly once by every node in the network. in FL, the broadcast packet is guaranteed to be received by every node in the network given that there is no packet loss caused by collision and also there is no high-speed movement of nodes during the broadcast process. However, due to the broadcast nature of this environment, redundant transmissions in FL may cause the broadcast storm problem, in which redundant packets cause contention and collisions. Over the past years many studies have been conducted to develop broadcast mechanisms to alleviate the effects of FL. The focus of the early works was on the schemes where the mobile nodes make the rebroadcast decision based on fixed and preconfigured thresholds. The most common thresholds relate to the distance between sender and receiver (Distance Based scheme - DB), the number of duplicate packets received (Counter Based scheme - CB), and a fixed probability for rebroadcast (Probability Based <b>scheme</b> - <b>PB).</b> Despite the fact that these schemes have been shown to considerably improve the overall performance of the network, they have been found to depend highly on the combination of threshold selected, traffic load and level of population. The degree of dependency is such that in certain network topologies FL performs better than these schemes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In {{real-time}} systems, tasks have deadlines {{to be met}} de-spite {{the presence}} of faults. Primary-Backup (<b>PB)</b> <b>scheme</b> {{is one of the}} most common schemes that has been employed for fault-tolerant scheduling of real-time tasks, wherein each task has two versions and the versions are sched-uled on two different processors with time exclusion. There have been techniques proposed for improving schedulabil-ity of the PB-based scheduling. One of the more popu-lar ones include Backup-Backup (BB) overloading, wherein two or more backups can share/overlap in time on a pro-cessor. In this paper, we propose a new schedulability en-hancing technique, called primary-backup (PB) overload-ing, in which the primary of a task can share/overlap in time with the backup of another task on a processor. The intuition is that, for both primary and backup of a task, the PB-overloading can assign an earlier start time than that of the BB-overloading, thereby increasing the schedulabil-ity. We conduct schedulability and reliability analysis of PB- and BB-overloading techniques through simulation and analytical studies. Our studies show that PB-overloading offers better schedulability (25 % increase in the guaran-tee ratio) than that of BB-overloading, and offers reliability comparable to that of BB-overloading. The proposed PB-overloading is a general technique that can be employed in any static or dynamic fault-tolerant scheduling algorithm. ...|$|R

No significant difference was observed {{for any of the}} parameters analyzed between <b>PB</b> or MB <b>schemes</b> of treatment and no indications were found for more efficient outcome of HI using the MB scheme. Remarkably, 18 (54. 5 %) of the individuals were PCR positive in {{at least one of the}} samples: positivity of PCR was highest in blood samples and four individuals were PCR positive in blood and some other sample. Upon comparison of PCR results with clinical and histopathological parameters, no correlation was found between PCR-positivity and eventual relapse. This is the first report on detection of M. leprae DNA in PB patients, more than half a decade after completion of MDT, suggesting that live bacilli are present and circulating much longer than expected, although reinfection of the individuals can not be excluded. Overall, we feel that because of the high sensitivity of the assay, extreme care should be taken about association of PCR results, efficacy of treatment and disease status...|$|R

An unprecedented neutron energy resolution of 1. 1 keV at 1 MeV (35 keV at 10 MeV) and a total uncertainty of about 5 % was achieved for the integral gamma production {{cross section of the}} most intense transition in 208 Pb. The gamma production cross section was measured for 29 transitions of the inelastic channel, 5 transitions of the (n, 2 ngamma) channel and one transition of the (n, 3 ngamma) channel. Based on the evaluated level <b>scheme</b> of 208 <b>Pb,</b> the total neutron inelastic scattering cross section and the level cross sections were deduced. Four large volume HPGe (high purity germanium) detectors were used for the detection of the gamma-rays. The 88. 11 % enriched 208 Pb sample was placed at a flight path length of 198. 551 m. The cross sections were measured relative to the standard cross section by continuously monitoring the neutron flux with a fission chamber containing 235 U. The results are compared with the existing experimental data from the literature and with model estimates obtained with the recent TALYS 1. 00 code. A good agreement of the present data is found with both the existing experimental data and with the calculations.

40|$|Soil was sampled along {{two lines}} of a highway, 0. 5 m and 2. 5 m from the asphalt surface, and in an {{infiltration}} pond for highway runoff. The study area was located in the infiltration area of the reserve water supply for a community. The concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn in soil samples from the highway 0. 5 m. andror in the infiltration pond exceeded guideline values for less sensitive land-use with groundwater protection. The highest Pb concentration measured 542 mg kgy 1. was 34 times the average Pb concentration in soils in Sweden, and exceeded the Swedish guideline value {{by a factor of}} almost two. Cadmium in the infiltration pond exceeded the guideline value almost three times. An increased concentration with soil depth for Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn and PAHs in the infiltration pond showed that downward transport had occurred. This was supported by a Pb concentration exceeding the limit for drinking water quality in the groundwater 4. 5 m below the soil surface in the infiltration pond. The ESP exchangeable sodium percentage. in some samples was high enough 10] 27 %. for dispersion of soil colloids to occur. The Tessier’s sequential extraction <b>scheme</b> showed that <b>Pb</b> and Zn occurred mostly in association with the oxide bound fraction whereas Cu was mainly associated with the organic fraction, e. g. colloids. Another important fraction for Pb was the carbonate fraction. The study showed that {{a large part of the}} Pb, Cu and Zn in roadside soils is vulnerable to leaching when exposed to a high NaCl concentration, reducing conditions or to a lowering in pH. Regression analyses showed that a high concentration of Na predominately displaces Ca of the base cations from the exchange sites in the soil. The highly significant relationships observed between soil properties and chemical fractions of the metals make the result reliable for the fractions that predominate. QC 20130109 </p...|$|R
