25|$|The {{amplitude}} of the BOLD signal {{does not necessarily}} affect its shape. A higher-amplitude signal may be seen for stronger neural activity, but peaking {{at the same place}} as a weaker signal. Also, the amplitude does not necessarily reflect behavioral performance. A complex cognitive task may initially trigger high-amplitude signals associated with good performance, but as the subject gets better at it, the amplitude may decrease with performance staying the same. This is expected to be due to increased efficiency in <b>performing</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> The BOLD response across brain regions cannot be compared directly even for the same task, since the density of neurons and the blood-supply characteristics are not constant across the brain. However, the BOLD response can often be compared across subjects for the same brain region and the same task.|$|E
25|$|Subjective {{estimates}} of an individual's SA {{may also be}} made by experienced observers (e.g., peers, commanders, or trained external experts). These observer ratings may be somewhat superior to self-ratings of SA because {{more information about the}} true state of the environment is usually available to the observer than to the operator, who may be focused on <b>performing</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> (i.e., trained observers may have more complete knowledge of the situation). However, observers have only limited knowledge about the operator's concept of the situation and cannot have complete insight into the mental state of the individual being evaluated. Thus, observers are forced to rely more on operators' observable actions and verbalizations in order to infer their level of SA. In this case, such actions and verbalizations are best assessed using performance and behavioral measures of SA, as described next.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we tested}} whether {{modified}} cognitive interviewing (MCI) {{is a valid}} method for distinguishing between genuine and deceptive human eyewitness accounts. 102 healthy military personnel were the participants of this study. 54 were assigned to a manual task condition and 48 to a cognitive <b>task</b> condition. Of <b>the</b> 54 assigned to <b>the</b> manual <b>task,</b> 17 truly <b>performed</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> and were truthful when interviewed about their activities; 18 <b>performed</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> and, when interviewed denied having <b>performed</b> <b>the</b> task; 19 read the instructions regarding <b>the</b> manual <b>task</b> and when interviewed falsely claimed to have <b>performed</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> Of <b>the</b> 48 participants assigned to <b>the</b> cognitive <b>task,</b> 20 <b>performed</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> and reported truthfully about their activities; 13 <b>performed</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> and denied having participated in the task; 15 read the instructions about <b>the</b> cognitive <b>task</b> and when interviewed claimed to have actually <b>performed</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> <b>The</b> transcripts of interviews were rated by individuals trained in cognitive interviewing; forensic speech variables (response length, unique word count and type-token ratio (TTR)) were coded from transcripts. Human rater judgments and computer-based speech analysis performed better than chance; computer based judgments were superior to the human judgments (i. e., 80 % vs. 62 %, respectively). Speech content variables derived from MCI differed significantly, and in different ways, between the truthful and false claimant participants and also between the truthful and denial type participants. MCI derived statement analysis methods are a scientifically valid method that can b...|$|R

2500|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{problems}} regarding studies of free will. Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that have been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings is representing. In other words, the dip might {{have nothing to do with}} unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while <b>performing</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> Some of the research mentioned here has gotten more advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers. Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of [...] "free will" [...] where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.|$|E
60|$|Jesus had seldom spoken literally, and {{the truths}} {{he sought to}} impress upon the world had of {{necessity}} been clothed in figures and symbols,--for spiritual truths might be conveyed in no other way. The supreme proof of his Godship, of his complete knowledge {{of the meaning of}} life was to be found in his parables. To the literal, material mind, for example, the parable of the talents was merely an unintelligible case of injustice.... What was meant by the talents? They were opportunities for service. Experience taught us that when we embraced one opportunity, one responsibility, the acceptance of it invariably led to another, and so the servant who had five talents, five opportunities, gained ten. The servant who had two gained two more. But the servant of whom only one little service was asked refused that, and was cast into outer darkness, to witness another <b>performing</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> which should have been his. Hell, here and hereafter, was the spectacle of wasted opportunity, and there is no suffering to compare to it.|$|E
