5|$|After {{considering}} the changed circumstances, the Archbishop of Goa, by a provision issued on 20 February 1795, appointed Minguel José Louis Mendes interim vicar {{of the four}} sub-districts of Mangalore, Barcoor, Onore and Moolki. Some other priests also came to Canara with the new vicar. Those from Goa retained their old <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> could not accept the rule of Tipu, openly advocating rebellion against him, writing offensive letters and making offensive speeches. As a result, in 1797, the brief repite enjoyed by the Christians ceased and their persecution recommenced.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

40|$|In {{everyday}} interactions, {{people go}} to great lengths to avoid being attributed as <b>prejudiced</b> <b>and</b> racist. Previous writers have argued that this is a result of a cultural ‘norm against prejudice’ and have shown how speakers orient to the norm. However new research has argued that this norm is far from straight forward, and that there is a lack of understanding of how lay people do define and utilise attributions of <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> racism in everyday talk. This study examines how, in the specific context of an online forum discussion surrounding three teenagers dressing as Golliwogs in the local parade of a rural Scottish community, contributors orient to and deal with potential attributions of <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> racism, and how they negotiate in that context what is to count as prejudiced/racist. Analysis shows that contributors do not mention <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> make few references to racism/racists. Issues of lay definitions of prejudice/racism are therefore not made explicit notwithstanding that contributors appear to be orienting to potential ascriptions of <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> / or racism. Future research is needed to look at further negotiations surrounding <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> racism in various specific contexts, in order to build a greater understanding of how <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> racism are actually negotiated in everyday talk in lay terms...|$|R

25|$|Opposition to the Swedish {{language}} was partly based around historical <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> conflicts that had sprung {{up during the}} 19th century.

40|$|Color poster with {{text and}} graphs. The {{relationship}} between religion, <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> prosocial behavior is complex.

This study sought to replicate and extend the findings of previous researchers by evaluating the relationships between religious affiliation <b>and</b> <b>prejudice,</b> <b>and</b> between religious affiliation and helping.

25|$|A body of {{correspondence}} between Marcus' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials (with {{a focus on}} Marcus himself) survives {{in a series of}} patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166. Marcus' own Meditations offer a window on his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs. The main narrative source for the period is Cassius Dio, a Greek senator from Bithynian Nicaea who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective. Some other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the Digest and Codex Justinianus on Marcus' legal work. Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} analyses the mediational role {{of threat}} perception {{in the relationship}} between <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> discrimination (opposition to immigration and opposition to naturalization of immigrants).

In Study 2, using representative samples in two countries with different traditions of immigration (Switzerland, N¼ 940; Portugal, N¼ 1514), we showed that realistic threat more strongly mediated the relationship between <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> opposition to immigration, while only symbolic threat perception mediated the link between <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> opposition to naturalization.

All the little quiet rivulets, that watered an humble, a contracted, but not an unfruitful field, are to {{be lost in the}} waste expanse, and boundless, barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of France. It is no longer an object of terrour, the aggrandizement of a new power, which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in their chair; whilst it propagates by arms, and establishes by conquest, the comprehensive system of universal fraternity. In what light is all this viewed in a great assembly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions, except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connexions with the metropolis of that fraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on its favourite subject, the display of those horrours, that must attend the existence of a power, with such dispositions and principles, seated in the heart of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including <b>prejudices)</b> <b>and</b> the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E
