50|$|The Four <b>Prism</b> <b>Dioptre</b> Reflex Test (also {{known as}} the 4 PRT, or 4 <b>Prism</b> <b>Dioptre</b> Base-out Test), is an objective, non-dissociative test used to prove the {{alignment}} of both eyes (i.e. the presence of binocular single vision) by assessing motor fusion. Through {{the use of a}} 4 dioptre base out prism, diplopia is induced which is the driving force for the eyes to change fixation and therefore re-gain bifoveal fixation meaning, they overcome that amount of power.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{conventional}} CR 39 and Fresnel prisms on {{high and low}} contrast letter acuity was studied. Visual acuity of the fully corrected better eyes of 15 subjects was measured with the high (90 %) and low (10 %) contrast logMAR letter charts, while they wore prisms of varying power. The results showed that when {{the power of the}} conventional CR 39 prism and the Fresnel prism reached 10 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> and 5 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres,</b> respectively, significant reduction (1 tail t-test, p < 0. 05) of the high and low contrast acuity occurred. The Fresnel prism caused a significantly greater acuity reduction than the conventional CR 39 prism for powers ranging from 5 to 30 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> for both contrasts. The rate of acuity reduction with increasing prism power was greater with the low contrast targets than with the high contrast targets for both prisms. In addition, the rate of acuity reduction with increasing prism power was greater with the Fresnel prism than with the conventional CR 39 prism for both contrasts. The conventional CR 39 prism reduced acuity by a ratio of about 0. 8 - 0. 9 of that of the Fresnel prism for powers ranging from 5 to 20 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> and by about 0. 7 for 30 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres.</b> These ratios applied for both high and low contrast acuity, and therefore were independent of the level of contrast used.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} found that crossed disparities give better stereoacuity than uncrossed. When near phoria is considered, exophores had a better crossed stereoacuity and esophores had a better uncrossed stereoacuity. The current study {{investigated}} the effect of heterophoria on distant crossed and uncrossed stereoacuity. Methods: Seventy-two subjects were recruited and their distant heterophoria measured. Heterophoria within two <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> was considered as orthophoric. Esophoric group had esophoria greater than two <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres.</b> Exophoric group had exophoria greater than two <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres.</b> There were 40 orthophores, 23 exophores and nine esophores. Their stereoacuity was measured with a three-rod apparatus at 6 m. Results: The mean crossed stereoacuity was 4. 8 ″ and uncrossed stereoacuity was 7. 2 ″ (t = - 3. 03, p < 0. 01). The mean stereoacuity for orthophoric subjects was 5. 31 ″, 6. 02 ″ for exophores and 8. 91 ″ for esophores. The distant crossed stereoacuity is better than uncrossed stereoacuity in all three groups but the difference is only significant for the exophores. Exophoric subjects demonstrated a significant difference between crossed (4. 10 ″) and uncrossed (7. 95 ″) stereoacuity. Conclusions: Orthophores have the best stereoacuity, followed by exophores and esophores. Exophoric subjects have a better crossed than uncrossed stereoacuity.

40|$|Caucasian {{children}} with myopia have elevated response accommodative vergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratios. The {{purpose of this}} study was twofold: to determine if response AC/A ratios vary with refractive error and with myopic progression rate in Hong Kong Chinese children, and to determine the effect of beta-adrenergic antagonism with topical timolol application on AC/A ratios. METHODS: Thirty children aged eight to 12 years participated in the study. All refractive errors were corrected with spectacle lenses. Accommodative responses were measured using a Shin-Nippon autorefractor and concurrent changes in vergence were assessed using a vertical prism and a Howell-Dwyer card at three metres and 0. 33 metre. Accommodative demand was altered using plus or minus two dioptre lenses and lens- and distance-induced response AC/A ratios were calculated. Measurements were repeated 30 minutes after the instillation of topical timolol maleate (0. 5 per cent). RESULTS: AC/A ratios appeared higher in progressing myopic children but the difference was not statistically significant. Timolol application reduced accommodative convergence (AC) in the stable myopes (reduction = - 3 ± 1. 14 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres)</b> but not in the emmetropes (0. 69 ± 0. 96 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres)</b> or progressing myopes (0. 16 ± 0. 43 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres)</b> and this difference between refractive groups was statistically significant (F 2, 27 = 3. 766; P = 0. 036). However, timolol did not produce a significant change in the accommodative response to positive or negative lenses or response AC/A ratios. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find that AC/A ratios in myopic Chinese children were elevated and therefore, it is unlikely that elevated AC/A ratios are responsible for the high levels of myopia that occur in Hong Kong. The finding that timolol reduced AC in the stable myopes suggests that the autonomic control of accommodative convergence in these children may be different from that in emmetropic children and those with progressing myopia...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:    The psychosocial {{implications}} of a strabismus have not received sufficient attention and yet may have a significantly negative effect on a person’s life.   Schizophrenia is the fourth leading cause of mental disability in the developed world.   Both schizophrenia and strabismus appear to share a genetic and neurological origin.   This study thus set out to assess the prevalence of strabismus {{in a sample of}} schizophrenic subjects. Setting:  The study was carried out in Durban, Kwazulu-Natal inSouth Africa specifically at the Durban and Coastal Mental Health Institution. Method:  Fifty schizophrenic subjects residing at the Durban and Coastal Mental Health (DMH) Institution were assessedfor the presence of strabismus using the cover test and modified Krimsky test.   The inclusion criteria were all subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia, of both genders and any race.   The subjects werebetween fifteen to seventy years of age.   The exclusion criteria included any other mental illness, systemic disease or medication other than that usedon schizophrenic patients.   Results:   The prevalence of strabismus in this sample was found tobe 74 % which was considerably higher than that reported by other studies 1, 2.   There was a greater incidence of exotropia as opposed to esotropia.   The mean distance exotropia as detected with the cover test was 33 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres.</b>   Similarly, the near cover test indicated a mean of 11 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> exotropia, and with the modified Krimsky test a mean of 9 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> exotropia.    Most of the strabismic subjects (86. 5 %) presented with a strabismus when fixating a near target.   Generally the strabismus was found to be constant and unilateral and no gender bias was found.   Conclusion:There appears to be a strong relationship between strabismus and schizophrenia.   Health care professionals, especially those dealing with paediatric care, parents and the public should be made awareof this relationship so that psychological adviceand early intervention can be sought for strabismic children.

40|$|AIMS [...] A {{surgical}} technique {{has been developed}} {{in order to obtain}} ocular alignment in the primary position in patients with third nerve palsy. METHODS [...] A method for surgically correcting the vertical deviation and the pseudoptosis is described in three patients with longstanding third nerve palsy. By decreasing the ability of the non-involved eye to elevate, a fixation duress was created which eliminated the secondary deviation that characteristically occurs in such patients when the involved eye fixates. As a result of this technique, both eyes in all patients on attempted fixation were under similar duress, therefore requiring equal amounts of stimulation to move into the primary position. When the fixation duress was sufficient, elimination of the hypotropia and ptosis was achieved. Additionally, in order to correct the exotropia, generous recession and resection procedures in the involved eye and recession of the lateral rectus in the noninvolved eye were performed. RESULTS [...] Between 8 and 10 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> of esotropia were achieved and maintained in two patients. One patient had 20 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> of exotropia.

40|$|BACKGROUND The gradual {{decrease}} in binocularity and stereopsis {{in patients with}} concomitant strabismus decreases the depth perception of the patients and adversely affects the reading speed and the motor dexterity skills of the individuals. It had been observed earlier that early management is necessary to help patients regain their binocularity, but recent studies indicate that binocularity and stereopsis may improve in these patients {{even if they are}} treated later in life, provided they are managed well. Hence, we undertook this study {{to determine the extent of}} improvement in binocularity and stereopsis in patients with long-standing large angle constant concomitant horizontal strabismus after surgical management after the age of 16 years and its association with the postoperative alignment. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective clinical trial was conducted in 30 patients with constant concomitant horizontal strabismus of more than 25 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> who presented after the age of 16 years.

40|$|SUMMARY Ninety-seven {{patients}} with congenital esotropia with deviations of 50 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> or greater underwent large (6 and 7 mm) bimedial rectus recessions. The overall success rate with one operation was 83 - 5 %. Judgment of final alignment {{was made at}} the last follow-up examination, six to 61 months (average 23 - 4 months) postoperatively. Large bimedial rectus recessions for congenital esotropia are an effective surgical treatment which does not significantly alter adduction. The best surgical treatment of large angle congenital esotropia continues to be controversial. Success rates ranging from 40 to 80 % have been described {{with a variety of}} surgical techniques. " Traditionally the maximum recession of the medial recti has been approximately 5 mm. 7 Several investigators have successfully corrected large angle esotropia with bimedial rectus recessions in excess of the traditional 5 mm. " " Mittleman and Folk have presented favour-able results following re-recession of the medial rectus 13 * 5 mm from the limbus for undercorrected esotropia.

50|$|This test is {{performed}} on patients suspected to have small angle deviations {{of less than}} 10 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres,</b> a microtropia, {{that may or may}} not have been observed on cover test because of subtle eye movements. The test determines whether the patient has bifoveal fixation or monofixation despite their eyes seeming straight. On the cover component of cover test a small manifest deviation may be documented, however the patient passes the Worth's Four Lights Test or Bagolini Striated Glasses Test, indicating binocular single vision, but fails a bifoveal test such as the Lang I/II. The 4 PRT therefore confirms the presence of a microtropia whether it be with identity (i.e. with eccentric viewing) or without identity (i.e. extension of Panum’s fusion area).|$|R

Full-face photographs were obtained using an 8. 2 -megapixel digital single-lens reflex camera, and the images were analysed using the 3 D Strabismus Photo Analyzer. The images were adjusted for age-dependent ophthalmic biometry and angle k. The main outcome measures were inter-observer variability, test-retest reliability and correlation between the angles of deviation measured by different methods. Results The 95 % limit of agreement of inter-observer variability was 63. 58 (6. 1 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> (PD)), 63. 18 (5. 4 PD) and 61. 58 (2. 6 PD) for the Krimsky test, PCT and the 3 D Strabismus Photo Analyzer, respectively. The test-retest reliability was 62. 88 (4. 9 PD) for the 3 D Strabismus Photo Analyzer versus the Krimsky test.

40|$|Objective: The study’s aims were to {{evaluate}} the success of bimedial rectus recession as a primary surgical procedure for patients with congenital esotropia; describe the demographic data of the study group; and compare surgical success with patient age {{at the time of}} surgery. Method: A retrospective review of 52 patients with congenital esotropia ≥ 50 ∆ (<b>prism</b> <b>dioptres)</b> was conducted. All patients underwent bimedial rectus recession and were followed-up postoperatively for a minimum of 6 months. Results: The study period was from January 1992 to September 2003. Fifty-two patients were included in the study group. The pre-operative angle of deviation ranged from 50 ∆– 85 ∆. Patient ages ranged from 15 months to 22 years, with a mean of 5. 3 years and a median of 4 years. The gender distribution was 42 % male (n = 20) and 58 % female (n = 28). Surgery was successful (within 10 ∆ of orthophoria) in 77 % (n = 40), a partial success (10 ∆– 20 ∆ from orthophoria) in 17 % (n = 9) and a failure (> 20 ∆ from orthophoria) in 6 % (n = 3). No statistically significant relationship was found between surgical success and patient age at the time of surgery. Conclusion: The study confirmed that bilateral medial rectus recession, performed as a primary procedure for patients with large-angle (> 50 ∆) congenital esotropia, has a high success rate. This finding corresponds with the outcomes of similar international studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Paresis of the {{superior}} oblique muscle is a common isolated palsy of an extraocular muscle. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate clinical findings and surgical approaches to this ocular motility imbalance. Methods. We reviewed the records of 135 patients with superior oblique palsy who were examined in our Department of Ophthalmology over the period 2000 - 2005 to evaluate the etiology, clinical patterns, surgical management and outcome. results. Congenital palsy were mostly unilateral (79 %), traumatic palsy bilateral (70 %). An excyclotropia of greater than 15 degrees was highly suggestive of bilaterality. Our patients reported diplopia more frequently in acquired (60 %) than in con- genital (21 %) superior oblique palsy. The surgical procedures were performed according to Knapp’s classification of superior oblique palsy. In 47 cases (35 %) tucking of superior oblique alone corrected the full deviation. In 14 cases tucking of superior oblique was combined with weakening of inferior oblique when the deviation exceeded 30 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres.</b> In 60 cases (45 %; Knapp class 8 th) tucking {{the superior}} oblique was performed concurrently with recession of superior rectus. Conclusion. In our experience surgical treatment of superior oblique palsy, according to Knapp’s classification, is not as difficult or unpredictable as that of horizontal strabismus; in fact if one uses a well thought out plan of diagnosis and treatment the results are most gratifying to the patient and to the surgeo...|$|R

Purpose. To evaluate the surgical outcomes of unilateral or bilateral medial rectus (MR) muscle resection for recurrent exotropia after bilateral lateral rectus (BLR) muscle recession based on a novel surgical formula. Methods. Forty-one consecutive patients with unilateral or bilateral MR muscle resection for recurrent exotropia after BLR muscle recession were included in this retrospective study. All surgeries were performed according to the formula: 1. 0 mm MR muscle resection for every 5 <b>prism</b> <b>dioptres</b> (PD) of exotropia, with an addition of 0. 5 mm to each MR muscle operated on. Results. The mean recurrent exotropia distant deviation was 28 PD ± 11. 2 (range 14 to 55 PD). Overall at postoperative 1 month, 36 (88 %) achieved successful outcomes, 4 (10 %) had undercorrection, and 1 (2 %) had overcorrection. At postoperative 6 months, 29 (71 %) achieved successful outcomes, 12 (29 %) had undercorrection, and none had overcorrection. Subgroup analysis showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in success rates between unilateral and bilateral MR groups. Conclusion. Unilateral or bilateral MR muscle resection using our surgical formula is a safe and effective method for calculating the amount of MR resection in moderate to large angle recurrent exotropia, with a low overcorrection rate. 1...|$|R
