When the modulators were presented to P-glycoprotein in pairs, we found examples of both competitive and non-competitive behaviour. We interpret these results on a model in which two modulatory sites exit on the MDR pump. To one of these, mefloquine, vinblastine and tamoxifen bind preferentially; to the other, verapamil, dipyridamole, trifluoperazine and quinidine bind (but mefloquine and tamoxifen only weakly if at all). Cyclosporin A can interact with both sites...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this thesis is to develop photonic integrated circuit (PIC) for Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) application. As such, {{at the beginning of the}} thesis, a dual-function photonic integrated circuit for microwave photonic applications is proposed. The photonic circuit is arranged to have two separate output ports, and depending upon the RF input signal strength, it provides either tunable millimeter wave carriers by frequency octo-tupling of the RF signal or frequency up-conversion of a microwave signal from the electrical to the optical domain. The circuit exploits the intrinsic relative phases between the ports of multi-mode interference couplers (MMI) to provide all the static optical phases needed, hence drift free. In the middle of thesis, a generalized architecture having N parallel phase modulators driven electrically with a progressive 2 π⁄N phase shift is analyzed. The proposed design is justified by computer simulation for N= 8 architecture with properly determined optical phase shifts to generate frequency multiplication of an electrical signal. The front- and back-end of the circuit comprises 4 × 4 MMI couplers enclosing an array <b>of</b> four <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> phase <b>modulators</b> and 2 × 2 MMI couplers. The proposed design for frequency multiplication requires no optical or electrical filters; the operation is not limited to carefully adjusted modulation indexes. Later on, a generalized approach for achieving frequency multiplication using two cascades MZM is presented. The proposed design consists of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with each arm containing a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Mach-Zehnder <b>modulators</b> (MZM) in series as a means of optoelectronic frequency multiplication (octo-tupling and quattourviginti-tupling). The circuit requires no electrical or optical filters. There is no requirement to carefully adjust the modulation index to achieve correct operation of the octo-tupler. A comparison is made with an alternative functionally equivalent single-stage parallel MZM circuit discussed herein the thesis. Finally, the thesis describes the generation of the same magnitude but opposite sign high order single optical side band from its output ports by using a RF source. A single stage parallel Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM) and a two-stage series parallel MZM architecture is described and their relative merits and demerits discussed. As an illustration of a prospective application it is shown how the circuit may be used to transport radio signals over fibre for wireless access; generating remotely a mm-wave carrier modulated by digital IQ data. A detail calculation of symbol error rate is presented to characterise the system performance. A mathematical analysis is provided to describe the principle of operation for all the proposed design and validated by commercially available industrial standard simulation tool. ...|$|R

In preparation for the space instrument, the MSPI team has built two incremental camera systems (Ground- and Air-MSPI) to improve understanding of the proposed architecture. Ground-MSPI is a gimballed instrument used primarily for stationary observation and characterization of the imager and optics. The ER- 2 based Air-MSPI operates in a step-and-stare mode, providing multi-angle imaging of a static target. This mode-of-operation simulates the observation scenario of the space instrument. Physically, MSPI is a pushbroom camera with a specialized frontend. Before imaging, light entering the camera passes through a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> photoelastic <b>modulators</b> {{and a set of}} pattern polarizers.

As reported in, the data processing algorithm can operate in real-time on a Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA. Moving beyond verification with an onboard data source, the algorithm has been validated on a commercial development board interfaced with the ground camera.
