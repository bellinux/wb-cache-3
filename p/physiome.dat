40|$|Increasingly, {{scientists}} {{have begun to}} tackle gene functions and other complex regulatory processes by studying organisms at the global scales for various levels of biological organization, ranging from genomes to metabolomes and <b>physiomes.</b> Meanwhile, new bioinformatics methods {{have been developed for}} inferring protein function using associative analysis of functional properties to complement the traditional sequence homology-based methods. To fully exploit the value of the high-throughput system biology data and to facilitate protein functional studies requires bioinformatics infrastructures that support both data integration and associative analysis. The iProClass database, designed to serve as a framework for data integration in a distributed networking environment, provides comprehensive descriptions of all proteins, with rich links to over 50 databases of protein family, function, pathway, interaction, modification, structure, genome, ontology, literature, and taxonomy. In particular, the database is organized with PIRSF family classification and maps to other family, function, and structure classification schemes. Coupled with the underlying taxonomic information for complete genomes, the iProClass system ([URL] supports associative studies of protein family, domain, function, and structure. A case study of the phosphoglycerate mutases illustrates a systematic approach for protein family and phylogenetic analysis. Such studies may serve as a basis for further analysis of protein functional evolution, and its relationship to the co-evolution of metabolic pathways, cellular networks, and organisms...|$|R

40|$|In patient-specific cardiac {{information}} recovery, meaningful {{a priori}} models for constraining the sparse and noise-corrupted measurements, {{and also the}} optimal criteria for coupling them together, are essential for obtaining more reliable estimates. Although the extensively used biomechanical models give promising results, it cannot account for the active components of the myocytes. In view of this, we propose to adopt a cardiac <b>physiome</b> model, which is composed by a cardiac electric wave propagation model, an electro-mechanical coupling model, and a biomechanical model, for a more complete modeling of the cardiac physiology. Under the multiframe state-space filtering framework, the <b>physiome</b> model is coupled with the measurements to provide the optimal estimates of the cardiac information.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives. To more {{reliably}} recover cardiac {{information from}} noise-corrupted, patient-specific measurements, {{it is essential}} to employ meaningful constraining models and adopt appropriate optimization criteria to couple the models with the measurements. Although biomechanical models have been extensively used for myocardial motion recovery with encouraging results, the passive nature of such constraints limits their ability to fully count for the deformation caused by active forces of the myocytes. To overcome such limitations, we propose to adopt a cardiac <b>physiome</b> model as the prior constraint for cardiac motion analysis. Materials and Methods. The cardiac <b>physiome</b> model comprises an electric wave propagation model, an electromechanical coupling model, and a biomechanical model, which are connected through a cardiac system dynamics for a more complete description of the macroscopic cardiac physiology. Embedded within a multiframe state-space framework, the uncertainties of the model and the patient's measurements are systematically dealt with to arrive at optimal cardiac kinematic estimates and possibly beyond. Results. Experiments have been conducted to compare our proposed cardiac-physiome-model-based framework with the solely biomechanical model-based framework. The results show that our proposed framework recovers more accurate cardiac deformation from synthetic data and obtains more sensible estimates from real magnetic resonance image sequences. Conclusion. With the active components introduced by the cardiac <b>physiome</b> model, cardiac deformations recovered from patient's medical images are more physiologically plausible...|$|E
