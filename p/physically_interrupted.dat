Evidently the networks had not been <b>physically</b> <b>interrupted,</b> as the Internet transit traffic through Egypt, such as traffic flowing from Europe to Asia, was unaffected. Instead, the government shut down the border gateway protocol (BGP) sessions announcing local routes. BGP is responsible for routing traffic between ISPs.|$|E

However, since these values are generated artificially based on perfect future knowledge and actually forced breaks of the connection, they are idealized as well. It was to be expected, that the enhanced RAPID implementation does not reach the same performance in any case, if the routing takes its own decisions based on the knowledge it has at that time. This most likely results from differences {{in the treatment of}} <b>physically</b> <b>interrupted</b> connections and the periodic contact-aware recalculations.|$|E
40|$|Constructive {{mechanisms}} in the auditory system may restore a fragmented sound when {{a gap in}} this sound is rendered inaudible by noise to yield a continuity illusion. Using combined psychoacoustic and electroencephalography experiments in humans, {{we found that the}} sensory-perceptual mechanisms that enable restoration suppress auditory cortical encoding of gaps in interrupted sounds. When <b>physically</b> <b>interrupted</b> tones are perceptually restored, stimulus-evoked synchronization of cortical oscillations at approximately 4 Hz is suppressed as if physically uninterrupted sounds were encoded. The restoration-specific suppression is induced most strongly in primary-like regions in the right auditory cortex during illusorily filled gaps and also shortly before and after these gaps. Our results reveal that spontaneous modulations in slow evoked auditory cortical oscillations that are involved in encoding acoustic boundaries may determine the perceived continuity of sounds in noise. Such fluctuations could facilitate stable hearing of fragmented sounds in natural environments...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new {{phenotype}} mapping to thet-complex, {{which is}} designatedBrachyury the Second(T 2), {{is characterized by}} a slightly shortened tail in heterozygotes and homozygous failure to form an organized notochord with subsequent abnormal development of posterior somites and neural tube. The phenotype ofT 2 superficially resembles that ofBrachyury;however, there are several important differences. Brachyuryhomozygotes fail to make posterior somites, notochord, floor plate, and a placental connection, resulting in death by 10. 5 days of development. In contrast,T 2 homozygotes make posterior somites, scattered notochord cells, and floorplate and achieve an allantoic connection. However, despite making a maternal connection,T 2 homozygotes cease development at E 11. 5 and die soon after. We have cloned and analyzed the transgene insertion site, which maps within 100 kb of theBrachyurygene, but does not seem to <b>physically</b> <b>interrupt</b> nor affect transcription from that locus. The existence of a second gene mapping nearBrachyuryand affecting the same developmental processes was alluded to over 50 years ago and has been debated ever since. An embryological description ofT 2 is presented, as is a discussion of the implications of a single, largerBrachyurylocus versus two closely linked genes coordinately regulating axial development...|$|R

However, the mechanism by which QS and metabolic networks have coevolved to support stable public good cooperation and maintenance of the cooperative group remains unknown. Here we explored the underlying mechanisms of QS-controlled central metabolism in the evolutionary aspects of cooperation. In Burkholderia glumae, the QS-dependent glyoxylate cycle {{plays an important role in}} cooperativity. A bifunctional QS-dependent transcriptional regulator, QsmR, rewired central metabolism to utilize the glyoxylate cycle rather than the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Defects in the glyoxylate cycle caused metabolic imbalance and triggered high expression of the stress-responsive chaperonin GroEL. High-level expression of GroEL in glyoxylate cycle mutants interfered with the biosynthesis of a public resource, oxalate, by <b>physically</b> <b>interrupting</b> the oxalate biosynthetic enzyme ObcA. Under such destabilized cooperativity conditions, spontaneous mutations in the qsmR gene in glyoxylate cycle mutants occurred to relieve metabolic stresses, but these mutants lost QsmR-mediated pleiotropy. Overcoming the metabolic restrictions imposed on the population of cooperators among glyoxylate cycle mutants resulted in the occurrence and selection of spontaneous qsmR mutants despite the loss of other important functions. These results provide insight into how QS bacteria have evolved to maintain stable cooperation via QS-mediated metabolic coordination...|$|R

40|$|In a {{practical}} situation, the control engineer may have experience with his system {{and have some}} insight into its dynamic behaviour. This paper suggests a theoretical method for making use of this background knowledge in the feedback control design process by manipulating the frequency response information available in the plant transfer function matrix H (s) into a form suitable for physical interpretation. The approach used is that of dyadic expansion of H (s). The technique represents {{an extension of the}} dyadic approximation method used in the analysis of nuclear reactor spatial control systems to include a description of interactions in a general case. However, under stated conditions, the representation given in this paper is exact. As the aim of the paper is to enable frequency response data to be <b>interrupted</b> <b>physically,</b> the method described does not generate a complete design technique. Examples indicate,however, that, if used with physical intuition, the procedure can provide guidelines to practical controller structures for highly interacting systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{spinal cord}} injury <b>physically</b> <b>interrupts</b> the long {{distance}} sensory and motor connections between cortex and the spinal cord {{as well as local}} circuits resulting in permanently dysfunctional or paralytic body parts. The axotomised neurons that survive the injury cannot regenerate their lost axons in the adult CNS. Therefore, treating the spinal cord injured is a daunting challenge posed to the neuroscience community. Our largely incomplete understanding of how the CNS responds to the injury adds to the difficulty in designing effective treatments. Over the last two decades researchers have focused on the question: why do neurons in the adult CNS not regenerate? The experiments driven by this question have led to the key concept of neurite outgrowth inhibitors, e. g. the protein Nogo-A. The concept and its significance in the injured spinal cord is summarised in chapter one. In the same two decades the adult cortex {{has been found to be}} surprisingly plastic. After peripheral injuries, the denervated cortex is largely reactivated by injury spared body parts. What little is known about {{spinal cord injury}} from a cortical perspective is reviewed in chapter two. A few years back, through anatomical tract tracing and intracortical stimulation after thoracic spinal cord injury in rats, it was suggested that the injury affected hindlimb cortex participates in forelimb movements. Axotomised hindlimb corticospinal neurons were proposed to influence forelimbs after the injury. In chapter three we find that indeed axotomised hindlimb corticospinal neurons can rewire to the forelimb after spinal cord injury. This rewiring was accompanied by representational changes in the cortex, such that the forelimb area now encroached into the hindlimb field. The involvement of axotomised corticospinal neurons in the plastic process was indeed surprising. The subsequent question was: does the spinal cord injury influence the synapses in the hindlimb area? We answered this question by taking advantage of transgenic mice that expressed a fluorescent protein in some cortical neurons to reveal the specialised synaptic protrusions or spines. Our results from a time course study in which we determined the synaptic spine density of both axotomised and non-axotomised cortical output neurons in the hindlimb field are described in chapter four. Our findings point towards a selective disconnection of cortical output neurons from a dysfunctional hindlimb circuitry while maintaining connectivity with the intact forelimb. The fifth chapter reveals the cortical plasticity that occurs after a spinal cord injury that models the Brown-Séquard syndrome in rats. A unilateral cervical spinal cord hemisection induced sprouting of corticospinal neurons from the intact side to the injury inflicted half of the spinal cord in both cervical and lumbar segments. We mapped these neurons in the cortex to find that forelimb-hindlimb somatotopy emerges over time in the newly formed corticospinal representation. The sensory input from the injured hindlimb was able to reach this representation in the ipsilateral cortex. In the sixth chapter we describe a simple modification of BOLD-fMRI analysis that enabled the monitoring of representational changes in the adult cortex after spinal cord injury. In summary, the adult cortex undergoes significant remodelling after a spinal cord injury. This remodelling incorporates neurons both directly and indirectly affected by the injury. The cellular changes of corticospinal neurons appear to be related to the larger scheme of representational changes involving the injury spared and sensory deprived cortices. Yet the cortical perspective of spinal cord injury remains incomplete. Now it is to be determined, if these changes are beneficial or need to be reversed to optimally treat the spinal cord injured patient...|$|R

But she was in a mood when it is almost <b>physically</b> disagreeable to <b>interrupt</b> the stride of one's thought, and she walked up and down two or three times under the trees before approaching his staircase. She liked getting hold of some book which neither her father or mother had read, and keeping it to herself, and gnawing its contents in privacy, and pondering the meaning without sharing her thoughts with any one, or having to decide whether the book was a good one or a bad one. This evening she had twisted the words of Dostoevsky to suit her mood--a fatalistic mood--to proclaim that the process of discovery was life, and that, presumably, the nature of one's goal mattered not at all. She sat down for a moment upon one of the seats; felt herself carried along in the swirl of many things; decided, in her sudden way, {{that it was time to}} heave all this thinking overboard, and rose, leaving a fishmonger's basket on the seat behind her.
