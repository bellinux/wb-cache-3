40|$|<b>PURPOSE.</b> Long-term medical <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>glaucoma</b> has {{an effect}} on the conjunctiva, {{possibly}} affecting the outcome of subsequent filtering surgery. The type and extent of these tissue changes caused by frequently used medications is important. An animal study using rabbits was performed to assess the tissue changes caused by timolol, latanoprost, and a combination of both substances. METHODS. Rabbits were treated with timolol, latanoprost, or a combination of these drugs for 18 months. Conjunctival specimens were examined by light microscopy, quantitative transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 2. RESULTS. By electron microscopy, the area of subepithelial collagen was significantly larger (P � 0. 03; Mann–Whitne...|$|R

40|$|Glaucoma is an {{irreversible}} blinding {{eye disease}} which produces progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss. Intraocular pressure (IOP) {{is currently the}} only modifiable risk factor, and lowering IOP results in reduced risk of progression of the disorder. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has attracted considerable attention as a potential target for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> {{largely due to the}} observed IOP lowering effects seen after administration of exogenous cannabinoids. However, recent evidence has suggested that modulation of the ECS may also be neuroprotective. This paper will review the use <b>of</b> cannabinoids in <b>glaucoma,</b> presenting pertinent information regarding the pathophysiology <b>of</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and how alterations in cannabinoid signalling may contribute to glaucoma pathology. Additionally, the mechanisms and potential for the use of cannabinoids and other novel agents that target the endocannabinoid system in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>glaucoma</b> will be discussed...|$|R
