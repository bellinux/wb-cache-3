5|$|Cane later {{explains}} to Rose that Polk {{had been his}} commander of an artillery battery at a battle {{which could have been}} a victory but that Polk <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> ran, depressing his men, with those who didn't desert their positions being decimated, including Cane's brothers, or captured like Cane himself. Rose makes Cane promise not to harm Polk, but still has Polk placed in protective custody.|$|E
5|$|In either 549 or 550, the Gepids and Lombards again marched {{against each}} other but, {{according}} to Procopius, both armies <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> no battle took place. As a result, a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted Audoin's request for a two-year truce. According to István Boná, the panic {{may be linked to}} a natural phenomenon: a lunar eclipse took place on June 25/26, 549.|$|E
5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm.

5|$|As {{the rebel}} forces {{advanced}} towards his enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios (or, {{according to the}} Alexiad, his brother John, who commanded the right wing) rallied his men and led forth the second line. This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, they fell upon the Immortals, who also <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled, abandoning their posts. Although they suffered some casualties from Bryennios's pursuing men, most managed to escape well {{to the rear of}} Alexios's army.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French {{and their}} Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced {{forces and the}} general was mortally wounded. After {{suffering}} devastating casualties, the British <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> retreated in disarray. Washington rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, he demonstrated bravery and stamina, despite his lingering illness. He had two horses shot from underneath him, while his hat and coat were pierced by several bullets. Two-thirds of the British force of 976 men were killed or wounded in the battle. Washington's conduct in the battle redeemed his reputation among many who had criticized his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.|$|E
5|$|In the final, Jastremski {{attacked}} {{from the}} outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> accelerated in the third 50m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had enough energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win {{the gold medal in}} a new world record time of 2min 27.8s, a margin of 0.4s, with Jastremski a further 1.4s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win.|$|E

5|$|PerdiccasII {{sided with}} Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, {{but he was}} forced to retreat owing to a {{shortage}} of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, {{and he was able to}} put down Arrhabaeus's revolt.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Berat in Albania by {{the forces}} of the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily against the Byzantine {{garrison}} of the city took place in 1280–1281. Berat was a strategically important fortress, whose possession would allow the Angevins access to the heartlands of the Byzantine Empire. A Byzantine relief force arrived in spring 1281, and managed to ambush and capture the Angevin commander, Hugo de Sully. Thereupon, the Angevin army <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled, suffering heavy losses in killed and wounded as it was attacked by the Byzantines. This defeat ended the threat of a land invasion of the Byzantine Empire, and along with the Sicilian Vespers marked the end of the Western threat to reconquer Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{arose from}} the Third Mithridatic War being fought between Roman Republic and Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose {{daughter}} Cleopatra was married to Tigranes. Mithridates fled to seek shelter with his son-in-law, and Rome invaded the Kingdom of Armenia. Having laid siege to Tigranocerta, the Roman forces fell back behind a nearby river when the large Armenian army approached. Feigning retreat, the Romans crossed at a ford and fell on the right flank of the Armenian army. After the Romans defeated the Armenian cataphracts, the balance of Tigranes' army, which was mostly made up of raw levies and peasant troops from his extensive empire, <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled, and the Romans remained {{in charge of the}} field.|$|E

5|$|Thompson's {{actions were}} {{initially}} overlooked by division commanders, who instead {{focused on the}} poor performance of the 24th Infantry Regiment, whose soldiers <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled from combat. Thompson's battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Melvin Blair, initially refused to submit a recommendation, until 4 January 1951, {{five months after the}} action. Thompson initially received a Silver Star Medal for the action, but after Blair changed his mind he began pushing the paperwork through, personally locating the witnesses who could attest to Thompson's valor. Blair hoped Thompson's recognition would improve other commanders' views on the 24th Infantry Regiment. Eventually, though, that unit was disbanded and its personnel integrated into other units.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|In 1451 {{during the}} Wars of the Roses Taunton {{was the scene}} of a {{skirmish}} between Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon, and Baron Bonville. Queen Margaret and her troops passed through in 1471 to defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury. In the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 most of the Cornish gentry supported Perkin Warbeck's cause and on 17 September a Cornish army some 6,000 strong entered Exeter before advancing on Taunton. Henry VII sent his chief general, Giles, Lord Daubeney, to attack the Cornish and when Warbeck heard that the King's scouts were at Glastonbury he <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> deserted his army. Henry VII reached Taunton on 4 October 1497 where he received the surrender of the remaining Cornish army. The ringleaders were executed and others fined a total of £13,000.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Arcadiopolis {{was fought}} in 970 between a Byzantine army under Bardas Skleros and a Rus' army, the latter also {{including}} allied Bulgarian, Pecheneg and Hungarian (Magyar) contingents. In the preceding years, the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav had conquered Bulgaria, {{and was now}} menacing Byzantium as well. The Rus' force had been advancing through Thrace towards Constantinople when it was met by Skleros' force. Having fewer men than the Rus', Skleros prepared an ambush and attacked the Rus' army with {{a portion of his}} force. The Byzantines then feigned retreat, and succeeded in drawing off the Pecheneg contingent into the ambush, routing it. The remainder of the Rus' army then <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled, and suffered heavy casualties from the pursuing Byzantines. The battle was important as it bought time for the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes to settle his internal problems and assemble a large expedition, which eventually defeated Sviatoslav the next year.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Ngasaunggyan broke {{the back of}} Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several {{thousand}} men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found {{the heat of the}} searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270km south. After the defeat, the king <b>panicked,</b> <b>and</b> fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan.|$|E
5|$|The next match pitted the Undertaker against Kamala, who was {{accompanied}} by his manager, Harvey Wippleman, and his handler, Kim Chee. Kamala attacked before the match but the Undertaker blocked the attack and punched Kamala repeatedly before performing a chop from the top rope on his opponent. The Undertaker attempted the same move again, but Wippleman knocked the Undertaker off the rope. Kamala knocked the Undertaker outside the ring, where the Undertaker attacked Wippleman and Kim Chee. Back inside the ring, the Undertaker gained the advantage by executing a chokeslam and a clothesline. When the Undertaker attempted his signature move, the Tombstone Piledriver, Kim Chee ran into the ring and hit the Undertaker with a pith helmet. As a result, Kamala was disqualified and the Undertaker won the match. Kamala kept on attacking and hit Undertaker {{with a series of}} splashes and seemingly left his opponent unconscious. When the Undertaker suddenly sat up and looked directly at the Ugandan Giant, Kamala, Whippleman and Kim Chee <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled ringside with The Undertaker and Paul Bearer slowly walking in pursuit.|$|E

5|$|The revolt {{intensified}} after Essad's exile. In {{order to}} gain support from the 1,000 Mirdita Catholic paid volunteers from the northern mountains, Prince of Wied appointed their leader, Prênk Bibë Doda, as foreign minister. Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo, also joined the International Gendarmerie to fight the rebels. Dutch gendarmes together with the Mirdita attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged on May23, they were surrounded and captured, along with another expedition from Durrës which attempted to release the captured gendarmes. Captain Sar {{did not know that}} the northern Catholic tribes refused to fight the rebels because General Besa was agreed when the Prince of Wied took over the throne. Rebels attacked Durrës, firing on it with light weapons. The people in Durrës <b>panicked,</b> <b>and</b> the Prince took his family to shelter in an Italian ship anchored in the bay.|$|E
5|$|The scouts were {{pursued by}} the disorganized militia and several were killed. The {{surviving}} scouts arrived at Black Hawk's camp ahead of the militia and reported the events. At the camp, the warriors set up a skirmish line in order {{to fend off the}} pending militia attack. The militia soldiers, intent on pursuing the scouts, chased them back toward the main force of Black Hawk's warriors and their skirmish line. Black Hawk and his force concealed themselves and ambushed the pursuers. Believing that thousands of Sauk and Fox were attacking them, the militia <b>panicked</b> <b>and</b> fled back to the main force camped at Dixon's Ferry. Stillman's exact whereabouts are unknown during this point in the battle. His later account published in a newspaper did not mention his location and noted his only order was to retreat. Stillman's account, published in the Missouri Republican, has been called fanciful.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{spends time}} with her {{daughter}} Lacey (Mary Mouser), who is upset about having Kate in her father's life. Megan comforts her, and Lacey reassures Megan that Kate will not replace her. Megan visits the new crime scene, investigating why Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), is found dead. On the other case, it is revealed that Martin is not the father of Julie's child, but after much evidence is checked, {{it is in fact}} Patrick, the person who was killed in Megan's case. Julie had asked his old school friend Patrick to be the father of her child, as she wanted someone that she knew. Her request made both Patrick his partner, Steve Turtell (Michael Dean Connolly) cry. The couple and Julie had not told Martin, as Martin divorced ex-wife Alexandra after Patrick introduced Julie to Martin, when he was decorating the Loeb's house. It is revealed that Alan, the financial director, killed both Patrick and Julie. Alan kept stealing from Martin, and was found out by Patrick, so he beat him to death. Julie also found out, so he <b>panicked,</b> <b>and</b> shot her. Alan begs for forgiveness towards Martin, who in anger, shoots Alan, in front of Bud and Samantha and is consequently arrested, whilst Alan dies.|$|E
