5|$|The Regency Acts {{allow for}} regencies {{in the event}} of a monarch who is a minor or who is <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> mentally incapacitated. When a regency is necessary, the next {{qualified}} individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that the Duke of Edinburgh (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{embarked}} {{on her first}} headlining concert tour, the Music Box Tour. Due to stage fright, Carey had not toured to promote her previous albums and did not originally plan a tour to support Music Box. However, after the continued success of the album and persuasion from Tommy Mottola, Carey agreed. Because Carey did not feel <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> emotionally ready for an extensive tour, six concerts were scheduled, each with many days in between, {{in order to give}} her voice time to rest. An extra performance at Proctor's Theatre was planned; there, Carey filmed the one-hour special Here Is Mariah Carey for release during the Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{the first}} Capcom-designed Vs. {{installment}} to be rendered fully in 3D. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and its graphical characteristics were optimized for the Wii, which prevents the game from being ported to other consoles without completely re-building the game. Niitsuma explained that its Wii exclusivity was also {{due to a lack}} of Capcom fighting games for the console, and because the Wii's casual quality matches the Vs. series trait of accessibility. The producer suggested that porting a sequel would be easier, but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making such plans. On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's senior vice president Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell Tatsunoko vs. Capcom <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> digitally.|$|E
5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examined whether preschool-aged children show less {{trust in}} <b>physically</b> disabled <b>or</b> obese informants. In Study 1, when learning about novel physical activities and facts, 4 - and 5 -year-olds preferred {{to endorse the}} testimony of a physically abled, non-obese informant rather than a <b>physically</b> disabled <b>or</b> obese one. In Study 2, after seeing that the <b>physically</b> disabled <b>or</b> obese informant was previously reliable whereas the physically abled, non-obese one was unreliable, 4 - and 5 -year-olds did not show a significant preference for either informant. We conclude that {{in line with the}} literature on childrenâ€™s negative stereotypes of <b>physically</b> disabled <b>or</b> obese others, preschoolers are biased against these individuals as potential sources of new knowledge. This bias is robust in that past reliability might undermine its effect on children, but cannot reverse it...|$|R

25|$|Employment {{background}} checks and legitimate firearms purchases cause citizens to be permanently {{recorded in the}} system. For instance, the State of Washington mandates that all applicants seeking employment in an inpatient setting that houses vulnerable minors (such as children who are mentally challenged, <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> emotionally ill) are fingerprinted and entered into IAFIS {{as part of their}} background check in order to determine if the applicant has any record of criminal behavior.|$|E
25|$|Usually the victim's {{fears are}} based in reality, as she may lack the social support, {{financial}} means, or may be too <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> emotionally disabled to survive on her own. Victims may have low self-esteem, suffer from Stockholm Syndrome, and are often {{led to believe that}} the abuse is their fault, that they deserved it, and, due to misplaced feelings of loyalty, or fear of retaliation from their abuser, may be unwilling to press charges against their abuser.|$|E
25|$|Neglect is {{a passive}} form of abuse {{in which a}} {{caregiver}} responsible for providing care for a victim (a child, a <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> mentally disabled adult, an animal, a plant, or an inanimate object) fails to provide adequate care for the victim's needs, {{to the detriment of}} the victim. It is typically seen as a form of laziness or apathy on the form of the caregiver, rather than ignorance due to inability; accordingly, neglect of a child by and adult with mental disorders or who is overworked is not considered abuse, although this may constitute child neglect nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive dissonance {{occurs to}} a person {{when he or she}} voluntarily engages in (<b>physically</b> <b>or</b> ethically) {{unpleasant}} activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} in {{research is to}} entrap biomolecules for sensory (biosensors) or catalytic purposes, by <b>physically</b> <b>or</b> chemically preventing them from leaching out and, {{in the case of}} protein or chemically-linked small molecules, by shielding them from the external environment yet allowing small molecules to be monitored. The major disadvantages are that the change in local environment may alter the functionality of the protein or small molecule entrapped and that the synthesis step may damage the protein. To circumvent this, various strategies have been explored, such as monomers with protein friendly leaving groups (e.g. glycerol) and the inclusion of polymers which stabilize protein (e.g. PEG).|$|E
25|$|The Servicemen's Dependents Allowance Act of 1942 {{provided}} {{family allowances}} for dependents of enlisted men.
