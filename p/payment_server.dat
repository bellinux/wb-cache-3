It chose the latter in order to offer better security, especially on the Internet payment side. Therefore, InternetCash required merchants to redirect the customer to a new web page, which was operated by InternetCash and was called the [...] "InternetCash payment window", where they would type in their card number and PIN. Part of the card number together with the transaction details and timestamp was then digitally signed by that window (using InternetCash's hardware encryption devices) and then sent back to the merchant for storage and reference. The digital signature and the transaction details were then sent to InternetCash's <b>payment</b> <b>server,</b> where the transaction was completed. This two-stage approach allowed full flexibility on the deployment of the [...] "InternetCash Payment Window", which was effectively providing the payment security to the system, so it could be run on separate servers than the actual [...] "banking" [...] system, which maintained the card balances and performed the transactions.|$|E

Setting up the KOPEK Payment System is easy, the system consist of the KOPEK <b>Payment</b> <b>Server</b> {{as well as an}} end user client. The server is installed so that it will be exposed to the desired customers, usually directly on the Internet. It can be installed in front an existing web server that handles more advanced content or services than the KOPEK <b>Payment</b> <b>Server</b> itself supports. Access to the content or the service will then be controlled by the rules configured in the KOPEK <b>Payment</b> <b>Server.</b> The KOPEK client application will be used from any end user who will access that content in order to identify the end user and make sure the user has met the requirements defined in the KOPEK <b>Payment</b> <b>Server.</b> Simple license control over personal licenses can be achieved by creating a web page and make the KOPEK <b>Payment</b> <b>Server</b> control access to that web page. An application can then try to access that web page and will only proceed if the web page can be read. If the web page cannot be read, the end user hasn 9 ̆ 2 t met the requirements defined in the KOPEK <b>Payment</b> <b>Server</b> and hence the end user doesn 9 ̆ 2 t have a valid license. This results in support for quite advanced copy protection when using the KOPEK Payment System. The copy protection can be further enhanced by also using the KOPEK Payment Systems support for centralized electronic identification systems, like the Norwegian BankID or BuyPass. In the market there exists some solutions that have specialized in license control and copy protection. These solutions seem to cover most of the more advanced licensing models, but none of these solutions can supply both a complete solution for license control and copy protection as well as a solution for electronic distribution of the licenses. There would probably be a market for such complete solutions and since the KOPEK Payment System already support both electronic distribution of licenses and can be used for simple license control an expansion of the KOPEK Payment System to also support more advanced license control. However, the KOPEK Payment System has some obvious weaknesses when it comes to dependence on an Internet connection and that both the company responsible for the KOPEK Payment System central servers as well as the company responsible for the KOPEK <b>Payment</b> <b>Server</b> used for license control can continue to keep the servers operative...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—HTTP is {{a popular}} channel for malware to com-municate with {{malicious}} servers (e. g., Command & Control, drive-by download, drop-zone), {{as well as to}} attack benign servers. By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, iden-tifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using <b>payment</b> <b>servers),</b> and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as As-sociated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cybercriminals use {{different}} types of geographi-cally distributed servers to run their operations such as C&C servers for managing their malware, exploit servers to distribute the malware, <b>payment</b> <b>servers</b> for monetization, and redirectors for anonymity. Identifying the server infrastructure used by a cybercrime operation is fundamental for defenders, as it enables take-downs that can disrupt the operation and is a critical step towards identifying the criminals behind it. In this paper, we propose a novel active probing approach for detecting malicious servers and compromised hosts that listen for (and react to) incoming network requests. Our approach sends probes to remote hosts and examines their responses, determining whether the remote hosts are malicious or not. It identifies different malicious server types as well as malware that listens for incoming traffic such as P 2 P bots. Compared with existing defenses, our active probing approach is fast, cheap, easy to deploy, and achieves Internet scale. We have implemented our active probing approach in a tool called CyberProbe. We have used CyberProbe to identify 151 malicious servers and 7, 881 P 2 P bots through 24 localized and Internet-wide scans. Of those servers 75 % are unknown to publicly available databases of malicious servers, indicating that CyberProbe can achieve up to 4 times better coverage than existing techniques. Our results reveal an important provider locality property: operations hosts an average of 3. 2 servers on the same hosting provider to amortize the cost of setting up {{a relationship with the}} provider.

40|$|In {{recent times}} {{the usage of}} smart phones has {{significantly}} increased. Businesses are transforming to make more out of smart phones. As a consequence, there is an increasing demand to {{have more and more}} mobile applications. Among other areas, mobile applications are also being used to make financial transactions. Applications used for financial transactions need to be more reliable and have end-to-end security. To implement security we heavily depend on cryptography and the heart of cryptography is the keys which are used in cryptographic processes (encryption/decryption). Therefore, it is essential not only to protect, but also to properly manage these keys, so that a robust and secure system can be achieved. This research work provides a complete implementation of symmetric key management for mobile phone applications with a focus on financial data using a key hierarchy approach. We have developed a key management system which allows smart phones to download the cryptographic key hierarchy. This key hierarchy is used to encrypt and decrypt financial data, such as PIN and other transaction information. Using this application (key management system), we can achieve an end-to-end security between client (mobile phones) and <b>payment</b> <b>server</b> (banking server).

40|$|Nowadays, {{electronic}} payment system {{is an essential part}} of modern business. Credit cards or debit cards have been widely used for on-site or remote transactions, greatly reducing the need for inconvenient cash transactions. However, there have been a huge number of incidents of credit card frauds over the Internet due to the security weakness of {{electronic payment}} system. A number of solutions have been proposed in the past to prevent this problem, but most of them were inconvenient and did not satisfy the needs of cardholders and merchants at the same time. In this thesis, we present a new secure card payment system called NNCC (No Number Credit Card) that significantly reduces the possibility of credit card frauds. This scheme is primarily designed for on-line shopping. NNCC is based on the Kerberos cryptographic framework that has been proven to be secure after being used in real world for decades. In this proposed system, instead of card numbers, only the payment tokens are exchanged between the buyers and merchants. The token is generated based on the payment amount, the client information, and merchant information. However it does not contain the credit card number, so the merchant cannot acquire and illegally use the credit card number. A token is cryptographically secure and valid only for the designated merchant, so it is robust against eavesdropping. This thesis describes the underlying cryptographic schemes, the operating principles, and the system design. It explains the concept of Kerberos and the background in Cryptography. Then it discusses the new proposed system and the associated payment processes. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype comprised of ecommerce web sites, client modules, <b>payment</b> <b>server,</b> and database.

For instance, mobile applications have evolved in different sectors such as healthcare patient support, geographic mapping and positioning, banking, e-commerce payment services and others. This study focuses {{on one of the most}} sensitive applications, which is mobile payment. Mobile payment system being one of the widely expanding mobile services, it has security concerns that prevented its wide acceptance. Some of the main security services given prior attention in mobile payment are issues of privacy, authentication and confidentiality. The research concentrates on the strong authentication of a mobile client to its server, securing the credit card* information and use of mobile card reader while making payments that enable customers to protect privacy of financial credentials. The strong authentication mechanism mainly follows the NIST standard publications namely, FIPS PUB 201 and FIPS 196; which are standards on Entity Authentication using public key cryptography and PKI credential storage Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card respectively. The proposed secure Credit Card Information (CCI) storage is in a secure element in order to prevent tampering of stored data. The secure element options are microSD, UICC, Smartcard (together with digital certificate and service ticket). During making payments, the payment information encrypted using a shared key is securely sent to <b>payment</b> <b>server.</b> A demo mobile application as proof of concept was implemented in a simulated lab (KTH SecLab), which has all the necessary infrastructure setup (servers, card reader) for testing the proposed solution.

40|$|Malware (e. g., trojans, bots, and spyware) {{is still}} a {{pervasive}} threat on the Internet. It is able to infect computer systems to further launch a variety of malicious activities such as sending spam, stealing sensitive information and launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In order to continue malevolent activities without being detected and to improve the efficiency of malicious activities, cyber-criminals tend to build malicious cyber infrastructures to communicate with their malware and to exploit benign users. In these infrastructures, multiple servers are set to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers), (iii) monetization (using <b>payment</b> <b>servers),</b> and (iv) robustness against server takedowns (using multiple backups {{for each type of}} server). The most straightforward way to counteract the malware threat is to detect malware directly on infected hosts. However, it is difficult since packing and obfuscation techniques are frequently used by malware to evade state-of-the-art anti-virus tools. Therefore, an alternate solution is to detect and disrupt the malicious cyber infrastructures used by malware. In this dissertation, we take an important step in this direction and focus on identifying malicious servers behind those malicious cyber infrastructures. We present a comprehensive inferring framework to infer servers involved in malicious cyber infrastructure based on the three roles of those servers: compromised server, malicious server accessed through redirection and malicious server accessed through directly connecting. We characterize these three roles from four novel perspectives and demonstrate our detection technologies in four systems: PoisonAmplifier, SMASH, VisHunter and NeighbourWatcher. PoisonAmplifier focuses on compromised servers. It explores the fact that cybercriminals tend to use compromised servers to trick benign users during the attacking process. Therefore, it is designed to proactively find more compromised servers. SMASH focuses on malicious servers accessed through directly connecting. It explores the fact that multiple backups are usually used in malicious cyber infrastructures to avoid server takedowns. Therefore, it leverages the correlation among malicious servers to infer a group of malicious servers. VisHunter focuses on the redirections from compromised servers to malicious servers. It explores the fact that cybercriminals usually conceal their core malicious servers. Therefore, it is designed to detect those ?invisible? malicious servers. NeighbourWatcher focuses on all general malicious servers promoted by spammers. It explores the observation that spammers intend to promote some servers (e. g., phishing servers) on the special websites (e. g., forum and wikis) to trick benign users and to improve the reputation of their malicious servers. In short, we build a comprehensive inferring framework to identify servers involved in malicious cyber infrastructures from four novel perspectives and implement different inference techniques in different systems that complement each other. Our inferring framework has been evaluated in live networks and/or real-world network traces. The evaluation results show that it can accurately detect malicious servers involved in malicious cyber infrastructures with a very low false positive rate. We found the three roles of malicious servers we proposed can characterize most of servers involved in malicious cyber infrastructures, and the four principles we developed for the detection are invariable across different malicious cyber infrastructures. We believe our experience and lessons are of great benefit to the future malicious cyber infrastructure study and detection...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} trends in the IT field today is to provide more {{mobility}} to existing IT based systems and users. With this trend, {{more and more people are}} using mobile financial transactions due to a widespread proliferation of mobile phones and wireless technologies. One of the most important concerns with such transactions is their security. The reasons are based on weaknesses of wireless protocols and additional requirements for handling of financial data. These aspects make mobile financial transactions and applications even more vulnerable to fraud and illegal use than similar transactions performed over fixed networks.   There are two important aspects related to security in mobile environments. First, security features provided by the communication protocols, such as GSM, SMS, Bluetooth, Mobile Internet, etc. are not adequate. Some security algorithms used by these protocols have even been broken, what requires upper layer applications to provide comprehensive protection in order to compensate the shortcomings of a transportation layer. Second, mobile devices have limited capabilities, limited processing speed, limited storage, etc, so that many security mechanisms are not suitable for mobile environments. Therefore, new, effective, lightweight and flexible security solutions are required.   In order to solve these two groups of security issues, in this research we created a service-oriented security infrastructure for mobile financial transactions and applications. Based on this infrastructure, we also designed and implemented a system, which is called SAFE (Secure Applications for Financial Environment), that represents a secure, convenient and reliable large–scale infrastructure for mobile financial transactions. The components of the system are Secure Mobile Wallet and three SAFE servers: Communications (Gateway) Server, IDMS (Identity Management System) Server, and <b>Payment</b> <b>Server.</b> Those core infrastructure components with secure messages exchanged between them provide a number of secure financial services.
