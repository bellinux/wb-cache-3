5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E

5|$|Portrayals of lesbians in {{the media}} suggest that society at large has been {{simultaneously}} intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others {{as a result of}} homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> health concerns arising from discrimination, prejudice, and minority stress. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open.|$|E
5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|In Britain, the Abortion Law Reform Association {{continued}} its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought {{the issue of}} abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists John Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act. On the grounds of reducing the amount of disease and death associated with illegal abortion, the Abortion Act allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to prevent grave permanent injury to the woman's <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> health, to avoid injury to the <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks, or if the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped. The free provision of abortions was provided through the National Health Service.|$|E

Abortion is condoned only in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or when a mother's <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> health is at risk. The Church opposes any legislation which would prevent women from obtaining abortions or information about abortions.|$|E

25|$|Fatigue is a {{subjective}} feeling of tiredness which {{is distinct from}} weakness, and has a gradual onset. Unlike weakness, fatigue can be alleviated by periods of rest. Fatigue can have <b>physical</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a muscle to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise. Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.|$|E
