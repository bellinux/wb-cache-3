25|$|Diazepam {{is mainly}} {{used to treat}} anxiety, insomnia, panic attacks and {{symptoms}} of acute alcohol withdrawal. It is also used as a <b>premedication</b> for inducing sedation, anxiolysis, or amnesia before certain medical procedures (e.g., endoscopy). Diazepam is the drug of choice for treating benzodiazepine dependence with its long half-life allowing easier dose reduction. Benzodiazepines have a relatively low toxicity in overdose.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{dose range}} for {{induction}} of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6mg/kg; however, {{there are many}} factors that can alter this. <b>Premedication</b> with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or clonidine will reduce requirements, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, and lean body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone {{and for that matter}} any other intravenous anaesthetic are: hypovolemia, burns, azotemia, hepatic failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.|$|E
500|$|Benzodiazepines {{enhance the}} effect of the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause [...] anterograde amnesia and dissociation. These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal and as a <b>premedication</b> for medical or dental procedures. Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.|$|E
50|$|When no <b>premedications</b> are used, {{alfaxalone}} causes animals (especially cats) to be agitated when recovering. Dogs {{and cats}} will paddle in the air, vocalize excessively, may remain rigid or twitch, and have exaggerated reactions to external stimuli such as light and noise. For this reason, {{it is recommended}} that animals recovering from anesthesia by alfaxalone stay in a quiet, dark area.|$|R
30|$|Monitoring {{was done}} by five-lead ECG, pulse oximeter, and noninvasive {{arterial}} blood pressure. Injection of <b>premedications</b> was done with atropine sulfate 0.01 [*]mg/kg intravenously and dexamethasone 0.2 [*]mg/kg intravenously. Induction of anesthesia {{was done by}} thiopental sodium 5 [*]mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 [*]mg/kg, and then oral endotracheal tube with appropriate size was inserted. Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved by isoflurane inhalation. Randomization was done by closed envelope method.|$|R
50|$|Alfaxalone, {{also known}} as alphaxalone or alphaxolone, is a neuroactive steroid and general anesthetic. It is used in {{veterinary}} practice under the trade name Alfaxan as an induction agent for anesthesia and as an injectable anesthetic. Though it is more expensive than other induction agents, it often preferred {{due to the lack}} of depressive effects on the cardiovascular system. The most common side effect is respiratory depression; when <b>premedications</b> aren't given, patients also become agitated and hypersensitive when waking up.|$|R
2500|$|Use of {{hydroxyzine}} for <b>premedication</b> as a sedative has no {{effects on}} tropane alkaloids, such as atropine, but may, following general anesthesia, potentiate meperidine and barbiturates, and use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified {{depending upon the}} state of the individual.|$|E

2500|$|Clonidine {{also has}} several off-label uses, {{and has been}} {{prescribed}} to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, sleep disorders, and hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders. [...] Clonidine is also a mild sedative, {{and can be used}} as <b>premedication</b> before surgery or procedures. Its epidural use for pain during heart attack, postoperative and intractable pain has also been studied extensively. [...] Clonidine has also been suggested as a treatment for rare instances of dexmedetomidine withdrawal. Clonidine can be used in restless legs syndrome. It {{can also be used to}} treat facial flushing and redness associated with rosacea. It has also been successfully used topically in a clinical trial as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine can also be used for migraine headaches and hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine has also been used to treat diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, diabetes, withdrawal-associated diarrhea, intestinal failure, neuroendocrine tumors and cholera.|$|E

Because of its relative long duration of residual effects (sedation, ataxia, hypotension, and amnesia), lorazepam <b>premedication</b> is best suited for hospital inpatient use.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{analysis of the}} records of about 9, 000 intravenous anaesthetics showed a striking relationship between dosage and induction complications. While the incidence of excitatory phenomena increased with dosage of thiobarbiturates, this effect was more marked with methylated barbiturates.

40|$|The first-generation taxanes, {{conventional}} paclitaxel and docetaxel, {{are established}} treatment options for adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, these agents have limitations, including primary/secondary resistance and harsh toxicities. The introduction of paclitaxel albumin represents a significant advance in taxane therapy {{as the first}} {{of a new generation of}} taxanes. This agent utilizes albumin pathways to achieve enhanced and targeted drug delivery to the tumour. The lack of solvent also means that it is well tolerated, despite the lack of <b>premedications.</b> Paclitaxel albumin is licensed in the United States and Europe as ≥ 2 nd-line therapy in MBC (260 mg/m 2 once every three weeks), but emerging evidence suggests it has activity in various settings as weekly therapy and in combination with other agents. Additional strategies to optimize taxane-based therapy are also being evaluated, including the possibility of tailoring treatment according to patient/disease characteristics, identifying predictive biomarkers and evaluating other novel taxanes. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|AbstractBackground {{and purpose}} : Differentiating acute tubular {{necrosis}} (ATN) from prerenal azotemia {{is crucial for}} selecting the appropriate treatment. Since urinary diagnostic modalities are usually unreliable because of <b>premedications,</b> a rapid and accurate diagnostic modality is needed. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the diagnostic value of Doppler ultrasonography in differentiating ATN form prerenal azotemia in children. Materials and methods : A total of 50 oliguric or anuric children with previous normal renal laboratory data entered in this study. Doppler examination and calculation of resistance index (RI) were performed within 24 hours of admission and in the recovery phase of ARF. Based on history, clinical follow-up and laboratory studies, diagnosis of underling cause of ARF was made and appropriate treatment started. The sensitivity and specificity of RI in differentiating ATN from prerenal azotemia were assessed.

Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of pemetrexed in NSCLC patients who had failed previous platinum-based chemo-therapy and had been salvaged with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment or not. Methods: Treatment consisted of pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion on day 1 of every 3 weeks. Standard <b>premedications</b> were given. Results: Between June 2005 and November 2006, 44 patients (pts) were treated. Thirty pts had been treated with TKI after they failed platinum-based chemotherapy. The mean age was 62.
