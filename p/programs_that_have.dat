However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of federal funds to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{screening}} <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{attempted to}} preclude soldiers exhibiting personality traits thought to predispose them to CSR {{have been a}} total failure. Part of this failure stems from the inability to base CSR morbidity on {{of one or two}} personality traits. Full psychological work-ups are expensive and inconclusive, while pen and paper tests are ineffective and easily faked. In addition, studies conducted following WWII screening programs showed that psychological disorders present during military training did not accurately predict stress disorders during combat.|$|E

25|$|While most {{universities}} have internship programs, UC Irvine {{is unique in}} starting two internship <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> become a mainstay for the whole University of California system. UC Irvine created the UCDC program in 1982 with four undergraduates; today, UCDC has nearly 50 UCI students in its summer program and maintains an equivalent academic year program. UCDC encourages students to seek internships in Washington, D.C., and houses them at the UC Washington Center. UCDC has since expanded to other UC campuses, with each campus administering their own summer and academic year programs. UC Irvine is also responsible for establishing the Sacramento Internship Program (SIP) in 2000. It is structurally similar to UCDC's summer program, but arranges for internships in the state capital and houses interns in a private apartment complex. SIP's academic year equivalent, the Scholar Intern Program, {{is administered by the}} UC Center Sacramento office.|$|E

500|$|In Malawi, primary {{education}} is compulsory (Revised Education Act 2012). In 1994, free {{primary education}} for all children was established by the government, which increased attendance rates. Dropout rates are higher for girls than boys, attributed to security problems during the long travel to school, as girls face a higher prevalence of gender-based violence. However, attendance rates for all children are improving, with enrollment rates for primary schools increased from 58% in 1992 to 75% in 2007, {{while the number of}} students who begin in standard one and complete standard five has increased from 64% in 1992 to 86% in 2006. However attendance in secondary school falls to approximately 25%, with attendance rates being slightly higher for males. [...] Youth literacy has also increased, moving from 68% in 2000 to 82% in 2007. This increase is primarily attributed to improved learning materials in schools, better infrastructure and feeding <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been implemented throughout the school system.|$|E
500|$|Ada devastated {{multiple}} resort {{islands in}} the Whitsundays, in some cases destroying virtually all facilities and guest cabins. The biggest resort, located on Daydream Island, was obliterated, with similar destruction seen on South Molle, Hayman, and Long islands; since most boats docked on these islands were destroyed, hundreds of tourists in these resorts became stranded and required emergency rescue. Based on {{the severity of the}} damage, wind gusts were later estimated at 220 km/h (140 mph). As Ada moved ashore, most homes were damaged or destroyed in communities near the storm's landfall point, including Cannonvale, Airlie Beach, and Shute Harbour. Extreme rainfall totals as high as [...] caused massive river flooding in coastal waterways between Bowen and Mackay. The floodwaters washed out roads and left some locations isolated for days. Offshore, seven people were missing and presumed dead after their fishing trawler encountered the cyclone. Ada killed a total of 14 people, including 11 at sea, and caused A$12 million in damage. The cyclone revealed inadequacies in the warning broadcast system, and served as the impetus for enhanced cyclone awareness <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been credited with saving lives in subsequent cyclones.|$|E
500|$|The episode makes {{references}} to several films and television shows. The Tracey Ullman Show {{is referred to}} as [...] "the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers", while the outtakes right before the commercial breaks parodies television series such as Roseanne and Home Improvement (which regularly aired similar outtakes). The deleted scene from [...] "$pringfield" [...] in which Homer plays blackjack with James Bond parodies the 1967 film Casino Royale. The deleted scene from [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] in which the robotic Richard Simmons is shot through the head and repairs itself parodies the liquid metal T-1000 in the 1991 film [...] The episode satirizes the Fox network in particular, as the two specials mentioned in the beginning, Alien Nose Job and Five Fabulous Weeks Of 'The Chevy Chase Show, are {{references to}} two actual <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> aired on the network: The Chevy Chase Show (1993) and [...] (1995). Several famous musical themes are used or parodied in the clips, such as when Homer sings the theme song from The Flintstones, and Johann Strauss II's Blue Danube is heard in the background of one scene. The show's producers are depicted as animated characters in the introduction: Groening is a bald Southern patriot who wields a gun wearing an eye patch, a reference to the promotional poster of the 1970 film Patton, and his own comic strip Life in Hell; Brooks is seen as Rich Uncle Pennybags, the tycoon from Monopoly; and Simon's appearance resembles Howard Hughes. One of Smithers' fantasies is a parody of Marilyn Monroe's famous happy birthday song to President John F. Kennedy, while another one is an allusion to Peter Pan flying through the window. The book that Krusty tries to sell is a reference to Madonna's book entitled Sex. [...] "NRA4EVER", the message that appears on a cash register during the opening sequence reference in a trivia question, is a reference to the National Rifle Association.|$|E
