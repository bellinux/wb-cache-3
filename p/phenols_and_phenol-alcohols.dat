Widespread studies on the biodegradation of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide {{have been carried out}} to overcome the environmental problems. This study provides an overview on the biological degradation of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide by isolated strain S. odorifera. For comparison three strains namely, A. chroococuum, E. coli and P. putida were also used for the degradation of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide. In this study, the effect of initial concentration of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide on their removal and biomass concentration was studied. It was observed that amongst these four bacteria percentage removal of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide, was found to be maximum for S. odorifera. The maximum tolerance level of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide for S. odorifera was found to be 1500 mg/l and 150 mg/l respectively.

30|$|Batch {{studies for}} the removal of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide from the binary {{component}} aqueous solution have been carried out using activated carbon acquired from coconut shell with immobilization of bacterium S. odorifera (MTCC 5700). Optimum conditions for simultaneous biosorption <b>and</b> bioaccumulation of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide were accomplished at CSAC dosage of 30  g/L, pH of 8, and temperature 30  °C with an initial concentration 500  mg/L of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> 50  mg/L of cyanide. Under the optimal conditions, maximum <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide removal efficiencies were acquired as 71.36 and 88.40  % from simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation process. In conclusion, a binary component system was found better than monocomponent biosorption system for the simultaneous elimination of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide using S. odorifera (MTCC 5700) immobilized onto CSAC biosorbent surface. In a binary component system among six multicomponent isotherms, extended Freundlich model indicate a better fit for both <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide. Therefore, a synergism effects were exhibited for both <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide, in binary component system. Among different kinetic models used in this study, Brouser–Weron–Sototlongo kinetic model as well as Fractal-like mixed first second order kinetic models for <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide found appropriate to calculate the adsorption kinetic onto CSAC.

30|$|The {{industrial}} wastewaters generally contain <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> its derivatives simultaneously. Hence, from {{a practical}} point of view, the results of adsorption from binary or multisolute systems are more relevant. Among those reported activated carbon adsorption works on multisolute systems were simultaneous removal of <b>phenol,</b> p-chlorophenol <b>and</b> p-nitrophenol by Kim et al.

In this study, Daphnia magna {{was used to evaluate}} the effectiveness of "baffle fixes film up flow sludge blanket filtration" (BFUSBF) system in elimination of phenolic compounds from water. Methods: D. magna cultures were used as toxicity index of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> 2, 4 -DNP mixtures after treatment by a pilot BFUSBF system which consisted of baffle in anoxic section and biofilm in aerobic sections. Initial concentrations were 312 mg/L <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> 288 mg/L 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (2, 4 -DNP). Results: Bioassay tests showed that D. magna was influenced by the toxicity of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> 2, 4 DNP mixtures. The comparison between the toxicity of initial <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> 2, 4 -DNP mixtures and the output toxic unit (TU) derived from BFUSBF treatment system showed that the TU of the effluent from BFUSBF reactor was much lower than that of the solution that entered the reactor. Conclusion: Based on the acute toxicity test, BFUSBF process could reduce <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> 2, 4 -DNP in aqueous solutions. Therefore, it is possible to use BFUSBF process as an appropriate treatment option for wastewaters containing phenolic compounds. ...|$|R

30|$|Currently, {{with the}} rapid {{increase}} of industries, water pollution problem has become progressively serious (Doney 2010). Among all pollutants enclosed in industrial wastewater, <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide are considered the most hazardous compounds for the environment (Busca et al. 2008; Vedula <b>and</b> Balomajumder 2011). <b>Phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide are regularly derived from wastewater generated from synthetic fuel processing, petrochemicals, and steel manufacturing industries comprises high concentrations of phenol (700 – 6000  mg/L), and cyanide (10 – 150  mg/L) (Kim et al. 2008; Liu et al. 1996). Moreover, <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide can also increase risks of heart pains, thyroid gland enlargement, breathing disorders, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, skin and eyes injuries, central nervous system, kidney, liver, lung damage, and even death (ATSDR 2006, 2008). Because of its several harmful effects, the elimination of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide from industrial wastewaters before their release into water bodies is measured to be essential (Lu et al. 2012). The maximum tolerance limit for <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide in drinking water according to the Minimum Nationals Standards (MINAS) of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in India and US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), is 0.5 and 0.2  mg/L, respectively (Busca et al. 2008; Akcil 2003). Numerous methods {{have been used for}} elimination of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide from wastewater comprising biosorption, solvent extraction, electrochemical oxidation, membrane separation, chemical coagulation, and photocatalytic degradation, etc. (Akcil 2003; Dash et al. 2009; Kujawski et al. 2004). Out of these treatment methods, biosorption has been established to be the superior method. It is a well-organized and inexpensive method for elimination of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide (Agarwal et al. 2013; Lin and Juang 2009; Singh et al. 2016). Therefore, numerous biosorbents have been established and widely used for biosorption of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> cyanide (Agarwal et al. 2013; Lin and Juang 2009; Singh et al. 2016; Daffalla et al. 2013).|$|R

The concentrations of <b>phenol</b> <b>and</b> o-cresol have been determined in aqueous solutions according to the linear dependence of quasi-catalytic peak currents with the concentration.
