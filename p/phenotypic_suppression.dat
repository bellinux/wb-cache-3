The underlying mechanisms have long remained a mystery. Mann and colleagues now dissect a mechanism of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> {{and find that}} posterior Hox AbdA can suppress activity of anterior Hox proteins only when they both bind to the same site.

40|$|Antibiotics that {{interfere}} reversibly {{with various}} aspects of ribosomal function (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, and spectinomycin) are shown to antagonize, at barely inhibitory concentrations, the inhibitory effect of low concentrations of streptomycin (SM) on the growth of Escherichia coli. Paradoxically, these compounds can also replace SM in supporting the growth of conditionally SM-dependent mutants. Chloramphenicol produced about as much <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> as SM in SM-sensitive strains, but less than that attainable with high concentrations of SM in resistant strains. The antagonism to SM inhibition and the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> appear to be specific for those growth inhibitors that act on the ribosome. Since inhibitors of the 50 S subunit of the ribosome (chloramphenicol, erythromycin) are as active as inhibitors of the 30 S subunit, {{it is suggested that}} <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> by borderline concentrations of ribosome inhibitors does not necessarily depend on an alteration of the recognition region of the ribosome. Alternatively, partial inhibition of the ribosomes might change the environment {{in a way that would}} influence the frequency of misreading. <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> by a low concentration of SM as well as by chloramphenicol was found to depend on the presence of a trace of the required growth factor...|$|E

In situ hybridization on the metaphase chromosomes indicated that in each cell line the TK sequences resided at a single chromosomal site and that integration occurred preferentially into regions of the cellular DNA rich in highly repetitive sequences.

40|$|Statins, {{competitive}} inhibitors of {{the rate}} limiting cholesterol/ergosterol enzymes HMG-CoA reductase (HMG 1 and HMG 2), are the most widely prescribed human therapeutic drugs. They are effective in lowering cholesterol levels in atherosclerosis and related syndromes. However, statins exhibit a range of pleiotropic side effects whose mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigates statin pleiotropy by analysis of genetic interaction networks in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which shows high homology to mammalian pathways affected by statins. Synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis allows elucidation of functional genetic networks of genes of interest ("query genes") by measurement of genetic epistasis in double mutants of the query gene with the genome - wide deletion mutant array of ~ 4800 non-essential strains. Chemicalgenetic profiling is similar where a SMP may effectively replace the query gene in genome wide epistatic analysis. The genetic interaction networks resulting from use of HMG 1 and HMG 2 as query genes for SGA analysis were compared to the chemical-genetic profiles of atorvastatin, cerivastatin and lovastatin. The genes ARV 1, BTS 1, OPI 3 displaying phenotypic enhancements (i. e. their deletion caused major growth inhibition) with statins became essential {{in the presence of}} all the statins. Two mitochondrial genes, COX 17 and MMM 1, showed <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppressions</b> (i. e. their deletion allowed better growth) in common to all three statin drugs. An attractive hypothesis is that major pleiotropic effects of statins could be due to variation in function or expression of these enhancing or suppressing genes. Other processes compensating statin use were also elucidated. For example, when HMG 1 and its epistatically interacting genes are shut down by deletion coupled with inhibition of HMG 2 with statin, there is strong evidence that the cell attempts to maintain membrane/lipid homeostasis via anterograde and retrograde transport mechanisms, including the mobilisation of lipid storage droplets. To aid refinement of genetic analysis in this and future studies, a more direct phenotypic assay was developed for quantifying ergosterol. Such an assay may be used as a phenotype to map the effect of up - and downstream - genes, or network genes affecting ergosterol levels. This assay was used to quantify ergosterol in a drug - resistant mutant developed by others aiding confirmation of the drug target...|$|R

Although myocardin {{has been shown}} to be a key regulator of this process, the role of its related factors, MKL 1 and MKL 2, in SMC phenotypic switching remains unknown. The present studies were aimed at determining if: (1) MKL factors contribute to the expression of SMC marker genes in cultured SMCs; and (2) platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) -induced repression of SMC marker genes is mediated by suppression of MKL factors. Results of gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that MKL factors regulated the expression of single and multiple CArG-containing SMC marker genes such as SM-actin and telokin, but not CArG-independent SMC marker genes such as smoothelin-B. Treatment with PDGF-BB reduced the expression of CArG-containing SMC marker genes as well as myocardin expression in cultured SMCs, while it had no effect on expression of MKL 1 and MKL 2.

Recent {{studies have shown that}} the Cbfa 1 (also known as Runx 2, AML- 3, and PEBP 2 alphaA) transcription factor supports commitment and differentiation of progenitor cells to hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts. This study addresses the functional involvement of Cbfa sites in expression of the Gallus BSP gene. Gel mobility shift analyses with nuclear extracts from ROS 17 / 2. 8 osteoblastic cells revealed that multiple Cbfa consensus sequences are functional Cbfa DNA binding sites. Responsiveness of the 1. 2 -kb Gallus BSP promoter to Cbfa factors Cbfa 1, Cbfa 2, and Cbfa 3 was assayed in osseous and nonosseous cells. Each of the Cbfa factors mediated repression of the wild-type BSP promoter, in contrast to their well known activation of various hematopoietic and skeletal <b>phenotypic</b> genes. <b>Suppression</b> of BSP by Cbfa factors was not observed in BSP promoters in which Cbfa sites were deleted or mutated. Expression of the endogenous BSP gene in Gallus osteoblasts was similarly downregulated by forced expression of Cbfa factors. Our data indicate that Cbfa repression of the BSP promoter does not involve the transducin-like enhancer (TLE) proteins. Neither coexpression of TLE 1 or TLE 2 nor the absence of the TLE interaction motif of Cbfa 1 (amino acids 501 to 513) influenced repressor activity. However, removal of the C terminus of Cbfa 1 (amino acids 362 to 513) relieved suppression of the BSP promoter. Our results, together with the evolutionary conservation of the seven Cbfa sites in the Gallus and human BSP promoters, suggest that suppressor activity by Cbfa is of significant physiologic consequence and may contribute to spatiotemporal expression of BSP during bone development...|$|R

These fragments, though stable for a short time, will ultimately degenerate by the procedures described in this report. One can, however, fuse cytoplasts to karyoplasts by using polyethylene glycol and obtain viable reconstituted cells whose properties may be useful for understanding some aspects of the nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions associated with tumorigenicity and steroidogenesis. However, the presence of cybrids, hybrids, and parental whole cell contaminants along with the reconstituted cell population make it necessary to have genetic markers that reside in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in order to preferentially identify reconstituted cells derived from a karyoplast fused to a cytoplast. By utilizing the Y- 1 cell line, which is tumorigenic and responds to corticotropin by secreting steroids, and the AMT-BU-A 1 (AMT) cell line, which is nontumorigenic and does not respond to corticotropin but has a nuclear marker, BrdUrdr, and a cytoplasmic marker, CAPr, we have reconstituted cells containing Y- 1 karyoplasts and AMT cytoplasts. In this report we extend our previous techniques by describing an identification procedure that allowed us to isolate cells reconstituted from AMT karyoplasts fused to Y- 1 cytoplasts.

40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} pathogenesis {{of lung cancer}} is necessary to identify biomarkers/targets specific to individual airway molecular profiles and to identify options for targeted chemoprevention. Herein, we identify mechanisms by which loss of microRNA (miRNA) 125 a- 3 p (miR 125 a) contributes to the malignant potential of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) harboring an activating point mutation of the K-ras proto-oncogene (HBEC K-ras). Among other miRNAs, we identified significant miR 125 a loss in HBEC K-ras lines and determined that miR 125 a is regulated by the PEA 3 transcription factor. PEA 3 is upregulated in HBEC K-ras cells, and genetic knockdown of PEA 3 restores miR 125 a expression. From a panel of inflammatory/angiogenic factors, we identified increased CXCL 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by HBEC K-ras cells and determined that miR 125 a overexpression significantly reduces K-ras-mediated production of these tumorigenic factors. miR 125 a overexpression also abrogates increased proliferation of HBEC K-ras cells and suppresses anchorage-independent growth (AIG) of HBEC K-ras/P 53 cells, the latter of which is CXCL 1 -dependent. Finally, pioglitazone increases levels of miR 125 a in HBEC K-ras cells via PEA 3 downregulation. In addition, pioglitazone and miR 125 a overexpression elicit similar <b>phenotypic</b> responses, including <b>suppression</b> of both proliferation and VEGF production.

40|$|Restricted until 28 Apr. 2010. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) infect the {{epithelial}} layer of cervical mucosa and are causally {{associated with the}} generation of cervical cancer. Although most women infected with HPV clear their lesions, the long latency period from infection to resolution indicates that HPV has evolved immune escape mechanisms. Langerhans cells (LC) are the resident antigen-presenting cells {{at the site of}} infection and therefore are responsible for initiating an immune response against HPV. However, LC exposed to HPV 16 L 1 L 2 virus-like particles do not induce an HPV-specific T cell response, suggesting that LC are targeted by HPV to evade immune detection. Herein we describe a novel immune escape mechanism of HPV 16 that targets LC function and identify therapeutic compounds to overcome the HPV 16 induced suppression of LC. We demonstrate that LC incubated with HPV 16 L 1 L 2 virus-like particles up-regulate phosphoinositide 3 -kinase activation while down-regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-κB pathways. When phosphoinositide 3 -kinase activation is inhibited and LC are subsequently exposed to HPV 16 L 1 L 2 virus-like particles, LC initiate a potent HPV-specific response, revealing that phosphoinositide 3 -kinase activation in LC is an escape mechanism utilized by HPV 16. Importantly, we also show that the minor capsid protein L 2 is responsible for the induction of this immune escape of HPV 16 through the manipulation of LC. Additionally, using pulldown assays we demonstrate that the N-terminus of L 2 associates with annexin A 2. Inhibiting the interaction between HPV 16 L 2 and annexin A 2 disrupts the internalization of HPV 16 L 1 L 2 virus-like particles by LC, indicating that annexin A 2 is the L 2 receptor for HPV 16, which likely initiates the immune escape mechanism of HPV 16 through LC.; Furthermore, we identify two molecules, 3 M- 002 (TLR 8 agonist) and resiquimod (TLR 8 / 7 agonist) that can overcome the <b>phenotypic</b> and functional <b>suppression</b> of LC previously exposed to HPV 16 L 1 L 2 virus-like particles.

The penA 2 locus, which confers an eightfold increase in resistance to penicillin, was not responsible for the increased resistance to steroid hormones. Phospholipids in the outer membrane of intact env- 2 cells were susceptible to digestion by phospholipase C, indicating exposure of phospholipid head groups on the outer surface. Cells of a wild-type and mtr- 2 strain were not susceptible to phospholipase C digestion unless they were pretreated with mixed exoglycosidases. This pretreatment also increased the sensitivity of mtr- 2 cells to progesterone inhibition of O 2 uptake. These data suggest that the permeability of the gonococcus to hydrophobic antibiotic and steroid molecules is mediated by the degree of phospholipid exposure on the outer membrane...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of misreading by streptomycin in vitro, previously {{observed with}} synthetic messengers, is now demonstrated with natural (endogenous or viral) messenger {{by the use}} of extracts of temperature sensitive mutants lacking Glu [...] tRNA or Val [...] tRNA synthetase. With chain-elongating but noninitiating ribosomes (i. e., purified polysomes) deprived of an aminoacyl [...] tRNA, streptomycin and other aminoglycosides, over a wide range of concentrations, stimulate incorporation. With ribosomes initiating in the presence of streptomycin stimulation is also observed but it is restricted, just like <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> in cells, to very low streptomycin concentrattions which evidently allow some ribosomes to initiate and later encounter them in the course of chain elongation. The stimulation is accompanied by an increase {{in the size of the}} products; hence, it is evidently due to substitution of an incorrect aminoacyl [...] tRNA for a missing one. The test introduced here also has revealed a misreading effect of streptomycin on resistant ribosomes. In addition, significant intrinsic misreading was observed without streptomycin, indicating that under optimal conditions for in vitro protein synthesis an empty codon is frequently read by an incorrect aminoacyl [...] tRNA...|$|E
40|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} of the Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV) genome {{has suggested}} that Tyr 1073 of the P 130 gag [...] fps protein-tyrosine kinase is a regulatory site. To investigate directly the ability of tyrosine phosphorylation to affect P 130 gag [...] fps kinase activity, the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and partially purified phosphotyrosyl phosphatases were used to manipulate the stoichiometry of P 130 gag [...] fps phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of P 130 gag [...] fps at Tyr 1073 correlated with enhanced kinase activity. The thermolabile phosphorylation, kinase activity and transforming ability of P 140 gag [...] fps encoded by a temperature-sensitive (ts) FSV variant were restored at the non-permissive temperature for transformation by incubation of infected cells with orthovanadate. In this case tyrosine phosphorylation can apparently functionally reactivate a conditionally defective v-fps kinase activity. These data suggest that reversible autophosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine within the v-fps kinase domain is a positive regulator of enzymatic activity and biological function. <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> of the tsFSV genetic defect by orthovanadate emphasizes the potential importance of phosphotyrosyl phosphatases in antagonizing tyrosine kinase action. It is suggested that autophosphorylation may constitute a molecular switch by which some protein-tyrosine kinases are activated...|$|E
40|$|Defects in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) cell cycle-controlling genes {{prevent the}} cell cycle progression. Mutations {{in one of}} the late {{septation}} genes, cdc 4, cause Sp cells to arrest at cytokinesis and result in an elongated cellular morphology. By functional complementation of one of the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant alleles of cdc 4, cdc 4 - 31, with a Sp cDNA library, a novel gene, scf 1, which suppresses the elongated ts phenotype of cdc 4 - 31, was isolated. DNA sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed homology with a small heat-shock protein family, HSP 12, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc). Expression of this gene is highly induced, both at 37 °C and in the stationary phase of cell growth. It is likely that scf 1 is expressed in stress conditions such as heat-shock or nutritional limitation. The <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> of cdc 4 - 31 by a small HSP 12 homolog, Scf 1, suggests that the functional loss of cdc 4, which is involved in formation of the F-actin contractile ring can be prevented or repaired by one of the small HSP. This implies that an HSP might be involved in late cell plate formation or in stabilization of the Sp F-actin contractile ring structure. ope...|$|E
40|$|Eugenol is an {{aromatic}} {{component of}} clove oil that has therapeutic potential as an antifungal drug, although its {{mode of action}} and precise cellular target(s) remain ambiguous. To address this knowledge gap, a chemical-genetic profile analysis of eugenol was done using ∼ 4700 haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion mutants to reveal 21 deletion mutants with the greatest degree of susceptibility. Cellular roles of deleted genes in the most susceptible mutants indicate that the main targets for eugenol include pathways involved in biosynthesis and transport of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids. Follow-up analyses showed inhibitory effects of eugenol on amino acid permeases in the yeast cytoplasmic membrane. Furthermore, <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> analysis revealed that eugenol interferes with two permeases, Tat 1 p and Gap 1 p, which are both involved in dual transport of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids through the yeast cytoplasmic membrane. Perturbation of cytoplasmic permeases represents a novel antifungal target and may explain previous observations that exposure to eugenol results in leakage of cell contents. Eugenol exposure may also contribute to amino acid starvation and thus holds promise as an anticancer therapeutic drug. Finally, this study provides further evidence of the usefulness of the yeast Gene Deletion Array approach in uncovering the mode of action of natural health products...|$|E
40|$|We have {{studies the}} <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> of a dnaA 46 {{mutation}} by plasmid integration at preselected chromosomal sites after introducing homologous sequences (Mu prophages) onto both the chromosomes and the suppressive plasmid. The plasmids used were all derived from plasmid R 100. 1. We {{found that the}} conditions required to get viable suppressive integration varied as the plasmid integration site moved from the origin to the terminus of chromosome replication. Two constraints were observed. Both appeared {{to be linked to}} the new characteristics acquired by chromosome replication from the integrated plasmid. One constraint was that strains with integrative suppression near the terminus terC were viable only in minimal medium. The rich medium sensitivity of these strains was correlated with a loss of regulation of initiation. The other constraint was a requirement for a specific orientation in certain regions of the chromosome. The two branches defined by normally initiated replication, between oriC and terC, were also symmetrical with respect to these plasmid orientation constraints. In studying the possible reasons for a plasmid orientation constraint, we found that, of the two forks initiated in bidirectional replication from the integrated plasmid, one was capable of moving across the terC region with a higher movability than the other...|$|E
40|$|The {{closely related}} Hox {{transcription}} factors Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Antennapedia (Antp) respectively direct first abdominal (A 1) and second thoracic (T 2) segment identities in Drosophila. It {{has been proposed}} that their functional differences derive from their differential occupancy of DNA target sites. Here we show that a hybrid version of Ubx (Ubx-VP 16), which possesses an enhanced transcriptional activation function, no longer directs A 1 denticle pattern in embryonic epidermal cells. Instead, it mimics Antp in directing T 2 denticle pattern, and it can rescue the cuticular loss-of-function phenotype of Antp mutants. In cells that do not produce denticles, Ubx-VP 16 appears to have largely retained its normal repressive regulatory functions. These {{results suggest that the}} modulation of Hox activation and repression functions can account for segment-specific morphological differences that are controlled by different members of the Hox family. Our results also are consistent with the idea that activity regulation underlies the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> phenomenon in which a more posterior Hox protein suppresses the function of a more anterior member of the Hox cluster. The acquisition of novel activation and repression potentials in Hox proteins may be an important mechanism underlying the generation of subtle morphological differences during evolution...|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila {{homeotic}} cluster (HOM-C) {{is made up}} {{of eight}} genes, which specify the identity of cephalic, thoracic and abdominal segments. These genes can be ordered in a hierarchy which correlates with their position along the 5 '- 3 ' transcriptional direction. When they are absent, thoracic and abdominal body segments develop the same'ground' pattern, which is thoracic-like but also includes cephalic structures (sclerotic plates). We find that these plates are specified by the homeobox gene empty spiracles (ems) which is {{not a member of the}} HOM-C and which is expressed in all body segments. ems mutations, however, only produce defects in anterior head structures and the posterior spiracles. The ems product has the potential to induce sclerotic plates but this potential is suppressed by any of the HOM-C genes, including the labial gene, which we show to be the lowest ranking of the HOM-C hierarchy. This suppression does not occur at the transcriptional or translational level because the ems function is suppressed in cells containing the ems product. Thus, this appears to be the first case of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>suppression</b> operating in normal development. We propose that ems was originally a member of the HOM-C which escaped from the complex and has also acquired new functions during evolution...|$|E
