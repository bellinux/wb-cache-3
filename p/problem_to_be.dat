25|$|The word {{problem was}} one of the first {{examples}} of an unsolvable <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found not in mathematical logic or the theory of algorithms, but in one of the central branches of classical mathematics, algebra. As a result of its unsolvability, several other problems in combinatorial group theory have been shown to be unsolvable as well.|$|E

25|$|This is {{important}} because enzymes do not have perfect discrimination; a nuclease will still have some likelihood of acting even if the sequence does not match perfectly. So {{the activity of the}} nuclease on a sequence with one mismatch is less than the no-mismatch case, and activity is even less for two mismatches, but still not zero. Exclusion of these sequences, which are very similar but not identical, is still an important <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overcome in genome engineering.|$|E

25|$|Wool pants, or, once available, rubber pants, were {{sometimes}} used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful {{because they thought}} the rubber acted as a poultice and damaged the skin of infants. The constant <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter {{in contact with the}} skin, were the two main causes of these problems.|$|E

When interviewed by Sunday Night in March 2009, the deputy Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas (who had been Passlow's divisional officer prior to the incident) promised counselling for the survivors, and claimed that prior treatment of the Onslow submariners was due to a limited understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder back in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Declarative {{programming}} languages {{describe what}} computation {{should be performed}} and not how to compute it. Declarative programs omit the control flow and are considered sets of instructions. Two broad categories of declarative languages are functional languages and logical languages. The principle behind functional languages (like Haskell) is to not allow side effects, which {{makes it easier to}} reason about programs like mathematical functions. The principle behind logical languages (like Prolog) is to define the <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved– the goal– and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself. The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is backtracked and another path is systematically attempted.|$|E
25|$|The DH.99 {{design was}} soon {{modified}} to incorporate a combined wood-and-metal construction {{in light of}} recommendations from the MAP; the design was thus renumbered to DH.100 by November 1941. The aircraft {{was considered to be}} a largely experimental design due to its use of a single engine and some unorthodox features, unlike the Gloster Meteor which had been specified for production early on. In February 1942, the MAP suggested dropping the project for a bomber but de Havilland stated that the twin-boom was, despite Ministry doubts, only an engineering <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overcome. On 22 April 1942, the construction of two prototypes (serials LZ548 and LZ551) was authorised by the Ministry while Specification E.6/41 was produced and issued to cover the work. Accordingly, the company proceeded with the detailed design work phase of the DH.100 in early 1942.|$|E

25|$|Interactionism {{had become}} popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a {{politically}} radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing {{society as a}} system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions. The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused {{on the process of}} law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.|$|E
25|$|The last <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved {{was how to}} {{separate}} the Lunar Module a safe distance away from the Command Module just before re-entry. The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's reaction control system (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist Bernard Etkin, was formed {{to solve the problem}} within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using slide rules. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.|$|E

500|$|However, {{this method}} is complex and non-combinatorial, and {{specialized}} clique-finding algorithms {{have been developed for}} many subclasses of perfect graphs. In the complement graphs of bipartite graphs, König's theorem allows the maximum clique <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved using techniques for matching. In another class of perfect graphs, the permutation graphs, a maximum clique is a longest decreasing subsequence of the permutation defining the graph and can be found using known algorithms for the longest decreasing subsequence problem. Conversely, every instance of the longest decreasing subsequence problem can be described equivalently as a problem of finding a maximum clique in a permutation graph. [...] provide an alternative quadratic-time algorithm for maximum cliques in comparability graphs, a broader class of perfect graphs that includes the permutation graphs as a special case. In chordal graphs, the maximal cliques can be found by listing the vertices in an elimination ordering, and checking the clique neighborhoods of each vertex in this ordering.|$|E
