With this impact, the wing fuel tanks ruptured, spilling fuel and causing the fire. The survivors left aircraft by the door behind the cockpit and through openings in the fuselage. Due to the impact, emergency exits could not be opened, and a large amount of smoke accumulated in the cabin. The pilot, who survived the accident, could not organize nor conduct the <b>passengers</b> <b>evacuation.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue to {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of cruise travel market as well as in light of the great loss caused by several maritime disasters, <b>passenger</b> ship <b>evacuation</b> in case of emergency has received increasing attention recently. For safety reasons, IMO has introduced a series of guidelines for undertaking full-scale evacuation analysis and certification of large passenger ships in the design stage. In this paper, an agent-based microscopic evacuation model—CityFlow-M has been introduced by a <b>passenger</b> ship <b>evacuation</b> case, and then validated using data sets from a semi-unannounced assembly trail at sea, which consists of passenger response times, starting locations, ending areas as well as the arrival times in the assembling stations.

50|$|Ozark Air Lines Flight 650 was a {{regularly}} scheduled flight from Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls Regional Airport in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. While landing on runway 3 in a snow storm on December 20, 1983, it struck a snow plow on the runway. The impact ripped {{the right wing}} from the plane destroying the snow plow and killing its driver. The leaking fuel from the wing briefly created a fireball that engulfed the airplane.

50|$|The use of {{overwing}} exits in a ditching {{varies from}} airline to airline but are generally a secondary (not primary) means of escape. On aircraft fitted with overwing exits, there is typically a raised escape rope bracket (about {{a third of}} the way from the door) attached to the wing's upper surface and typically painted yellow. This is accompanied by an escape rope found in the frame of the exit after opening the hatch. Once this rope is attached to the escape rope bracket, it will aid <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> onto the wing to await rescue or to enter the water (depending on the airline's procedures). On aircraft with life rafts to be launched via the overwing exit, the wing will be used to provide a boarding platform onto the life raft. On certain regional aircraft, the overwing exits are the only escape route in the event of a ditching.|$|E
50|$|On August 24, 1999, , a McDonnell Douglas MD-90, {{landed at}} Hualien Airport and was rolling on Runway 21, when an {{explosion}} was {{heard in the}} front section of the passenger cabin, followed by smoke and then fire. The pilot immediately braked, brought the aircraft to {{a stop on the}} runway. Then, after deploying the evacuation slides and initiating an emergency <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation,</b> the pilot proceeded to call the tower for help. Upon receiving this call, fire squads at both the Hualien Airport and the Air Force Wing rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. The fire was eventually put out at 13:45. While {{the upper part of the}} fuselage was completely destroyed, 90 passengers plus the crew of 6 were safely evacuated. Casualties included 14 seriously injured passengers and another 14 that suffered minor injuries. Most of the injured passengers suffered burns. There was eventually one death.

50|$|The Allies had {{a fairly}} secure hold over {{northern}} Norway until late May. The situation was dramatically altered, however, by their deteriorating {{situation in the}} Battle of France. With the Germans rapidly overrunning France, the Allied high command decided that the forces in northern Norway should be withdrawn. The Royal Family and Norwegian Government were evacuated from Tromsø on 7 June aboard HMS Devonshire {{with a total of}} 461 <b>passengers.</b> This <b>evacuation</b> became extremely costly for the Royal Navy when the German warships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau attacked and sank the nearby aircraft carrier HMS Glorious with its escorting destroyers HMS Acasta and HMS Ardent. Devonshire did not rebroadcast the enemy sighting report made by Glorious as she could not disclose her position by breaking radio silence. No other British ship received the sighting report, and 1,519 British officers and men and three warships were lost. Devonshire arrived safely in London and King Haakon and his Cabinet set up a Norwegian government in exile in the British capital.|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident {{was a lack of}} proper crew coordination, including a virtual reversal of roles by the DC-9 pilots, which led to their failure to stop taxiing their airplane and alert the ground controller of their positional uncertainty in a timely manner before and after intruding onto the active runway.Contributing to the cause of the accident were (1) deficiencies in the air traffic control services provided by the Detroit tower, including failure of the ground controller to take timely action to alert the local controller to the possible runway incursion, inadequate visibility observations, failure to use progressive taxi instructions in low-visibility conditions, and issuance of inappropriate and confusing taxi instructions compounded by inadequate backup supervision for the level of experience of the staff on duty; (2) deficiencies in the surface markings, signage, and lighting at the airport and the failure of Federal Aviation Administration surveillance to detect or correct any of these deficiencies; and (3) failure of Northwest Airlines, Inc., to provide adequate cockpit resource management training to their line aircrews.Contributing to the fatalities in the accident was the inoperability of the DC-9 internal tail cone release mechanism.
