Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), olives, blackberries, common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and dog rose (Rosa canina). In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park.

5|$|Many thrips {{species are}} pests of commercially {{important}} crops. A few species serve as vectors for over 20 viruses that cause <b>plant</b> <b>disease,</b> especially the Tospoviruses. Some species of thrips are beneficial as pollinators or as predators of other insects or mites. In the right conditions, {{such as in}} greenhouses, many species can exponentially increase in population size and form large swarms {{because of a lack}} of natural predators coupled with their ability to reproduce asexually, making them an irritation to humans. Their identification to species by standard morphological characters is often challenging.|$|E

30|$|In {{the natural}} world, plants are very important, {{since they are}} the {{survival}} foundation {{for all kinds of}} creatures, including human being, animals, and even microbes. However, {{there are a lot of}} <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> which affect the health of plants, such as Cucumber mosaic virus, Broad bean wilt virus, Beet curly top virus, and Maize streak virus [1]. A serious potato disease destroyed almost all the potatoes of the Irish and caused a great famine in 1845 - 1846. In fact, in human history, <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> were not recognized until very late. In the late 18 th century, there were many scientists who began to research the essence of <b>plant</b> <b>diseases.</b> For example, Marthieu Tillet experimentally proved that Wheat bunt is caused by a kind of black powder; Adolf Mayer found that Tobacco mosaic disease can be spread by the juice of infected leafs; and many other <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> have been found and researched. It was confirmed that insect vectors (such as aphids, leafhoppers, plant hopper, mealworm etc.) have close relations with many kinds of <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> [2, 3].|$|R
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E

25|$|Members {{of every}} class of {{pathogen}} that infect humans also infect plants. Although the exact pathogenic species vary with the infected species, bacteria, fungi, viruses, nematodes, and insects can all cause <b>plant</b> <b>disease.</b> As with animals, plants attacked by insects or other pathogens use a set of complex metabolic responses which lead {{to the formation of}} defensive chemical compounds that fight infection or make the plant less attractive to insects and other herbivores.

25|$|Throughout 1942 {{and into}} early 1943, a complex series of {{overlapping}} crises placed enormous, widespread stress on Bengal's economy, particularly on its more vulnerable segments. Distressing {{military and political}} events and subsequent government and market responses created escalating price shocks that overlapped with supply shocks caused by natural disasters and <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> later in the year. As Bengal's food needs rose from increased military presence and an influx of refugees from Burma, its ability to obtain rice and other foodgrains from outside the province was restricted by interprovincial trade barriers. The outlook of the typical Bengali, particularly in the countryside, deteriorated into a general belief in the inevitability of famine and devastating inflation, a lack {{of faith in the}} government's ability to overcome the crises, and a mood of isolation and panic. In nearly every sector of the population, the overriding concerns were the lack of food and personal safety, though a small number secured record profits amidst the havoc.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s was caused by a <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> that reached the Highlands in 1846, where 150,000 people faced disaster because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk). They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|According to {{conservative}} estimates, {{the introduction of}} the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900. Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, part of the Colombian exchange. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by distrustful European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom. However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora infestans, spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland as well as parts of the Scottish Highlands, resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine. Thousands of varieties still persist in the Andes however, where over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley, and a dozen or more might be maintained by a single agricultural household.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{control is}} {{the control of}} disease by the {{application}} of biological agents to a host animal or plant that prevents the development of disease by a pathogen. With regard to <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> the biocontrol agents are usually bacterial or fungal strains isolated from the endosphere or rhizosphere. Viruses {{can also be used}} as biocontrol agents and there is a resurgent interest in the use of bacterial viruses for control of <b>plant</b> <b>diseases.</b> The degree of disease suppression achieved with biological agents can be comparable to that achieved with chemicals. Our understanding {{of the ways in which}} biocontrol agents protect <b>plants</b> from <b>disease</b> has developed considerably in recent years with the application of genomics and genetic modification techniques. We have uncovered mechanisms by which biocontrol agents interact with the host plant and other members of the microbial community associated with the plant. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to the isolation of effective biocontrol agents and the development of biocontrol strategies for <b>plant</b> <b>diseases.</b> This review looks at recent developments in our understanding of biocontrol agents for <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> and how they work...|$|R
