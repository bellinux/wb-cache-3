5000|$|<b>Pheneturide</b> (INN, BAN) (brand names Benuride, Deturid, Pheneturid, Septotence, Trinuride), {{also known}} as phenylethylacetylurea (or ethylphenacemide), is an {{anticonvulsant}} of the ureide class. Conceptually, it can be formed in the body as a metabolic degradation product from [...] It {{is considered to be}} obsolete, and is now seldom used. It is marketed in Europe, including in Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. <b>Pheneturide</b> has a similar profile of anticonvulsant activity and toxicity relative to phenacemide, but is less toxic in comparison, despite still being a toxic drug. As such, it is only used in cases of severe epilepsy when other, less-toxic drugs have failed. <b>Pheneturide</b> inhibits the metabolism and thus increases the levels of other anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin.|$|E
50|$|The acylurea {{functional}} group {{is also found}} in some pharmaceutical drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenacemide, <b>pheneturide,</b> chlorphenacemide, and acetylpheneturide (which are phenylureides), and the sedatives acecarbromal, bromisoval, and carbromal (which are bromoureides). Others include apronal (apronalide), capuride, and ectylurea. As the barbiturates are basically cyclic ureas, these drugs are structurally and mechanistically related to them. The phenylureides are also closely related to the hydantoins, such as phenytoin, and may be considered ring-opened analogues of them.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one {{patients}} with {{various forms of}} myoclonus are presented. Phenacemide was given to five {{patients with}} considerable benefit to three, but with serious toxic effects in two. Another acetylurea derivative, <b>pheneturide,</b> was given to 19 patients and was well tolerated. Myoclonus was completely or substantially controlled in 12 patients...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} cross-over trial between <b>pheneturide</b> and phenytoin in ninety-four outpatients with epilepsy is described. There was {{no significant}} difference between the frequency of seizures in the two groups. The difficulties in comparing two anticonvulsants of similar efficacy are discussed particularly in relation to ethical problems, the selection of patients and trial design...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} calcium {{metabolism}} in epileptic {{patients in a}} residential centre showed a subnormal serum calcium level in 22 Â· 5 % of patients and a raised alkaline phosphatase in 29 %. Hypocalcaemia was related to high dosage of anticonvulsant drugs, to multiple drug therapy, and {{to the use of}} individual anticonvulsant drugs in the following order, with decreasing order of importance: <b>pheneturide,</b> primidone, phenytoin, phenobarbitone. Subnormal serum calcium levels occurred more commonly in patients with a raised liver alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme than in those whose phosphatase was mainly of bone origin...|$|E
40|$|A {{family is}} {{described}} with three affected brothers, {{two of whom}} were examined, born to consanguineous parent, who in early adult life began to experience ataxia, intention myoclonus, and progressive visual failure. The brothers examined had cherry red spots at the maculae and cataracts. They were of normal intelligence. The intention myoclonus responded partially to treatment with clonazepam and <b>pheneturide,</b> but not to 5 -hydroxytryptophan in combination with carbidopa or to sodium valproate. Studies in one patient showed the excretion of large quantities of sialylated oligosaccharides in the urine. Both patients showed deficient sialidase activity in their cultured fibroblasts. Further studies on cultured skin fibroblasts revealed increased electrophoretic mobility of six glycoprotein enzymes that was returned approximately to normal by treatment with sialidase. The clinical and biochemical findings indicate that these patients are further cases of the newly described condition sialidosis type 1...|$|E
