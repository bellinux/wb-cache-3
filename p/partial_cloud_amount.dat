40|$|Automated high-temporal {{resolution}} {{cloud cover}} measurements {{can contribute to}} the weak understanding of the net radiative cloud effect and its evolution with climate change. They can further serve as a reference for satellite-based cloud retrievals. A dataset of 10 -minute cloud amount estimates at 24 sites of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network is presented. These sites are located worldwide covering a wide range of climatic zones. The length of cloud amount time series vary among sites from 3 to 22 years (until 2014). Cloud amount was calculated from ground measurements of long-wave incoming radiation, air temperature and relative humidity by means of the Bayesian Automatic Cloud Detection Algorithm (BACADA), which builds on the Automatic <b>Partial</b> <b>Cloud</b> <b>Amount</b> Detection Algorithm (APCADA, Dürr and Philipona, JGR, 2004). Evaluation of cloud fraction (0 - 100 %) was carried out based on comparison with synoptic and total-sky imager cloud observations. It is demonstrated that BACADA improves the performance of <b>partial</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> estimates (MBE= 1. 55 %, MAE= 15. 35 %) as compared to the existing APCADA algorithm (MBE= 7. 18 %, MAE= 17. 89 %). Yet, the aim of BACADA is to provide total cloud amount. These estimates are of MBE=- 1. 53 % and MAE= 17. 86 %. Although the study focuses on the need of cloud amount estimates for evaluation of satellite-based retrievals, the dataset demonstrated here may potentially be valuable for other disciplines...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of cloudiness is investigated {{by means of}} partial and total cloud amount estimations from pyrgeometer radiation measurements and all-sky imager observations. The measurements have been performed in Westerland, a seaside resort on the North Sea island of Sylt, Germany, during summer 2005. An improvement to previous studies on this subject results {{from the fact that}} for the first time <b>partial</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> (PCA), defined as total cloud amounts without high clouds, calculations from longwave downward radiation (LDR) according to the APCADA-Algorithm (Dürr and Philipona, 2004) are validated against both human observations from the German Weather Service DWD at the nearby airport of Sylt and digital all-sky imaging. Differences between the resulting total cloud amounts (TCA's), defined as total cloud amount for all-cloud situations, derived from the camera images and from human observations are within &plusmn; 1 octa in 72 % and within &plusmn; 2 octa in 85 % of the cases. Compared to human observations PCA measurements according to APCADA underestimate the observed cloud cover in 47 % of all cases and the differences are within &plusmn; 1 octa in 60 % and &plusmn; 2 octa in 74 % of all cases. Since high cirrus clouds can not be derived from LDR, separate comparisons for all cases without high clouds have been performed showing an agreement within &plusmn; 1 (2) octa in 73 (90) % for PCA and also for camera derived TCA. For this coastal mid-latitude site under investigation we find similar though slightly smaller agreements to human observations as reported in Dürr and Philipona (2004). Though limited to day-time the cloud cover retrievals from the sky imager are not much affected by cirrus clouds and provide a more reliable cloud climatology for all-cloud conditions than APCADA...|$|E
40|$|In this study, hourly RUC {{analyses}} {{were used to}} examine the differences between RH and temperature values from RUC reanalysis data and from radiosonde atmospheric profiles obtained at the ARM SCF. The results show that the temperature observations from the SONDE and RUC are highly correlated. The RHs are also well-correlated, but the SONDE values generally exceed those from RUC. Inside cloud layers, the RH from RUC is 2 - 14 % lower than the RH from SONDE for all RUC layers. Although the layer mean RH within clouds is much greater than the layer mean RH outside cloud or in the clear-sky, RH thresholds chosen as a function of temperature can more accurately diagnose cloud occurrence for either dataset. For overcast clouds, {{it was found that the}} 50 % probability RH threshold for diagnosing a cloud, within a given upper tropospheric layer is roughly 90 % for the Vaisala RS 80 - 15 LH radisonde and 80 % for RUC data. While for the <b>partial</b> <b>cloud</b> (<b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> is less than 90 %), the RH thresholds of SONDE are close to RUC for a given probability in upper tropospheric layers.

If cloud detection errors and differences in area sampling are neglected, individual ISCCP <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> agree with individual surface observations to within 15 % rms with biases {{of only a few}} percent.

Comparison of the ISCCP climatology to three other cloud climatologies shows excellent agreement in the geographic distribution and seasonal variation of cloud amounts; there is little agreement about day/night contrasts in <b>cloud</b> <b>amount.</b> Notable results from ISCCP are that the gobal annual mean <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> is about 63 %, being about 23 % higher over oceans than over land, that it varies by less than 1 % rms from month to month, and that it has varied by about 4 % on a time scale approximately equal to 2 - 4 years.

Based on the occurrence of the overlaying of high, medium and low types of clouds and the interaction and interrelationship of information provided by them, this paper puts forwards new concepts of "effective" frequency of occurrences of cloud and "effective" time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> and their calculation formulas, while the commonly used calculation formula for time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> is treated as a special case of the calculation formula for "effective" time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount.</b> Through a principal component analysis of the correlation coefficient matrix formed by conditional probabilities exhibited by {{any other type of}} cloud when a certain type of cloud occurs, the normalized weight of the conditional probability exhibited by any other type of cloud when this particular type of cloud occurs is ascertained. When this particular type of cloud is obscured by another type of cloud, the weight {{can be seen as the}} probability of this particular type of cloud being obscured by another type of cloud. With the formula for the "effective" frequency of occurrences of cloud and the formula for "effective" average cloud, this probability can be used to calculate the "effective" time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> of this particular type of cloud. By applying this method to the analysis and calculation of the "effective" average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> in the four different seasons as observed by 15 observation stations worldwide, this paper finds that the sum of the "effective" time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> of each type of clouds is far closer to the observed value of the total <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> than the sum of the time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> derived by using only the calculation formula for time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount,</b> with more than 87 % of the relative errors of the total <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> corrections made by the former being smaller than 15 % and all relative errors of the total average cloud corrections made by the latter exceeding 15 %.

The model covers a large horizontal domain (512 km) but resolves individual clouds.

Motivated by this premise, we formulate an economical effective cloud algorithm for GCM's called;'SA TCLD, " which utilizes compact, readily accessible analyses of observed satellite-derived radiative flux data. We then examine the plausibility of preliminary effective cloud fields. Analysis of SATCLD and other cloud fields and associated radiative fluxes (diagnosed by our GCM's cloud radiation model from observed atmospheric temperature and water vapor data) also provides {{some insight into}} biases in our GCM's cloud radiation model and surface albedo field. "SA TCLD " generates effective low and high <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> at each GCM grid point by minimizing {{the sum of the}} squares of the local residual (i. e., model-diagnosed minus observed) shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes. The preliminary SATCLD effective <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> fields seem plausible in many respects, based upon comparison with the satellitederived 3 DNEPH and surface-based SFCOBS analyses. In the tropics the SATCLD effective high <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> is rather well correlated with 3 DNEPH, while systematic differences in low <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> are ~vident in July.

Furthermore, the precipitation reduction associated with enhanced aerosol leads to large changes in the energetics of air-sea exchange and trade wind boundary layer. Our results represent the first observational evidence of large-scale increase of <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> due to aerosols in a trade cumulus regime, which can be used to constrain the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models. The findings also have implications for volcano-climate interactions and climate mitigation research...|$|R

Differences in trends of seasonal mean effective high <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> between situations favorable for contrails and for cirrus are analyzed in regions with high and low air traffic density. In regions with especially high air traffic density, a significantly stronger increase of effective high <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> is found for situations with sufficiently cold and humid air masses favorable for contrails than for all situations in general or for situations favorable for cirrus. Situations of potential contrails occur in about 5 to 10 % of all situations, and their seasonal effective high <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> averages lie between about 7 % and 22 %. Indicators of cirrus increase due to air traffic corresponding to the difference in trends of effective high <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> between potential contrail situations and cirrus or all situations are about 2. 8 %– 3. 5 % and 1. 6 %– 4. 7 % per decade over Europe and the North Atlantic flight corridor, respectively. Weighted by frequency of potential contrail occurrence, the overall increase amounts to at least 0. 20 %– 0. 25 % and 0. 08 %– 0. 24 % per decade over regions with very high air traffic (Europe and the North Atlantic flight corridor, respectively) ...|$|R

At Syowa Station, Antarctica, meteorological observation has been continued for nearly 50 years. During this term, an annual mean <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> showed a gradual increase {{at a rate of}} 0. 014 /yr. Radiation budget was observed since 1991 as one of the BSRN stations. Trends of monthly mean radiative fluxes were compared with those of <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> and conformable relations were seen during the period from 1991 to 2004. A cloud radiative forcing was estimated. In December, a downward trend in net longwave and net total appeared, while an upward trend in net shortwave was seen, and all corresponded to the decrease of <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> in this month. On the other hand in June, an upward trend in net longwave forcing was seen, corresponding to the increase of <b>cloud</b> <b>amount.</b> On an average, cloud radiative forcings at Syowa Station represented those of Antarctic costal stations near sea ice area. 昭和基地の過去 50 年間の気象データを解析した結果、近年南極の雲量が増加傾向にあることを示し、この雲量増加とradiative fluxesの相関、季節変動について議論しています...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{temporal}} {{structure of the}} variation of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) {{and its impact on}} regional climate variability are analyzed using various datasets. The results show that blocking formations in the Atlantic region are sensitive to the phase of the NAO. Sixty-seven percent more winter blocking days are observed during the negative phase compared to the positive phase of the NAO. The average length of blocking during the negative phase is about 11 days, which is nearly twice as long as the 6 -day length observed during the positive phase of the NAO. The NAO-related differences in blocking frequency and persistence are associated with changes in the distribution of the surface air temperature anomaly, which, to a large extent, is determined by the phase of the NAO. The distribution of regional <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> is also sensitive to the phase of the NAO. For the negative phase, the <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> are significant, positive anomalies in the convective zone in the Tropics and much less cloudiness in the mid latitudes. But for the positive phase of the NAO, the <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> is much higher in the mid-latitude storm track region. In the whole Atlantic region, the <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> shows a decrease with the increase of surface air temperature. These results suggest {{that there may be a}} negative feedback between the <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> and the surface air temperature in the Atlantic region.
