40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{tools and}} methods of subject indexing in different kind of bibliographic databases (subject headings, thesauri, classifications). The future of <b>pre-coordinated</b> <b>indexing,</b> {{pros and cons of}} controlled indexing versus keywords is also discussed, in the context of users needs and competencies. Quality of indexing, cooperation with end-users (including adaptation of folksonomy and other tools of Web 2. 0) and openness to new technologies (full-text search) are the key factors of successful retrieval...|$|E
40|$|Subject {{indexing}} in Italy {{is facing}} a change, because the Biblioteca nazionale centrale di Firenze {{is working on the}} Nuovo soggettario: a new <b>pre-coordinated</b> <b>indexing</b> language that will be presented in January 2007, based on logical principles for the sintax of subject strings and for the construction of the controlled vocabulary. Indexing term is the base unit of this new indexing language, according to ISO 2788 1986 Guidelines for monolingual thesauri: the representation of a concept, preferably {{in the form of a}} noun or noun phrase. Indexing term is not coincident to the traditional unit of subject heading, the so-called “descrittore” in SBN (Italian national library service). Softwares for the automation of libraries must be adapted to the new indexing language. This document illustrates a proposal for the adaptation of ALEPH 500 software to the characteristics of the Nuovo soggettario indexing language, in the respect of international formats Unimarc/Authorities and Unimarc/Bibliographic...|$|E

Using a dedicated terminal or telnet client, users could search a handful of <b>pre-coordinate</b> <b>indexes</b> and browse the resulting display {{in much the same}} way they had previously navigated the card catalog.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final phase}} of {{indexing}} is to present the entries in a systematic order. This may involve linking entries. In a <b>pre-coordinated</b> <b>index</b> the indexer determines {{the order in which}} terms are linked in an entry by considering how a user may formulate their search. In a post-coordinated index, the entries are presented singly and the user can link the entries through searches, most commonly carried out by computer software. Post-coordination results in a loss of precision in comparison to pre-coordination ...|$|R
40|$|Pre-coordination of {{index terms}} has {{fallen out of}} favor {{with the advent of}} {{automated}} information retrieval. This is unjustified, as a certain amount of pre-coordination greatly enhances the searcher's possibilities of fine-tuning the query to match the level of detail of the information request. We propose a system of index concepts that allows concepts to be coordinated by means of special coordinators. The query engine able to handle coordinated and uncoordinated concepts is specified by means of an elaborate functional specification. The query engine combines the facilities of pre- and post-coordination. The feasibility of the query engine is demonstrated by a prototype that can be run over WWW. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Pre- and post-coordination The advent of automated Information Retrieval (IR) systems is generally held to have implied the demise of <b>pre-coordinated</b> <b>index</b> terms. Post-coordination is the norm, said to be to the advantage of users. Briefly, the distinction between pre- a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In 1996 the GRIS, Gruppo di ricerca sull’indicizzazione per soggetto (Research Group on Subject Indexing), {{proposed}} {{a method for}} <b>pre-coordinated</b> subject <b>indexing,</b> based on logical principles for the sintax of subject strings and {{for the construction of}} the controlled vocabulary; the Nuovo soggettario, a new indexing language that will be presented by the Biblioteca nazionale centrale di Firenze in January 2007, is structured according to GRIS method. This case study concerning TECA, an application for catalogue data for the UNESCO CDS/ISIS retrieval software, analyses the problem of the full application of GRIS method to subject indexing in automated catalogues. The aspects of GRIS method relevant to bibliographic and authority data recording and display are considered: the structural peculiarities of subject strings and the authority control of indexing terms. Authority control is derived from UNIMARC/Authorities international format: access point management is not organized according to their function in the bibliographic records (author or subject indexing), but rather according to the type of entity they represent or refer to. Two classes of entities are defined: concepts, represented by general indexing terms, and individual entities, to which indexing terms that are proper nouns (singular terms) refer...|$|R
