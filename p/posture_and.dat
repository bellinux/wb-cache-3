5|$|Most of {{the known}} Ankylosaurus {{specimens}} were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so, until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that Ankylosaurus has become the archetypal member of its group, and the best known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. Many traditional popular depictions show Ankylosaurus in a squatting <b>posture</b> <b>and</b> with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb <b>posture</b> <b>and</b> with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from Ankylosaurus itself.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis is territorial, {{defending}} the nesting and display sites against intruders. Agonistic or threat displays include lunging {{forward with the}} bill in a horizontal <b>posture,</b> <b>and</b> standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird engaging in the same display. Birds also lunge and bite, often holding onto an opponent's head or wings.|$|E

5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive <b>posture</b> <b>and</b> later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{quantity}} and excellent {{quality of the}} fossil material, Plateosaurus {{was for a long}} time one of the most misunderstood dinosaurs. Some researchers proposed theories that were later shown to conflict with geological and palaeontological evidence, but have become the paradigm of public opinion. Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), taphonomy (how the animals became embedded and fossilized), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of Plateosaurus have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, <b>posture</b> <b>and</b> behaviour.|$|E
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb <b>posture</b> <b>and</b> a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E

The Tasmanian boobook has been recorded from southern Victoria, with one record from New South Wales. It has darker and more reddish upperparts with brighter white dots, with more prominent white dots and a yellow-brown tinge to the underparts. It has pinkish grey feet and golden eyes.|$|E
5|$|One catechesis of Symeon's, On Faith, {{along with}} a {{composite}} work titled One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts, {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics. Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of Prayer is also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing the Jesus Prayer that includes direction on correct <b>posture</b> <b>and</b> breathing while reciting the prayer. It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E
