40|$|Until recently, hydrostatic-mechanical {{power split}} CVT {{drivelines}} {{have not found}} a place in construction machinery. The majority of these vehicles still use hydrodynamic <b>powershift</b> <b>transmissions,</b> full-hydrostatic transmissions or mechanical direct-shift transmissions. Hydrostatic drive lines are widely used in construction machinery possessing lower engine power. The upper power range is dominated by hydrodynamic <b>powershift</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Decisions made by vehicle manufacturers about which driveline technology to be used, have been based mainly on reliability, durability, and cost. Fuel economy {{has also been a}} growing trend over the past years; however the additional cost of higher technologies must be compensated by the savings in fuel cost over a time period of 2 - 3 years. The transmission’s efficiency highly contributes to the vehicle’s fuel consumption. ZF has thoroughly studied the possible concepts of hydrostatic-mechanical power split transmissions. The most important requirements of reliability, durability and efficiency were taken into consideration during the concept study. An examination the most typical working cycles showed that a construction machinery transmission needs to be fully power split in all ranges and obtain equal performance in both driving directions. It was also observed that up to 60 % of productive time for construction and forestry equipment was spent at a speed below 12 km/h. For this speed range, achieving the highest possible efficiency is vital. The result of this research is the ZF cPower, which is an output-coupled, fully power split transmission...|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} {{is a very}} crucial part of a vehicle, especially if the prime mover is a combustion engine, since such a power source has a rather low torque at low engine speeds. There {{would not be enough}} torque to accelerate the vehicle at an acceptable rate while still reaching acceptable top speed. There is a need for several gears to achieve this, thus making the transmission mandatory in such vehicles. Increasing demands on modern vehicles for minimizing the environmental impact are putting high requirements on transmissions. Hybrid solutions integrating electric motors are not only reducing the carbon footprint but also opening up possibilities for improving transmission shift quality. In this thesis a dual clutch transmission propelled by an electric motor is analysed in the simulation software AVL Cruise 2015 and Matlab Simulink 2010 a in order to investigate and improve the shift quality of the transmission using motor torque control. The {{transmission is}} an automatic, <b>powershifting,</b> <b>transmission</b> which means that the torque interruption during the shift procedure is minimal. The four different phases of a shift procedure: filling phase, torque phase, inertia phase and completion phase are studied. A Simulink program was developed including a proportional integrator (PI) controller for comparing the output torque of the transmission to the desired value and control the electric motor torque in order to achieve a smooth torque curve during the power-on upshift procedure. It was found in the results from the simulations that the controller is effective in reducing the torque fluctuations during the power-on upshift procedure both for a low and a high load signal applied to the electric motor. In order to reduce the fluctuations even more, a special strategy aiming to improve the fluctuations during inertia phase, was applied. The result was satisfying but can be further improved and is hence a scope for future development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of damping {{driveline}} oscillations, which is crucial to improving driveability and passenger comfort. Recently, this problem has received an increased interest due to the introduction in several production vehicles of the dual-clutch <b>powershift</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> with dry clutches. This type of transmission improves fuel economy, but it results in a challenging control problem, due to driveline oscillations. These oscillations, also called shuffles, occur during gear-shift, while traversing backlash or when tip-in and tip-out maneuvers are performed. The first contribution of this paper is the derivation of an accurate piecewise affine drivetrain model with three inertias. The second contribution is concerned with the design of a horizon- 1 predictive controller based on flexible Lyapunov functions. Several simulations based on realistic scenarios show that the proposed control scheme can handle both the performance and physical constraints, and the strict limitations on the computational complexity...|$|R
50|$|Like in {{most other}} non-European markets, only the 4-door sedan and 5-door {{hatchback}} are offered in the United States and Canada. The EPA rated fuel economy at 28 city/38 hwy MPG for the 6-speed automatic, and 26 city/ 36 hwy MPG for the 5-speed manual. The SFE package, {{which can only be}} added to the sedan SE trim with <b>PowerShift</b> semi-automatic dual-clutch <b>transmission,</b> improves highway fuel economy to 40 MPG.

50|$|The skidders use {{the same}} 6V53 Detroit Diesel engine and {{steering}} gearbox as the M113, but utilized a more heavily built undercarriage and a 4-speed Clark <b>powershift</b> <b>transmission.</b> The skidder either came as a cable arch model, with a tilting tray to set the logs on (A hydraulic grapple attachment was later offered to fit over the cable fairleads). Or as a Clam-Bunk forwarder, with a Prentice grapple mounted {{on the roof of}} the cab. Dealers also modified the base tractor to handle various forestry and utility jobs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, the [...] D9L was introduced. The unit {{featured}} the same {{new type of}} elevated-sprocket undercarriage as {{was used in the}} larger D10. The new undercarriage design reduced strain and shock loads on the final drives and gave the [...] "belly pan" [...] more ground clearance. The elevated-drive-sprocket undercarriage is a modular design. To repair the machines one breaks down the tracks and pulls the drive sprockets out. As a result, one can pull the <b>powershift</b> <b>transmission</b> out the rear. The [...] D9N replaced the D8L in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} Ford Fiesta, the Focus {{equipped}} with the Ford DPS6 <b>PowerShift</b> <b>transmission</b> has received much criticism due to transmission shuddering, including several lemon law claims. The issue {{is due to the}} dry type clutches associated with gasoline models. Ford's current response is to replace the clutch pack assembly (with updated parts) when shuddering exceeds 250 rpm (upon customer complaint). This is proving to be a short term remedy as {{it is not unusual for}} the clutch packs to be replaced every 6000 mi. As of March 2017, the issue of the clutch packs remains unresolved.|$|E
40|$|The most {{essential}} property of a <b>powershifting</b> <b>transmission</b> is that {{power can be}} transferred even during a gear shift. Automatic transmissions in vehicles are a common application. The gearbox is shifted by simultaneous engaging and disengaging of clutches, connected to a gear train. Analytic simulation models are useful tools when optimizing the control strategy for these clutches. This dissertation presents the following models for analysis of powershift operations in vehicle drivelines: * Model for dimensionless equations: A driveline model without too many details generates equations, which are made dimensionless in a lucid way. Through these, a good overview {{of the principles of}} powershifting is found. Also, some phenomena of interest are strictly defined (tie-up, flare, torque and inertia phase, etc.). * Two-clutch model: This driveline model has a gearbox, which shifts between two gears by controlling two clutches, one for the lower gear and one for the higher gear. The simulation results are verified by tests. Thus the level of detail in the driveline model is found to be appropriate. * Multi-clutch model: In this model, the gearbox is equipped with as many clutches as the real gearbox has. (In the presented example, this means five clutches.) Therefore, all gear shifts for a certain gearbox can be analyzed with the same model. Also, it is possible to analyze other shift operations than those where exactly one clutch is engaging and one is disengaging. * Model including surrounding systems: The driveline model is connected to models of the engine block and vehicle. Also, a simple model of a passenger is present, making it possible to study the passenger comfort more properly. The clutches are often oil-immersed, and so they cannot be properly described with dry friction characteristics. A model of an engaging multi-disc clutch, including squeeze and viscous friction in the oil film, is therefore developed. The influence of the oil film on the gear shift quality is studied. The modelling is carried out systematically. Therefore, the work also gives some general advice as to how dynamic transmission systems should be modelled. An algorithm is developed to find the appropriate state variables for a constrained dynamic transmission system...|$|R
5000|$|Thailand was {{the last}} plant to start {{assembling}} Ford Fiesta for ASEAN countries. A 6-speed <b>Powershift</b> dual-clutch <b>transmission</b> was made available as standard transmission initially for the 1.6L Ti-VCT engines in 2011 and 2012 in Thailand, and currently also for the 1.5 Ti-VCT variant (officially from March 2012 onwards). Curiously, the Thai-made Fiesta versions - both saloon and five-door hatch - feature a 100 mm pitch circle diameter (PCD) wheel lug mount measurement identical to the Mazda2, {{as opposed to the}} 108 mm one as found in other global versions. There were 3 models at launch; 1.4 [...] "Style", 1.6 [...] "Trend" [...] and 1.6 [...] "Sport". All models feature ABS, driver airbag, air conditioning, electric windows and mirrors; the top-of-the-range 1.6 Ti-VCT 'Sport' and (from 2013) 1.5 Ti-VCT 'Sport' models featuring front passenger airbag, alloy wheels and stability control across the range, along with voice command in-car entertainment system and Bluetooth connectivity. Some of the paint options available for the Fiesta in Thailand (such as 'True Red' (a colour shared with the new Ford Ranger Pick-up)) are also shared with the Mazda2 (known as 'Race Red').|$|R

This is the Duratorq 2.0-litre TDCi with the six-speed <b>PowerShift</b> automatic <b>transmission.</b> The Australian range {{is available in}} hatchback and sedan. Variants include: Trend, Sport, Titanium and ST and the performance oriented RS. In the original lineup a diesel and 3 petrol engines were available based on what model, but the updated car has the all of the engines were replaced with the 1.5-litre Ecoboost engine except for the Exclusive engines for the ST and RS variants. The Focus ST, has a 2.0-litre Ecoboost engine that is assembled at Saarlouis Body & Assembly rather than from AutoAlliance Thailand like the other models. The Ford Focus RS cars that had been allocated to Australia and New Zealand were all pre-ordered so quickly that the wait from ordering one at present will take 18 months. A recent update that the Australian range has received includes a standard Sync 3 infotainment system with navigation on all models, a return of the Convenience Pack on the Ford Focus Trend and the Technology Pack on Trend, Sport, and Titanium. The Technology Pack includes Lane departure warning, Lane keeping Aid, Active City Stop, Adaptive Cruise Control, Auto High Beams, Blind Spot Monitoring, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Driver Impairment Monitor for $2000, but $1500 for the Titanium. Also, an optional Sports Executive Pack on the Sport and Titanium includes Bi-Xenon Headlamps with headlamp jet wash, and a Power Sunroof.|$|R
