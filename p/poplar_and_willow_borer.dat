40|$|ABSTRACT: Fifty-six taxa in forty-two genera are {{reported}} from wood-boring beetle {{activity of the}} long-horned beetle Saperda calcarata (poplar borer) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and weevil Cryptorhynchus lapathi (<b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> <b>borer)</b> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) during a study designed to assess {{the distribution of the}} yeast genus Ascobotryozyma. Regular collections from wounds, frass, galleries, and larvae in Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) over 27 months revealed trends in fungal species composition in relation to gallery location and age of beetle damage. In Salix, fungi were identified only from galleries from which Ascobotryozyma was found; thirty-four taxa {{are reported}}. Fungi identified in this study are compared with those from other surveys and their roles within the trees and associations with other organisms are discussed...|$|E

30|$|To {{address a}} {{knowledge}} gap {{of the growth}} of young <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow,</b> a trial of three types of planting materials of two clones each of <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> aimed to assess early above- and below-ground growth (after 1, 2 and 3  years) to test the hypothesis that larger-grade vegetative material will outperform smaller (often called “lesser grade”) material (i.e. poles[*]>[*]wands[*]>[*]stakes). This paper reports results after 9  months only from that trial.|$|R
30|$|<b>Poplars</b> <b>and</b> <b>willows</b> {{are used}} widely in soil {{conservation}} in New Zealand to prevent shallow landslides on hill country. Determining when plants become effective at soil stabilisation {{is important for}} developing guidelines and policy for land management. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if the size of plant material (0.5 -m stakes, 1 -m wands, 3 -m poles) influences the early below-ground plant growth of <b>poplars</b> <b>and</b> <b>willows</b> used in conservation plantings.|$|R

30|$|Advantages of <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> for soil {{conservation}} on unstable hill country include rapid establishment from stem cuttings, ease of establishment {{in the presence}} of grazing livestock (sheep/cows/deer), extensive lateral root development, high evapotranspiration rates during the growing season, and tolerance of seasonally wet soils (Wilkinson [1999]). Plants are mainly established from 3 -m-long unrooted stem cuttings (poles). Occasionally where livestock are not present, smaller diameter and shorter length materials (stakes or wands) are used (National <b>Poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>Willow</b> Users Group ([2007])).|$|R
40|$|Five {{field trials}} {{were carried out}} from 2010 – 2012 on three {{different}} locations. The trials conformed high requirement of effective weed control by planting <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> short rotation coppice (SRC) on arable area. The selectivity of different pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicide treatments was tested. Further trials focused on sufficient and long-standing herbicide efficacy of tank mixture and sequence treatments. As results of these trials it is advisable to use proper soil active herbicides like Artist, Cadou SC, Sencor WG, Spectrum, Spectrum Plus or Stomp Aqua as pre-emergent tank mixture treatment after planting of <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> SRC. Aramo <b>and</b> Lontrel 100 {{can be used as}} post-emergent treatment for control of specific weeds. We intend to register the successful tested herbicides for minor use in <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> SRC under licensing referred to Art. 51 regulation (EC) no 1107 / 2009...|$|R

A comparison between <b>willow</b> <b>and</b> <b>poplar</b> Short Rotation Forestry and rapeseed cultivation was designed to evaluate the ratio between soil respiration and the combustion heat obtained from the extracted products per hectare. A manual dynamic closed chamber system was applied to measure CO 2 emissions at the SRF and rapeseed sites during the growing season. Our results show that <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> SRF has a very low ratio compared to rapeseed. We thus recommend <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> SRF as renewable sources for bioenergy over the currently prevalent rapeseed production...|$|R

40|$|Phytoremediation is a {{promising}} technology to remediate carcass burial sites where deep soil layers are contaminated with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and other potential contaminants by leachate. The {{current study was}} conducted to examine the remedial efficiency of two different woody plants, <b>poplar</b> (Populus euramericana) <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix alba), by employing the deep-planting technique for the enhanced removal of N and P for the soil affected by leachate. For this, pot trials to assess N and P removal efficiency of <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> in liquid manure-applied soil, and pilot-scale column experiments to evaluate the suitability of the deep-planting technique for the enhanced phytoremediation of deep soil layer were conducted. The results of this study showed that <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> removed N <b>and</b> P from soils effectively while surviving under deep-planting conditions. Notably, compared to the surface planted roots, the roots of the deep-planted <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> could transfer significant amounts of N and P leachate from the deep soil layer to the rhizosphere, from where it can be absorbed by the plants. For the first time, the use of poplar or willow plants are recommended by employing the deep-planting technique for the successful remediation of carcass burial sites...|$|R
40|$|<b>Poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> {{plantations}} {{have become}} widespread in China, {{in order to}} meet national economic and environmental needs. The emergence of several pathogens is enhanced by climatic change and associated human factors. Species of Cytospora are well-known pathogens on <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow,</b> <b>and</b> cause stem cankers and diebacks. In the present study, we conducted a survey of Cytospora species occurring on Populus spp. and Salix spp. in China. We used morphological examination and phylogenetic inferences, based on the DNA sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS 1, 5. 8 S rDNA, and ITS 2) and partial β-tubulin gene, to identify six Cytospora species occurring on <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow.</b> Five of these species belonged to known taxa, viz. Cytospora chrysosperma (asexual state of Valsa sordida), Cytospora translucens (asexual state of Leucostoma translucens), Cytospora fugax (asexual state of Valsa salicina), Cytospora atrocirrhata, and Cytospora kantschavelii. Our study yielded a new species, Cytospora davidiana sp. nov., on poplar. The new species is characterized by typical torsellioid conidiomata. An additional Cytospora sp. 1, which formed a distinct clade in the phylogenetic inferences, remains unnamed; the paucity of available materials prevented phenotypical characterization. © 2015 The British Mycological Society...|$|R

40|$|In New Zealand, nitrate (NO 3 -) {{leaching}} is a {{major environmental}} problem associated with intensive agriculture. Research suggests that plants with deeper roots and high evapotranspiration rates, such as <b>poplars</b> (Populus) <b>and</b> <b>willows</b> (Salix), may reduce NO 3 - leaching. In New Zealand, <b>willows</b> <b>and</b> <b>poplars</b> have largely been studied {{in relation to their}} soil conservation benefits, use as stock fodder, biomass production and phytoremediation of contaminated soil. This review compiles information on the use of <b>poplars</b> <b>and</b> <b>willows</b> in agricultural systems and explores their potential application to the management of NO 3 - leaching. Studies show reduced NO 3 - leaching under short rotation coppice willows. However, the establishment and harvesting phases are risk periods for NO 3 -leaching where nitrogen application should be avoided. A case study has identified a potential for role of <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> silvopastoral systems on intensively-managed irrigated farms of the Canterbury Plains. Height restrictions due to overhead irrigation, stock fodder value and the need to restrict light competition with pastures suggest Salix viminalis (with annual coppicing) is the most suitable species for integration into these farms. Further research is needed to quantify both the possible reduction in N losses and the additional on and off-farm benefits of <b>poplar</b> <b>and</b> <b>willow</b> silvopastoralism in the context of intensive farming in New Zealand...|$|R
