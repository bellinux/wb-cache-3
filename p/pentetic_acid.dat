5000|$|TPEN (N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine) is an {{intracellular}} membrane-permeable ion chelator for zinc. Chelators {{can be used}} in chelation {{therapy to}} remove toxic metals in the body. [...] TPEN is a chelator that has a high affinity for zinc. For example, one study showed that TPEN is a stronger chelator compared to other chelators like <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA) when high levels of zinc are present (15 µM). When low levels of zinc were present however (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 µM zinc), there was no significant difference.

40|$|Here, the new {{biosensor}} {{destined for}} screening of interactions between kinase JAK 2 and compounds which may act as inhibitors was presented. The Cu(II) complex of <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> thiol ligand {{was applied for}} immobilization of kinase JAK 2 on the gold electrode surface through his-tagged chemistry. The base of the biosensor response was the change of the electrochemical properties of the Cu(II) redox centres upon formation of the kinase JAK 2 –potential inhibitor complex. The increasing inhibitor concentration caused the decrease of reduction/oxidation Cu(II) current observed with Osteryoung square wave voltammetry. The biosensor usability was checked using known inhibitors, berberines–isoquinolone alkaloids, as well as caffeic acid—a control compound which has no affinity to kinase JAK 2. The possible parameters suitable for estimation {{of the strength of}} the interactions between kinase JAK 2 covalently attached to the Cu(II) complex of <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> thiol ligand deposited on the gold electrode surface and potential inhibitors present in the solution were presented...|$|E

Influence of the optical purity of the lactic acid (L or DL) on the structure and properties of the product is investigated in close details. The influence of <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> core on molar mass, as analysed by the means of gel permeation chromatography using triple detection (refractive index, light scattering and viscometric detectors) is performed as a detailed survey. Furthermore FTIR and NMR spectra, end group analysis, and water contact angle measurements were analysed to receive detailed product characteristics. Differential scanning calorimetry was carried out to examine thermal properties. Obtained results confirm {{the possibility of the}} starshaped structure preparation using a simple polycondensation reaction. The properties of the prepared polymers were found to be dependent on optical purity of the lactic acid precursor.

Results show nanoparticles with diameter in the range 100 - 200 nm, spherical shape and ζ-potential between 27 - 35 mV. The presence of (S-PLA) side chain does not influence the encapsulation efficiency of the drug but strongly reduce the initial burst effect compared with unmodified chitosan. 15 - 08287 Y, GACR, Czech Science Foundatio...|$|E
40|$|Smoke {{inhalation}} causes most of {{the deaths}} in fire-related injuries, with pulmonary edema as a major determinant {{in the outcome of}} smoke-inhalation injury. The pathophysiology of pulmonary edema is thought {{to be related to the}} products of incomplete combustion. Damage to the integrity of the alveolar epithelium is one of the determinants of the development of smoke-induced pulmonary edema. In recent studies using lung clearance of aerosolized <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA [diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid]) labeled with technetium Tc 99 m to assess the permeability of the alveolar epithelium, several factors were identified that may increase a person's susceptibility to smoke-induced acute lung injury. These are increased initial alveolar permeability and alterations in the number and activity of alveolar macrophages. Clinical measurement of 99 mTcDTPA clearance may provide a sensitive and convenient method for the early detection and serial assessment of smoke-induced alveolar epithelial permeability changes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we report on}} an {{electrochemical}} biosensor for {{the determination of the}} S 100 B protein. The His-tagged VC 1 domains of Receptors for Advanced Glycation End (RAGE) products used as analytically active molecules were covalently immobilized on a monolayer of a thiol derivative of <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DPTA) complex with Cu(II) deposited on a gold electrode surface. The recognition processes between the RAGE VC 1 domain and the S 100 B protein results in changes in the redox activity of the DPTA-Cu(II) centres which were measured by Osteryoung square-wave voltammetry (OSWV). In order to verify whether the observed analytical signal originates from the recognition process between the His 6 –RAGE VC 1 domains and the S 100 B protein, the electrode modified with the His 6 –RAGE C 2 and His 6 –RAGE VC 1 deleted domains which have no ability to bind S 100 B peptides were applied. The proposed biosensor was quite sensitive, with a detection limit of 0. 52 pM recorded in the buffer solution.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} an electrochemical biosensor for the determination of Aβ 16 – 23 &# 039; and Aβ 1 – 40 peptides. The His-tagged V and VC 1 domains of Receptor for Advanced Glycation end Products (RAGE) immobilized on a gold electrode surface were used as analytically active molecules. The immobilization of His 6 –RAGE domains consists of: (i) formation of a mixed layer of N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) and the thiol derivative of <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DPTA); (ii) complexation of Cu(II) by DPTA; (iii) oriented immobilization of His 6 –RAGE domains via coordination bonds between Cu(II) sites from DPTA–Cu(II) complex and imidazole nitrogen atoms of a histidine tag. Each modification step was controlled by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Osteryoung square-wave voltammetry (OSWV), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The applicability of the proposed biosensor was tested in the presence of human plasma, which had no influence on its performance. The detection limits for Aβ 1 – 40 determination were 1. 06 nM and 0. 80 nM, in the presence of buffer and human plasma, respectively. These values reach the concentration level of Aβ 1 – 40 which is relevant for determination of its soluble form in human plasma, as well as in brain. This indicates the promising future application of biosensor presented for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} graft patency, flow, and flow reserve {{in patients with}} minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery of internal thoracic artery grafts by a combined magnetic resonance protocol with a phase-contrast technique and magnetic resonance angiography. MethodsAt 1. 5 T (Magnetom Sonata, Siemens), 30 symptomatic patients with 30 left internal thoracic artery grafts were examined 6 years after minimally invasive surgical intervention. Navigator-gated magnetic resonance angiography and contrast-enhanced FLASH- 3 D magnetic resonance angiography (0. 2 mmol gadopentate–diethylene triamine <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> [Gd-DTPA]/kg body weight) {{was used to assess}} bypass patency. Phase-contrast flow measurements with retrospective gating were performed in the internal thoracic artery grafts at rest and after stress induction with dipyridamole (0. 57 mg/kg body weight). Graft patency was evaluated by means of multidetector computed tomography (Sensation 16, Siemens). ResultsInternal thoracic artery grafts were occluded in 5 of 30 patients. In 6 patients the anastomosis to the left anterior descending artery was highly stenotic (> 70 %) at multidetector computed tomography. In patients with regular grafts (multidetector computed tomography), a significant improvement of graft flow (P <. 001) and diastolic/systolic peak velocity ratio (P <. 001) after stress induction was detected. Magnetic resonance angiography combined with flow reserve measurements could differentiate between occluded-stenotic and regular minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafts. ConclusionsMagnetic resonance imaging allows a combined assessment of bypass patency and flow with flow reserve in patients after the minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass operation. The protocol of this study might be applicable for the evaluation of graft status in symptomatic patients after revascularization...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{of clinical}} significance, produces elastase as a predominant exoprotease. Here, we screened {{a library of}} chemical compounds currently used for humanmedication and identified diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA, <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid)</b> as an agent that suppresses the production of elastase. Elastase activity found in the pro-totype P. aeruginosa strain PAO 1 was significantly decreased when grown with a concentration as low as 20 MDTPA. Supple-mentation with Zn 2 orMn 2 ions restored the suppressive effect of DTPA, suggesting that the DTPA-mediated decrease in elastase activity is associated with ion-chelating activity. In DTPA-treated PAO 1 cells, transcription of the elastase-encoding lasB gene and levels of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), a molecule that mediates P. aeruginosa quorum sensing (QS), were significantly downregulated, reflecting the potential involvement of the PQS QS system in DTPA-mediated elastase suppression. Biofilm formation was also decreased by DTPA treatment. When A 549 alveolar type II-like adenocarcinoma cells were infected with PAO 1 cells {{in the presence of}} DTPA, A 549 cell viability was substantially increased. Furthermore, the intranasal delivery of DTPA to PAO 1 -infected mice alleviated the pathogenic effects of PAO 1 cells in the animals. Together, our results revealed a novel function for a knownmolecule that may help treat P. aeruginosa airway infection. Persistent use of antibiotics has resulted in the unwanted emer-gence of drug-resistant bacterial strains, ushering in a new era in which alternative strategies are necessary for the treatment of bacterial infections.

40|$|In this work, nanocomplexes {{based on}} {{chitosan}} grafted by carboxy-modified polylactic acid (SPLA) were prepared {{with the aim}} of loading simultaneously two anticancer drugs – doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil, as well as to control their release, reduce the initial burst and boost cytotoxicity. The SPLA was prepared by a polycondensation reaction, using <b>pentetic</b> <b>acid</b> as the core molecule, and linked to the chitosan backbone through a coupling reaction. Nanocomplexes loaded with both drugs were formulated by the polyelectrolyte complexation method. The structure of the SPLA was characterized by 1 H NMR, while the product CS-SPLA was analyzed by FTIR-ATR to prove the occurrence of the reaction. Results showed that the diameters and ζ-potential of the nanocomplexes fall in the range 120 – 200 nm and 20 – 37 mV, respectively. SEM and TEM analysis confirmed the spherical shape and dimensions of the nanocomplexes. The presence of hydrophobic side chain SPLA did not influence the encapsulation efficiency of the drugs but strongly reduced the initial burst and prolonged release over time compared to unmodified chitosan. MS analysis showed that no degradation or interactions between the drugs and carrier were exhibited after loading or 24 h of release had taken place, confirming the protective role of the nanocomplexes. In vitro tests demonstrated an increase in the cytotoxicity of the drugs when loaded in the prepared carriers. © 2017 The Authors 15 - 08287 Y, GACR, Grantová Agentura České RepublikyCzech Science Foundation [15 - 08287 Y]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [LO 1504, CZ. 1. 05 / 2. 1. 00 / 19. 0409...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{order to}} prevent gastric {{microbial}} overgrowth, which may complicate nasogastric feeding, administration of nutrients more distally into the gut has been advocated in intensive care patients, as it offers the advantage of keeping the stomach empty and acid. In this study, we assessed the impact of jejunal feeding upon gastic pH {{in a group of}} mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients, with special focus on duodenogastric reflux as a possible cause of gastric alkalinization during jejunal nutrition. DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gastric pH was recorded by continuous pHmetry over a 4 -h period of fasting followed by a 4 -h period of nasojejunal feeding at 100 kcal/h in 21 mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients. To determine the contribution of duodenogastric reflux to modifications of gastric acidity, the diet was traced with [(111) In] DTPA (<b>pentetic</b> <b>acid)</b> in 11 of these 21 patients; gastric contents were aspirated every 30 min, then analysed for measurement of radioactivity, glucose, and bile acid concentration. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Median intragastric pH increased slightly from 1. 59 (1. 20 - 2. 73; interquartile range) (fasting) to 2. 33 (1. 65 - 4. 64) (feeding) (p = 0. 013), and the length of time that the pH was 4 or above increased from 1 (0 - 24) to 9 (0 - 142) min (p = 0. 026). The variability of pH values and the number of acute alkalinization episodes did not change between the two phases. In 10 of 11 patients in which the diet was labeled with [(111) In] DTPA, reflux was documented at a given time of the feeding period. Bile acid concentrations in the stomach increased from 392 (61 - 1076) (fasting) to 1446 (320 - 2770) micromol/l (feeding) (p = 0. 010) and mean glucose concentration increased from 59 (28 - 95) to 164 (104 - 449) mg/dl (p = 0. 006). CONCLUSION: Duodenogastric reflux is common in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with nasojejunal feeding tubes. It occurs both during fasting and during nasojejunal feeding. During nasojejunal feeding, moderate alkalinization of the gastric contents occurs as a result of bile and nutrient reflux...|$|E
