50|$|The main {{limitations}} of the Thury system was that series distribution meant greater opportunity for power failures. Placing loads in series means that since current must flow through each device {{to get to the}} next, if the circuit is broken in any of the devices, the current stops at all other loads. Such series distribution was possible with automatic short circuiting mechanisms as in the Thomson-Houston and Brush high voltage DC arc light systems, but since each load is not independent as in modern <b>parallel</b> <b>distribution,</b> the approach was inherently more fragile.|$|E

The observation of scanning electron microscope (SEM) on a mature tooth shows that the tooth {{is a kind of}} natural bioceramic composite consisting of hydroxyapatite layers and collagen protein matrix. The observation also shows that the hydroxyapatite layers consist of long and thin hydroxyapatite sheets and that all the hydroxyapatite sheets are arranged in a kind of <b>parallel</b> <b>distribution.</b> The maximum pullout energy of the hydroxyapatite sheets, which is closely related to the fracture toughness of the tooth, is investigated based on the representative model of the <b>parallel</b> <b>distribution.</b> It shows that the long and thin shape as well as the <b>parallel</b> <b>distribution</b> of the hydroxyapatite sheets increase the maximum pullout energy and enhance the fracture toughness of the tooth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – A {{current flowing}} through a {{distribution}} conductor produces induced voltage, which is harmful to a telecommunication line. Previous research on induced voltage {{has been focused}} on single-circuit lines in the distribution system. However, the double-circuit lines, referred to as <b>parallel</b> <b>distribution</b> lines, are widely used in distribution systems because they have significant economic and environmental advantages over single-circuit lines. Therefore, a study on the induced voltage in double-circuit lines is needed. This paper presents a method of calculating the induced voltage in a <b>parallel</b> <b>distribution</b> system using four-terminal parameters and vector analysis. The calculation method is verified by the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) simulation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Parallel</b> {{patterns}} of <b>distribution</b> in different lineages suggest a common cause. Explanations {{in terms of}} a single biogeographic event often imply contemporaneous diversifications. Phylogenies with absolute time scales provide the most obvious means of testing temporal components of biogeographic hypotheses but, in their absence, the sequence of diversification events and whether any could have been contemporaneous can be tested with relative date estimates. Tests using relative time scales have been largely overlooked, but because they do not require the calibration upon which absolute time scales depend, they make a large amount of existing molecular data of use to historical biogeography and may also be helpful when calibration is possible but uncertain. We illustrate the use of relative dating by testing the hypothesis that <b>parallel,</b> disjunct east/west <b>distributions</b> in three independent lineages of African caecilians have a common cause. We demonstrate that at least two biogeographic events are implied by molecular data. Relative dating analysis reveals the potential complexity of causes of <b>parallel</b> <b>distributions</b> and cautions against inferring common cause from common spatial patterns without considering the temporal dimension...|$|R

40|$|Relevant {{results for}} (sub-) {{distribution}} functions related to parallel systems are discussed. The reverse hazard rate is defined using the product integral. Consequently, the restriction of absolute continuity for the involved distributions can be relaxed. The only restriction {{is that the}} sets of discontinuity points of the <b>parallel</b> <b>distributions</b> have to be disjointed. Nonparametric Bayesian estimators of all survival (sub-) distribution functions are derived. Dual to the series systems that use minimum life times as observations, the parallel systems record the maximum life times. Dirichlet multivariate processes forming a class of prior distributions are considered for the nonparametric Bayesian estimation of the component distribution functions, and the system reliability.
