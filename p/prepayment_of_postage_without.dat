50|$|The term formular (often spelled formula) is an {{adjective}} {{applied to}} envelopes, cards and aerograms, etc., produced by postal authorities or to their specification, but bearing no imprinted or embossed stamp or other indication <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b>|$|R

Note that {{although there is}} an indicium for the registration fee, there is no <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> An adhesive postage stamp {{would have to be}} applied to send it. This and many other envelopes were made from thick paper and lined with glued gauze to make it stiffer and non-transparent.|$|R
50|$|Most aerograms have an {{imprinted}} stamp {{indicating the}} <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> As such, this meets {{the definition of}} being postal stationery. However, some countries such as New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Ireland, sell unstamped aerograms. Unstamped aerograms {{are referred to as}} formular aerograms and can be issued by either postal authorities or by private companies. Senders are required to write their name and address on the reverse.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{purpose of}} a stamp is to indicate the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> Since different kinds and sizes of mail normally pay different amounts <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> the stamps need to carry a value. In a very few cases, the denomination has been omitted; for instance, during the tumults of 1949 China, undenominated stamps were issued, so as to allow {{the price of a}} stamp to fluctuate on a daily basis depending on the value of the gold yuan.|$|R
5000|$|Hong Kong {{formerly}} produced {{postage stamps}} {{with the name}} Hong Kong, {{with the face of}} the reigning monarchs of the United Kingdom, or with the royal symbols (e.g. [...] "E.R.").

50|$|The {{use of the}} Scinde Dawk {{adhesive}} stamps {{to signify}} the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> began on 1 July 1852 in the Scinde/Sindh district, {{as part of a}} comprehensive reform of the district's postal system. A year earlier Sir Bartle Frere had replaced the postal runners with a network of horses and camels, improving communications in the Indus river valley to serve the military and commercial needs of the British East India Company.|$|R
50|$|Vote-by-mail is a {{variation}} of postal voting in the United States in which a ballot is mailed {{to the home of}} a registered voter, the voter fills it out and returns it via postal mail. This process eliminates the requirements to staff and run a polling center during an election, and can result in considerable cost savings to the state. Balloting materials may be sent via the United States Postal Service <b>without</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The British {{set up an}} {{overseas}} post office in Malta in the mid-nineteenth century. British stamps were made available in Malta in August 1857, and <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> became compulsory on 1 February 1858. These British stamps were cancelled with [...] "M" [...] or later [...] "A25" [...] postmarks. The [...] "A25" [...] postmark was also used to cancel other countries' stamps on maritime mail, and it is known on French, Tunisian, Italian, Egyptian and Indian stamps.|$|R
50|$|Stamps were {{required}} for the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> a basic feature of the new system. These stamps, first issued on July 1, 1852, bore the Merchants' Mark of the British East India Company in a design embossed on wafers of red sealing wax impressed on paper. Because they cracked and disintegrated, they were soon replaced by a colourless design embossed on white paper which {{was hard to see}} in a dim light. The last stamps were a blue embossing on white paper. All of these had a value of only one-half anna each, but today they rank among the rare classics of philately.|$|R
5000|$|As {{noted by}} the U.S. Postal Service's Domestic Mail Manual, the voter must {{typically}} pay postage for mailing his or her absentee ballot, but [...] "balloting materials for any election ... must indicate in a prominent location that the proper amount <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> must be paid." [...] Balloting materials may be sent via the U.S. Postal Service <b>without</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> for [...] "members of the Armed Forces in active service (and their spouses and dependents)"; [...] "members of the U.S. Merchant Marine and their spouses and dependents"; and [...] "U.S. citizens residing outside the territorial limits of the United States and the District of Columbia and their spouses and dependents residing with or accompanying them." ...|$|R
50|$|The one penny (carmine), two pence (blue) and one {{shilling}} (green) stamps of 1855 {{were initially}} printed in London by Perkins, Bacon & Co. These are rare and expensive (collectors should not buy without expertisation). The printing plates were shipped to New Zealand, and beginning in 1856, stamps were printed by J. Richardson in Auckland, who also printed the six pence stamp (brown) from 1858. Government postage stamp printer John Davis began printing stamps in 1862. <b>Prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> became compulsory in New Zealand in 1862, {{and so the}} Davis prints are much more common than the other printings. The three pence stamp (mauve) was also added in 1862.|$|R
50|$|Private overprints {{have been}} used for a number of reasons. Generally they cannot be used as control marks, as the stamp or stamps are thus {{rendered}} invalid for <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> (though some such invalid stamps have successfully passed through the mails, presumably due to an oversight of postal employees). However, while in Great Britain privately overprinted stamps usually served as receipts for tax payments, in 1859, upon application of the Oxford Union Society, there was a unique instance of a private overprint being approved for application on the face of stamps. This is to be distinguished from the more or less frequent application of private overprints to the back of stamps as control marks.|$|R
25|$|President Don Ignacio Comonfort, {{authorized}} the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> using adhesive stamps by decree of February 21, 1856. New regulations were drawn up and {{were supposed to}} be published on July 15, but problems with the engraving delayed this until July 31. On August 1, 1856 Mexico issued its first postage stamps. The design, a portrait of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the parish priest who led an unsuccessful bid for Mexican independence in 1810, reflected the reform politics of the Comonfort government. The stamps were somewhat crudely engraved and imperforate. Five values were issued from 1856-1859; ½ real, 1r, 2r, 4r, and 8r. The stamps usually, but not always, had district overprints with the name of the district post office.|$|R
5000|$|Postal {{cards are}} postal {{stationery}} with an imprinted stamp or indicium signifying the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> They are sold by postal authorities. On January 26, 1869, Dr. Emanuel Herrmann of Austria described {{the advantages of}} a Correspondenz Karte. By October 1, 1869 the world's first postal card was produced by Austria-Hungary. [...] They caught on quickly. By the end of 1870, Great Britain, Finland, Switzerland and Württemberg joined the countries issuing postal cards. In the United States, they were first produced in 1873. [...] Some of the forms taken by postal cards include the regular single card which may be commemorative or definitive, attached message-reply cards, airmail postal cards, and official postal cards used for official government business with a [...] "penalty for private use".|$|R
60|$|I {{invite the}} {{favorable}} consideration of Congress to the suggestions and {{recommendations of the}} Postmaster-General for {{an extension of the}} free-delivery system in all cities having a population of not less than 10,000; for the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> on newspapers and other printed matter of the second class; for a uniform <b>postage</b> and limit <b>of</b> weight on miscellaneous matter; for adjusting the compensation of all postmasters not appointed by the President, by the old method of commissions on the actual receipts of the office, instead of the present mode of fixing the salary in advance upon special returns; and especially do I urge favorable action by Congress on the important recommendations of the Postmaster-General for the establishment of United States postal savings depositories.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, an {{absentee}} ballot is a ballot that the voter records and casts other than at a designated polling station on Election Day. Typically these ballots are mailed, though some states provide provisions for emailing ballots, faxing ballots, or delivering them in person to a designated location. Typically a voter must request an {{absentee ballot}} {{at least a}} week before the election occurs. Each State's Secretary of State or Director of Elections {{is in charge of the}} election process, including voter registration and absentee ballot requests. Balloting materials may be sent via the United States Postal Service <b>without</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> for members <b>of</b> the Armed Forces, members of the U.S. Merchant Marine and U.S. citizens residing outside the territorial limits of the United States and the District of Columbia and their spouses.|$|R

In 1856, under the direction of Postmaster General James Campbell, Toppan and Carpenter, (commissioned by the U.S. government to print U.S. postage stamps through the 1850s) purchased a rotary machine designed to separate stamps, patented in England in 1854 by William and Henry Bemrose, who were printers in Derby, England. The original machine cut slits into the paper rather than punching holes, but the machine was soon modified. The first stamp issue to be officially perforated, the 3-cent George Washington, was issued by the U.S. Post Office on February 24, 1857. Between 1857 and 1861 all stamps originally issued between 1851 and 1856 were reissued with perforations. Initial capacity was insufficient to perforate all stamps printed, thus perforated issues used between February and July 1857 are scarce and quite valuable.|$|R
5000|$|Soon thereafter, Fisk was {{appointed}} as Postmaster of San Francisco. It {{was in this}} position he suffered his first public controversy. In {{the wake of the}} 1906 earthquake, Fisk had allowed mail to be sent <b>without</b> <b>postage,</b> which was technically illegal, and was estimated to cost the federal government $60,000. Fisk said he [...] "forwarded hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> letters <b>without</b> <b>postage</b> throughout the United States. These letters were written on old cuffs, pieces of cardboard, anything. They went into the mail bags and I was liable to criminal prosecution...Thousands were homeless, without food and without means of communicating with relatives. I established kitchens {{in the basement of the}} post office and fed hundreds of starving people." [...] Five years later, an act of Congress exonerated Fisk. When Democrats gained the White House in 1912, President Wilson asked for Fisk's resignation as Postmaster.|$|R
40|$|Contact author. 1 Although {{extensive}} {{studies have}} been done to examine the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> primary mortgages, not much has been done to analyze the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper studies the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fixed-rate home equity loans using a large loan-level sample for the period 1995 to 1998. We find that <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans is sensitive to changes in market interest rates, indicating that borrowers refinance their loans when market interest rates are lower than coupon interest rates. We also find that trends in interest rate changes {{play an important role in}} borrower prepayment decisions. When borrowers expect market interest rates to decrease further, they will wait for better opportunities to prepay their home equity loans even when the loans are already “in the money. ” Loan size and borrower creditworthiness also affect the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. However, the loan-to-value ratio, an important factor in primary mortgage prepayment, has little effect on the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper also documents the effect of payment delinquencies on prepayment behavior. Borrowers with either minor or major delinquencies in making monthly payments are less likely to prepay their home equity loans. ...|$|R

5|$|The great {{influx of}} bullion from the California Gold Rush and other finds caused {{the price of}} silver {{relative}} to gold to increase starting in 1848, and silver coins were hoarded or exported for melting. In 1851, a bill for a three-cent piece in 75% silver and 25% copper was introduced in Congress by New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson, who wanted to lower postage rates from five to three cents. This percentage of silver was less than the normal 90% so that the coins would circulate {{at a time of}} hoarding. The copper large cent did not circulate in the Pacific Coast region or South due to prejudice against coins that did not contain precious metal, and some means of allowing the purchase <b>of</b> a <b>postage</b> stamp <b>without</b> the use of copper cents was necessary. Dickinson's bill passed on March 3, 1851, and in addition to authorizing the new three-cent silver, lowered rates for most domestic mails. By 1854, the imbalance had abated, and Congress increased the silver content of the three-cent piece to the standard 90% for silver coins, though its weight was reduced.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the probabilities <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> or default for Fixed Rate Mortgages (FRMs) and Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs). Using {{data from the}} period 1985 - 1992, the analysis indicates that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> thirty year FRMs was determined primarily by house price appreciation and personal income growth and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fifteen year FRMs was determined primarily by interest rate changes. ARMs were prepaid less frequently than FRMs, {{were less likely to}} be prepaid when interest rates declined and defaulted more often than FRMs. The analysis provides evidence that ARM holders are less mobile than FRM holders.
