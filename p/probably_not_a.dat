The {{historian}} Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, which suggests that Regenbald {{was one of the}} foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome {{looks more like a}} mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster Abbey. His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic in style, but it is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E

5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> town.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists accept Allosaurus as {{an active}} {{predator}} of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on Stegosaurus, including an Allosaurus tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a Stegosaurus tail spike, and a Stegosaurus neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an Allosaurus snout. Sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging, based {{on the presence of}} scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, Allosaurus was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. Robert T. Bakker, comparing Allosaurus to Cenozoic sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although Allosaurus did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that this theological objection plays any role in the non-inclusion of Good Friday as a holiday. On the contrary, Good Friday is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> public holiday because, as a whole in the federation, Christians constitutes 9.2% of the population according to the 2010 Census. The other two significant religious minorities in Malaysia, Buddhists and Hindus, also receive just one federal public holiday each – Wesak Day and Deepavali respectively. Deepavali however, is not federal holiday in the state of Sarawak.|$|E

25|$|Viking burial rituals were {{complex and}} dramatic. One witness Ibn Fadlan Risala {{describes}} the ship burial ritual in detail. The burial consisted {{of days of}} mourning, sewing special burial clothes, dog sacrifice, running horses then cutting them into pieces and putting them in the ship with the deceased, and burning the whole thing. This shows that horse slaughter was dramatic and memorable; it was noted in this story. Also taking into consideration the economic value of horses, it was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> decision taken lightly. Given the public display of the sacrifice, {{it could not have}} solely been for personal religious reasons and could have had important social implications as well.|$|E

25|$|Later {{the parties}} confer. The {{man in the}} teashop was Mr Lipscombe and when Miss Carnaby {{recognised}} him, she put on an act of allegiance to Andersen. Poirot realised this {{when he had the}} man followed back to the lodge. Andersen's chemistry background (although he was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Jewish refugee) came in useful for preparing injections of hashish to produce ecstasy in his adherents, and also for injecting them with relevant bacteria when he wanted to kill them and inherit their estates. Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment she told him about. The proof has been obtained in the laboratory in the sanctuary that the police have raided.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of schooling behavior was probably {{associated with an}} increased quality of perception, predatory lifestyle and size sorting mechanisms to avoid cannibalism. In filter-feeding ancestors, before vision and the OLS had developed, the risk of predation would have been limited and mainly due to invertebrate predators, hence, at that time, safety in numbers was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> major incentive for gathering together in shoals or schools. The {{development of}} the OLS, and vision, would have permitted detection of potential prey. This could have led to an increased potential for cannibalism within the shoal. On the other hand, increased quality of perception would also give small individuals a chance to escape or to never join a shoal with larger fish. It has been shown that small fish avoid joining a group with larger fish, although big fish do not avoid joining small conspecifics. This sorting mechanism based on increased quality of perception could have resulted in homogeneity of size of fish in shoals, which would increase the capacity for moving in synchrony.|$|E

500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the Mascarene parrot in life. Since several {{specimens}} were kept alive in captivity, it was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> specialised feeder. That the Vienna specimen was partially white may have been the result of food deficiency during a long period in captivity; the clipped primary wing feathers indicate it was caged. Little was known about parrot-diet in the 1700s, and the Vienna specimen may not have received enough of the amino acid tyrosine through its food, which it would have needed for melanin synthesis. In other parrots, this would have resulted in orange instead of white colour in the affected feathers, due to the presence of the pigment psittacin, but Coracopsis parrots and the Mascarene parrot are the only parrots that lack this pigment. The specimen has also been described as [...] "partially albinistic" [...] at times, though true albinism (lack of the enzyme tyrosinase) can by definition never only be partial.|$|E

500|$|Herodotus (III, 137-38), {{who lived}} some years after Milo's death, says the wrestler {{accepted}} {{a large sum}} of money from the distinguished physician Democedes {{for the privilege of}} marrying Milo's daughter. [...] If Herodotus is indeed correct, then Milo was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> member of Croton's nobility for such an arrangement with a wage-earning physician would have been beneath the dignity of a Greek noble. Democedes was a native of Croton and enjoyed a successful career as a physician at Croton, Aegina, Athens, and Samos. He was captured by Darius in the defeat of the Samian tyrant Polycrates and taken to the Persian capital of Susa as a slave. [...] There, he carefully tended both the king and queen and was eventually permitted to revisit Croton, but under guard. [...] He escaped his Persian guards and made his way to Croton, where he married Milo's daughter. [...] The physician sent a message regarding his marriage to Darius, who was an admirer of the wrestler and can only have learned of him through Democedes during his slavery at Susa.|$|E
500|$|The passage {{suggests}} that tunic-wearing retiarii were trained {{for a different}} role, [...] "in servitude, under strict discipline and even possibly under some restraints." [...] Certain effeminate men mentioned by Seneca the Younger in his Quaestiones naturales were trained as gladiators and may correspond to Juvenal's tunic-wearing retiarii. Suetonius reports this anecdote: [...] "Once a band of five retiarii in tunics, matched against {{the same number of}} secutores, yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors." [...] The reaction of Emperor Caligula showed the disgust with which he viewed the gladiators' actions: [...] "Caligula bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder, and expressed his horror of those who had had the heart to witness it." [...] The fate of the retiarii is not revealed. This was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> standard competition, as real gladiators did not surrender so easily. Rather, such tunic-wearing net-men may have served as comic relief in the gladiatorial programming.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the gradual}} {{condemnation}} {{of the work and}} the accusation that Sigonio had created it himself, there were some holdouts. Robinson Ellis, in 1893, argued that the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio, while <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> genuine work of Cicero's, was not a forgery by Sigonio. He reasoned that, because St. Ambrose Traversari had claimed to have found a copy of the work so close to its rediscovery by Sigonio in 1583, it was possible that Sigonio had simply found the Perugian text. He also proposed the idea that, because the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio contained all of the extant fragments from Lactantius's work, the true Consolatio had been lost and replaced by a [...] "spurious one" [...] in the distant past that was read by Lactantius, Augustine, and Jerome, who mistakenly assumed its veracity; this false Consolatio was then rediscovered by Sigonio, who unwittingly believed it also to be genuine. Finally, Ellis argued that, because Sigonio was a man of [...] "high character" [...] who had spent much of his life editing the fragments of Cicero, for Sigonio to stoop to forgery would have been completely out of character.|$|E
