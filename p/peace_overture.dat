25|$|On 7 June 1950, Kim Il-sung {{called for}} a Korea-wide {{election}} on 5–8 August 1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 15–17 June 1950. On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South as a <b>peace</b> <b>overture</b> that Rhee rejected outright. On 21 June, Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve a general attack across the 38th parallel, rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin peninsula. Kim was concerned that South Korean agents learned about the plans and South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses. Stalin agreed to this change of plan.|$|E
25|$|Kublai's niece, Kelmish, {{who married}} a Khongirad {{general of the}} Golden Horde, was {{powerful}} enough to have Kublai's sons Nomuqan and Kokhchu returned. Three leaders of the Jochids, Tode Mongke, Köchü, and Nogai, agreed to release two princes. The court of the Golden Horde returned the princes as a <b>peace</b> <b>overture</b> to the Yuan Dynasty in 1282 and induced Kaidu to release Kublai's general. Konchi, khan of the White Horde, established friendly relations with the Yuan and the Ilkhanate, and as a reward received luxury gifts and grain from Kublai. Despite political disagreement between contending branches of the family over the office of Khagan, the economic and commercial system continued.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Peace</b> <b>Overture,</b> for orchestra. [...] A {{programmatic}} tone {{poem about}} {{the struggle for}} peace - inspired by the life of Anwar Sadat and the Israel-Egypt Peace Accords. Conductor, Paul Polivnick recorded <b>Peace</b> <b>Overture</b> with the London Symphony. Polivnick also premiered the work in 1988 during the Birmingham International Festival of Arts, which commissioned Peck to write a piece for the Alabama Symphony honoring Egypt. It traces an emotional outline regarding Sadat's story. One very defined melody permeates the work: the Negro Spiritual [...] "Sometimes I feel like a motherless child". Peck said he didn't intend to quote a phrase from this melody, {{but there is a}} clear correlation when listening to the song, for example, as sung by Paul Robeson. <b>Peace</b> <b>Overture</b> was performed at the Eastern Music Festival in July 2009 in honor of Russell Peck. [...] Duration: 11', (1988).|$|E

50|$|While in Tokyo, Bagge was {{attended}} by foreign minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, who wanted Bagge to convey a <b>peace</b> <b>overture</b> to the United States. Bagge cabled a surrender offer to the Swedish foreign office, for transmittal to the United Kingdom, which relayed it to the United States. Japan was prepared to relinquish all the territory it took in the war and Manchukuo, which it had seized in 1931. Bagge emphasized that the offer must be considered a serious one. The offer, however, came to nothing.|$|E
50|$|Following the Fall of France, <b>peace</b> <b>overtures</b> {{continued}} to emanate from the Vatican {{as well as}} Sweden and the United States to which Churchill responded resolutely that Germany would first have to free its conquered territories.

Compare this to the emperor's <b>peace</b> <b>overture</b> in [...] "The Coming of Shadows."There's another applicable metaphor for the sword story; you'll see it a little later this season.

50|$|Although {{in the end}} {{nothing came}} of them, during 1917 and 1918, the Turks made {{informal}} <b>peace</b> <b>overtures</b> to the British. In {{the second and third}} weeks of November, after the signing of the Balfour Declaration, the War Cabinet considered what terms it might offer in order to detach Turkey. Both Milner and Smuts were willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty and this view, backed by Lloyd George, prevailed even over the objections of the Foreign Office and Curzon.|$|R

Von Papen was a cousin of Elisabeth Vermehren, and as a result of this family tie, Vermehren was assigned to Istanbul as a junior-grade agent after two weeks' training in secret inks. Elisabeth, however, was detained by the Gestapo as a hostage.|$|R

50|$|In summer 384, as Murong Hong was {{advancing}} on Chang'an, Murong Hong's strategist Gao Gai (高蓋) {{and other}} officials felt that Murong Hong's reputation was not as great as Murong Chong's, and that Murong Hong's punishments were overly harsh. They therefore killed him and supported Murong Chong {{to be the new}} ruler. As Murong Wei was still alive but under Former Qin control in Chang'an, Murong Chong took the title of crown prince. Fu Jiān made a <b>peace</b> <b>overture</b> to him with an apparent sexual undertone—by sending him a robe and a message reminding him of their personal relationship, but Murong Chong rejected the overture.|$|E

50|$|Abu Zayd began criticizing President Sadat in the mid-1970s. She {{became a}} leader of the Egyptian National Front, which was set up in Damascus in 1980 by General Saad El Shazly. The {{organization}} called for the overthrow of Sadat's government. Due to her opposition to Sadat's <b>peace</b> <b>overture</b> to Israel, Abu Zayd was accused of high treason, terrorism and spying, and was consequently deprived of her Egyptian nationality. This turned her into a stateless political refugee. A long legal battle ensued, which was finally resolved in late 1991 when a judge ruled that Abu Zayd and her husband were entitled to their Egyptian passports. She was also acquitted of the charges of high treason and terrorism.|$|E
50|$|The Lombard League disbanded. Lodi, Novara, Vercelli, Chieri and Savona were {{captured}} or {{submitted to the}} emperor, while Amadeus IV of Savoy and Boniface II of Montferrat confirmed their Ghibelline allegiance. Milan, Brescia, Piacenza and Bologna remained alone in Arms. Frederick, now {{at the top of}} his strength, besieged Milan. He rejected all Milanese <b>peace</b> <b>overtures,</b> insisting on unconditional surrender. Milan and five other cities, however, held out, and, in October 1238, he had to raise the siege of Brescia.|$|R
5000|$|The Afghan {{government}} was {{to set up}} a [...] "national council for peace, reconciliation and reintegration".

By the end of October, Hitler realised the necessary air superiority for his planned invasion of Britain could not be achieved and he ordered nightly air raids on British cities, including London, Plymouth and Coventry.|$|R
