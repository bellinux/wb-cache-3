40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{evaluation}} of radiation effects in detectors based on p-type magnetic czochralski (MCz) Si that was converted to n-type by thermal donor (TD) introduction. As-processed p+-p-n+ detectors were annealed at 430 °C resulting in p+-n(TD) -n+ structures. The space charge sign and the electric field distribution E(x) in MCz Si p+-n(TD) -n+ detectors irradiated by 24 GeV/c protons were analyzed using the data on the current <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> and the Double Peak (DP) electric field distribution model for heavily irradiated detectors. The approach considers an irradiated detector as a structure with three regions in which the electric field depends on the coordinate, and the induced current <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> arises from the drift process of free carriers in the detector with variable electric field. Reconstruction of the E(x) profile from the <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> shapes is performed employing a new method for DP electric field reconstruction. This method includes: (a) a direct extraction of charge loss due to trapping and (b) the fitting of a simulated <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> to the “corrected” pulse by adjusting the electric field profiles in the three regions. Reconstruction of E(x) distribution showed that in the diodes irradiated by a proton fluence of (2 – 4) × 1014 p/cm 2 space charge sign inversion has occurred. This is the evidence that the influence of 24 GeV/c proton radiation on MCz Si p+-n(TD) -n+ detectors is similar to that on p+-n-n+ detectors based on FZ or diffusion oxygenated n-type Si...|$|R

The <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> signal initiates from the ultrafast charge separation of the retinal and the proton translocation followed by the deprotonation and reprotonation of the Schiff base and its surrounding amino acids. This is a quick response and is the preceding reaction of the differential response. The differential response signal is caused by the charging and discharging of the continuous proton current of the BR light-driven proton pump at light-on and light-off, which is a slow process. The differential response is related to not only the construction of the BR photocell but also the coupling mode of measurement. To observe the differential response signal, the BR photocell must have large enough B- 3 and B- 3 &# 39; components in its <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> as well as an alternative coupling mode to measure it...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{publication}} is to document a simple model of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration based on exogenous input of anthropogenic emission of CO 2 and taking air-sea exchange and biospheric responses into account. The approach described by Joos et al (1996) {{is based on the}} application of a mixed layer <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function. The advantage of using a mixed layer <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function instead of an atmosphere <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function (Siegentaler and Oeschger, 1978; Oeschger and Heimann, 1983; Meier-Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987; Sarmiento et al., 1992) is that it is then possible to represent the non-linear effects of seawater chemistry. As long as the CO 2 increase in the atmosphere is below approximately 50 % of the pre-industrial level, the CO 2 system behaves in a linear way and it is possible to represent the effects of anthropogenic emissions on the atmospheric concentrations by an atmospheric <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function. For CO 2 perturbations beyond this level the non-linear effects of the seawater chemistry becomes important, and it thus becomes necessary to apply a mixed layer <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function to obtain accurate results. The approach described in this paper includes changes in CO 2 uptake and release by terrestrial vegetation by CO 2 fertilization, but {{does not take into account}} possible feedback mechanisms of climate change on the carbon cycle. Possible feedbacks include changes in CO 2 solubility due to sea surface temperature (SST) changes and changes in vertical mixing by reduced deep-water formation in the North Atlantic. Joos et al. (1999 a) have estimated the marine part of this to be of minor importance (approximately 4 %) up to 2100, increasing to about 20 % in 2500. Since damage caused by climate change could imply high costs, an accurate representation of the carbon cycle is very important in models that are to be used to estimate the costs of climate and evaluate different mitigation and/or adaptation strategies (Joos et al., 1999 b). The carbon cycle model described in this paper is included in a simple model for scenario studies of changes in global climate (Fuglestvedt and Berntsen, 1999) ...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experimental}} work {{is concerned with}} the study of amplitude dependent acoustic response of an isothermal coaxial swirling jet. The excitation amplitude is increased in five distinct steps at the burner's Helmholtz resonator mode (i. e., 100 Hz). Two flow states are compared, namely, sub-critical and super-critical vortex breakdown (VB) that occur before and after the critical conical sheet breakdown, respectively. The geometric swirl number is varied in the range 2. 14 - 4. 03. Under the influence of external <b>pulsing,</b> global <b>response</b> <b>characteristics</b> are studied based on the topological changes observed in time-averaged 2 D flow field. These are obtained from high resolution 2 D PIV (particle image velocimetry) in the longitudinal-mid plane. PIV results also illustrate the changes in the normalized vortex core coordinates (r(vcc) /(r(vcc)) (0) (Hz), y(vcc) /(y(vcc)) (0) (Hz)) of internal recirculation zone (IRZ). A strong forced response is observed at 100 Hz (excitation frequency) in the convectively unstable region which get amplified based on the magnitude of external forcing. The radial extent of this forced response region at a given excitation amplitude is represented by the acoustic response region (b). The topological placement of the responsive convectively unstable region is a function of both the intensity of imparted swirl (characterized by swirl number) and forcing amplitude. It is observed that for sub-critical VB mode, an increase in the excitation amplitude till a critical value shifts the vortex core centre (particularly, the vortex core moves downstream and radially outwards) leading to drastic fanning-out/widening of the IRZ. This is accompanied by similar to 30 % reduction in the recirculation velocity of the IRZ. It is also observed that b = R. In contrast, the vortex core of super-critical breakdown mode consistently spreads radially outwards and is displaced further downstream. Finally, the IRZ fans-out at the threshold excitation amplitude. However, the acoustic response region b is still less than R. This is explained based on the characteristic geometric swirl number (S-G) of the flow regimes. The super-critical flow mode with higher S-G (hence, higher radial pressure drop due to rotational effect which scales as Delta P similar to rho u theta(2) and acts inwards towards the center line) compared to sub-critical state imposes a greater resistance to the radial outward spread of b. As a result, the acoustic energy supplied to the super-critical flow mode increases the degree of acoustic <b>response</b> at the <b>pulsing</b> frequency and energizes its harmonics (evident from power spectra). As a disturbance amplifier, the stronger convective instability mode within the flow structure of super-critical VB causes the topology to widen/fan-out severely at threshold excitation amplitude.
