25|$|When the {{locomotive}} is running under power, a draught {{on the fire}} is created by the exhaust steam directed up the chimney by the blastpipe. Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When {{the locomotive}} is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no exhaust steam to create a draught, so the draught is maintained {{by means of a}} blower. This is a ring placed either {{around the base of the}} chimney, or around the blast pipe orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by the blower valve. When the regulator is open, the blower valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open the blower valve. It is important that the blower be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught â€“ where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the <b>pressure</b> <b>shock.</b> The blower is also used to create draught when steam is being raised at the start of the locomotive's duty, at any time when the driver needs to increase the draught on the fire, and to clear smoke from the driver's line of vision.|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the design of a {{hydraulic}} device on which simulations of <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> can be performed. The hydraulic device was constructed to allow simulations of <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> transferred directly in operating conditions because simulation programs for hydraulic accumulators have only theoretical values while simulation on the designed hydraulic device enables obtaining specific readings directly in operating conditions that can be set. At the first control measurement on the hydraulic device, there occurred <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> generated by the hydraulic device itself, these <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> being undesirable in hydraulic circuits. In order to eliminate <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> in the circuit, a diaphragm accumulator was added to the hydraulic device and was used to verify the function of simulating <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> and eliminating undesirable <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks.</b> During the second control measurement on the hydraulic device, a reduction of unwanted <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> was shown with the help of added diaphragm accumulator, thus the function of the hydraulic device to simulate <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> was confirmed, which may also refect practical application in hydraulic circuits of mobile machines...|$|R

2500|$|At gas-phase {{concentrations}} {{greater than}} 30% volume in air at STP (more correctly: at partial pressures above 10 kPa), ClO2 may explosively decompose into chlorine and oxygen. The decomposition can be initiated by, for example, light, hot spots, chemical reaction, or <b>pressure</b> <b>shock.</b> [...] Thus, chlorine dioxide gas is never handled in concentrated form, but {{is almost always}} handled as a dissolved gas in water in a concentration range of 0.5 to 10grams per liter.

In many countries, such as the United States, chlorine dioxide gas may not be transported at any concentration and is almost always produced at the application site using a chlorine dioxide generator. In some countries, chlorine dioxide solutions below 3grams per liter in concentration may be transported by land, however, they are relatively unstable and deteriorate quickly.|$|E

40|$|The {{physics of}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> plays {{a central role}} in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In {{indirect}} drive ICF, x-rays from a gold cavity (hohlraum) are used to ablatively drive a series of high <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> into a spherical target (capsule). These shocks converge at the center, compressing the fuel and forming a hot dense core. The target performance, such as peak fuel density and temperature and neutron yield, depends critically on hock timing, and material compressibility. Accurate predictions of NIF target performance depends critically on shock timing and material compressibility. Current measurement techniques enable us to accurately determine shock timing in planar samples of abator material as a function of laser drive. Although this technique does not separately address uncertainties in material EOS and opacity, it does allow us to tune the laser drive until the desired shock timing is achieved. Experiments to directly address the EOS of D{sub 2 } ice are planned to further increase the margin for ignition in current target designs...|$|R

40|$|A survey covers <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> {{or water}} hammers and {{cavitation}} impacts in piping systems, events that increasingly occur, {{and the reasons}} for their occurrence and their effects on the piping. The application and limits of simplified formulas that under certain conditions make it possible to estimate such possible impacts are presented. Three examples indicate which measures to take to avoid <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> or water hammers and cavitation impacts in piping systems. The discussion includes introduction; reasons and effects for <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> and cavitation; empirical formulas, their use and limits; consideration of the risks and measures to avoid them; and a passive safety system. In cooperation with the Ebro Armaturen company, the Fraunhofer Institut Umsicht has developed and patented the Pressure Control Device (PCD). This is a reliable, easily installed, and passive safety system (no additional auxiliary energy involved). On a standard drive the PCD with force lockin g closure or control fitting contains an inner hydraulic circuit that is placed in motion by a signal from the control element. At the same time the PCD is effectively hydraulically connected to the main line. When the pressure in the main line piping reaches an undue value, such that the hydraulic circulation or cycle in the PCD is stopped, further closing of the fitting is hindered until the pressure in the main pipeline again drops. In every instance the fitting closes - failsafe - through an inner bypass in the PCD with preset time constants. The first example relates to a long pipe carrying liquids in which water hammers and cavitation blows arise form opening and closing the fittings. The second example also relates to a long pipe carrying liquids where water hammers and cavitation blows occur from the startup and shutdown of high performance pumps. The third example relates to a long pipe carrying liquids with a great vertical difference in the neighborhood of the boiling point...|$|R
