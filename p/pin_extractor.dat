50|$|In addition, several AR-15 {{manufacturers}} have produced the 7.62x39mm option. Some {{current and past}} companies include AR-Stoner, Armalite, Colt, Rock River Arms, Olympic Arms, DPMS, Del-Ton Inc, and ModelOne Sales. Custom builds and conversion kits are available as well. Wide availability and low cost ammo {{with a wide variety}} of manufacturers make it a much lower cost of operation compared to other 5.56x45mm alternatives. Accuracy is much better than AK style rifles. Conversions include a new bolt, firing <b>pin,</b> <b>extractor,</b> barrel, and magazine.|$|E
5000|$|A SABS {{inspector}} fired a {{high pressure}} round through every rifle manufactured on Musgrave's site and signed off. Musgrave's quality control department did a rigorous functional test on every rifle, testing the trigger, safety catch, firing <b>pin</b> protrusion, <b>extractor</b> and headspace against strict standards while evaluating the rifles accuracy. The SOUTH AFRICAN BISLEY UNION site states: ...|$|R
5000|$|Rock-Ola {{became a}} prime {{contractor}} for {{production of the}} M1 carbine for the US Military during World War II. Rock-Ola machined receivers, barrels, bolts, firing <b>pins,</b> <b>extractors,</b> triggers, trigger housings, sears, operating slides, gas cylinders, and recoil plates. Rock-Ola used its furniture machinery to manufacture stocks and handguards for its own production and for other prime contractors, and subcontracted production of other machined parts. Rock-Ola delivered 228,500 military carbines at $58 each before contracts were cancelled on May 31, 1944. Rock-Ola also produced approximately sixty [...] "presentation" [...] carbines as gifts to company executives and other officials. Presentation carbines were finished in polished blue rather than the dull Parkerizing used on military weapons, and were accompanied by a custom-made wooden case including {{the name of the}} recipient engraved on a brass plate. Some of the presentation carbines had no serial numbers, while others were numbered in a special sequence preceded by [...] "EX". Military production carbines had serial numbers in the following range: ...|$|R
25|$|The spare {{lubricant}} clip (on {{the left}} side of the cocking lever assembly) was removed, replaced with an oil reservoir and an oiler in the pistol grip of the receiver assembly. The stylus on the oiler cap could also double as a drift to remove the <b>extractor</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gustloff Volkssturmgewehr is {{constructed}} rather like many semi-automatic pistols, {{it has a}} casing and spring around the barrel; the whole casing recoils backward. The breech block, with firing <b>pin</b> and <b>extractor,</b> is <b>pinned</b> to {{the back end of}} the barrel casing. The rear end of the gun does not recoil and has the hammer, sear and trigger built into it. Gas coming from four vents, {{near the end of the}} barrel, holds the bolt closed till the gas pressure drops to a safe level. Some selective fire Gustloff Volkssturmgewehrs were made.|$|R
50|$|Every firearm leaves unique, {{reproducible}} {{markings on}} expended bullet and cartridge cases that it fired. The barrel, firing <b>pin,</b> firing chamber, <b>extractor,</b> ejector {{and other parts}} of the gun leave these marks, called toolmarks, on the bullet and cartridge case faces. Individually and collectively, these markings function as the “ballistic signature” of the firearm.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was adopted}} by the United States in 1909 as the [...] "Benét-Mercié Machine Rifle, Caliber [...]30 U. S. Model of 1909" [...] firing the [...]30-06 cartridge. The name comes from three sources: Hotchkiss, the name of the American Benjamin B. Hotchkiss who started the company in France; the two main designers, Laurence Benét and Henri Mercié; and the U.S. {{designation}} system at time which label arms with [...] "Model of Year". Laurence Benét was a son of Stephen Benét, a former Chief of U.S. Army Ordnance. It was also used by other countries, including Belgium, Spain, Brazil and Australia. France and Britain used the Hotchkiss M1909 through World War I and on into World War II. The Australian Light Horse, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the Imperial Camel Corps used the Hotchkiss in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign (1915-17). U.S. forces used the Benét-Mercié at the Battle of Columbus (Pancho Villa Raid) in 1916 (4 guns fired 20,000 rounds total in the engagement) and in the subsequent Pancho Villa Expedition in Mexico of 1916-17 and initially in France. Firing <b>pins</b> and <b>extractors</b> broke frequently on the American guns.|$|R
50|$|The {{receiver}} {{is made of}} {{an impact}} modified glass reinforced Zytel. The front end houses a hinge block holding the barrel and the rear sight. This block is securely locked in place by a swiveling trigger guard. The receiver rigidly attaches to the stock by multiple lugs. The bottom of the receiver forms the pistol grip, also accepting different magazines according to the version specified. The receiver also houses the firing mechanism. The 4130 ordnance steel barrel has a spring-loaded collar to ensure an accurate lock between the receiver and the polymer fore end and the fully adjustable front sight. The fore end also has integrated the ability to house batteries and/or other small devices. The tubular steel stock contains the bolt and is ended by the polymer butt stock. The heavy two-piece steel bolt holds the firing <b>pin,</b> the <b>extractor</b> and has the operating handle on the bottom. A captive guide recoil spring with buffer actuates the bolt. The firing mechanism is of conventional single action type. It has a positive disconnector, a push bolt safety that blocks the sear and disengages the trigger bar. The hardened steel ejector is internal. This design, with its long bolt travel, allows for very large functioning marginals.|$|R
2500|$|Sacco's pistol is {{also claimed}} to have passed {{in and out of}} police custody, and to have been {{dismantled}} several times, both in 1924 prior to the gun barrel switch, and again between 1927 and 1961. The main problem with these charges is that the match to Sacco's gun was based not only the [...]32 pistol, but also to the same-caliber bullet that killed Berardelli, as well as to spent casings found at the scene. In addition to tampering with the pistol, the gun switcher/dismantler would also have had to access police evidence lockers and exchange the bullet from Berardelli's body and all spent casings retrieved by police, or else locate the actual murder weapon, then switch barrel, firing <b>pin,</b> ejector, and <b>extractor,</b> all before Goddard's examination in 1927 when the first match was made to Sacco's gun. However, skeptics of Sacco's guilt have repeatedly pointed to a single anomaly — that several witnesses to the crime insisted the gunman, alleged to be Sacco, fired four bullets into Berardelli. [...] "He shot at Berardelli probably four or five times," [...] one witness said. [...] "He stood guard over him.” If this was true, many ask, how could only one of the fatal bullets be linked to Sacco's gun? In 1927, the defense raised the suggestion that the fatal bullet had been planted, calling attention to the awkward scratches on the base of the bullet that differed from those on other bullets. The Lowell Commission dismissed this claim as desperate but in 1985, historians William Kaiser and David Young made a compelling case for a switch in their book [...] "Post-Mortem: New Evidence in the Case of Sacco and Vanzetti." ...|$|R
