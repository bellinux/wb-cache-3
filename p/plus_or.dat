5|$|Two {{additional}} polls, {{released in}} late April and mid-May by Keystone Analytics, showed Peduto regaining {{the lead in}} the primary race. In the April poll, Peduto's lead was within the <b>plus</b> <b>or</b> minus 4.38 percent margin of error; he led Jack Wagner 38 to 36 percent. Jake Wheatley received 5 percent support and A. J. Richardson received less than 1 percent. A poll released in mid-May, with a <b>plus</b> <b>or</b> minus 4.9 percent margin of error, suggested that Peduto had expanded his lead over Wagner. Peduto was supported by 39 percent of respondents, while Wagner had 36 percent. Wheatley and Richardson garnered 8 and 1 percent, respectively. An additional poll, commissioned by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and conducted by Susquehanna Polling & Research and released in the final week before the primary, also showed Peduto leading Wagner, 42 to 33 percent. The same poll showed Wheatley with 6 percent and Richardson with 1 percent.|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the response of wheat to tank mixture of herbicides with insecticide and manure in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The experiment consisted of 8 treatments: 1 - tribenuron methyl (15 - 20 g ha- 1) + clodinafop propargyl (0. 8 L ha- 1) 2 - tribenuron methyl + clodinafop propargyl + fenitrotion (1. 2 L ha- 1) + librel (1 Kg ha- 1) 3 - tribenuron methyl + clodinafop propargyl + fenitrotion 4 - tribenuron methyl + clodinafop propargyl plus librel 5 - iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron 6 - iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron + fenitrotion + librel 7 - iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron + fenitrotion 8 - iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron + librel and 9 - untreated control. The layout was a completely randomized design with 4 replications. The combinations were applied in tillering stage. On the base of our results combination of iodosulfuron methyl-sodium <b>plus</b> mesosulfuron-methyl, <b>or</b> <b>plus</b> fenitrotion, <b>or</b> <b>plus</b> librel, and iodosulfuron methyl-sodium <b>plus</b> mesosulfuron-methyl, <b>or</b> <b>plus</b> fenitrotion caused the most reduction in wheat height by 20 % and 15 %, leaf area by 44 % and 39 %, leaf fresh weight by 40 % and 38 %, shoot fresh weight by 36 % and 32 %, leaf dry weight by 30 % and 25 % and shoot dry weight by 37 % and 29 %, respectively. Combination of tribenuron methyl <b>plus</b> clodinafop propargyl, <b>or</b> <b>plus</b> fenitrotion, <b>or</b> <b>plus</b> librel, and tribenuron methyl <b>plus</b> clodinafop propargyl, <b>or</b> <b>plus</b> fenitrotion reduced leaf area, fresh weight and dry weight of wheat plants, but this reduction was {{not as much as}} previous mixture.

5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems output decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years.
