30|$|Busses and {{crossbar}} switches {{are vastly}} used {{to connect the}} cores in a multi-core processor [6, 7]. These solutions are not applicable to many-core architectures (processors with a very high number of cores), because the increased number of cores demands an increase in wire length [8]. Lengthy wires generate more latency and electrical resistance and make routing <b>packets</b> between <b>cores</b> difficult, making the use of buffers and repeaters necessary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{computer}} architectures are founded on multi-core processors. In order to efficiently process network traffic, {{it is necessary}} to dynamically split high-speed <b>packet</b> streams across <b>cores</b> based on the monitoring goal. Most network adapters are multi-core aware but offer limited facilities for assigning <b>packets</b> to processor <b>cores.</b> In this paper we introduce a hybrid traffic analysis framework that leverages flexible packet balancing mechanisms available on recent 10 Gbit commodity network adapters not yet exploited by operating systems. The main contribution of this paper is an open source hardware-assisted software layer for dynamically configuring packet balancing policies in order to fully exploit multi-core systems and enable 10 Gbit wire-speed network traffic analysis...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{structure}} in Figure 2 is for future network, {{it can also}} be used alongside the architecture of current systems; for instance, the technologies-specific domains in the mid-level correspond to the circuit switching and <b>packet</b> switching <b>core</b> networks in the GSM and GPRS or UMTS. The major difference is that the proposed structure is an open architecture, where different technologies and operators could join the network. However, to control this open architecture, the CEP in the top-level has been proposed to manage the resources in all various domains.|$|R
50|$|The Radio Network Controller (or RNC) is a {{governing}} {{element in the}} UMTS radio access network (UTRAN) and is responsible for controlling the Node Bs that are connected to it. The RNC carries out radio resource management, some of the mobility management functions and is the point where encryption is done before user data is sent {{to and from the}} mobile. The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through Media Gateway (MGW) and to the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) in the <b>Packet</b> Switched <b>Core</b> Network.|$|R
50|$|The main {{component}} of the SAE architecture is the Evolved <b>Packet</b> <b>Core</b> (EPC), also known as SAE Core. The EPC {{will serve as the}} equivalent of GPRS networks (via the Mobility Management Entity, Serving Gateway and PDN Gateway subcomponents).|$|E
5000|$|OpenLTE is an {{open source}} {{implementation}} of the 3GPP LTE specifications. In the current version, it includes an eNodeB with a built-in simple Evolved <b>Packet</b> <b>Core,</b> and some tools to scanning and recording LTE signal based on GNU Radio.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "SaMOG" [...] (S2a Mobility {{based on}} GTP) study item in 3GPP defines the {{interworking}} between mobile <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> and a trusted WLAN access network (3GPP TR 23.852). The interface that SaMOG defines for this interworking is the 3GPP S2a GTP interface.|$|E
30|$|Network {{operators}} {{looks for}} flexibility, scale and operational simplicity {{to lower the}} total cost of ownership and simultaneously enhance the mobile service. In this sense, the IP/MPLS network deployed in the mobile backhaul and the <b>core</b> <b>packet</b> network provides higher resiliency and ensures the reliability of the mobile backhaul [12].|$|R
50|$|The IPv6 {{packet header}} has a minimum size of 40 octets. Options are {{implemented}} as extensions. This {{provides the opportunity}} to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the <b>core</b> <b>packet</b> structure. However, a study in 2015 {{indicated that there was}} still widespread dropping of IPv6 packets containing extension headers.|$|R
40|$|Network line speeds have {{increased}} at a significant rate. Unfortunately, network performance {{has not been}} able to keep pace with increases in line speed. This is due to the majority of packets being less than or equal to 100 bytes in addition to network routers not being able to scale well with the increased number of packets. In this paper we present our solution, JumboGen, an approach that will allow for a higher utilization of larger packet sizes on a domain-wise basis. Through simulations and experimentation, we show that the dynamic creation of jumbo packets decreases the number of <b>packets</b> processed by <b>core</b> routers and does not have an adverse impact on link utilization or fairness. The final result of JumboGen is a reduction in the number of <b>packets</b> seen by <b>core</b> routers which directly improves network scalability...|$|R

50|$|On September of {{that year}} MTS {{launched}} the country’s first TD-LTE network, using the TD-LTE spectrum in the 2595-2620 MHz band it secured in February.

50|$|The logical {{connections}} between the network elements are known as interfaces. The interface between the RNC and the Circuit Switched Core Network (CS-CN) is called Iu-CS and between the RNC and the <b>Packet</b> Switched <b>Core</b> Network is called Iu-PS. Other interfaces include Iub (between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same network). Iu interfaces carry user traffic (such as voice or data) as well as control information (see Protocols), and Iur interface is mainly needed for soft handovers involving 2 RNCs though not required as the absence of Iur will cause these handovers to become hard handovers.|$|R

A range of these integers are reserved for extensions.|$|R
