50|$|Niosome {{preparation}} using <b>polyoxyethylene</b> alkyl etherThe {{size and}} number of bilayer of vesicles consisting of <b>polyoxyethylene</b> alkyl ether and cholesterol can be changed using an alternative method.25 Temperature rise above 60 °C transforms small unilamellar vesicles to large multilamellar vesicles (>1 μm), while vigorous shaking at room temperature shows the opposite effect, i.e., transformation of multilamellar vesicles into unilamellar ones. The transformation from unilamellar to multilamellar vesicles at higher temperature might be the characteristic for <b>polyoxyethylene</b> alkyl ether (ester) surfactant, since {{it is known that}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) and water remix at higher temperature due to breakdown of hydrogen bonds between water and PEG moieties. Generally, free drug is removed from the encapsulated drug by gel permeation chromatography dialysis method or centrifugation method. Often, density differences between niosomes and the external phase are smaller than that of liposomes, which make separation by centrifugation very difficult.

40|$|The use of <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> -diamine or monoamine as the {{hydrophilic}} monomers {{to react}} with various other monomers or prepolymers {{with the purpose}} of producing antistatic materials is the main theme of this thesis. (1) <b>Poly(oxyethylene)</b> -segmented polyamides The synthesis of <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> containing polyamides has been carried out by the co-polycondensation of diacid including terephthalic, adipic, and sebacic acid, and diamines including polyetheramines of Jeffamine D- 230, ED- 2003, D- 2000 and EDR- 148. The polyamides consist of structures of <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> and poly- oxypropylene) segments as well as amide linkages. With judicious choice of the hydrophilic amine, the amphiphilic polyamides could have a surface resistivity as low as 107. 2 ohm/sq. (2) Metal ion added <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> -segmented polyamides A series of lithium ion added <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> -segmented polyamides have been prepared by using a developed solvent/metal halide addition method. The structures involve the <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> /lithium complexes which promote the surface conductivity reaching 10 4. 2 ohm/sq. (3) <b>Poly(oxyethylene)</b> grafting polypropylene maleic anhydride Using polyether monoamines such as <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> monoamine, i. e., commercially available Jeffamine M- 2070 of molecular weight of approximately 2000, a family of hydrophilic group grafting on polypropylenes have been prepared. This type of polymers can have surface resistivity of 107. 5 ohm/sq. (4) <b>Poly(oxyethylene)</b> grafting styrene/ maleic anhydride polymers Using the similar methods described in (3), another family of Jeffamine M- 2070 grafted polystyrenes are made. The surface resistivity of such polymer can reach at a value of 107. 8 ohm/sq. The prepared polymers have been compared among structures with regard to their physical property, particularly the DSC analyses including Tg, Tm and the heat of melting. Based on these data and observations, a mechanism involving hydrogen bonding between moisture water and poly(oxyethyl-ene) /amide functionalities is suggested, as depicted below: The important features of this mechanism are cited below: (a) The surface conductivity {{is a function of the}} weight content of hydrophilic groups in the presence. (b) The hydrophilic groups have a optimal molecular weight of ca. 2000. The smaller molecular weight of amines appear to be worse. (c) The <b>poly(oxyethylene)</b> is a better hydrophilic group than the poly(oxypropylene). (d) The surface conductivity is derived from the moisture water association with polymers through a group of hydrogen bondings and partially ionization of water.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} the hemoglobin- based nitric oxide scavenger, pyridoxalated hemoglobin <b>polyoxyethylene,</b> against placebo in patients with vasopressordependent distributive shock. Design: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label study. Setting: Sixty-one participating ICUs in six European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom). Patients: All patients admitted with distributive shock, defined {{as the presence of}} at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, persisting norepinephrine dependence and evidence of organ dysfunction/hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive 0. 25 mL/kg/hr pyridoxalated hemoglobin <b>polyoxyethylene</b> (20 mg Hb/kg/hr) or an equal volume of placebo, infused for up to 150 hours, in addition to conventional vasopressor therapy. Measurements and Main Results: The study was stopped after interim analysis showed higher mortality in the pyridoxalated hemoglobin <b>polyoxyethylene</b> group and an increased prevalence of adverse events. At this time, 377 patients had been randomized to pyridoxalated hemoglobin <b>polyoxyethylene</b> (n = 183) or placebo (n = 194). Age, gender, type of patient (medical/surgical), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were similar between groups. Twenty-eight-day mortality rate was 44. 3 % in the pyridoxalated hemoglobin <b>polyoxyethylene</b> group versus 37. 6 % in the placebo group (OR, 1. 29; 95 % CI, 0. 85 - 1. 95; p = 0. 227). In patients with higher organ dysfunction scores (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment > 13), mortality rates were significantly higher in the pyridoxalated hemoglobin <b>polyoxyethylene</b> group when compared with those in placebo-treated patients (60. 9 % vs 39. 2 %; p = 0. 014). Survivors who received pyridoxalated hemoglobin <b>polyoxyethylene</b> had a longer vasopressor-free time (21. 3 vs 19. 7 d; p = 0. 035). Conclusions: In this randomized, controlled phase III trial in patients with vasopressor-dependent distributive shock, administration of a pyridoxalated hemoglobin solution decreased the need for vasopressors but was associated with a trend to increased mortality.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the application of <b>polyoxyethylene</b> homopolymers in buccal bioadhesive drug (BBD) delivery device formulations. The bioadhesive strength of four different molecular weight (MW) <b>polyoxyethylene</b> polymers was measured by Instronâ tensile tester using glass plate and bovine sublingual tissue as substrate surfaces. Several BBD device formulations containing <b>polyoxyethylene</b> polymer (MW 7, 000, 000) were prepared by direct compression and compression molding processes. The prepared BBD devices were evaluated for their elasticity, in vitro adhesion and drug release characteristics. The in vivo bioadhesion characteristics of a placebo compression molded device were examined in 3 adult healthy male beagle dogs. The bioadhesive strength of <b>polyoxyethylene</b> polymers appeared to be directly related to their molecular weights. When bovine sublingual mucosa or a glass plate was used as model mucosal substrate surface, the rank order of bioadhesive strength of different molecular weight <b>polyoxyethylene</b> polymers was similar. The bioadhesive strength of devices prepared by the compression molding process was greater than those prepared by direct compression, but the kinetics of drug release were independent of the process used for {{the preparation of the}} devices. The drug release and the bioadhesive strength of the similarly prepared device formulations appeared to be dependent on the drug:polymer ratios. The elasticity of the BBD devices prepared by compression molding was improved by the inclusion of polyisobutylene polymer in the formulations. When adhered to the oral cavity of the dogs, the compression molded placebo BBD device exhibited adhesion for at least 4 hours and appeared to show no signs of local irritation. In conclusion, BBD devices containing <b>polyoxyethylene</b> polymer (MW 7, 000, 000) can be prepared by direct compression or compression molding process in order to provide controlled drug release to the oral cavity while maintaining appropriate bioadhesive characteristics...|$|E
