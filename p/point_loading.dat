40|$|Deformations of {{membrane}} structures under external loads {{are much}} more prominent compared to other structures and structural materials. External area loads cause large displacements and redistribution of internal tension forces. <b>Point</b> <b>loads</b> have a less significant impact on changes of internal forces, but a more significant role in creation of local deformations.

50|$|The {{benefit of}} sandjacking is {{the control of}} moisture. There are more voids under {{concrete}} than the average person would presume. Any void will acquire moisture, subjecting the slab to endless wet-dry cycles (freeze-thaw in colder climates). If the voids are full of sand, water can't accumulate in sufficient quantity to be destructive. Moisture in the lifting process is also undesirable; {{the only way to}} reduce it is to reduce the quantity of lifting material. It's important to fill first, then lift creating a new void which is then filled with sand through the same hole. Since dry material will blow greater distances the holes required are few.

50|$|A tower {{testing station}} {{is a special}} plant for testing various design for towers for {{transmission}} lines and similar uses. A tower testing station consists of two steel stands and one or more foundations, on which {{a sample of the}} tower can be built. The number of test conditions is normally limited to between six and eight individual cases, with loading condition such as reduced wind and ice. The towers to be tested are erected on rigid foundation and the wire ropes attached to the loading point required. Loading may either be applied by 'dead' weights using scale pans, winches or hydraulic rams. In the latter cases a load cell or dyamometer is placed in the rigging adjacent to the point of loading at the structure. The loading methods induce strain by pulling cables away from the tower to the specified loads. The pulling load is indicated through a strain gauge placed on the pulling <b>point.</b> <b>Loading</b> points on a tower naturally encompasses longitudinal, transverse and vertical components, either as individual or a combined resultant load.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} elastic {{foundation}} on the static and dynamic snap-through of a shallow arch under a <b>point</b> <b>load</b> traveling at a constant speed. The deformation of the arch is expressed in a Fourier series. For static analysis when the moving speed of the <b>point</b> <b>load</b> is almost zero, the first four modes in the expansion are sufficient in predicting the equilibrium positions and the critical loads. Unlike the case without elastic foundation, static snap-through can occur even when the arch is in another stable (P 1 -) position before the <b>point</b> <b>load</b> moves onto the arch. In the dynamic case when the moving speed of the <b>point</b> <b>load</b> is significant, the numerical simulation of the response does not converge well, especially long after the <b>point</b> <b>load</b> leaves the arch. However, the total energy of the arch converges quite well when only the first eight modes are used in the Fourier series.

Although, the <b>point</b> <b>load</b> strength can {{be representative of the}} uniaxial strength of isotropic rocks, it can be misleading in the case of anisotropic rocks due to the presence of foliation or bedding planes.

The paper describes results from tests performed on anisotropic rocks, according to the suggested method by ISRM but also using alternative loading directions in the diametral test.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of laboratory testing of sedimentary rocks under <b>point</b> <b>loading</b> as well as in uniaxial and triaxial compression. From the statistical analysis of the data, different conversion factors relating uniaxial compressive and <b>point</b> <b>loading</b> strength were determined for soft to strong rocks. Additionally, the material constant m(i), an input parameter for the Hoek and Brown failure criterion, was also estimated for different limestone samples by analysing the results from a series of triaxial compression tests under different confining pressures. The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of intact rocks, as estimated from the point load index using conversion factors, together with the Hoek-Brown constant m(i), and the Geological Strength Index (GSI) constitute the parameters for the calculation of the strength and deformability of rock masses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytic {{solution for the}} stresses within an elastic solid finite cylinder subjected to the axial <b>point</b> <b>load</b> strength test (PLST). The "displacement potential approach" is used to uncouple the equations of equilibrium; then the contact stresses on the end surfaces induced by the <b>point</b> <b>load</b> indentors are expanded {{in terms of a}} Fourier-Bessel expansion to yield the unknown constants of the appropriate form of the displacement potential.

Mineral wool boards for thermal insulation of low-slope roofs are described by the values of compressive stress (σ 10) and <b>point</b> <b>load</b> (F 5). For this work, three types of mineral wool boards normally used as thermal insulating layer and/or as basis for the waterproof roofing membranes were tested. Usually, during roof installation or regular maintenance, these boards are affected by reoccurring short-term loads acting on a small area which is due to “walking”. In order to simulate the effects of short-term dynamic loading, a JW fatigue machine with a special construction was used. The surface of a test specimen was compressed till its deformation would reach 5 mm, using a periodic load of 147 kPa repeated every 2 seconds – {{in the same way as}} the board would have been affected while by “walking ” on it during its operation use. In order to determine how the short-term loads affect the strength of the test specimen, the initial values of density and <b>point</b> <b>load</b> were measured.
