50|$|As of March 2011, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) {{requires}} {{the use of}} green/yellow colour cables as <b>protective</b> <b>conductors,</b> blue as neutral conductors and brown as single-phase conductors.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a risk}} of {{electric}} shock when touching {{the parts of the}} system under voltage by the body joint. As a countermeasure, so-called <b>protective</b> <b>conductors</b> and residual current circuit breakers are used in electrical engineering.|$|R
5000|$|Earth (E), formally, circuit <b>protective</b> <b>conductor</b> (CPC): Core/wire that {{provides}} a connection to earth, for safety and protection purposes, for both end-user devices and metal objects and components in the installation; colour-coded [...] green/yellow striped (but may be bare within sheathed cable).|$|E
5000|$|The colour {{combination}} [...] green/yellow is always and exclusively {{used to identify}} the <b>protective</b> <b>conductor.</b> On any 15 mm length of the conductor, {{one of these two}} colours should cover between 30% and 70% of the area and the other the remaining area.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, thermoplastic-sheathed cable in [...] "twin and earth" [...] (or 'T and E') format has the Circuit <b>Protective</b> <b>Conductor</b> (CPC = earth) {{uninsulated}} (bare) and {{of reduced}} diameter {{compared to the}} main cores. Green and yellow sleeving is sold separately, to be applied at the ends.|$|E
40|$|The <b>protective</b> <b>conductors</b> {{associated}} with the electrical installation in this location MUST NOT BE CONNECTED TO EARTH. Equipment having exposed-conductive-parts connected to earth must not brought into this location. CAUTION This installation has wiring colours to two versions of BS 7671. Great care should be taken before undertaking extension, alteration or repair that all conductors are correctly identified. insulation is applied to equipment: Regulation 412. 2. 4. 1 state...|$|R
50|$|In a TT system, no lengthy common <b>protective</b> ground <b>conductor</b> is used, instead each {{article of}} {{electrical}} equipment (or building distribution system) {{has its own}} connection to earth ground.|$|R
5000|$|Each of {{the current}} {{carrying}} conductors in the [...] "core" [...] is insulated by an individual thermoplastic sheath, coloured to indicate {{the purpose of the}} <b>conductor</b> concerned. The <b>Protective</b> Earth <b>conductor</b> may also be covered with Green/Yellow (or Green only) insulation, although, in some countries, this conductor may be left as bare copper. With cables where the current carrying conductors are of a large Cross Sectional Area (CSA) and current carrying capacity, the <b>Protective</b> Earth <b>conductor</b> may be found to be of a smaller CSA, with a lower continuous current carrying capacity. The conductors used may be solid in cross-section or multi-stranded.|$|R
5000|$|Armour: Steel wire armour {{provides}} mechanical protection, {{which means}} the cable can withstand higher stresses, be buried directly and used in external or underground projects. The armouring is normally connected to earth and can sometimes {{be used as the}} circuit <b>protective</b> <b>conductor</b> ("earth wire") for the equipment supplied by cable.|$|E
50|$|The Earth circuit is {{modified}} when an ELCB is used; {{the connection}} to the Earth rod is passed through the ELCB by connecting to its two Earth terminals. One terminal goes to the installation Earth CPC (circuit <b>protective</b> <b>conductor,</b> aka Earth wire), {{and the other to}} the Earth rod (or sometimes other type of Earth connection).|$|E
50|$|These cables {{comprise}} two individually insulated {{current carrying}} conductors and a Circuit <b>Protective</b> <b>Conductor</b> (CPC = PE = Earth). It {{is commonly used}} for fixed wiring in domestic and commercial premises, {{but it is not}} intended to be used where it is subject to regular movement or sunlight, because the sheathing is affected by ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical {{earthing}} electrode (left of gray pipe), {{consisting of}} a conductive rod driven into the ground, at a home in Australia.Most electrical codes specify that the insulation on <b>protective</b> earthing <b>conductors</b> must be a distinctive color (or color combination) not used for any other purpose.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States National Electrical Code and Canadian Electrical Code {{the feed}} from the {{distribution}} transformer uses a combined neutral and grounding conductor, {{but within the}} structure separate neutral and <b>protective</b> earth <b>conductors</b> are used (TN-C-S). The neutral must be connected to earth only {{on the supply side}} of the customer's disconnecting switch.|$|R
5000|$|... "N" [...] â€” Earth {{connection}} is {{supplied by the}} electricity supply Network, either as a separate <b>protective</b> earth (PE) <b>conductor</b> or combined with the neutral conductor.|$|R
50|$|ELCBs {{have one}} {{advantage}} over RCDs: {{they are less}} sensitive to fault conditions, and therefore have fewer nuisance trips. (This does not mean they always do, as practical performance depends on installation details and the discrimination enhancing filtering in the ELCB.) Therefore, by electrically separating cable armour from the cable circuit <b>protective</b> <b>conductor,</b> an ELCB can be arranged to protect against cable damage only, and not trip on faults in downline installations.|$|E
50|$|In the TN-S system, {{separate}} {{neutral and}} protective earth conductors are installed between {{the equipment and}} the source of supply (generator or electric utility transformer). Normal circuit currents flow only in the neutral, and the protective earth conductor bonds all equipment cases to earth to intercept any leakage current due to insulation failure. The neutral conductor is connected to earth at the building point of supply, but no common path to ground exists for circuit current and the <b>protective</b> <b>conductor.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the basic}} level PAT test {{instruments}} carry out basic safety checks. Most {{are equipped with}} an earth continuity test, insulation resistance test {{and the ability to}} check the wiring of detachable mains cords. Many do not however include tests which involve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a <b>protective</b> <b>conductor</b> current or touch current tests. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL testers that are easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing with minimal interpretation of results. Advanced PAT testers can give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at more highly skilled users.|$|E
50|$|Also {{available}} in smaller conductor sizes are versions containing three current-carrying conductors and a circuit <b>protective</b> (earth) <b>conductor.</b> These configurations {{are commonly used}} for applications such as switched light circuits, battery-backed emergency lighting which requires a switched and unswitched supply, extractor fans with a run-on timer which require a switched and unswitched supply, mains-powered interlinked smoke alarms, and central heating thermostats.|$|R
30|$|LV {{distribution}} networks {{consist of}} several conductors {{which can be}} simultaneously used to set up multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication links. This strategy is being successfully employed in wireless communications and in indoor BB-PLC [19], where the phase, neutral, and <b>protective</b> earth <b>conductors</b> are used for the MIMO. However, there are almost no available works on NB-PLC MIMO, and they are limited to explore indoor NB-PLC channels [20] or to plain tests using existing single phase PRIME devices [21].|$|R
50|$|In digital systems, which {{commonly}} transmit data serially (RS232, RS485, USB, Firewire, DVI, HDMI etc) {{the signal}} voltage is often {{much larger than}} induced power frequency AC on the connecting cable screens, but different problems arise. Of those protocols listed, only RS232 is single-ended with ground return, {{but it is a}} large signal, typically + and - 12V, all the others being differential. Simplistically, the big problem with the differential protocols is that with slightly mismatched capacitance from the hot and cold wires to ground, or slightly mismatched hot and cold voltage swings or edge timing, the currents in the hot and cold wires will be unequal, and also a voltage will be coupled onto the signal screen, which will cause a circulating current at signal frequency and its harmonics, extending up to possibly many GHz. The difference in signal current magnitudes between the hot and cold conductors will try to flow from, for example, item A's <b>protective</b> ground <b>conductor</b> back to a common ground in the building, and back along item B's <b>protective</b> ground <b>conductor.</b> This may involve a large loop area and cause significant radiation, violating EMC regulations and causing interference to other equipment.|$|R
5000|$|In TN, an {{insulation}} fault {{is very likely}} to lead to a high short-circuit current that will trigger an overcurrent circuit-breaker or fuse and disconnect the L conductors. With TT systems, the earth fault loop impedance can be too high to do this, or too high to do it within the required time, so an RCD (formerly ELCB) is usually employed. Earlier TT installations may lack this important safety feature, allowing the CPC (Circuit <b>Protective</b> <b>Conductor</b> or PE) and perhaps associated metallic parts within reach of persons (exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts) to become energized for extended periods under fault conditions, which is a real danger.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of the}} armour as {{the means}} of {{providing}} earthing to the equipment supplied by the cable (a function technically known as the circuit <b>protective</b> <b>conductor</b> or CPC) {{is a matter of}} debate within the electrical installation industry. It is sometimes the case that an additional core within the cable is specified as the CPC (for instance, instead of using a two core cable for line and neutral and the armouring as the CPC, a three core cable is used) or an external earth wire is run alongside the cable to serve as the CPC. Primary concerns are the relative conductivity of the armouring compared to the cores (which reduces as the cable size increases) and reliability issues. Recent articles by authoritative sources have analysed the practice in detail and concluded that, for the majority of situations, the armouring is adequate to serve as the CPC under UK wiring regulations.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK [...] "Earthing" [...] is the {{connection}} of the exposed-conductive parts of the installation by means of protective conductors to the [...] "main earthing terminal", which is connected to an electrode {{in contact with the}} earth's surface. A <b>protective</b> <b>conductor</b> (PE) (known as an equipment grounding conductor in the US National Electrical Code) avoids electric shock hazard by keeping the exposed-conductive surface of connected devices close to earth potential in fault conditions. In the event of a fault, a current is allowed to flow to earth by the earthing system. If this is excessive the overcurrent protection of a fuse or circuit breaker will operate, thereby protecting the circuit and removing any fault-induced voltages from the exposed-conductive surfaces. This disconnection is a fundamental tenet of modern wiring practice and {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Automatic Disconnection of Supply" [...] (ADS). Maximum allowable earth fault loop impedance values and the characteristics of overcurrent protection devices are strictly specified in electrical safety regulations to ensure this happens promptly and that whilst overcurrent is flowing hazardous voltages do not occur on the conductive surfaces. Protection is therefore by limiting the elevation of voltage and its duration.|$|E
50|$|If A and B {{are simple}} {{electrical}} apparatus, the signals between them being {{of a simple}} nature, such as 24V DC to control relays, this ground loop is harmless and merely reinforces the grounding system, such that, if for example, B develops a fault causing its metalwork to become live, {{in addition to its}} own <b>protective</b> ground <b>conductor</b> there is an additional path to ground via A, so the momentary rise in potential before the fuse or circuit breaker operates to remove power will be reduced somewhat, improving safety.|$|R
2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may {{be connected}} to ground (earth) for several reasons. [...] In mains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a <b>protective</b> ground <b>conductor</b> {{is an essential part}} of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return).|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} alleged that a {{significant}} cause of current in the ground loop is voltage drop along the equipment <b>protective</b> ground <b>conductors.</b> This is rarely significant, because safety regulations place strict limits on ground leakage current, and ground conductor impedance. For modest sized pieces of equipment such as most audio equipment the ground leakage will be typically less than 2 mA, and the protective ground impedance less than 1 ohm, so this effect will only cause a few milliamps of current to flow in the loop. The current arising due to magnetic induction is liable {{to be at least}} one or two orders of magnitude greater.|$|R
40|$|In {{low-voltage}} systems, ground faults do {{not necessarily}} involve the actual earth, but fault currents may return to the source via conductors. Such conductors, which provide a clear path toward the source, are defined in the applicable codes and technical standards as equipment grounding conductors or <b>protective</b> <b>conductor...</b>|$|E

40|$|The terms {{grounding}} and bonding {{are often}} used interchangeably also if they are a combined protective measure, having a distinct function. The terms need to be understood separately in order to correctly apply equipment in the most beneficial manner.

50|$|The {{most common}} use of {{triaxial}} cable is in television {{industry as a}} connecting cable between a camera and its CCU. The outer sheath is commonly used as a <b>protective</b> earth <b>conductor.</b> The core provides both power and signal connections, with the return for the power being provided through the inner screen. Through frequency-division multiplexing, the camera can send audio and video signals along the triax while the CCU can send camera control information, such as exposure settings, intercom, return audio and video (usually that of the program), and tally (a signal alerting the operator that their camera is on the air)and power for the camera.|$|R
40|$|In {{electric}} power supply systems, an earthing system determines the electric potential of the conductors related {{to that of the}} Earthâ€™s surface. The choice of earthing system has implications {{for the safety of the}} power supply systems. There are considerably different regulations for earthing (grounding) systems in each country. A <b>protective</b> earth(PE) <b>conductor</b> ensures that all exposed conductive surfaces are at the same electric potential as the earth surface. This paper deals with that when PEN conductor of TN-C-S system is disconnected, dangerous touch voltage causes personnel body to be harmed and human beingâ€™s property to be damaged seriously. For this reason, this paper explains how serious problems can occur when the fault current flows. As a consequence, we can understand how we can design earthing system properly to ensure the personnel safety against eart...|$|R
50|$|A {{ground loop}} {{is the result}} of {{careless}} or inappropriate design or interconnection of electrical equipment that results in there being multiple paths to ground where this is not required, so a complete loop is formed. In the simplest case, two items of equipment, A and B, both intended to be grounded for safety reasons, are each connected to a power source (wall socket etc) by a 3 conductor cable and plug, containing a <b>protective</b> ground <b>conductor,</b> usually green/yellow, in accordance with normal safety regulations and practice. This only becomes a problem when one or more signal cables are then connected between A and B, to pass data or audio signals from one to the other. The shield (screen) of the data cable is typically connected to the grounded equipment chassis of both A and B. There is now a ground loop.|$|R
