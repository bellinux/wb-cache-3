5|$|A {{creation}} date {{at the beginning}} of the second millennium BCE places the relief into a region and time in which the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> was unsteady, marked by the waxing and waning influence of the city states of Isin and Larsa, an invasion by the Elamites, and finally the conquest by Hammurabi in the unification in the Babylonian empire in 1762BCE.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the Polish government-in-exile {{decided that}} the post-war <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> afforded no hope of Poland's liberation and ordered the {{remaining}} active members of the Polish resistance (who {{became known as the}} cursed soldiers) to either return to their normal civilian lives or escape to the West.|$|E

5|$|The East Angles formed one of {{the seven}} kingdoms known to post-mediaeval historians as the Heptarchy, a scheme used by Henry of Huntingdon in the twelfth century. Some modern historians have {{questioned}} whether seven independent kingdoms ever really existed contemporaneously, and claim that the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> was much more complicated.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} West Bank localities, {{unemployment}} {{is a minor}} issue in Jifna. However, the average income is low because of the unstable <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in the Palestinian territories, Israeli checkpoints, the West Bank barrier and the 2006 freezing by Israel of funds to the Palestinian territories—although the latter no longer applies to the West Bank.|$|E
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} to be active in pro-democracy groups; she also wrote another play, Sang Raja (The King). Towards the end of 1998, with the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in Indonesia increasingly unstable and Sarumpaet rumoured to be wanted for stirring up dissent, she fled to Europe via Singapore. In December 1998, the Tokyo-based Asia Foundation for Human Rights awarded Sarumpaet the Female Human Rights Special Award.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> deteriorated, Whitlam and his {{government}} continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in my {{professional}} career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as breaking into the prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. The <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{difficult}} <b>political</b> <b>situation,</b> CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga {{for the first}} time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949. In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina. In June 1950, Barcelona signed Ladislao Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{the general}} public was apathetic towards the new <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> and the British {{regarded}} this as the major impediment {{to the development of}} democratic government in Singapore. Thus, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George Rendel was set up in 1953 to recommend changes in the constitutional system, with the aim of increasing widespread participation in the central and local government of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Mexican {{authorities}} {{gave the}} settlers of Gonzales a small cannon {{to help protect}} them from frequent Comanche raids. Over the next four years, the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in Mexico deteriorated, and in 1835 several states revolted. As the unrest spread, Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, the commander of all Mexican troops in Texas, felt it unwise to leave the residents of Gonzales with a weapon and requested {{the return of the}} cannon.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the copper}} {{deposits}} in the Katanga Province (former Shaba province) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were the top producer of cobalt with almost 40% world share, reports the British Geological Survey. By 2015, DRC supplied 60% {{of the world}} production of 32,000 tons at prices of $20,000 to $26,000 per ton, including artisanal mining which supplied 10 to 25%. The <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in the Congo influences the price of cobalt significantly.|$|E
5|$|One {{matter in}} which he {{invested}} much effort was the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In Peru, power struggles between conquistadors and the viceroy became an open civil war in which the conquistadors led by Gonzalo Pizarro rebelled against the New Laws and defeated and executed the viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela in 1546. The Emperor sent Pedro de la Gasca, a friend of Las Casas, to reinstate the rule of law, and he in turn defeated Pizarro. In order to restabilize the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> the encomenderos started pushing {{not only for the}} repeal of the New Laws, but for turning the encomiendas into perpetual patrimony of the encomenderos – the worst possible outcome from Las Casas's point of view. The encomenderos offered to buy the rights to the encomiendas from the crown, and Charles V was inclined to accept since his wars had left him in deep economic troubles. Las Casas worked hard to convince the king {{that it would be a}} bad economic decision, that it would return the viceroyalty to the brink of open rebellion, and could result in the crown losing the colony entirely. The Emperor, probably because of the doubts caused by Las Casas's arguments, never took a final decision on the issue of the encomiendas.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous <b>political</b> <b>situation.</b> On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

5|$|Stationed off Haiti was the British frigate HMS Southampton under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo, {{tasked with}} observing the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> but with orders not to {{interfere}} in the intermittent conflict between Christophe and Pétion.

5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{constituted}} {{the first major}} conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire and represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars. Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, but Darius had vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all Greece.|$|E
5|$|The Komnenian era {{was born}} out of a period of great {{difficulty}} and strife for the Byzantine Empire. Following a period of relative success and expansion under the Macedonian dynasty (c. 867–c. 1054), Byzantium experienced several decades of stagnation and decline, which culminated in a vast deterioration in the military, territorial, economic and <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> of the Byzantine Empire by the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081.|$|E
