2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Suppression</b> Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The <b>pressure</b> <b>suppression</b> system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the <b>pressure</b> <b>suppression</b> pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E

It also broke or burned through into room 304/3. The corium flowed from the reactor in three streams. Stream 1 was composed of brown lava and molten steel; steel formed a layer {{on the floor of the}} Steam Distribution Corridor, on the Level +6, with brown corium on its top. From this area, brown corium flowed through the Steam Distribution Channels into the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Suppression</b> Pools on the Level +3 and Level 0, forming porous and slag-like formations there. Stream 2 was composed of black lava, and entered the other side of the Steam Distribution Corridor. Stream 3, also composed of black lavas, flowed to other areas under the reactor. The well-known [...] "Elephant's Foot" [...] structure is composed of two metric tons of black lava, forming a multilayered structure similar to tree bark. It is said to be melted 2 meters deep into the concrete. The material is dangerously radioactive and hard and strong, and using remote controlled systems was not possible due to high radiation interfering with electronics.|$|E

40|$|Blood {{pressure}} estimation by the oscillometry is {{a practice}} growing in popularity.

Next, we developed algorithms for extracting and suppressing breathing effects on blood pressure estimation. Breathing causes fluctuation in blood pressure and current oscillometric devices do not account for these effects. Extracting breathing signals extends the capabilities of existing oscillometric devices, such as reporting respiratory sinus arrhythmia, without the need for hardware changes. Suppression of these effects is performed by homomorphic and adaptive filtering.

40|$|The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a {{proposed}} future gravitational wave detector. Its design is original, using a triangular orientation of three detectors and a xylophone configuration, splitting each detector into one high-frequency and one low-frequency system.

In this paper, we investigate {{the feasibility of}} replacing the low-frequency part of the ET detectors with a Sagnac interferometer.
