Although wind energy is generally considered environmentally friendly (because it generates electricity without emitting air pollutants or greenhouse gases), the potential for avian fatalities has delayed and even significantly contributed to blocking the development of some windplants in the U. S. Given the importance of developing a viable renewable source of energy, the objective {{of this paper is to}} put the issue of avian mortality associated with windpower into perspective with other sources of avian collision mortality across the U. S. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed summary of the mortality data collected at windplants and put avian collision mortality associated with windpower development into perspective with other significant sources of avian collision mortality across the United States. We provide a summary of data collected at many of the U. S. windplants and provide annual bird fatality estimates and projections for all wind turbines in the U. S. For comparison, we also review studies of avian collision mortality from other major human-made structures and report annual bird fatality estimates for these sources. Other sources also significantly contribute to overall avian mortality. For example, the National Audubon Society estimates avian mortality due to house cats at 100 million birds per year. Pesticide use, oil spills, disease, etc., are other significant sources of unintended avian mortality. Due to funding constraints, the scope of this paper is limited to examining only avian mortality resulting from collisions with human-made obstacles...|$|R

Coupled with advances in new modulation techniques, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a well-known digital multicarrier communication technique and one of the best methods of digital data transmission over a limited bandwidth. The main aim of this research is to design an OFDM modem for powerline-based communication in order to propose and examine a novel approach in comparing the different modulation order, different modulation type, application of Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme and also application of different noise types and applying them to the two modelled channels, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Powerline modelled channel. This is an attempt to understand and recognise the most suitable technique for the transmission of message or image within a communication system. In doing so, MATLAB and embedded Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems are used to simulate the operation of virtual transmitter and receiver. The simulation results presented in this project suggest that lower order modulation formats (Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and 4 -Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)), are the most preferred modulation techniques (in both type and order) for their considerable performance. The results also indicated that, Convolutional Channel Encoding (CCE) -Soft and Block Channel Encoding (BCE) -Soft are by far the best encoding techniques (in FEC type) for their best performance in error detection and correction.

A DC power bus line connecting a DC power supply to motor drives and sensor units is used for transmitting both data and DC power. Unlike conventional AC <b>powerline</b> <b>communication,</b> the DC power bus provides amenable and predictable noise characteristics and desirable impedance characteristics that allow for large fanout and high bandwidth. First the basic architecture of DC <b>powerline</b> <b>communication</b> is presented, followed by verification of the feasibility of using a DC power bus as a communication medium. A high-fanout modem is then designed using a Guanella type transmission line transformer (TLT).

A prototype DC <b>powerline</b> <b>communication</b> system is then designed, built, and tested.

Although the powerline is not an ideal environment for data communication but it has advantage of ubiquity: available in almost every place and denser than today's existing telephony networks and other dedicated data networks. The major applications in the <b>powerline</b> <b>communication</b> are: Automatic Meter Reading (AMR); Distribution Automation and Supervisory Control; Home-Bus for making the building "Intelligent"; Multimedia Communication- used as the last mile part communications. The goal of this report is to study the <b>powerline</b> <b>communication</b> (PLC) system, especially, used as in-home network for home automation and for supporting multimedia applications. Due to the characteristics of the powerline channel, the PLC system is different from the common wire network and makes high-speed data transmissions very challenging. This report points out some technical obstacles and presents some of the strategies to overcome them. We firstly study some aspects, such as the modulation (OFDM) in the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) protocols, combining reliable data transmission with high-throughput access methods and real-time, Quality-of-Service (QoS) features. Some problems exist in TCP applications over PLC, because the high bit error rate makes it difficult to estimate the round trip time (RTT) and causes unnecessary retransmission. So we have done a feasible research on this program by means of network simulation technology. We propose a simulator which aims to find a TCP version to match the requirement of <b>powerline</b> <b>communication</b> system. In this simulator, a new error model is introduced, which takes into consideration both the frequency of the errors (error occurrences following a Poisson law) and their gravity (burst of errors or single errors).
