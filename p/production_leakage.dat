The pHi plays a critical role in the function of the cell, and close regulation is required for cells to survive. There are numerous mechanisms that can cause pHi to change, including metabolic acid <b>production,</b> <b>leakage</b> of acid across plasma and organelle membranes and membrane transport processes. The mechanisms that regulate pHi are usually considered to be plasma membrane transporters of which two main types exist — those independent of HCO3&minus; and those requiring HCO3&minus;.

40|$|Carbon leakage {{is central}} to the {{discussion}} on climate policy, given the confluence of issues that are currently being debated, including the 2030 Energy and Climate Framework and the review of the EU carbon leakage list by 2014. Carbon leakage is the result of asymmetrical carbon policies, especially carbon pricing, and the resulting carbon cost, which affects the international competitive position of some EU industry and could displace production and/or investment, and the emissions of the activities displaced. This paper identifies the difference between carbon price and carbon cost to leakage exposed industry as one of two fundamental issues to be understood and addressed; lack of visibility on future climate policies and anti-leakage provisions is the other key issue. While this is a global issue, most of the experience has been accumulated in the EU. Carbon leakage {{is only one of the}} factors that could affect the competitive position of sectors, but it is difficult to attribute the impact of carbon costs versus other variables such as energy costs, labour, etc. Studies have predicted the risk of a significant amount of <b>production</b> <b>leakage</b> in a number of energy-intensive industries. To address the danger, they were included in the EU ETS carbon leakage list, which gave them access to free allowances. However, a limited number of studies undertaken after the end of the second trading period (2012) show little evidence of <b>production</b> <b>leakage</b> and asks the question whether the issue has not been blown out of proportion. The paper argues that the past may not be a good representation of the future, as it was heavily influenced by a high level of free allocation, the exceptional economic downturn, CO 2 prices significantly below what was anticipated, as well as the potential for changes in some fundamental variables such as the shrinking pool of allowances available for free allocation. It emphasises the need for a well-informed debate in the EU on measures to address carbon leakage post- 2020, underpinned by a number of options, and objective criteria to evaluate those options. It emphasises that the debate should cover both investment and <b>production</b> <b>leakage,</b> caused by both direct and indirect carbon costs...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} determining the interaction of microwaves with germinating seeds. This study covers two different approaches. The preliminary efforts covered the response of germinating seeds to treatment by microwaves and heat. The {{second phase of the}} investigation used microwaves as a probe to determine some of the processes of early seed germination. The preliminary investigation measured the internal metabolic process by ATP <b>production.</b> <b>Leakage</b> of ions and organic material from germinating seeds indicated that membranes are a target of microwaves and heat. Electron photo-micrographs showed an increase in damage to membranes as heat and microwave treatments were increased. The second phase of this {{investigation was}} concerned with determining some of the biological activity at the initiation of germination of wheat seeds, Triticum aestivum L., using a resonating microwave cavity oscillating at 9. 3 GHz as a probe. Direct current conductivity measurements were also made on the seeds as a means of confirming the observations made with the microwave cavity. There was no observable difference between treatment by UHF or heat in the ultrastructure of germinating seeds. A dielectric response far above that of free water was found as live seeds of wheat began to imbibe water. This effect was assumed to be due to the release of ions, because conductivity increased as corresponding quantities of water were imbibed; and both conductivity and dielectric response decreased as imbibition progressed. Although dead seeds also imbibe water, they do not show this decrease in dielectric response. The dielectric response of live seeds was reduced after the initial imbibition, showing that water became tightly bound as imbibition progressed. The dielectric response of actively growing shoots from the seeds was much less than that of the seeds themselves. The large quantity of water in the shoots is assumed to be immobile, being tightly bound within the membranes, enzymes, and organelles...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} indicators of human capital accumulation {{in parallel with}} data for natural resource abundance and rents in a panel of 102 countries running from 1970 to 1999. Mineral wealth is shown to make a positive and marked difference in terms human capital accumulation. Matching on observables reveals that cross-country results are not driven by a third factor such as overall economic development. Political stability does seem to affect both human capital accumulation and subsoil wealth, {{but not enough to}} overturn conclusions. Instrumentation reveals that reverse causality running from education to natural resources is not driving the results. Estimation of a panel VAR indicates that, over three decades, a one-dollar shock to resource rent generates close to five cents of extra educational expenditure per year. Results are consistent with Hirschman’s conjecture that enclave economies have weaker <b>production</b> <b>leakages</b> but stronger government revenue linkages than other activities. The “wealth channel ” identified in this paper implies that caution should be exerted about discouraging countries to exploit their mineral wealth, especially where human capital is scarce.

The main objective is to ship a high quality software product to their customers in order to attain total customer satisfaction.

Hence, several defect management techniques are followed to reduce the defect leakage count during their production cycle. Nevertheless, the efforts laid by expert professionals in unearthing the maximum defects, yet there still prevails unidentified defects entering the customer’s site. Unawareness to post production defects results in rework and overheads which is not an appreciable solution to the industry.

40|$|Background: The postharvest life of fresh-cut {{apple slices}} {{is limited by}} {{browning}} on cut surfaces. Dipping in halide salt solutions was examined for their inhibition of surface browning on 'Granny Smith' apple slices and the effects on biochemical factors associated with browning. Results: Delay in browning by salts was greatest with chloride = phosphate > sulfate > nitrate with no difference between sodium, potassium and calcium ions. The effectiveness of sodium halides on browning was fluoride > chloride = bromide > iodide = control. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity of tissue extracted from chloride- and fluoride-treated slices was not different to control but when added into the assay solution, NaF > NaCl both showed lower PPO activity at pH 3 - 5 compared to control buffer. The level of polyphenols in treated slices was NaF > NaCl > control. Addition of chlorogenic acid to slices enhanced browning but NaCl and NaF counteracted this effect. There was no effect of either halide salt on respiration, ethylene <b>production,</b> ion <b>leakage,</b> and antioxidant activity. Conclusion: Dipping apple slices in NaCl is a low cost treatment with few impediments to commercial use and could be a replacement for other anti-browning additives...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral malaria (CM) is {{a disease}} of the {{vascular}} endothelium caused by Plasmodium falciparum. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine <b>production,</b> and vascular <b>leakage.</b> A distinguishing feature of P.  falciparum infection is parasite production and secretion of histidine-rich protein II (HRPII). Plasma HRPII is a diagnostic and prognostic marker for falciparum malaria. We demonstrate that disruption of a human cerebral microvascular endothelial barrier by P.  falciparum-infected erythrocytes depends on expression of HRPII. Purified recombinant or native HRPII can recapitulate these effects. HRPII action occurs via activation of the inflammasome, resulting in decreased integrity of tight junctions and increased endothelial permeability. We propose that HRPII is a virulence factor that may contribute to cerebral malaria by compromising endothelial barrier integrity within the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{is named}} as {{possible}} energy carrier for future energy systems. However, {{the impact of}} large-scale hydrogen use on the atmosphere is uncertain. Application of hydrogen in clean fuel cells reduces emissions of air pollutants, but emissions from hydrogen <b>production</b> and <b>leakages</b> of molecular hydrogen could influence atmospheric chemistry. This paper combines a global energy system model and a global atmospheric model to explore the range of impacts of hydrogen on atmospheric chemistry. We found that emissions of molecular hydrogen may range from 0. 2 up to 10 % (or 25 – 167 Tg hydrogen/yr) for a global hydrogen energy system. The lower end of this range would in fact be equal to current emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Hydrogen energy use leads to a clear decrease in emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide, but large-scale hydrogen production from coal may lead to net increase in emissions of nitrous oxide and volatile organic compound. Compared to a reference scenario, this would lead to positive impacts on surface concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone. However, if hydrogen leakage would not be minimised it leads {{to an increase in}} methane lifetimes and a decrease in stratospheric ozone concentrations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study aims to {{evaluate}} the impact of complex air and soil pollutions on date palm plants (Phoenix dactylifera), {{one of the most}} important commercially valuable crops in Tunisia. These field experiments were performed in the vicinity of the industrial complex in the south of Tunisia (Sfax) for the polluted samples and in unpolluted areas for control date palm plants. Several biomarkers were studied belonging mainly to the antioxidant system like enzymes or antioxidant compounds. Mains results indicate that air and sol pollution induced an oxidative stress as demonstrated by an increase in the rate of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) <b>production,</b> electrolyte <b>leakage</b> and lipid peroxidation in all plant parts. This stress affects chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of leaves. Additionally, the activities of enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification were affected. Air and soil pollution induce an increase in the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Moreover, in polluted date palm plants the contents of antioxidant molecules like polyphenols and proline increase strongly, this is consistent with the role of these potent antioxidants in scavenging ROS.

40|$|A high nitrate {{pollution}} of groundwaters has been detected {{in recent years}} in many areas of southwest Spain where maize is cropped. This may be caused by the high fertilization level used in those areas. In this work, maize was grown consecutively for six years (1991 - 96) under Mediterranean management practices in the Guadalquivir River Valley (southwest Spain), using both a fertilization level widely used in the area (510 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1) and one third of it. The effect of the reduced fertilization on crop development, yield parameters and kernel analysis was studied. Nitrate leaching for each fertilization treatment was also monitored, during one experimental year. Crop development was slightly poorer in the plot with reduced fertilization, but no differences in yield were found. The only effect on kernel composition was a higher nitrogen (N) concentration in the kernels of the plot with the higher fertilization level. The amount of N supplied by the reduced fertilization, together with the N in the irrigation water and from the soil mineralization, was enough to counterbalance the N removed by the crop in years of high <b>production.</b> Nitrate <b>leakage</b> was three times greater in the plot with the higher fertilization level than in the plot with reduced fertilization.

Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Tertiary care institution. Patients: Sixty consecutive patients with total laryngectomy were included. All had indwelling tracheoesophageal speaking valves for voice restoration. Intervention: Anterograde replacement of voice prosthesis in case of failure of functional speech <b>production</b> or <b>leakage</b> of saliva. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of successful tracheoesophageal speech rehabilitation for daily communication, influence of different clinicopathologic factors on the outcome, and prosthesis lifetime {{and its relationship to}} different clinicopathologic factors. Results: The success rate of speech rehabilitation was 78 %. Age younger than 60 years was the only clinicopathologic factor associated with successful speech rehabilitation (P=. 04, Fisher exact test). The median device lifetime was 8. 2 months. Both age of 60 years or older and {{the use of}} subsequent prosthetic valves were identified as risk factors for valve failure on univariate analysis (n= 192; log-rank test; P=. 02 and P=. 03, respectively), with age of 60 years or older as the only risk factor that reduced the device lifetime in the Cox proportional hazards model (P=. 03; relative hazard ratio, 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 - 2. 4). Conclusions: Our success rate in using indwelling tracheoesophageal speaking valves was comparable to that reported in the Western literature. The median device lifetime of 8. 2 months was satisfactory.

40|$|Abstract Background In nature, deuterium/hydrogen {{ratio is}} ~ 1 / 6600, {{therefore}} one of ~ 3300 water (H 2 O) molecules is deuterated (HOD + D 2 O). In body fluids {{the ratio of}} deuterons to protons is ~ 1 / 15000 because of the lower ionization constant of heavy water. The probability of deuteronation rather than protonation of Asp 61 on the subunit c of F 0 part of ATP synthase is also ~ 1 / 15000. The contribution of deuteronation to the pKa of Asp 61 is 0. 35. Theory and Discussion In mitochondria, {{the release of a}} deuteron into the matrix side half-channel of F 0 is likely to be slower than that of a proton. As another example, deuteronation may slow down electron transfer in the electron transport chain (ETC) by interfering with proton coupled electron transport reactions (PCET), and increase free radical <b>production</b> through the <b>leakage</b> of temporarily accumulated electrons at the downstream complexes.

In {{order to understand the}} CBF cold response pathway, a well-recognized regulatory mechanism in temperate plants, in cassava, overexpression of an Arabidopsis CBF 3 gene is studied. This gene renders cassava increasingly tolerant to cold and drought stresses but is associated with retarded plant growth, leaf curling, reduced storage root yield, and reduced anthocyanin accumulation in a transcript abundance-dependent manner. Physiological analysis revealed that the transgenic cassava increased proline accumulation, reduced malondialdehyde <b>production,</b> and electrolyte <b>leakage</b> under cold stress. These transgenic lines also showed high relative water content when faced with drought. The expression of partial CBF-targeted genes in response to cold displayed temporal and spatial variations in the wild-type and transgenic plants: highly inducible in leaves and less altered in apical buds. In addition, anthocyanin accumulation was inhibited by downregulating the expression of genes involved in its biosynthesis and by interplaying between the CBF 3 and the endogenous transcription factors.

In this study, the efficacy of aged garlic extract (AGE) compared to diallyl disulfide (DADS) in protecting against toxicity induced by cadmium (Cd) in 1321 N 1 and HEK 293 cells was investigated. The involvement of the transcription factor Nrf 2 in this protection was also examined. The results show that AGE significantly prevented loss of cell viability in Cd-treated 1321 N 1 and HEK 293 cells. In comparison DADS had no significant effect in protecting HEK 293 cells but did protect 1321 N 1 cells. AGE significantly reduced Cd-induced TBARS <b>production</b> and LDH <b>leakage</b> in the two cell lines, and AGE and DADS both increased GSH levels in Cd-treated cell lines. Pre-treatment of cells with AGE or DADS increased expression of the protective enzyme NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO 1), and this was associated with the accumulation of the transcription factor Nrf 2. These results show that AGE and DADS have beneficial effects against Cd-induced toxicity, and this protection appears to be mediated via induction of cytoprotective enzymes in an Nrf 2 -dependent manner.

To directly test whether statins are protective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of CAP, we examined the impact of prolonged oral simvastatin therapy at physiologically relevant doses in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia. BALB/c mice were placed on rodent chow containing 0 [*]mg/kg (control), 12 [*]mg/kg (low simvastatin diet [LSD]; corresponds to 1. 0 [*]mg/kg/day), or 120 [*]mg/kg (high simvastatin diet [HSD]; corresponds to 10 [*]mg/kg/day) simvastatin for four weeks, infected intratracheally with S. pneumoniae serotype 4 strain TIGR 4, and sacrificed at 24, 36, or 42 h post-infection for assessment of lung histology, cytokine <b>production,</b> vascular <b>leakage</b> and edema, bacterial burden and bloodstream dissemination. Some mice received ampicillin at 12 -h intervals beginning at 48 h post-infection and were monitored for survival. Immunoblots of homogenized lung samples was used to assess ICAM- 1 production. Results Mice receiving HSD had reduced lung consolidation characterized by less macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and a significant reduction in the chemokines MCP- 1 (P [*]=[*] 0. 03) and KC (P [*]=[*] 0. 02) and ICAM- 1 in the lungs compared to control mice. HSD mice also had significantly lower bacterial titers in the blood at 36 (P [*]=[*] 0. 007) and 42 (P [*]=[*] 0. 03) hours post-infection versus controls. LSD had a more modest effect against S. pneumoniae but also resulted in reduced bacterial titers in the lungs and blood of mice after 42 h and a reduced number of infiltrated neutrophils. Neither LSD nor HSD mice had reduced mortality in a pneumonia model where mice received ampicillin 48 h after challenge. Conclusions Prolonged oral simvastatin therapy had a strong dose-dependent effect on protection against S. pneumoniae as evidenced by reduced neutrophil infiltration, maintenance of vascular integrity, and lowered chemokine production in the lungs of mice on HSD. Statin therapy also protected through reduced bacterial burden in the lungs. Despite these protective correlates, mortality in the simvastatin-receiving cohorts was equivalent to controls. Thus, oral simvastatin at physiologically relevant doses only modestly protects against pneumococcal pneumonia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) are {{generated}} by sperm metabolism. While, ROS {{are required for}} maturation, capacitation and acrosome reaction, they also modify many peroxidable cellular compounds. There is production of ROS during cryopreservation and frozen spermatozoa are highly sensitive to lipid peroxidation (LPO). Antioxidants exert a protective effect on the plasma membrane of frozen bovine sperm preserving both metabolic activity and cellular viability. Manganese (Mn++) is {{proved to be a}} chain breaking antioxidant in biological system. Therefore, we examined the role of (Mn++) during cryopreservation of cattle bull semen. Semen was divided into four parts and cryopreserved in egg-yolk-citrate extender + glycerol (EYC-G), EYC-G + 100 µM of Mn++, EYC-G + 150 µM of Mn++ and EYC-G + 200 µM of Mn++. After four hours of cooling and 24 hrs of freezing, the spermatozoa were examined for percentage motility, Hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS), LPO and protein leakage. Addition of manganese to the semen during cryopreservation showed a protective effect and accounted for an increase in semen quality parameters [percentage motility, HOS percent and decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) production and protein leakage]. The effect of manganese on motility and HOS was non-significant (p < 0. 05) in cooled spermatozoa but significant with 150 µM of Mn++ in frozen-thawed spermatozoa. MDA <b>production</b> and protein <b>leakage</b> decreased to a significant and maximum level (p < 0. 05) on addition of 200 µM of manganese. The addition of manganese to EYC-G dilutor will improve the quality/fertility of semen, which will result in improvement of in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination success rate...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{technology}} now has {{the ability}} to generate large datasets over space and time. Such data typically exhibit high autocorrelations over all dimensions. The field trial data motivating the methods of this paper were collected to examine the behaviour of traditional cropping and to determine a cropping system which could maximise water use for grain <b>production</b> while minimising <b>leakage</b> below the crop root zone. They consist of moisture measurements made at 15 depths across 3 rows and 18 columns, in the lattice framework of an agricultural field. Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) models are used to account for local site correlations. Conditional autoregressive models have not been widely used in analyses of agricultural data. This paper serves to illustrate the usefulness of these models in this field, along with the ease of implementation in WinBUGS, a freely available software package. The innovation is the fitting of separate conditional autoregressive models for each depth layer, the ‘layered CAR model’, while simultaneously estimating depth profile functions for each site treatment. Modelling interest also lay in how best to model the treatment effect depth profiles, and in the choice of neighbourhood structure for the spatial autocorrelation model. The favoured model fitted the treatment effects as splines over depth, and treated depth, the basis for the regression model, as measured with error, while fitting CAR neighbourhood models by depth layer. It is hierarchical, with separate onditional autoregressive spatial variance components at each depth, and the fixed terms which involve an errors-in-measurement model treat depth errors as interval-censored measurement error. The Bayesian framework permits transparent specification and easy comparison of the various complex models compared...|$|R

Studies on {{improving}} the immobilized bead reusability and alkaline protease production by isolated immobilized Bacillus circulans (MTCC 6811) using overall evaluation criteria. Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 150 (1), 65 - 83. RONO: 2490 3014 This study uses an overall evaluation criterion {{for improving the}} immobilized bead reusability and extracellular enzyme production by immobilized cells by assigning relative weightage to bead reusability, enzyme <b>production,</b> and cell <b>leakage.</b> Initially, alkaline protease production by alginate-immobilized Bacillus circulans (MTCC 6811) was analyzed using L 18 orthogonal array (OA). The resultant optimized parameters were further fine-tuned with L 9 OA experimentation. At L 18 -OA analysis, inoculum level and CaCl 2 had least influence at individual level. At the interactive level, incubation time revealed maximum and minimum interaction with sodium alginate and glucose concentration, respectively. L 9 experimentation indicated that glucose concentration contributed the major influence on protease production followed by matrix material and incubation time {{at the individual level}}, and at the interactive level, matrix concentration played a vital role by interacting with incubation time, inoculum, and CaCl 2 concentration. All selected input parameters showed significance either at individual level or interactive in both OAs. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed bacterial morphology variation with variation of matrix concentration. Overall, glucose concentration depicted a major influence at the individual level for the enzyme production. Significant improvement, approximately 147 %, in enzyme yield was observed. Economic enzyme production by immobilized B. circulans is regulated by interactive influence of fermentation parameters, which influence the immobilized bead stability, reusability, and enzyme yield.

40|$|China’s {{balance of}} {{emissions}} embodied in trade: approaches to measurement and allocating international responsibility Jiahua Pan, ∗ Jonathan Phillips,∗ ∗ and Ying Chen∗∗∗ Abstract International trade is characterized {{not only by}} the flow of capital and goods, but also by the energy and emissions embodied in goods during their production. This paper investigates the evolving role that Chinese trade is playing in the response to climate change by estimating the scale of emissions embodied in China’s current trade pattern and demonstrating the magnitude of the difference between the emissions it produces (some of which are incurred to meet the consumption demands {{of the rest of the}} world) and the emissions embodied in the goods it consumes. Estimating China’s emissions on a consumption rather than a production basis both lowers its responsibility for carbon-dioxide (CO 2) emissions in 2006 from 5, 500 to 3, 840 mtCO 2 and reduces the growth rate of emissions from an average of 12. 5 per cent p. a. to 8. 7 per cent p. a. between 2001 and 2006. The analysis indicates that a reliable consumption-based accounting methodology is feasible and could improve our understanding of which actors and states are responsible for emissions. For example, recent emissions reductions by developed countries may lack credibility if production has merely been displaced to countries such as China. Moreover, in the current institutional context, <b>production</b> methodologies encourage <b>leakages</b> through trade that may do more to displace than to reduce emissions. Both equity and efficiency concerns therefore suggest that emissions embodied in trade should receive special attention in the distribution of post-Kyoto abatement burdens...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDirect and {{indirect}} effects from human activity have dramatically increased nutrient loading to aquatic inland and estuarine ecosystems. Despite {{an abundance of}} studies investigating the impact of agricultural activity on water quality, our understanding of what determines the capacity of a watershed to remove or retain nutrients remains limited. The goal {{of this study was}} to identify proximate and ultimate controls on dissolved organic carbon and nutrient dynamics in small agricultural catchments by investigating the relationship between catchment characteristics, stream discharge, and water chemistry. We analyzed a 5 -year, high-frequency water chemistry data set from three catchments in western France ranging from 2. 3 to 10. 8 km 2. The relationship between hydrology and solute concentrations differed between the three catchments and was associated with hedgerow density, agricultural activity, and geology. The catchment with thicker soil and higher surface roughness had relatively invariant carbon and nutrient chemistry across hydrologic conditions, indicating high resilience to human disturbance. Conversely, the catchments with smoother, thinner soils responded to both intra-and interannual hydrologic variation with high concentrations of phosphate (PO 3 − 4) and ammonium (NH + 4) in streams during low flow conditions and strong increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), sediment, and particulate organic matter during high flows. Despite contrasting agricultural activity between catchments, the physical context (geology, topography, and land-use configuration) appeared to be the most important determinant of catchment solute dynamics based on principle components analysis. The influence of geology and accompanying topo-graphic and geomorphological factors on water quality was both direct {{and indirect}} because the distribution of agricultural activity in these catchments is largely a consequence of the geologic and topographic context. This link between inherent catchment buffering capacity and the probability of human disturbance provides a useful perspective for evaluating vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems and for managing systems to maintain agricultural <b>production</b> while minimizing <b>leakage</b> of nutrients...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the role of ethylene action, via use of the ethylene antagonist 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), on the senescence and quality of fresh-cut ripe papaya (Carica papaya L. `Sunrise Solo') fruit. Ripe papaya fruit were treated with 2. 5 μL·L- 1 1 -MCP and immediately processed into fresh-cut slices or left intact. At 2 -day intervals over 10 days at 5 °C, continuously stored slices were monitored for ethylene <b>production,</b> firmness, electrolyte <b>leakage,</b> color, sensory changes, and pathogen incidence. Slices freshly prepared from intact fruit stored under identical conditions were measured similarly. Ethylene production did not differ significantly between the treatments, although production rates were slightly but consistently higher in slices from intact control compared with intact 1 -MCP-treated fruit. Mesocarp firmness of continuously stored slices and slices from fruit stored intact was significantly retained by 1 -MCP. Firmness of continuously stored slices from 1 -MCP-treated fruit declined 50 % compared with 75 % for control slices. Firmness of fresh-cut slices prepared from intact control and 1 -MCP-treated fruit at each sampling interval declined 26 % and 15 %, respectively. Electrolyte leakage remained low and changed little in slices freshly prepared from fruit stored intact. Leakage from continuously stored papaya slices increased after 4 days, and after 6 days controls increased significantly compared with stored slices derived from papaya fruit initially treated with the ethylene antagonist. The flesh color of continuously stored slices or slices prepared from fruit stored intact was influenced by 1 -MCP only during the later periods of storage. Microbial counts in stored slices or slices prepared at each sampling were generally unaffected by 1 -MCP. Informal sensory analysis indicated that the edible shelf life was 6 days in stored slices from 1 -MCP-treated fruit compared with 2 to 3 days for stored slices from control fruit...|$|R
