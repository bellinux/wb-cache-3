5|$|To decrypt Enigma messages, {{three pieces}} of {{information}} were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the <b>plugboard).</b> Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.|$|E
5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a <b>plugboard,</b> but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, the German Navy adopted, as its top {{cryptographic}} device, {{a modified}} civilian Enigma machine; in 1928 the German Army followed suit. The {{complexity of the}} system was much increased in 1930 {{by the introduction of}} a <b>plugboard</b> (Steckerbrett), albeit with only six connecting leads in use. In December 1932, Marian Rejewski made what historian David Kahn describes {{as one of the greatest}} advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure mathematicsthe theory of permutations and groupsto breaking the German armed forces' Enigma machine ciphers. Rejewski had worked out the precise interconnections of the Enigma rotors and reflector, after the Bureau had received, from French Military Intelligence Captain Gustave Bertrand, two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year). These had been obtained by a French military intelligence agent, a German codenamed Rex, from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, whom the French codenamed Asché.|$|E
50|$|The {{first version}} of the ENIAC {{computer}} was programmed via cabling, switches and <b>plugboards.</b> ENIAC's cabling was later reconfigured to use the existing Function Tables data ROM memory as program ROM memory (the switches and <b>plugboards</b> continued {{to be used in}} the reconfigured ENIAC).|$|R
50|$|<b>Plugboards</b> for the {{reflector}} {{were added}} to the machine from November 1941.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Typex {{was based}} on the {{commercial}} Enigma machine, but incorporated a number of additional features to improve the security. This model, a Typex 22, was a late variant, incorporating two <b>plugboards.</b>|$|R
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of <b>plugboard</b> connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} <b>plugboard,</b> {{it was much}} harder to perform trial encryptions because it was unknown what the crib and {{ciphertext}} letters were transformed to by the <b>plugboard.</b> For example, in the first position, A and W were unknown because the <b>plugboard</b> settings were unknown.|$|E
25|$|Although the Herivel tip {{provided}} the Enigma's ring settings, {{it did not}} provide {{other parts of the}} Enigma key: the rotor order and the <b>plugboard</b> settings. A Luftwaffe key at the time chose from 5 rotors, so there were 60 possible rotor orders. In addition, there might be 8 to 10 <b>plugboard</b> connections, which means that all but 6 of the 26 letters are permuted by the <b>plugboard.</b> The codebreakers had to use other methods to find the remaining portions of the Enigma key.|$|E
50|$|Typex 22 (BID/08/2) and Typex 23 (BID/08/3) {{were late}} models, that {{incorporated}} <b>plugboards</b> for improved security. Mark 23 was a Mark 22 modified {{for use with}} the CCM. In New Zealand, Typex Mark II and Mark III were superseded by Mark 22 and Mark 23 on 1 January 1950.|$|R
5|$|The {{electronics}} {{of the new}} ENIAC ran at one-sixth the speed, {{but this}} in no way degraded the ENIAC's performance, since it was still entirely I/O bound. Complicated programs could be developed and debugged in days rather than the weeks required for <b>plugboarding</b> the old ENIAC. Some of von Neumann's early computer programs have been preserved.|$|R
40|$|A system {{designed}} for use in complex operant conditioning experiments is described. Some of its key features are: (a) <b>plugboards</b> that permit the experimenter to change either from one program to another or from one analysis to another {{in less than a}} minute, (b) time-sharing of permanently-wired, electronic logic components, (c) recordings suitable for automatic analyses. Included are flow diagrams of the system and sample logic diagrams for programming experiments and for analyzing data...|$|R
25|$|Turing's {{solution}} to {{working out the}} stecker values (<b>plugboard</b> connections) was to note that, even though the values for, say, A or W, were unknown, the crib still provided known relationships amongst these values; that is, the values after the <b>plugboard</b> transformation. Using these relationships, a cryptanalyst could reason {{from one to another}} and, potentially, derive a logical contradiction, in which case the rotor setting under consideration could be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|The {{cryptanalyst}} hypothesised one <b>plugboard</b> interconnection for the bombe to test. The other stecker {{values and}} the ring settings were worked out by hand methods.|$|E
25|$|While {{the crib}} {{does not allow}} us to {{determine}} what the values after the <b>plugboard</b> are, it does provide a constraint between them. In this case, it shows how T is completely determined if A is known.|$|E
50|$|A {{closely related}} but {{different}} design {{is the so-called}} pin plug and matching pin jack. The pin plug designs resemble banana plugs, but without the spring on the male pin. Instead, these designs rely on spring action in the female jack, or tightly machined tolerances, to ensure good contact. The pin plug design was used where maximum density of connectors was desired (such as in pin <b>plugboards),</b> or a very compact connector was needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{turnaround}} {{time for a}} single job often spanned entire days. If one were very lucky, it might be hours; real-time response was unheard of. But there were worse fates than the card queue; some computers actually required an even more tedious and error-prone process of toggling in programs in binary code using console switches. The very earliest machines actually had to be partly rewired to incorporate program logic into themselves, using devices known as <b>plugboards.</b>|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} methods and devices {{had to be}} invented in {{response}} to continual improvements in German operating procedure and to the Enigma machine itself. The earliest method for reconstructing daily keys was the [...] "grill", {{based on the fact}} that the <b>plugboard's</b> connections exchanged only six pairs of letters, leaving fourteen letters unchanged. Next was Różycki's [...] "clock" [...] method, which sometimes made it possible to determine which rotor was at the right-hand side of the Enigma machine on a given day.|$|R
25|$|The bombe was {{designed}} to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks: specifically, the set of rotors in use and their positions in the machine; the rotor core start positions for the message—the message key—and one of the wirings of the <b>plugboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{candidate}} {{solutions for}} the set of wheel orders were subject to extensive further cryptanalytical work. This progressively eliminated the false stops, built up the set of <b>plugboard</b> connections and established {{the positions of the}} rotor alphabet rings. Eventually, the result would be tested on a Typex machine that had been modified to replicate an Enigma, to see whether that decryption produced German language.|$|E
25|$|To break non-steckered Enigma {{machines}} (those {{without a}} <b>plugboard),</b> Knox (building on earlier research by Hugh Foss) developed a system known as 'rodding', a linguistic {{as opposed to}} mathematical way of breaking codes. This technique worked on the Enigma used by the Italian Navy and the German Abwehr. Knox worked in 'the Cottage', {{next door to the}} Bletchley Park mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to cryptanalysis of the Enigma.|$|E
50|$|Once digital {{computers}} {{of adequate}} performance became available, the solution methods developed on analog network analyzers were {{migrated to the}} digital realm, where <b>plugboards,</b> switches and meter pointers were replaced with punch cards and printouts. The same general-purpose digital computer hardware that ran network studies could easily be dual-tasked with business functions such as payroll. Analog network analyzers faded from general use for load-flow and fault studies, although some persisted in transient studies for a while longer. Analog analyzers were dismantled and either sold off to other utilities, donated to engineering schools, or scrapped.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{control panel}} {{was used for}} the <b>plugboards</b> in unit record {{equipment}} and in the early computers of the 1940s and '50s. In the 1980s, the Xerox Star and the Apple Lisa, which pioneered the first graphical user interface metaphors, controlled user settings by single click selections and variable fields. In 1984 the Apple Macintosh in its initial release made use of fundamental graphic representation of a [...] "control panel board" [...] imitating the operation of slider controls, on/off buttons and radio-select buttons that corresponded to user settings.|$|R
5000|$|The HX-63 was an {{advanced}} rotor machine designed by Crypto AG, {{who started the}} design in 1952. The machine had nine rotors, each with 41 contacts. There were 26 keyboard inputs and outputs, leaving 15 wires to [...] "loop back" [...] through the rotors via a different path. Moreover, each rotor wire could be selected from one of two paths. The movement of the rotors was irregular and controlled by switches. There were two <b>plugboards</b> with the machine; one to scramble the input, {{and one for the}} loop-back wires. The machine could be set up in around 10600 different configurations.|$|R
25|$|ENIAC was, {{like the}} Z3 and Harvard Mark I, {{able to run}} an {{arbitrary}} sequence of mathematical operations, but did not read them from a tape. Like the Colossus, it was programmed by <b>plugboard</b> and switches. ENIAC combined full, Turing complete programmability with electronic speed. The Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC), ENIAC, and Colossus all used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus.|$|E
25|$|The Enigma machine worked {{reciprocally}} so that {{an identical}} machine with identical settings would, if fed the enciphered letters, show the deciphered {{letters on the}} lampboard. Hut 6 had Enigma replica machines that were logically identical to the machines that the Germans were using. To decipher the intercepted messages required that the selection of rotors, the ring settings and the <b>plugboard</b> connections were known. At this time, the first three letters of the prelude to the message were used as an indicator to tell the receiving operator the letters that should appear in the windows for this particular message.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lead}} up to World War II, the Germans made {{successive}} improvements to their military Enigma machines. By January 1939, additional rotors had been introduced {{so that there was}} a choice of three from five (i.e. 60 wheel orders) for the army and airforce Enigmas, and three out of eight (336 wheel orders) for the navy machines. In addition, ten leads were used on the <b>plugboard</b> leaving only six letters unsteckered. This meant that the airforce and army Enigmas could be set up 1.5×1019 ways. In 1941 the German navy introduced a version of Enigma with rotatable reflector (the M4 or Four-rotor Enigma) for communicating with its U-boats. This could be set up in 1.8×1020 different ways.|$|E
2500|$|The US Army Bombe was {{physically}} {{very different from}} the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with Bell Labs on 30 September 1942. The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It was known as [...] "003" [...] or [...] "Madame X". It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not. The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately [...] long [...] high and [...] wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of <b>plugboards.</b> Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons. A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.|$|R
50|$|John von Neumann {{consulted}} for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, {{most notably}} on the ENIAC project, {{as a member}} of its Scientific Advisory Committee.The electronics of the new ENIAC ran at one-sixth the speed, but this in no way degraded the ENIAC's performance, since it was still entirely I/O bound. Complicated programs could be developed and debugged in days rather than the weeks required for <b>plugboarding</b> the old ENIAC. Some of von Neumann's early computer programs have been preserved.The next computer that von Neumann designed was the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were designed and built at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby. John von Neumann recommended that the IBM 701, nicknamed the defense computer include a magnetic drum. It was a faster version of the IAS machine and formed the basis for the commercially successful IBM 704.|$|R
5000|$|The Jacquard head used {{replaceable}} {{punched cards}} {{to control a}} sequence of operations. It is considered {{an important step in}} the history of computing hardware. [...] The ability to change the pattern of the loom's weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of computer programming and data entry. Charles Babbage knew of Jacquard looms and planned to use cards to store programs in his Analytical engine. In the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the 1890 U.S. Census. A large, punched-card-based data processing industry developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, dominated by the International Business Machine corporation (IBM), with its line of unit record equipment. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by <b>plugboards.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Enigma {{machine was}} an {{electromechanical}} device, {{equipped with a}} 26-letter keyboard and 26 lamps, corresponding to {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Inside was a set of wired drums (rotors and a reflector) that scrambled the input. The machine used a <b>plugboard</b> to swap pairs of letters, and the encipherment varied from one key press to the next. For two operators to communicate, both Enigma machines had to be set up in the same way. The large number of possibilities for setting the rotors and the <b>plugboard</b> combined to form an astronomical number of configurations, and the settings were changed daily, so the machine code had to be [...] "broken" [...] anew each day.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time as Rejewski's bomba, a manual method was invented by Henryk Zygalski, that of [...] "perforated sheets" [...] ("Zygalski sheets"), which was {{independent}} of the number of <b>plugboard</b> connections. [...] Rejewski describes the construction of the Zygalski mechanism and its manipulation: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1937 Rejewski, {{along with}} the German section of the Cipher Bureau, {{transferred}} to a secret facility near Pyry in the Kabaty Woods south of Warsaw. On 15 September 1938, the Germans introduced new rules for enciphering message keys (a new [...] "indicator procedure"), making the Poles' earlier techniques obsolete. The Polish cryptanalysts rapidly responded with new techniques. One was Rejewski's , an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas, which solved the daily keys within about two hours. Six bombas were built and were ready for use by mid-November 1938. The bomba exploited {{the fact that the}} <b>plugboard</b> connections did not affect all the letters; therefore, when another change to German operating procedure occurred on 1 January 1939, increasing the number of <b>plugboard</b> connections, the usefulness of the bombas was greatly reduced. The British bombe, the main tool that would be used to break Enigma messages during World War II, would be named after, and likely inspired by, the Polish bomba, though the cryptologic methods embodied in the two machines were different.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{machines}} only tabulated data, counting {{records with}} certain properties, like [...] "male" [...] or [...] "female". In later use, separate stages or [...] "cycles" [...] of processing could be done, {{analogous to the}} stages in batch production. In modern data processing terms, one can think of each stage as an SQL clause, such as SELECT (filter columns), then WHERE (filter cards, or [...] "rows"), etc. The earliest machines were built (hard-wired) for a single function, while from 1906 they could be rewired via <b>plugboards,</b> and electronic computers could be reprogrammed without being rewired. Thus early multi-stage processing required separate machines for each stage, or rewiring a single machine after each stage. Early electronic computers were not capable of having multiple programs loaded into main memory (multiprogramming), and thus while they could process multiple stages on a single machine without rewiring, the program for each stage had to be loaded into memory, run over the entire batch, and then {{the program for the}} next loaded and run.|$|R

50|$|Some {{influential}} figures {{had doubts}} about his proposed design for the decryption machine, and Flowers proceeded with the project while partly funding it himself. Like the later ENIAC of 1946, Colossus {{did not have a}} stored program, and was programmed through <b>plugboards</b> and jumper cables. It was faster, more reliable and more capable than the Robinsons, so speeding up the process of finding the Lorenz χ pin wheel settings. Since Colossus generated the putative keys electronically, it only had to read one tape. It did so with an optical reader which, at 5000 characters per second, was driven much faster than the Robinsons' and meant that the tape travelled at almost 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). This, and the clocking of the electronics from the optically read paper tape sprocket holes, completely eliminated the Robinsons' synchronisation problems. Bletchley Park management, which had been sceptical of Flowers's ability to make a workable device, immediately began pressuring him to construct another. After the end of the war, Colossus machines were dismantled on the orders of Winston Churchill, but GCHQ retained two of them.|$|R
