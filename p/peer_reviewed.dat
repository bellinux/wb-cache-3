5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E

40|$|In {{computer}} science, {{conferences and}} journals conduct <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> {{in order to}} decide what to publish. Many have pointed out the inherent weaknesses in <b>peer</b> <b>review,</b> including those of bias, quality, and accountability. Many have suggested and adopted refinements of <b>peer</b> <b>review,</b> for instance, double blind <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> with author rebuttals. In this essay, I argue that <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> as currently practiced conflates the sensible idea of getting comments on a paper with the irrevocably-flawed one that we either accept or reject the paper, which I term gatekeeping. If we look at the two separately, then {{it is clear that the}} ills associated with current <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> systems are not due to the practice of getting comments, but due to the practice of gatekeeping. True <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> constitutes my proposal for replacing existing <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> systems. It embraces the idea of open debate on the merits of a paper; however, it rejects unequivocally the exercise of gatekeeping. True <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> offers all the benefits of current <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> systems but has none of its weaknesses.
