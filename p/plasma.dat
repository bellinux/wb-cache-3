5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and {{interchange}} instability being the main escape mechanisms—the <b>plasma</b> slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As the <b>plasma</b> moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of the <b>plasma</b> decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the <b>plasma</b> begins to rotate more slowly than the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer magnetosphere) this <b>plasma</b> escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail. As cold, dense <b>plasma</b> moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density <b>plasma</b> (temperature 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere. This <b>plasma,</b> adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal discharge {{generated by}} the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the <b>plasma</b> discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere. The dielectric barrier discharge {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure <b>plasma</b> is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as <b>plasma</b> medicine. The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature <b>plasma</b> jets. These <b>plasma</b> jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as <b>plasma</b> bullets.|$|E
5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see <b>Plasma</b> parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the <b>plasma</b> as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid <b>plasma</b> picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the <b>plasma</b> velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because fluid models usually describe the <b>plasma</b> {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold <b>plasma</b> from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ.

The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) <b>plasma,</b> and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense <b>plasma</b> from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with <b>plasma.</b> The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian <b>plasma,</b> away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E
