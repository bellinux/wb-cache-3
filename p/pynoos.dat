5000|$|Vive la Fête {{was founded}} in 1997 when Mommens (then still playing in his former band dEUS) met Els at a party hosted by or for her sister. He had {{previously}} been an acquaintance of <b>Pynoo's</b> sister whom photographed Els naked {{and showed it to}} Mommens. As Els stated in a 2005 interview; Mommens had approached her in a normal fashion and said randomly: [...] "Hey I saw you naked!" [...] Mommen's recorded a few demos with <b>Pynoo</b> on his 8-track recorder. These demos were released on the EP Je ne veux pas (sometimes also referred to as Paris) which gathered some attention for its resemblance to '80s new wave music. Their first success came with their debut Attaque Surprise (2000). Later records such as République Populaire (2001) and Nuit Blanche (2003) made them popular, especially in the fashion world, where Karl Lagerfeld is one of their fans, and has enlisted them to perform at a number of his big shows in New York City and Paris. In 2005 they released Grand Prix and toured all over Europe and played some shows in Brazil and Mexico.|$|R

50|$|However, {{supportive}} housing, {{especially as}} assisted living, may be congregate in nature either related to hospital and nursing home systems reform {{on one hand}} (E.g., <b>Pynoos</b> et al., 2004), or in psychiatric, to its categorical disability service system with roots in community services systems and psychiatric hospitals (Racino, in press, 2014). In the field of intellectual disabilities, the term Supportive living is more common with decongregated, small size homes and apartments with choice options throughout local communities.|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} of these beliefs in e-learning and LMS research has been affirmed with their causal influence on users’ attitude, satisfaction, system usage, intention to use, and continued intention to use (De Smet et al. 2012; <b>Pynoo</b> and van Braak 2014; Wu and Zhang 2014). In a study comparing six competing models to predict intention to use cloud computing classroom, the TAM exhibited the strongest effect size with perceived usefulness significantly influenced intention, and perceived ease of use significantly influenced attitude towards cloud computing classroom (Shiau and Chau 2016). In terms of LMS functionalities, De Smet et al. (2012) demonstrated that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are significant in influencing teachers to post announcements, upload exercises, receive students’ work, and publish documents in an LMS. In addition, perceived ease of use was also {{found to be a}} pre-cursor that give rise to teachers’ perception about LMS performance. In another study that investigated users’ motivations to replace traditional LMS tools with cloud-based services, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were found to be the key factors for evaluating cloud-based services (Stantchev et al. 2014). Hence, investigation of these beliefs can provide insights about the utility and functionality of a technology.|$|R
30|$|The {{study also}} found that {{psychological}} ownership developed for a VLE had positive significant influences on the VLE’s perceived usefulness with a large effect size and perceived ease of use with a nearing to large effect size (H 4 and H 5). The significance of the findings is consistent with existing research (Smith et al. 2014; Yim et al. 2017) which imply that psychological ownership can be valuable external variable in the TAM. The large effect size on perceived usefulness can serve the TAM well because research had shown perceived usefulness to be more important than perceived ease of use to effect user attitude and intention to use e-learning (<b>Pynoo</b> and van Braak 2014; Sanchez-Prieto et al. 2017; Shiau and Chau 2016). Results supported the notion that people evaluate objects more favourably if they feel a sense of ownership towards it (Van Dyne and Pierce 2004). In the context of the study, this implies that teachers who psychologically own their VLE tend to rate the platform favourably in terms of its usefulness and perceived ease of use. This is indicative of psychological ownership’s benefits in overcoming teachers’ perception of the complexity of cloud-based VLEs which offer more applications that run through the cloud compared to a traditional LMS. It is possible that increased psychological ownership can promote positive perception about the utility and functionality of cloud-based VLE among teachers.|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to understand teachers’ belief in technology use as it can affect their decision on its implementation in the classroom (Chien et al. 2014). Teachers are the frontliners in terms of integration of educational technologies in classroom as they mastermind the application of technological knowledge and pedagogical strategies using these technologies (Kong et al. 2017). In leveraging educational technologies to enhance teaching and learning, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are salient beliefs about technology which can affect users’ attitude and behaviour (Moses et al. 2013; Wang and Wang 2009). These beliefs {{have been found to be}} key determinants within the ambit of e-learning and learning management system (LMS), capable of explaining users’ acceptance, behavioural intention, continuance intention, and usage of these technologies (De Smet et al. 2012; <b>Pynoo</b> and van Braak 2014; Stantchev et al. 2014; Wu and Zhang 2014). They are central constructs to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), developed for research of technology used in utilitarian contexts (Davis 1989). Perceived usefulness is a driver for behavioural intention and attitude towards a particular technology, when individuals believe that using it would be advantageous for their job performance (Davis 1989). Perceived ease of use serves as an important intrinsic motivation for individuals to accept and use a particular technology. A technology that is perceived to be easy to use spares its users from the efforts of having to learn about it (Davis 1989). The efforts saved can be redeployed to the users’ core work tasks and increase their job efficiency and efficacy.|$|R

All rights reserved. doi: 10. 1016 /j. chb. 2010. 10. 005 abstract In this study, secondary school teachers’ acceptance of a digital learning environment (DLE) was investi- gated. Questionnaires were taken on three times (T 1 /T 2 /T 3) during the same school year, with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as theoretical framework. Next to questionnaires, user-logs were collected during the entire school year. A total of 72 teachers completed a questionnaire on at least one occasion: 64 teachers responded at T 1, 41 at T 2, and 55 at T 3. We first investigated which factors influence teachers’ acceptance of a DLE. The main predictors of DLE acceptance were performance expectancy and social influence by superiors to use the DLE. Effort expectancy and facilitating conditions were of minor importance. We then investigated how well the amount of final observed use could be pre- dicted, and found that at T 1 about one third, at T 2 about one fourth and at T 3 about half of the variance in observed use was predicted by attitude, behavioral intention and self-reported frequency of use. Our study showed that to maximize use of a DLE, its usefulness should be demonstrated, while school boards or principals should strongly encourage teachers to (start to) use the DLE. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Grief {{has long}} been a topic of study and debate among researchers, but the concept of Childhood Traumatic Grief (CTG) has only {{recently}} been introduced and accepted as a condition in need of better understanding. Childhood Traumatic Grief is defined as occurring “…when children whose loved ones die in circumstances that are subjectively traumatic develop trauma symptoms which impinge on these children 2 ̆ 7 s abilities to engage in the typical tasks of grieving” (Cohen, Mannarino, Greenberg, Padlo, 2 ̆ 6 Shipley, 2002; <b>Pynoos</b> 2 ̆ 6 Nader, 1990).

40|$|Recently, a new {{diagnostic}} construct, developmental trauma disorder (DTD), {{was proposed}} {{to describe the}} effects of chronic exposure to violence in combination with disruptions in caregiving systems. This study uses archival data to field test the consensus proposed diagnostic criteria for DTD {{in a sample of}} urban children (N = 214). Children with complex trauma histories as defined in the proposed DTD Criterion A {{were much more likely to}} meet the proposed DTD symptom criteria than children who did not meet the exposure criterion. This field trial of the proposed DTD criteria suggests that the proposed construct of DTD is useful for describing the symptoms induced by ongoing traumatic stressors and disrupted caregiving and that the proposed symptom criteria can differentiate children with histories of exposure to developmental trauma from other trauma-exposed children. The vast majority of trauma exposure in the United States is ongoing and includes multiple, co-occurring types of trauma (Anda et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2004; <b>Pynoos</b> et al., 2009). Additionally, much of this trauma exposure takes place in the context of compromised caregiving (van der Kolk, 2005). Clinicians and researchers have suggested that ongoing trauma, coupled with compromised caregiving, may result in a distinct constellation of symptoms. In 2009, a group of experts on th...|$|E
40|$|Adolescents in {{in urban}} areas are at a higher risk for {{experiencing}} direct victimization as well as witnessing violence directed towards others, which increases the amount of post-traumatic stress (PTS) they face (Joseph, S., Mynard, H., 2 ̆ 6 Mayall, M. 2000). Experiencing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) {{has been associated with}} a number of negative externalizing behaviors, such as increased delinquency, drug use and aggressive behavior in adolescents (Dierkhising, C. B., Ko, S. J., Woods-Jaeger, B., Briggs, E. C., Lee, R., 2 ̆ 6 <b>Pynoos,</b> R. S. 2013). This association is especially relevant, as adolescence is a stage where youth are beginning to experiment and form life-long habits to manage life stressors. However, previous research has been limited regarding gender differences in PTS as males and females often have different ways of coping with traumatic events (Stevens, Murphy, 2 ̆ 6 McKnight, 2003). This study closes this gap by investigating the connection between PTS and externalizing behaviors in the form of delinquency, drug use, and aggression in a sample of urban, predominantly African American adolescents. Data for this study comes from the first two waves of Project COPE, a four-year longitudinal study on violence exposure, stress responses and adjustment who were recruited from low SES neighborhoods in Richmond, Virginia. The sample included 166 males (46. 4...|$|E
40|$|I {{shall present}} a {{selective}} overview of recent themes and directions in social research on {{housing in the}} U. S. I narrowed the topic by focusing on research centering on the family and on neighborhood. These topics offer ways to concentrate on 2 ̆ 2 social 2 ̆ 2 research and to narrow a rather broad topic. My meaning of 2 ̆ 2 social 2 ̆ 2 research encompasses work not only by sociologists. It also includes the separate or collaborative work of other disciplines, especially psychology, anthropology, social psychology, architecture and urban planning. Research on housing has from its Post-World War II flowering been an interdisciplinary enterprise. And {{it continues to be}} so. Several themes stand out in the last 15 years. A longstanding and overriding framework in housing research involves physical determinism - the assumption that the house, neighborhood, community or town influences and shapes how people live. This view has remained predominant (Schorr, 1963); but there are growing reactions against it to suggest that people select environments according to their preferences more than being shaped by those environments (<b>Pynoos</b> et al, 1973) and that people and environments interact to affect each other Ti eller 1966). On the whole, physical determinism remains the strongest of the orientations: it takes a physical setting as given and assesses the impact on life styles, values and attitudes, or it involves design of housing environments which presume to create desirable social conditions. The deterministic view and reactions against it permeate each of the four research emphases which are described next...|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{examined}} students 2 ̆ 7 adjustment to college—why some students {{make the transition}} successfully, whereas others struggle or leave school after {{only a short time}} (e. g., Ezezek, 1994; Holmbek 2 ̆ 6 Wandrei, 1993). Efforts to support students through this transition must draw upon a more complete understanding of variables that place students at risk for a stressful transition and protective factors that promote positive adaptation. Recent research has been focused on both individual and contextual variables including gender, racial identity, coping strategies, stress, social support and attachment (Feenstra, Banyard, Rines, 2 ̆ 6 Hopkins, 2000; Klasner 2 ̆ 6 Pistole, 2003; Pritchard 2 ̆ 6 Wilson, 2003) and suggests the need for more research that goes beyond explaining academic success from 2 ̆ 2 demographic and academic variables 2 ̆ 2 (Pritchard 2 ̆ 6 Wilson, p. 18). The current study is an examination of a group of students potentially at risk for a stressful transition to college: students who are survivors of traumatic stress. For the purposes of this research, trauma is defined broadly as a range of events that overwhelm an individual 2 ̆ 7 s coping capacities and involves threats of serious injury or death to self or someone close to the individual (e. g., <b>Pynoos,</b> 1993). This examination was of variation in the transition to college among a sample of trauma survivors, of the roles of social relationships and supports, coping, and making meaning of the trauma in explaining variance in resilience in adjusting to college...|$|E
