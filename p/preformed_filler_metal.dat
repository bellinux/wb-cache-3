Susceptibility to fusion zone DDC was evaluated using the transverse varestraint test method, while heat affected zone (HAZ) DDC susceptibility was evaluated using a newly developed spot-on-spot varestraint test method. Alloy 690 and <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 52 cracking susceptibility was compared to the DDC susceptibility of Alloy 600, <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 52, and <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 625. In addition, the effect of grain size and orientation on cracking susceptibility was also included in this study. Alloy 690, <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 82, <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 52, and <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 625 were found more susceptible to fusion zone DDC than Alloy 600. <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 52 and Alloy 690 were found more susceptible to HAZ DDC when compared to wrought Alloy 600, <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 82 and <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 625. <b>Filler</b> <b>Metal</b> 52 exhibited the greatest susceptibility to HAZ DDC of all the weld metals evaluated. The base materials were found much more resistant to HAZ DDC in the wrought condition than when autogenously welded. A smaller grain size was found to offer greater resistance to DDC. For weld metal where grain size is difficult to control, a change in grain orientation was found to improve resistance to DDC...|$|R

The shear strengths of the joints brazed at 1173 to 1473 K using active <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> containing Ti and Zr were 150 to 250 MPa. The fracture position of the joints after shear test was the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> or mixture of the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> and Si_ 3 N_ 4. On the other hand, the average shear strengths of the joints brazed at 1373 K using active <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> containing V and Nb were 144 and 163 MPa, respectively.

30|$|With laser welding, Sujin, et al. (2014) {{showed that}} laser-welded Cu-Al joints {{fracture}} easily {{due to the}} large weld zone {{and the formation of}} intermetallic compounds (CuAl and Al 2 Cu). The work of Weigl, et al. (2011) on laser welding with adapted filler materials (i.e. AlSi 12 and CuSi 3) showed that the hardness value decreased more with the AlSi 12 <b>filler</b> <b>metal,</b> due to uniform distribution of the Cu concentration and intermetallic compounds. Additionally, the weld formed with the AlSi 12 <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> had the highest ductile strength, followed by the weld made with the CuSi 3 <b>filler</b> <b>metal,</b> with the weld formed without <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> having the lowest ductile strength. The ductility in the weld that was made using an AlSi 12 <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> was due to a less coarse honeycomb structure.|$|R
30|$|As well as {{reduction}} in intermetallic compounds, <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> addition can improve other properties and reduce defects. Research {{has shown that}} appropriate <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> such as Zn-Al alloys for a brazed Al-Cu joint give high corrosion resistance and better mechanical properties compared to other <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> (Berlanga-Labari et al. 2011; Feng et al. 2012 b; Yan, et al., 2013). Research has also shown that {{the addition of a}} suitable <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> having a low melting temperature results in a reduction of the residual stress in Al-Cu joints (Xiao et al. 2013). An inappropriate <b>filler</b> <b>metal,</b> on the other hand, results in defect formation in the weld metal. This was demonstrated in the studies by Berlanga-Labari, et al. (2011), in which it was seen that brazing of an Al-Cu joint with a Zn-Al eutectic <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> resulted in a uniform microstructure but with defects such as porosity and cracks. In the case of laser welding, Weigl, et al. (2011) conducted an experiment on adapted filler materials that were used in thermal welding and a brazing process (AlSi 12 and CuSi 3). The weld metal showed micro-cracks in the AlSi 12 filler material; welds formed by CuSi 3 had macro-crack formation and low dilution but were better than welds formed without <b>filler</b> <b>metals.</b> In conclusion, the use of appropriate <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> in Al-Cu joints improves the properties of the joint, by assisting in proper dilution, which reduces the intermetallic compounds and leads to fewer defects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{theoretical}} {{approaches to}} the erosion and wetting/flowing phenomena during the laser brazing process {{were made by the}} computer simulation. The erosion kinetics of the Inconel 600 base metal was investigated using Au- 18 %Ni <b>filler</b> <b>metal.</b> The erosion profile during the laser brazing was estimated by applying the additivity rule to the Nernst-Brunner theory based on the measured thermal cycle of the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> droplet. The computed erosion profiles in the laser brazed joints were fairly consistent with the experimental ones. The wetting and flowing of the melted Au- 18 %Ni <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> on the Inconel 600 butt joint during the laser brazing were analyzed by the metal flow model. The <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> droplet wetted and spread on the base metal and simultaneously infiltrated into the joint gap with the lapse of time.
