40|$|The {{environmental}} and energy parameters of Photovoltaic (PV) systems {{play a very}} important role when compared to conventional power systems. In the present paper, a typical PV-system is analyzed to its elements and an assessment of the material and energy requirements during the production procedures is attempted. A Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is being performed on the production system of photovoltaics. Energy and environmental analyses are extended to the production of the primary energy carriers. This allows having a complete picture of the life cycle of all the PV-components described in the present study. Four different scenarios are examined in detail providing every possible aspect of scientific interest involving polycrystalline PV systems. In order to obtain concrete results from this study, the specific working tool used is the Eco-Indicator ’ 95 (1999) as being reliable and widely applied and accepted within LCA community. A process that relates inventory information with relevant concerns about natural resource usage and potential effects of environmental loadings is attempted. Large-scale PV-systems have many advantages in comparison with a conventional power system (e. g. diesel power station) in electricity production. As a matter of fact, PV-systems become part of the environment and the ecosystems from the moment of their installation. Carbon Footprints of various PV-systems scenarios are greatly smaller than that of a diesel <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>operation.</b> Further technological improvements in PV module production and in the manufacture of Balance-of-System components, as well as extended use of renewable energy resources as primary energy resources could make Carbon Footprint of PV-systems even smaller. Extended operational period of time (O. P.

40|$|In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the {{availability}} of water from estuarine lakes combined {{with the use of}} coal as an energy source has resulted in coal-fired power stations on the margins of coastal lakes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use a multi-proxy method to evaluate the extent and trends of historical metal inputs from a coal-fired power station to sediments in Lake Budgewoi. Metal concentrations in 15 -cm sediment cores showed a uniform depth profile. The highest concentrations of zinc and copper were found close to the Munmorah Power Station outlet, while arsenic and lead were found in the deposition basin of sediments. Background values for metal concentrations of Zn < 80 mg/kg, As < 15 mg/kg, Se < 1 mg/kg, Cu < 16 mg/kg, Cd < 0. 8 mg/kg and Pb < 20 mg/kg were used as the baseline for future studies in this lake. The history of sediment metal concentrations is consistent with power station activities in the lake. Maximum metal concentrations found in sediments of Lake Budgewoi were Zn 122 mg/kg, Cu 45 mg/kg, As 10 mg/kg, Se 1. 8 mg/kg, Cd 0. 2 mg/kg and Pb 41 mg/kg. The ratio of these values to the national interim sediment quality guidelines are Pb 0. 8, Cu 0. 7, Zn 0. 6, As 0. 5 and Cd 0. 1. Although concentrations were below guideline values, the multi-proxy method applied in this study was sensitive enough to detect metal concentration changes over the 45 years of <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>operation.</b> The results of this study provide environmental regulators with a baseline of the past and current situation of power station metal contamination, and in the future will provide insights into how long it takes the environment to revert to background metal concentrations. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of a high}} share of photovoltaic (PV) power generation in remote electricity networks is often limited by the networks’ capabilities to accommodate PV power fluctuations caused by passing clouds. Increasing the share of PV penetration in such networks is accompanied by an increased effort to achieve integration. In the absence of solar forecasting, sufficient spinning reserve must always be provided to cover unforeseen reductions. The expected ramp rates are magnified in small and centralised PV systems and {{can be in the}} order of a few seconds. In this study, we investigate the use of a low-cost sky camera for very short-term solar forecasting. Almost 2 months of sky camera data have been recorded in Perth, Western Australia and processed for to provide high-resolution irradiance forecasts based on visible sky images. For performance validation, the capability to provide reliable forecasts under constant clear sky conditions is investigated. During these times, PV generation is expected to be high and reliable, which provides an opportunity to reduce the online spinning reserve often enabling <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>operation</b> with one less operating diesel generation. For networks with disconnected diesel generators, we assume that clouds that could reduce the PV generation output have to be predicted at least 2 [*]min before their arrival to have enough time for a diesel generator to start and synchronize with the grid. Therefore, we define an irradiance threshold discriminating between the persistent state of constant clear sky (stays clear) and the non-persistent state (cloud shading event) based on a 2 – 5 [*]min time horizon. In a binary evaluation, we achieve an overall accuracy of 97 % correct forecasts and low 3 % false alarms of cloud events indicating a high potential for fuel savings. Focusing on the rare (2 % of the time) but more critical non-persistent conditions, we found 8 out of 84 cloud events have not been predicted in advance.

Then also affect from the coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>operation</b> in enhancement activities of natural thorium isotopes to the marine environment. The unsupported activity of thorium- 228 used to estimate the sediment mixing with extremely high rate value of 12455 cm 2 yr(- 1) at the hot water discharge station. The activity range of thorium- 232, thorium- 230 and thorium- 228 was from 4. 38 ± 0. 14 to 11. 75 ± 0. 51 dpm/g, 2. 73 ± 0. 11 to 9. 54 ± 0. 43 dpm/g and 3. 34 ± 0. 19 to 12. 38 ± 0. 61 dpm/g, respectively. All three isotopes display non-uniform and greatly fluctuated distribution from surface to the deeper layers as revealed by high sediments mixing. The ratio values of thorium- 230 /thorium- 232 and thorium- 228 /thorium- 232 also exhibited as non-uniform profile where the average ratio of thorium- 228 /thorium- 232 was about 0. 76 indicating low contain activity of uranium- 238 or uranium- 234 in the detrital materials and that uranium was tends to diffuse from sediments during the weathering, erosion and sediments transport. Meanwhile, the ratio of thorium- 228 /thorium- 232 less than unity cause by the leach out process of radium- 228 from sediment-water interface. The statistical correlation coefficient value obtained from the Pearson method have {{a positive correlation between}} thorium- 232, thorium- 230 and thorium- 228 with Al, Fe and Mn, indicating thorium isotopes were attached with the oxides metals.

40|$|History of {{peaceful}} {{use of nuclear}} energy, despite of all necessary emphasis on operation safety, {{is accompanied by a}} series of accidents, some of which left indelible trace in minds of wide public and so led to changes in the comprehension of nuclear safety and in the access to its preservation. Because the consequences of possible nuclear power plant accident have always serious social impacts, it is most desirable to define all possibly risks, to quantify probability of their formation and in this way to gain the possibility to prevent them effectively and efficiently. This work is dedicated to approve or to disapprove that the KARS method is practically applicable for evaluation of nuclear <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>operation</b> safety. The work objective is to evaluate events and risks associated with the operation of a particular nuclear facility by the KARS method and critically evaluate obtained results and the used method as such. The work is divided into theoretical and practical part. Theoretical part includes basic information necessary for correct understanding of the chosen data processing procedure and subsequent interpretation of the gained results. A brief overview of basic concepts relating to the nuclear safety, the safety culture and the emergency preparedness, including their definitions is given in this section of the work. For the evaluation of obtained results it is useful to make familiar with basic concepts of the NPP safety evaluation, PSA and the stress tests. Obviously, it is necessary to describe the KARS method and to define the concept of quality of human performance with regard to the obtained results. The risk analysis by the KARS method was carried out in the four consecutive steps: 1. Data collection for the risk analysis. 2. Data processing by the use of the KARS method. 3. Interpretation of the obtained results. 4. Comparison of the obtained results with the available data. The particular risks for the construction of the risk correlation table were based on the analysis of activities of individual members of the emergency and technical support center on the basis of managing documentation for each function. In the emergency instructions these risks are either named or the action to manage them are determined. Subsequently these risks are further more specify according to the operational documentation used for solving abnormal and emergency conditions or solving of severe accidents. Determination of the risk correlation seems to be subjective and requires a considerable degree of professional insight into the analyzed issues. The risk analysis was processed according to the procedure that was laid down by Ing. Stefan Pacinda, Ph. D. Each risk taken into consideration in this analysis is briefly described within the interpretation of obtained results. The coefficients of activity with the biggest value were found for these risks: human error, earthquake, plane crash, terrorist threat, errors in operating and managing documentation and fire. The coefficients of passivity with the biggest value were found for these risks: human failure, serious damage to health, ecological disaster, components malfunctions, radiation accident, nuclear material integrity damage and control system malfunctions. Comparison of the risks that were postulated in the stress tests and the risks that were considered in this analysis indicate that the ETE NPP emergency response was prepared to be able to cope these risks. Results of this analysis showed that the essential element for the safe operation of nuclear power plants is qualified, well selected and systematically trained staff. In light of the experience acquired during elaboration of this work I have concluded that the KARS method can be used for nuclear safety evaluation only in a limited way...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} here describes {{a novel approach}} for determining past and present effects of a power station thermal plume discharge on an estuary. The technique utilised benthic diatoms, combining palaeoecological and contemporaneous multi-taxa approaches, to demonstrate that diatoms were not only responding to the plume in the modern day environment, but also indicated a changing temperature regime within the receiving water bay over time. The approach provided new information and demonstrated a range of techniques that may be employed for improved management of thermal discharges to enclosed coastal water bodies. To determine the spatial distribution of benthic diatoms {{in relation to a}} power station cooling field, the discharge at Vales Point, Lake Macquarie, was selected as the study site and first sampled in 2003. The initial fieldwork sampled sediments along a thermal gradient with increased distance from the discharge point. This spatial pattern was then replicated within two other southern lake control embayments. Multi-variate analyses determined that temperature {{and a number of other}} variables associated with the plume explained gradients in the diatom flora of the receiving bay. Satellite imagery and high resolution logger data then provided detailed plume and lake temperature information and indicated that thermal loading of lake water and thus the potential for ecological effects were expected to be greater in autumn/winter compared to summer. To determine changes in receiving bay water quality over time and to establish prepower station baseline conditions, a sediment core was obtained from Wyee Bay, sub sectioned, 210 Pb dated and analysed for fossil benthic diatoms. Diatom-inference models were then developed based upon a localised reference dataset obtained from sample sites across Lake Macquarie and NSW central coast estuaries. The assemblage profile displayed periods (several years to decades) of relative homogeneity and heterogeneity (years to a decade), coincident with the major phases of <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>operation.</b> A change in assemblages was also observed around 1925 - 30 and prior to power station commissioning, indicating a change to receiving bay ecology at an earlier time. Although the salinity and temperature data were both adequate for modelling, reconstruction errors meant that only longer-term trends were discernable for temperature. When compared to real-time data (monitoring) variability in salinity within the core was relatively well represented by the model and appeared to respond to climatic factors such as SOI and rainfall. Longer-term salinity trends, however, were not as reliable as those for temperature. In an effort to improve the temperature-inference model for the Wyee Bay core an alternative reference dataset was developed by sampling across a natural temperature gradient. Triplicate samples from 13 estuaries from Noosa (southern Queensland) to Eden (southern NSW) (26 °S – 37 °S) were analysed for benthic diatoms and combined with environmental variables to establish a Temperature-Latitude (TL) dataset. Sensitivity testing was also conducted to examine the roles of eveness/unevenness (structure) within the sample design, numbers of species and taxonomic resolution on the multi-variate analyses and model output. While latitude, salinity and phosphate were the variables that consistently explained the greatest proportion of variability across the different datasets, salinity, temperature and nutrients were dominant when latitude was removed. Most models using TL datasets improved reconstruction errors; however, the nested (nTL 1) dataset provided the best inferred-temperature history for Wyee Bay when validated by long-term monitoring data. Generally, the environmental variables attributable to gradients between lakes were the same regardless of the number of species, sample design or taxonomic resolution. To increase our understanding of the changes in diatoms and lake ecology over a greater pre-power station and pre-industrial (heavy metals) period two additional cores were obtained for the final phase of the study. At both a plume-effected and a control site cored sediments were analysed for heavy metals and 210 Pb to establish and cross validate geochemical chronology and identify pre-industrial boundaries. While only sediments of the Crangan Bay core were preserved adequately for dating it provided key information relative to the original Wyee Bay core. Prior to heavy metal enrichment in the southern lake (1925 - 1942), Crangan Bay (control) (20 - 42 cm) and Wyee Bay (pre- 1935) supported a similar diatom flora. Thus, it was inferred that the environmental condition of the lake’s southern embayments were likely to be similar at that time and relatively stable for Crangan Bay to at least 1790. The work described here demonstrated the applicability of benthic diatoms as tools for understanding spatial and temporal changes in a coastal lake associated with a power station thermal plume. Diatoms and the multi-taxa approach could be utilised as bioindicatortype tools for regular broadscale assessments of south-east coast estuarine health...|$|E
