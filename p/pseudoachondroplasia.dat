5000|$|<b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> (also {{known as}} PSACH, Pseudoachondroplastic {{dysplasia}}, and Pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia syndrome) is an osteochondrodysplasia {{that results in}} mild to severely short stature due to the inhibition of skeletal growth primarily in the limbs. [...] Though similarities in nomenclature may cause confusion, <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{should not be confused}} with achondroplasia, which is a clinically and genetically distinct skeletal dysplasia. <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein COMP. Mutation in the COMP gene can also multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Despite the radioclinical similarities between <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, the latter is less severe.132400 ...|$|E
50|$|Hetch et al. also {{discovered}} type IX collagen accumulated within the <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> chondrocytes. This discovery indicated {{the pathogenesis of}} <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> results from the interactions of {{the products of the}} mutant COMP allele with certain “cartilage components,” particularly with type IX collagen (Hetch et al. 1995).|$|E
50|$|Studies {{conducted}} by Hetch et al. suggest that type IX collagen, a collagen active {{specifically in the}} construction of cartilage, {{plays a key role in}} <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> The researchers found that IX collagen was amassed within the <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> chondrocytes. This discovery suggests that the pathogenesis of <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> involves the interactions of the mutant COMP gene products with specific cartilage components, such as type IX collagen, and that it is not solely the result of the effects of mutant molecules on the production and secretion of COMP (OMIM 2008).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{is a type}} of short-limb dwarfism. It is {{a genetic}} {{autosomal}} dominant disorder. It is generally not discovered until 2-3 years of age, since growth is normal at first. <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> is usually first detected by a drop of linear growth in contrast to peers, a curious, waddling gait or arising lower limb deformities.|$|E
5000|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of plain radiographic findings remains an important contributor to diagnosis of <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> It {{is noteworthy that}} vertebral radiographic abnormalities tend to resolve over time. Epiphyseal abnormalities tend to run a progressive course. Patients usually suffer early-onset arthritis of hips and knees. Many unique skeletal radiographic abnormalities of patients with <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{have been reported in}} the literature.|$|E
5000|$|Short-limb short stature {{in which}} there is limb {{shortening}} as achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.|$|E
5000|$|Together with rhizomelic limb shortening, the {{presence}} of epiphyseal-metaphyseal changes of the long bones is a distinctive radiologic feature of <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is also {{a common}} symptom for those who suffer from various {{skeletal}} dysplasias such as with <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> and achondroplasia at an early age.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{skeletal}} dysplasias affecting all racial groups. However, no precise incidence figures are currently available (Suri et al. 2004).|$|E
5000|$|Normal {{widening}} of the interpedicular distances caudally demonstrated on anteroposterior radiographs of the dorsolumbar region. This {{is an important}} differentiating feature between <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> and achondroplasia.|$|E
5000|$|Disproportionate short stature, {{deformity}} of {{the lower}} limbs, short fingers, and ligamentous laxity give <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> its distinctive features. The average height of adult males with the condition is around 120 centimeters (3 ft, 11 in), while adult females are typically around 116 cm (3ft, 9in). Affected individuals are not noticeably short at birth. Patients with <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> present with gait abnormalities, lower limb deformity, or a retarded growth rate that characteristically appear at age 2-3 years. Disproportionate short stature is characterized by shortening of proximal limb segments (humeri and femora) also called rhizomelic shortening. Other known clinical features include, genu valgum/varum, brachydactyly (short fingers), supple flexion deformity of the hips, knees, hyperlordosis of lumbar spine, rocker bottom feet and broadening of the metaphyseal ends of long bones especially around the wrists, knees and ankles. Patients with <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> have normal intelligence and craniofacial features, “Figure 1”, “Figure 2”, “Figure 3”.|$|E

50|$|The Ovitz family {{originated}} from Maramureş County, Romania. They were descended from Shimson Eizik Ovitz (1868-1923), a badchen entertainer, itinerant rabbi and himself a dwarf. He fathered ten children in total, {{seven of them}} dwarfs (afflicted with <b>pseudoachondroplasia),</b> from two marriages.|$|E
50|$|Other {{causes of}} {{dwarfism}} are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, diastrophic dysplasia, <b>pseudoachondroplasia,</b> hypochondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, primordial dwarfism, Turner syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), and hypothyroidism. Severe shortness with skeletal distortion also occurs {{in several of}} the Mucopolysaccharidoses and other storage disorders. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may cause proportionate, yet temporary, dwarfism.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly 60 {{mutations}} in the COMP gene {{have been identified}} in individuals with <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> However, the mutation responsible for the most common allele is a deletion of one codon within a very short triplet repeat (GAC), in which the 469th amino acid, an aspartic acid, is deleted (OMIM 2008).|$|E
5000|$|... ==History== In 1995 {{the gene}} {{responsible}} for <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> was identified by a research {{team led by}} Dr. Jacqueline Hecht of The University of Texas-Houston, Health Science Center. This discovery additionally {{shed light on the}} COMP protein, which the team recognized as somehow involved in skeletal growth and height determination (Hetch et al. 1995).|$|E
5000|$|... ==Diagnosis== Exact {{diagnosis}} remains widely {{built on}} precise history taking, with the characteristic clinical and radiographic skeletal features. Genetic diagnosis {{is based on}} DNA sequencing. Because plasma COMP levels are significantly reduced in patients with COMP mutations, such as <b>pseudoachondroplasia,</b> measuring plasma COMP levels has become a reliable means of diagnosing this and pathopysiologically similar disorders.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Inheritance== <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> is {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal dominant}} manner, though one {{case of a}} very rare autosomal recessive form has been documented. The offspring of affected individuals are at 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele. Prenatal testing by molecular genetic examination is available if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member (Hecht et al. 1995).|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, Ralph Oehlmann's group mapped MED to the peri-centromeric {{region of}} {{chromosome}} 19, using genetic linkage analysis. Michael Briggs' group mapped PSACH {{to the same}} area. COMP gene was firstly linked to MED and PSACH in 1995. In 1995, the group led by Knowlton did a [...] "high-resolution genetic and physical mapping of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> mutations at chromosome 19p13.1-p12." ...|$|E

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a noncollagenous {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) protein. It consists of five identical glycoprotein subunits, each with EGF-like and calcium-binding (thrombospondin-like) domains. Oligomerization results from {{formation of a}} five-stranded coiled coil and disulfide bonds. Binding to other ECM proteins such as collagen appears to depend on divalent cations. Mutations can cause the osteochondrodysplasias <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the genetic}} {{mutation}} causing the short-legged trait in Munchkins has {{been referred to}} as achondroplasia, achondroplasia is typically associated with an enlarged head as well as short legs. This combination of features is not seen in Munchkin cats. The condition has sometimes been referred to as hypochondroplasia or <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> Small litter sizes when two munchkin cats are crossed indicate that embryos that are homozygous for the munchkin gene are non-viable.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Hetch and {{her colleagues}} from the Research Department at Shriners Hospital for Children in Portland, Oregon {{conducted}} further research, which led to their discovery that the intracellular fate of mutant COMP {{is determined by the}} environment of individual chondrocytes, contrary to the previous notion that COMP activities leading to <b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> were determined by structural effects of the mutation on COMP; this meant that COMP activities are cell-specific (Hetch et al. 1995).|$|E
50|$|Hall's {{research}} has been far-ranging {{in the areas of}} congenital malformations including neural tube defects, the genetics of short stature, the mechanisms of disease such as mosaicism and imprinting, the natural history of genetic disorders, the genetics of connective tissue disorders such as arthrogryposis, and monozygotic (identical) twins. She has contributed to the knowledge of a number of syndromes. Her name is associated with the Hall type of <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> (a severe form of dwarfism with short limbs), Sheldon-Hall syndrome, and the Hall-Pallister syndrome (hamartoma in the hypothalamus tract, hypopituitarism, imperforate anus and polydactyly).|$|E
50|$|Pankert was {{apparently}} affected by dwarfism, possibly <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> He {{was born in}} Salurn in the County of Tyrol (present-day Salorno, South Tyrol) and originally practised as a button maker. Probably about 1718 he met with Prince Charles III Philip, who since 1712 ruled as a Habsburg governor over the lands of Tyrol and Further Austria. Philip {{took an interest in}} Pankert, and when he assumed the rule in the Electoral Palatinate, he brought him along to Heidelberg Castle (in what is today Germany) as a cup-bearer and official entertainer for the court.|$|E
50|$|While {{there were}} early speculations that the Munchkin will develop spinal {{problems}} commonly seen in short-legged dog breeds, in 1995 several breeders had their oldest Munchkins X-rayed and examined {{for signs of}} joint or bone problems and found none. However, {{there appears to be}} two conditions with increased incidence in the breed: lordosis (excessive curvature of the spine) and pectus excavatum (hollowed chest). Both conditions are commonly seen in humans with <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> These conditions can appear in other breeds and some breeders have denied that it is a problem for the Munchkin.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{currently}} {{no cure for}} <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> However, management of the various health problems that result from the disorder includes medications such as analgesics (painkillers) for joint discomfort, osteotomy for lower limb deformities, and the surgical treatment of scoliosis. Prevention of some related health problems includes physical therapy to preserve joint flexibility and regular examinations to detect degenerative joint disease and neurological manifestations (particularly spinal cord compression). Additionally, healthcare providers recommend treatment for psychosocial issues related to short stature and other physical deformities for both affected individuals and their families (OMIM 2008).|$|E
50|$|All those {{genes are}} {{involved}} in the production of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The role of COMP gene remains unclear. It is a noncollagenous protein of the ECM. Mutations in this gene can cause the <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> (PSACH). It should {{play a role in the}} structural integrity of cartilage by its interaction with other extracellular matrix proteins and can be part of the interaction of the chondrocytes with the matrix. It is a potent suppressor of apoptosis in chondrocytes and can suppressapoptosis. Another one of it roles is maintaining a vascular smooth muscle cells contractile under physiological or pathological stimuli.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{is a rare}} {{osteochondrodysplasia}} {{characterized by}} disproportionate short stature and limb deformity. Diagnostic accuracy {{is based on a}} detailed evaluation of the radioclinical features. We report a boy with <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> We aim to underscore why is accurate delineation of the pattern of radioclinical skeletal abnormalities in <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> a weighty part of diagnosis. Furthermore, we aim to highlight the main clinical and skeletal imaging features of skeletal dysplasias that overlap with <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> using clinical cases evaluated in our institution. The findings affirm that anthropometric measurements and skeletal radiography are important contributors to the differential diagnosis and classification of disproportionate growth...|$|E
40|$|Achondroplasia and <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> are {{autosomal}} dominant skeletal dysplasias resulting in short-limbed dwarfism. Histologic and ultrastructural {{studies of the}} cartilage in <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> and in homozygous achondroplasia have suggested a structural abnormality in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), a major structural protein in the extra-cellular matrix. The gene encoding CSPG core protein (CSPGCP) is thus a logical "candidate gene" for analysis in these conditions. cDNA probes encoding CSPGCP were used to identify restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in DNA from a panel of control individuals. No gross alterations at the CSPGCP locus were noted in DNA from 37 individuals with achondroplasia and 5 individuals with <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> In addition, allelic frequencies of the RFLPs {{were not significantly different}} among controls and patients with either condition. In one three-generation family with achondroplasia, close linkage of the CSPGCP locus and the skeletal dysplasia was excluded using a Bgl II polymorphism. Similarly, in a three-generation family with <b>pseudoachondroplasia,</b> the CSPGCP gene was not tightly linked to the disease phenotype. These results indicate that mutations at the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein locus do not cause achondroplasia or <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> in these families...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{is a rare}} type of short-limbed {{skeletal}} dysplasia. It {{is usually}} found as an autosomal dominant inheritable disorder.

40|$|<b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> is a dominantly {{inherited}} chondrodysplasia {{associated with}} mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Investigations into {{the pathogenesis of}} <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> are hampered by its rarity. We developed a cell culture model by expressing mutant COMP in bovine primary chondrocytes using a gutless adenoviral vector. We show that mutant COMP exerts its deleterious effects through both intra- and extracellular pathogenic pathways. Overexpression of mutant COMP led to a dose-dependent decrease in cellular viability. The secretion of mutant COMP was markedly delayed, presumably due to a prolonged association with chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ECM lacked organized collagen fibers and showed amorphous aggregates formed by mutant COMP. Thus, <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{appears to be an}} ER storage disease, most likely caused by improper folding of mutant COMP. The growth failure of affected patients may be explained by an increased cell death of growth-plate chondrocytes. Dominant interference of the mutant protein on collagen fiber assembly could contribute to the observed failure of the ECM of cartilage and tendons...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pseudoachondroplasia</b> {{is a rare}} rhizomelic short-limbed {{skeletal}} dysplasia. Its inheritance is varied; {{autosomal dominant}} pattern and germline or somatic mutations can occur. Children at 2 - 3 years of age present with short height, gait disturbances, or limb deformities. Characteristic skeletal changes include shortening of long bones, predominantly of femur and humerus with irregular, flared metaphysis and fragmented epiphysis. Platyspondyly is also present, but the interpedicular distance is normal. The diagnosis is essentially based on imaging, and thus, {{it is important to}} be aware of the radiological features. Here, we report a case of two brothers where the elder sibling had classical radiological features of <b>pseudoachondroplasia,</b> whereas the younger one had early changes of this disorder...|$|E

40|$|Cartilage {{oligomeric}} {{matrix protein}} (COMP), a secreted glycoprotein synthesized by chondrocytes, regulates proliferation and type II collagen assembly. Mutations in the COMP gene cause <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Previously, {{we have shown}} that expression of D 469 del-COMP in transgenic mice causes intracellular retention of D 469 del-COMP, thereby recapitulating <b>pseudoachondroplasia</b> chondrocyte pathology. This inducible transgenic D 469 del-COMP mouse is the only in vivo model to replicate the critical cellular and clinical features of <b>pseudoachondroplasia.</b> Here, we report developmental studies of D 469 del-COMP-induced chondrocyte pathology from the prenatal period to adolescence. D 469 del-COMP retention was limited prenatally and did not negatively affect the growth plate until 3 weeks after birth. Results of immunostaining, transcriptome analysis, and qRT-PCR suggest a molecular model in which D 469 del-COMP triggers apoptosis during the first postnatal week. By 3 weeks (when most chondrocytes are retaining D 469 del-COMP), inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage contribute to chondrocyte cell death by necroptosis. Importantly, by crossing the D 469 del-COMP mouse onto a Chop null background (Ddit 3 null), thereby eliminating Chop, the unfolded protein response was disrupted, thus alleviating both D 469 del-COMP intracellular retention and premature chondrocyte cell death. Chop therefore {{plays a significant role}} in processes that mediate D 469 del-COMP retention. Taken together, these results suggest that there may be an optimal window before the induction of significant D 469 del-COMP retention during which endoplasmic reticulum stress could be targeted...|$|E
