Although we observe a correlation between HDI, effects and effort in the health system, however, HDI is not correlated with the health system efficiency calculated as the ratio between effect and effort. This aspect shows that the elasticity of the effects of health system reported on the <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> (effort of the health system which is expressed as a percentage of GDP) decreases, as the increase of <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> in GDP.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how domestic, foreign, {{private and public}} investments affect income-inequality through financial intermediary dynamics of depth, efficiency, activity and size. With the exception of <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> efficiency, <b>financial</b> channels of depth and activity are good for the poor as they diminish estimated household income-inequality. Financial size {{does not have a}} significant income-redistributive effect. <b>Financial</b> <b>allocation</b> efficiency has a disequalizing effect on income-distribution; implying policies designed to improve the allocation of mobilized funds to economic agents only benefit the rich {{to the detriment of the}} poor. The use of financial and investment dimensions previously missing in the literature provide new insights into the two contrasting theories in the finance-inequality nexus. ...|$|R

40|$|Structural Funds for the {{programming}} period 2007 - 2013 : a critical analysis on <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> among Regions of Member States Objectives - The recent European Commission’s implementing regulation for the Structural and Cohesion Funds 2007 - 2013 establishes criteria for defining the Regions eligible for {{funding from the}} Structural Funds. Moreover it identifies the objectives to be reached during {{the programming}} period. The general objectives of the Structural policies consist in speeding up the convergence of the least-developed Member States and regions by improving conditions for growth and employment through higher quality investments in physical and human capital, innovation, environment and administrative efficiency. However, the indicators used to identify regions for funding mainly refer to GDP and population. Methods and Results The analysis uses a simulation model based on Regions of Member States <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> model. The results show that using indicators more coherent with the European Commission objectives {{would lead to a}} different funds allocation. Conclusions This paper tries to highlight the inconsistency of this process and, through the identification and use of alternative indicators, proposes some simulations in order to present a different and more coherent scenario of <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> of Structural Funds. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} how the Cohesion Policy of the EU is dealt with beyond policies and politics {{in one of its}} Member States, i. e. Romania.

The legacy left by the communist centralized system is still present in how the administration functions but also the fear of fraud has lead in some cases to excessive bureaucracy burdening the management of the Funds and so creating delays and dissatisfaction among the beneficiaries or possible beneficiaries...|$|R

40|$|The study {{assesses the}} role of globalization-fuelled {{regionalization}} policies on <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> efficiency in four economic and monetary regions in Africa for the period 1980 to 2008. Banking system and financial system efficiencies are used as dependent variables whereas seven bundled and unbundled globalization variables are employed as independent indicators. The bundling exercise is achieved by means of principal component analysis while the empirical evidence is based on interactive Fixed Effects regressions. The following findings are established. First, <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> efficiency is more sensitive to financial openness compared to trade openness and most sensitive to globalization. The relationship between allocation efficiency and globalization-fuelled regionalization policies is: (i) Kuznets or inverted U-shape in the UEMOA and CEMAC zones (evidence of decreasing returns to allocation efficiency from globalization-fuelled regionalization) and (ii) U-shape overwhelmingly in the COMESA and scantily in the EAC (increasing returns to allocation efficiency from globalization-fuelled regionalization). Established shapes are relevant to specific globalization dynamics within regions. 2 ̆ 018 Economic and monetary 2 ̆ 019 regions {{are more prone to}} surplus liquidity than purely economic regions.
