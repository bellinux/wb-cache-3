5|$|On December 4, 2008, Illinois State Representative Robert S. Molaro {{resigned}} {{after serving}} about 15 {{years in the}} state legislature, and was eligible to receive a public pension of about $64,000 per year based on the standard of 85% of his roughly $75,000 annual salary. Burke hired the newly retired Molaro for $12,000 for one month to write a 19-page white <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> Chicago's perennially under-funded pensions. When Molaro officially retired on January 1, 2009, his pensionable salary was annualized as $144,000, nearly doubling his pension. On August 16, 2012 Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a bill which limited the state's liability when former state legislators bolster their state pensions with short-term jobs with cities, counties and other local governments.|$|E
5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E

30|$|Authors with {{addresses}} in Spain made-up {{the largest}} number of authors listed on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between athletic performance and ACTN 3 (Table  3). Authors with Spanish addresses were equally likely to be listed on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between ACTN 3 and athletic performance as they were on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> ACTN 3 independent of athletic performance (Tables  3, 4). The achieved statistical power of these tests was low (1 – β[*]=[*] 0.069).

However, authors with addresses in Norway were as likely as authors with USA addresses to be found on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  6).

5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.|$|E

30|$|Authors with {{addresses}} in Germany {{represented the}} largest {{proportion of the}} authors listed on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between athletic performance and MSTN (Table  3). No authors with German addresses were listed on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  3).

30|$|When all ACE {{papers were}} considered, the {{proportions}} of first authors, corresponding authors, and all authors with USA addresses were significantly smaller on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> athletic performance and ACE than on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> ACE independent of athletic performance (Table  2).|$|R
30|$|First, authors with {{addresses}} in Norway {{were never}} listed on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> {{the relationship between}} MSTN and athletic performance (Table  4). Consequently, they were disproportionately found listed on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  4). However, the sample size of authors with addresses in Norway was small (n[*]=[*] 10). Second, authors with addresses in the United Kingdom were equally likely as those with addresses in the USA to be found on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between DR and athletic performance (Table  6). However, probably because of small sample sizes, {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (Table  6). Third, authors that listed addresses in Germany were never found on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  3). As a consequence, authors with addresses in Germany were less likely than authors with USA addresses to be found on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  5). This was the only instance of authors with USA addresses having a significantly greater proportional representation on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between an innate factor and athletic performance. Last, authors with Japanese addresses were about twice as likely to be found on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the innate factors independent of athletic performance than on <b>papers</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  4). Nevertheless, authors with Japanese addresses were more likely than those with USA addresses to be found on the pooled sample of papers that examined the relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  6). Taken together, these patterns suggest that authors based in these countries were more likely than authors with USA addresses to publish papers that examined questions about the roles of these innate factors in athletic performance.|$|R

25|$|In 1891, the {{mineralogist}} Albert E. Foote {{presented the}} first scientific <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> the meteorites of Northern Arizona. Several years earlier, Foote had received an iron rock for analysis from a railroad executive. Foote immediately recognized the rock as a meteorite and led {{an expedition to}} search and retrieve additional meteorite samples. The team collected samples ranging from small fragments to over 600 pounds. Foote identified several minerals in the meteorites, including diamond, albeit of little commercial value. His paper to the Association for the Advancement of Science provided the first geological description of the crater to a scientific community.|$|E

500|$|Dugan {{changed from}} {{lighting}} design to sound design in 1967. The state of sound design {{at the time}} was mostly occasional sound effects performed live or played back on record players or tape machines. Dugan's first efforts in sound involved designing sound solutions for the Shakespeare festival in San Diego and for the American Conservatory Theatre (ACT) in San Francisco. Dugan's complex and atmospheric theatrical soundscapes led to a new title: during ACT's 1968–69 season, he was the first regional theatre person to be called a [...] "sound designer". He presented a <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> his sound design to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) at their 37th convention, and his paper was published in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society in December 1969. Dugan described a system in which the signals from three stereo tape players were routed to ten loudspeaker zones in the theater.|$|E
500|$|In 1845, amateur geologists William Guybon Atherstone and Andrew Geddes Bain {{discovered}} several fossils near Dassieklip, Cape Province, in the Bushmans River Valley. This was {{the first}} dinosaur find {{in all of the}} Southern Hemisphere and Africa. In 1849 and 1853, Bain sent some of the fossils to Richard Owen for identification. Among them was an upper jaw Bain referred to as the [...] "Cape Iguanodon", so the site was named [...] "Iguanodonhoek". Atherstone published a short <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> the discovery in 1857, but lamented in 1871 that it had thus far received no attention in London. Only in 1876 were a series of specimens from the collection named by Owen as Anthodon serrarius, basing the generic name on the resemblance of the teeth to a flower. The partial holotype skull BMNH 47337, the left jaw BMNH 47338, the matrix BMNH 47338 including bone fragments and impressions of the anterior skull, and the vertebrae BMNH 47337a were all assigned to Anthodon. In 1882, Othniel Charles Marsh assigned Anthodon to Stegosauridae based on BMNH 47338, and in 1890, Richard Lydekker found that although Anthodon was a pareiasaur, its teeth were {{similar to those of the}} Stegosauridae.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{version of}} the game also {{did not include the}} central star gravity well or the {{hyperspace}} feature; they were written by MIT graduate student and TMRC member Dan Edwards and Graetz respectively to add elements of a strategy to what initially was a shooter game of pure reflexes. The initial {{version of the}} hyperspace function was limited to three jumps, but carried no risk save possibly re-entering the game in a dangerous position; later versions removed the limit but added the increasing risk of destroying the ship instead of moving it. Additionally, during this development period, Kotok and Saunders created the gamepads for the game. The game was a multiplayer-only game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. Similarly, other proposed additions to the game such as a more refined explosion display upon the destruction of a spaceship and having the torpedoes also be affected by gravity had to be abandoned as there were not enough computer resources to handle them while smoothly running the game. With the added features and changes, Spacewar was essentially complete by late April 1962, and Russell and the other programmers shifted focus from developing the game to preparing to show it off to others such as at the MIT Science Open House in May. The group added a time limit, as well as a larger, second screen for viewers at the demonstration, and that same month Graetz presented a <b>paper</b> <b>about</b> the game, [...] "SPACEWAR! Real-Time Capability of the PDP-1", at the first meeting of the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society. The demonstration was a success, and the game proved very popular at MIT; the laboratory that hosted the PDP-1 soon banned play except during lunch and after working hours.|$|E
