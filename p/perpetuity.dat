5|$|Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, {{to build}} a new stone castle at Rochester. He {{established}} the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in <b>perpetuity.</b> William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained in the custody of the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|From 1882 to 1886, Glentoran used Ormeau Park {{as their}} home ground. They moved to Westbourne in Ballymacarrett {{for six years}} until 1892. They then moved to The Oval. Initially it was on Dee Street, however in 1903 The Oval's pitch was rotated 90 degrees to its current location. During the early 20th century, the land on which The Oval stood was given in <b>perpetuity</b> to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Daniel Dixon.|$|E

40|$|This article {{traces the}} Rules Against <b>Perpetuities</b> 2 ̆ 7 history, from its {{creation}} until the present, and discusses the reasons both for its existence and its decline, {{along with the}} rise of perpetual trusts. The article also provides the current status of the Rule in the states, which has continued to evolve. Part III of this article explains how the common law Rule works, and it discusses pre-Uniform Statutory Rule Against <b>Perpetuities</b> (USRAP) <b>perpetuities</b> law in Arkansas. Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s constitution forbids <b>perpetuities.</b> The Arkansas Supreme Court has interpreted this constitutional provision to mean that the common law Rule is law in Arkansas. Nonetheless, six out of eight states with similar constitutional provisions have enacted USRAP. Thus, the fourth and fifth parts of the article discuss USRAP and the effect that its enactment will have on Arkansas law. Appendix A sets out the text of USRAP. Appendix B includes a state-by-state summary of current <b>perpetuities</b> law. Appendix C is a subject index of the examples illustrating how USRAP works...|$|R

5|$|During the {{elections}} of 1866, Heliade Rădulescu won {{a seat in the}} Chamber as a deputy for the city of Târgovişte. As Cuza had been ousted from power by a coalition of political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join Nicolae Ionescu and other disciples of Simion Bărnuţiu in opposing the appointment of Carol of Hohenzollern as Domnitor and a proclamation stressing the <b>perpetuity</b> of the Moldo-Wallachian union. Speaking in Parliament, he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the Phanariote period. The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with a large majority.|$|E
5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city in <b>perpetuity.</b> The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in <b>perpetuity.</b> Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades more than half the states have either {{abolished}} or substantially weakened the traditional rule against <b>perpetuities.</b> The increased demand for perpetual trusts is widely attributed to the ability of such trusts to avoid federal wealth transfer taxes. Furthermore, recent empirical studies confirm a correlation between repeal of the rule against <b>perpetuities</b> (coupled with favorable state income tax treatment) and increased personal trust assets and average account size. This symposium article discusses the asymmetric benefits and drawbacks of perpetual trusts and concludes that the decline of the rule against <b>perpetuities</b> cannot be explained solely in terms of rational tax planning...|$|R

5|$|On 30 June 1852 the {{promoters}} of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was formed. The former Woking Common near Brookwood, {{owned by the}} Earl of Onslow, {{was chosen as the}} site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in <b>perpetuity</b> and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify detail of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started proselytising the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as Portuguese Christians, though they were Nestorian Christians who had only recently established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in <b>perpetuity</b> to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{ended with the}} Treaty of Winchester, late in 1153, which {{provided}} that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death. When Stephen died the next year, this became a lasting peace. In {{the last year of}} Stephen's reign, in mid-1154, Chesney acquired the right to operate a mint in the town of Newark, granted in <b>perpetuity.</b> But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long. Chesney also acquired the right of justice in the city of Lincoln, and was involved in the commercial life of his diocese, establishing a fair in the town of Banbury in 1154.|$|E
40|$|The Rule Against <b>Perpetuities</b> {{is dying}} an ignoble death. To attract trust {{business}} and the lawyers 2 ̆ 7 fees and trustees 2 ̆ 7 commissions that come with it, twenty states have abolished the Rule as applied to interests in trust. But the Rule Against <b>Perpetuities</b> {{is not the only}} rule of property law that bears on trust duration. Another is the rule against accumulations of income, which limits the timeframe during which a settlor may direct the trustee to accumulate and retain income in trust. For 200 years, the rule against accumulations of income has lurked in the shadow of its older and more distinguished cousin, the Rule Against <b>Perpetuities.</b> But with the race to abolish the Rule Against <b>Perpetuities,</b> the rule against accumulations of income may have newfound relevance. Perpetual trusts are more likely than ordinary trusts to involve accumulations of income in trust. Accordingly, the task for this short essay is to examine the lurking rule against accumulations of income and its potential impact on the 100 billion perpetual trust industry...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rule against}} <b>perpetuities</b> {{is closely related}} to another {{doctrine}} in the common law of property, the rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation. Both stem from an underlying principle or reference in the common law disapproving of restraints on property rights. [...] However, while a violation of the rule against <b>perpetuities</b> is also a violation of the rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation, the reciprocal is not true. As one has stated, [...] "The rule against <b>perpetuities</b> is an ancient, but still vital, rule of property law intended to enhance marketability of property interests by limiting remoteness of vesting." [...] For this reason, another court has declared that the provisions of the rule are predicated upon [...] "public policy" [...] and thus [...] "constitute non-waivable, legal prohibitions.|$|R
