30|$|Paid and unpaid {{overtime}} {{hours are}} calculated {{mainly on the}} basis of the yearly GSOEP while also the Microcensus enters the accounts for computations on recent years. The GSOEP contains information about the number of weekly overtime hours and its compensation form (compensated with time-off; <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> <b>partly</b> compensated with time-off; paid; not compensated at all). On that basis, the number of annual paid and unpaid overtime hours can be calculated. Problems arise due to the assignment of <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> overtime hours. Since 2001, these overtime hours can be assigned through information by the additional question of the number of paid overtime hours last month. With this information the otherwise undetermined cases of <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> overtime hours are made unambiguous, while the resulting fraction of paid hours among the ambiguous cases is extrapolated to previous years. Certain groups of employees (marginally employed, apprentices and employees with zero working hours, e.[*]g., on parental leave) do not work paid overtime according to their contract, which we take into account in the calculations.|$|R
50|$|The {{shares in}} a {{corporation}} may be issued <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> which renders {{the owner of}} those shares liability to the corporation for any calls on those shares up to the par value of the shares.|$|R
2500|$|Two years later, {{following}} {{a move to}} London, March finished his third novel, The Tallons, the second in his [...] "Pearl County" [...] series. Reviews in the UK were generally positive, {{more so than in}} the United States. Psychological problems that had already bothered him in Germany worsened in London, and he became a patient of psychoanalyst Edward Glover, who was able to cure March's throat paralysis, diagnosing it as a hysterical condition. (March dedicated The Tallons to him, [...] "as a slight recompense for the gray hairs I have put in his head".) While in London March became acquainted with a number of literary characters, leaving more of his Waterman work to his subordinates. In 1937, he returned to the US and within two years resigned his position to concentrate more on his writing, which by then was a full-time occupation; he had been <b>paid</b> <b>partly</b> in <b>stock</b> and could live well off the dividends. 1937, Simmonds notes, was an important year—it marked the high point of his productivity as a short-story writer, and the magazine The American Mercury took up Company K for a reprinting. In 1943, he completed his most ambitious and critically acclaimed novel, The Looking-Glass, the final book in his [...] "Pearl County" [...] series; Bert Hitchcock, literature professor at Auburn, called it March's [...] "finest literary achievement".|$|R
5000|$|Gold Reefs’ {{articles}} {{gave it a}} [...] "first and paramount lien" [...] (the {{right to}} retain possession) on all <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> shares held by any member for any debt owed to the company. Mr Zuccani held some <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> up shares. He also owned the only fully paid up shares issued by the company. He died insolvent. The company altered its articles by special resolution to create a lien on all fully paid shares (deleting the words in brackets of ‘upon all shares (not fully paid) held by such members’). Mr Allen, one of the executors of Mr Zuccani (trying to get money back) sued to get the fully paid shares’ value.|$|R
50|$|In {{that same}} year, the Air Force {{received}} two Sukhoi Su-27s and two Sukhoi Su-30s from Russia. The fighters were <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for in Indonesian palm oil. The purchase, however, {{did not include}} any weaponry. Seven KT-1B Korean basic trainers were also purchased.|$|R
50|$|Shares {{are most}} {{commonly}} issued fully paid, {{in which case}} the liability of the shareholders is limited to the amount paid on the shares; but they may also be issued <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> with unlimited liability, subject to guarantee, or some other form.|$|R

50|$|Cash {{calls were}} made on holders of <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> cotton mill shares, which even then were deemed worthless. John Brown joined R J Tilney and became a partner because Grace Brothers, for whom he had worked, closed in Liverpool in {{anticipation}} of the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Constable’s {{position}} {{remained the}} only regular full-time or part-time position until 1931, when the municipal council authorized {{the appointment of}} a night policeman. It was the duty of this policeman, whose salary was <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for by the local merchants, to patrol the streets of Ladner at night.|$|R
50|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>paid</b> {{shares in}} a company are ones in respect of which only a partial payment (or deposit) has been made, with the {{understanding}} that as the company requires more funds, calls will be made from time to time until the shares are fully paid, when no further calls can be made.|$|R
5000|$|Christ Church, Chatburn was <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for by Dixon Robinson and {{his older}} brother, William. [...] Extensions to the church in 1882-83 were {{designed}} by his son, Frederick Josias Robinson. The first perpetual curacy was given to his brother-in-law Rev Robert Ingram. There are many Ingram and Robinson memorials in the church.|$|R
25|$|In the UK {{there was}} {{initially}} a widespread {{belief that a}} corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> as where shares are <b>partly</b> <b>paid,</b> the investor would be liable {{for the remainder of}} the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.|$|R
25|$|Funding for {{national}} parks is complex, but {{the full cost}} of each park authority is funded from central government funds. In the past this was <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for by local authorities, and refunded to them from the government to varying degrees. In 2003/2004, the park authorities received around £35.5 million of central government funding.|$|R
50|$|For {{a limited}} {{liability}} company, {{the legal right}} of the company to make calls and the obligation to pay them ceases when shares become fully paid. In Australia, a mining exploration company may be formed as a no liability company, which {{is not able to}} make calls on shares, even on <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> shares.|$|R

5000|$|The {{church was}} built between 1865 and 1867 to a design by the Chester {{architect}} John Douglas. [...] It {{was one of}} Douglas's earliest churches {{and is in the}} High Victorian style of Gothic Revival architecture. The site for the church was given by the River Dee Company who also <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for it. [...] It was consecrated on 15 October 1867.|$|R
60|$|To {{provide that}} {{taxation}} shall fall entirely on income, {{and not at}} all on capital, is beyond the power of any system of fiscal arrangements. There is no tax which is not <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> from what would otherwise have been saved; no tax, the amount of which, if remitted, would be wholly employed in increased expenditure, and no part whatever laid by as an addition to capital. All taxes, therefore, are in some sense <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> out of capital; and in a poor country it is impossible to impose any tax which will not impede the increase of the national wealth. But, in a country where capital abounds and the spirit of accumulation is strong, this effect of taxation is scarcely felt. To take from capital by taxation what emigration would remove, or a commercial crisis destroy, is only to do what either of those causes would have done—namely, to make a clear space for further saving.|$|R
5000|$|Payment of Dividend: Payment of Dividend {{does not}} have direct impact on value of {{derivatives}} {{but it does have}} indirect impact through stock price. We know that if dividend is <b>paid,</b> <b>stock</b> goes ex-dividend therefore price of stock will go down which will result into increase in Put premium and decrease in Call premium.|$|R

It is not on the person from whom we buy, but on all those who buy from us, that a portion of our customs duties spontaneously falls.” Explain and examine the reasons for this conclusion.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there may}} be capital gains or profit on sale {{implications}} on the subsequent sale of these shares. In general, the cost base of the bonus shares is usually zero, but if the bonus issue is taxable as a dividend, then the cost base is generally the taxed dividend amount, plus any calls on <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> bonus shares. The acquisition date is the date of issue.|$|R

He collected a large mathematical library in his villa in the Stockholm suburb of Djursholm. The house and its contents was donated to the Academy of Sciences as the Mittag-Leffler Institute.|$|R
50|$|Ladas were briefly {{popular in}} New Zealand in the 1980s. Meat, dairy and {{fertiliser}} exports to Russia were wholly or <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for with Belarus tractors, Stolichnaya vodka and Lada cars. The New Zealand Dairy Board were distributors for Lada vehicles.Some Ladas, {{even those of}} the 1970s, can still be seen on New Zealand roads (especially in rural areas and offshore islands) but are increasingly rare.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, the {{cemetery}} was desecrated {{just like the}} synagogue, with the grave stones and buildings being partly destroyed. The cemetery was sold in 1943 but confiscated by the US military in 1945. It was {{handed over to the}} JSRO and renovations were carried out, <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for by the municipality of Hainsfarth. The cemetery is now in private possession with the stipulation that it is cared for.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum was}} built between 1824 and 1826 by the {{architect}} Samuel Vaucher {{on behalf of}} the Société des arts. It was <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for with funds that General Simon Rath (1766-1819) had bequeathed to his sisters, Jeanne-Françoise and Henriette Rath, for such a purpose; the remainder was paid by the state of Geneva. Vaucher designed the building as a temple of the muses, inspired by Ancient Greek temples.|$|R
25|$|In May 1989 one of Haughey's lifelong friends, former {{government}} minister Brian Lenihan, underwent {{a liver transplant}} which was <b>partly</b> <b>paid</b> for through fundraising by Haughey. The Moriarty tribunal found that of the £270,000 collected in donations for Brian Lenihan, no more than £70,000 ended up being spent on Lenihan's medical care. The tribunal identified one specific donation of £20,000 for Lenihan that was surreptitiously appropriated by Haughey, who took steps to conceal this transaction.|$|R
