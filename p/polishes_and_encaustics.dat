50|$|Nancy Azara (born October 13, 1939) is an American sculptor. Her work is carved, {{assembled}} and highly painted wood with {{gold and silver}} leaf <b>and</b> <b>encaustic.</b> The wood, the paint and the layers {{that make up the}} sculpture record a journey of memory, images and ideas.|$|R
50|$|Goniodsky {{experiments}} with mixing oils, acrylics, collage, <b>and</b> <b>encaustic.</b> Her paintings are layers upon layers of paint, lines and collage elements. Her work is both contemporary and antique, often approaching monochrome sepia. The theater {{has a tremendous}} influence on her work and is evident in most of Goniodsky's paintings.|$|R
50|$|De Forest paints with acrylic paint, {{oil paint}} <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> (melted wax) on canvas. Dreams, things she notices in passing and even {{commercials}} have provided inspiration for her painting. De Forest cites as inspiration Andy Warhol, Georgia O'Keeffe, Pablo Picasso, Grant Wood, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and Henri Matisse, contributing to her assortment of styles.|$|R
30|$|If fresco was the {{technique}} {{commonly used in}} Greco-Roman wall paintings, it would be reasonable to think that ancient Greeks and Romans had a name to designate this technique and to distinguish from other painting techniques used in wall painting at that time, such as encaustic, whose names (wax <b>and</b> <b>encaustic)</b> are often found in ancient literature.|$|R
40|$|The thesis has two purposes: to {{evaluate}} the difference between oil, acrylic, gouache, <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> paint {{for the purpose of}} glazing and to integrate engineering and artistic principles into this thesis. My final evaluation across the four paints is that oil has the highest performing glaze. I believe it is the best glazer because time is not a constraint for me as an artist. If an artist has a time constraint on their painting, I recommend using acrylic mixed with an acrylic polymer medium as a glaze because the drying time is much faster than oil. I discovered that gouache <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> paint do not serve as good glazers. I believe that by evaluating oil, acrylic, gouache <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> paint for their engineering and artistic merit, I was able to convince my readers the importance of combining both engineering and art {{for the purpose of this}} thesis. The background knowledge on the manufacturing of paint from pigment helps me evaluate the minute differences in the four paints such as drying time and viscosity. I achieved a thorough evaluation as well as explanation of why I combined art and engineering through an interview with a modern artist, Dave Ghildarducci and a visit to Golden Artist Colors manufacturer. Recommendations for further improvements to this project include using a different brand of gouache paint, delving into the differences between artist and student grade paint, and looking into both glazing and applying opaque layers of paint...|$|R

5000|$|Winner Jumalon is a multi-award winning Filipino {{contemporary}} visual artist {{based in}} Manila. His works of oil <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> on canvas {{have been described}} as [...] "late capitalist masterpieces marred by illogical marks, haze, and aggregations of reality that not only displaces portraiture as the totemic symbols of power and status but questions the formation of identity itself as the trap where man cannot go forward".|$|R
50|$|Nicole Gordon (born May 19, 1976) is a Chicago-based {{artist whose}} {{paintings}} draw on images from highly stylized scenic art, such as 19th-century French wallpaper, and Medieval and Renaissance landscapes, to create anachronistic and often whimsical paintings with bright and vibrant colors. Her work is often mixed media, combining oil painting <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> techniques with more traditionally craft-associated {{materials such as}} glitter, and often incorporates installed sculptures that extend the paintings into the viewer's space.|$|R
5000|$|His {{works are}} abstract. Ksiazek used oil paints <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> {{painting}} on large canvasses {{to build up}} layers with thin washes and impastos, then scratches, splatters, gouges and picks at the paint to create incised geometric forms and lines. His works took {{up to six months}} to complete, and were usually untitled. He, personally, disliked to call his paintings abstract. If forced to label his work, he would use the term, [...] "Constructionist." ...|$|R

50|$|It is {{believed}} that Boynton produced the first paintings in true fresco <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> painting in the San Francisco area. Examples of mural paintings done by him in these media are to be seen at Mills College, in the Faculty Club at Berkeley, and at the California School of Fine Arts. His paintings in oil, tempera, and pastel are in the permanent collections of The California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Mills College Art Gallery, the M. H. De Young Museum, and elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Brooker {{works on}} canvas and paper, using {{acrylics}} {{as a base}} coat and mixing oils, oil stick <b>and</b> <b>encaustic.</b> He has been influenced by both graffiti art and music, and has moved from semi-figurative art to abstract art. He credits abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky's book Concerning the Spiritual in Art (1912) as an influence on his work. [...] One {{of the reasons why}} Brooker moved to abstraction was that he wanted to paint the joyous and spiritual aspects of African-American life, but could not find figurative symbols for doing so.|$|R

50|$|Kallinikos studied {{many types}} of iconography, like fresco <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> {{painting}} which he learned in Mount Sinai during his visit in 1967. He started by painting with oil paint, while he later used more often eggs for the mixing of the colours. Paintings of his exist in many churches and monasteries in Cyprus and in other countries. His most important murals with the fresco technique are situated in the katholikon of the Stavrovouni Monastery. From 2006 and after he hpainted only using the encaustic painting technique. Moreover, his works have been featured in various exhibitions worldwide.|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} was notably {{used in the}} Fayum mummy portraits from Egypt around 100-300 AD, in the Blachernitissa and other early icons, {{as well as in}} many works of 20th-century North American artists, including Jasper Johns, Tony Scherman, Mark Perlman, and Fernando Leal Audirac. Kut-kut, a lost art of the Philippines, employs sgraffito <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> techniques. It was practiced by the indigenous tribe of Samar island around 1600 to 1800. Artists in the Mexican muralism movement, such as Diego Rivera and Jean Charlot sometimes used encaustic painting. The Belgian artist James Ensor also experimented with encaustic.|$|R

5000|$|The “Ruabon Brick & Terra Cotta Ltd." [...] or [...] "Jenks' Terracotta Works" [...] (or [...] "Gwaith Jinks") was {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Ruabon-Wrexham road (off Tatham Road) but with its original clay pit to the east of the Ruabon-Wrexham road, separated from the Monk & Newell clay pit by the Afon Goch. Founded by the Hague family of the Gardden in about 1883 and managed by Henry Jenks, it produced bricks, chimney pots, finials, cornices <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> tiles. It was taken over by Dennis' in the 1960s but closed in the mid-1970s. The works site is now an industrial estate as is the original clay pit.|$|R

This space features a fine tessellated <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> tiled floor, which continues in less decorative form into {{the entrance hall}} and dining room. The entrance hall is punctuated by an arcade supported on heavy masonry columns with stylised ionic capitals, initiating the stair and forming a walkway through the space, indicating the entrances to other rooms. The bifurcating dog leg stair features very fine cedar joinery of carved timber balusters joined by a carved panel below the handrail. Heavy columns flanking the stair are met by the expanding lower treads and the wreathed handrail.|$|R
5000|$|An abiding {{concern in}} her oeuvre {{has been the}} perceptual process: “My own {{interest}} in visual perception {{and its relationship to}} society is always fundamental to the work I create. To varying degrees both my digital <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> works address situations where cognition conditions conceptualization, and where a priori concepts influence the accuracy of one’s cognition. I am interested in the social and philosophical implications that exist when one realizes that ‘seeing is not believing’. Ultimately, I intend the social impact of my work to be felt through its induction of destabilizing or stabilizing our perceptual complacence, since it is within the boundaries of our perceptual framework that we interpret and act within the world.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Shelton's active {{involvement}} in archaeology began in 1927. In an unpublished paper, [...] "22 years of excavation", Shelton {{wrote that he}} researched ancient Coventry {{when he was in}} hospital for nine weeks with a fractured right leg. Later during convalescence, mobile on crutches, he watched the builders Messrs. Harris and Sons excavating {{on the site of the}} Hare and Squirrel, in Cheylesmore, only a short distance from his home in Little Park Street. His record of the excavation, later lost in the fire in his library during the Blitz, refers to finding sandstone walls, a medieval stone-lined well, fourteenth century pottery <b>and</b> <b>encaustic</b> tiles, which he interpreted as evidence of a chapel of Greyfriars, built about 1234.|$|R

His paintings utilize acrylic paint, oil paint, <b>and</b> <b>encaustic,</b> {{as well as}} resin, grit, house-paint, and varnish; according to a review of his 2015 show at the ARTIS Gallery, recent work [...] "rides roughshod over any conventions of neatness and grace, using bold form, often black, and adorning his surface with found objects and collage." [...] Of his own work, the artist says, [...] "I suppose, that’s what my painting’s about; life itself is terribly dangerous, terribly cruel, terribly rewarding. All these things at once. This multi-faceted, wonderful jewel - which we all live with and die with - is there. We’re saddled with it, like it or not." ...|$|R
