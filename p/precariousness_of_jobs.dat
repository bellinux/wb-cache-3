40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{articulation}} between {{the form of}} the division of maintenance and servicing labor and the social classification of inhabitants. Based upon fieldwork conducted in Buenos Aires {{in the second half of}} the 2000 s, it analyzes how the middle classes inhabiting condominiums created during the latest wave of real estate developments have appropriated equipment and services that were until then the privilege of wealthier groups (front desk, tennis courts, gym, etc.) The article shows that the growing <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> among the employees who provide these goods and services has been a condition of this cultural appropriation. What defines these cheap luxuries? And what does it mean to have access to them at home? Fieldwork suggests that access to these goods and services is not the same as in the case of wealthier groups, and that the way in which the households view the precarious condition of condominium employees varies according to which fraction of the middle classes they belong to...|$|E
40|$|Informality is {{ubiquitous}} in most developing countries. Understanding the informal economy is therefore {{of utmost importance}} from a political, economic and social point of view. Paradoxically, despite its economic importance, knowledge is extremely limited regarding the informal economy. It remains largely unrecognized by researchers, is neglected by politicians, and is even negatively perceived as {{it is meant to}} disappear with development. This book aims to amend this situation by presenting recent high level research which studies the informal sector and informal employment. Fresh research into this subject is presented through empirical analysis which covers Asia, Africa and Latin America. Each chapter relies on data and a detailed knowledge of the context of the countries studied in order to question the dominant schools of thought on the origins and causes of informality. The results provide interesting insights into the constraints faced by informal workers, the dynamics of the informal economy and its link with poverty issues. On the basis of the evidences provided by results adequate policies could be defined to address informality issues. The principal characteristics of the informal sector testify to some profound similarities between developing countries: low qualifications and the <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> mediocre incomes and working conditions, atomization of production units and lack of articulation with the formal economy, etc. This general statement does not contradict the observation that there is a high level of heterogeneity in the sector and in informal employment within each country, confirmed by several chapters in this work. In the absence of a sufficient number of job creations, the informal sector essentially constitutes a refuge for workers seeking and is here to stay in the short and medium term, even in emerging countries...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} to measure precarious employment with a multidimensional approach. The adjusted multidimensional precariousness rate employed to measure job precariousness is calculated on a counting approach and exhibit several advantages, including its decomposability {{according to the}} relative contribution to total <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> different dimensions and sub-populations. For illustrative purposes, the methodology {{is applied to the}} Spanish case using microdata from the Encuesta de Estructura Salarial (Wage Structure Survey) and considering three <b>precariousness</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> (low wages, fixed-term contracts and part-time work). The evidence obtained shows that {{at the beginning of the}} economic crisis there was an increase in the incidence and intensity <b>of</b> <b>precariousness</b> for new <b>jobs</b> created in the Spanish economy. Moreover, obtained evidence shows that the incidence of precarious employment is particularly high in certain economic sectors and for females. This study has received funding from Spain’s Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project CSO 2014 - 55780 -C 3 - 2 -P) and from Autonomous Community of Madrid and European Commission (Project S 2015 /HUM- 3416 -DEPOPOR-CM) ...|$|R

40|$|Using a differences-in-differences {{approach}} and controlling for individual unobserved heterogeneity, we evaluate {{the impact of}} a 1999 law that granted all workers with children younger than 7 years old protection against a layoff if the worker had previously asked for a work-week reduction due to family responsibilities. As only mothers took advantage of these arrangements, we find that after the law, employers were: (i) more likely to let childbearing-aged working women go relative to their male counterparts; (ii) less likely to promote childbearing-aged women into good jobs; and (iii) less likely to hire childbearing-aged women. In addition, employers were able to pass {{at least part of the}} cost to childbearing-aged women through lower wages, and the amount passed to workers increased with the <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>job.</b> Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the effect on employment transitions is mainly driven by low-skilled workers and those in blue-collar jobs, while the effect on wages holds across all groups. Evidence that the substitution away from (good) jobs widens over time suggests employer learning. These results are robust to the use of different specifications and placebo tests...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the sixties, {{numerous}} Japanese contractors {{have been}} active in heavy industry work in Algeria and other North African countries. This has opened a large market for Japanese-French liaison interpreters. Such interpreters are hired by specialized agencies in Europe and Japan. With one or two exceptions, they are Japanese nationals. Most of them are young and have no previous experience as interpreters. Neither are they properly briefed before they are sent to the site, but they become proficient in their work with experience. Their tasks range from interpreting at various levels to translation and even participation in negotiations and report drafting. Material working conditions are comparatively good, but the duration of contracts is short and long-term stability of employment is uncertain. The <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> interpreting <b>jobs</b> and the temporary nature of the Japanese companies' contracting work in North Africa make this activity a provisional and highly volatile one. Japanese liaison interpreters in North Africa do not feel like professional interpreters and do not aspire to become professionals...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Along with {{fast-food}} workers, retail {{workers are}} capturing {{the attention of}} the public and the media with the Fight for 15. Like fast-food workers, retail workers are underpaid, and fewer than 5 percent of them belong to unions. In Hard Sell, Peter Ikeler traces the low-wage, largely nonunion character of U. S. retail through the history and ultimate failure of twentieth-century retail unionism. He asks pivotal questions about twenty-first-century capitalism: Does the nature of retail work make collective action unlikely? Can working conditions improve {{in the absence of a}} union? Is worker consciousness changing in ways that might encourage or further inhibit organizing? Ikeler conducted interviews at New York City locations of two iconic department stores―Macy 2 ̆ 7 s and Target. Much of the book’s narrative unfolds from the perspectives of these workers in America’s most unequal city. When he speaks to workers, Ikeler finds that the Macy’s organization displays an adversarial relationship between workers and managers and that Target is infused with a 2 ̆ 2 teamwork 2 ̆ 2 message that enfolds both parties. Macy’s workers identify more with their jobs and are more opposed to management, yet Target workers show greater solidarity. Both groups, however, are largely unhappy with the pay and <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> their <b>jobs.</b> Combined with workplace-generated feelings of unity and resistance, these grievances provide promising inroads to organizing that could help take the struggle against inequality beyond symbolic action to real economic power...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to design a multiagent system (MAS) {{simulation}} to model the French labor market. We departed from an economic model proposed by Cahuc and Carcillo to model the introduction <b>of</b> a new <b>job</b> contract into the labor market. We designed a specific methodology to convert this equation-based model to an agent-based model, and calibrated our MAS to reproduce the data found in the economic simulations. As we observed the same tendencies found in the former model, a new dimension emerged from the agent-based simulation: an increase of oscillations for the characteristic rates, revealing an increase <b>of</b> <b>precariousness</b> (<b>job</b> instability) due to the new type of contract. Moreover, our simulation enabled us to detect and correct some flaws of the Cobb–Douglas type of matching function. These encouraging results led us to continue in that direction, where several extensions of our model can be proposed, including the move to a large-scale simulation framework...|$|R
40|$|This essay, {{published}} {{in conjunction with}} the release of Harun Farocki’s film documenting the work of ‘creatives’ in Hamburg, A New Product [Ein Neues Produkt] (2012), takes a critical look at the contemporary world of work through the prism of claims made about the purported ‘immateriality’ of such labour. Power was invited to contribute this essay on the basis of her research into the future of work. Power draws upon the work of Franco ‘Bifo’ Beradi and Silvia Federici to examine the claims made for the physical and psychological impact of work that directly engages communicative, linguistic and creative skills. She examines the relationship between material and immaterial labour, and philosophical arguments about the relationship between the body and the mind. As a way of overcoming both old and new binaries, Power argues that the labouring body needs to be placed in the centre of any discussion of the supposedly ‘non-physical’ nature of much contemporary service work. Here, feminist scholarship on the relationship between social and human reproduction, where both can be seen as inextricably linked forms of ‘work’, is key to overcoming the re-emergence of old binaries. Power researched statistics for global employment tendencies, as well as the structural role of unemployment in ensuring the increasing <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>jobs.</b> She deployed these data to suggest a way beyond both the mind/body split and the idea that the working class is no longer the subject of history. She relates feminist writing to contemporary ideas of precarious and immaterial, knowledge and language-based employment, thus linking up supposedly disembodied, immaterial types of work with embodied care work to present a new and positive image of the social whole. This essay forms part of Power’s project on contemporary labour, which has included a series on the topic for The Guardian (2013) ...|$|R

40|$|In Precarious Life. The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Judith Butler {{poses the}} {{question}} if adequate representation of human vulnerability is possible {{against the background}} of media representations of violence and suffering during the Iraq war. She takes Emmanuel Levinas's concept of the "precarious other" as her starting point. In addition to Levinas's sense of the face, Butler also considers the sense of hearing or the acoustic mediation of vulnerability, and she asks for media that could mediate the vulnerability that is (according Levinas, and to herself) at the core of humanity: "One would need to hear the face as it speaks in something other than language to know the <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> life that is at stake. But what media will let us know and feel that frailty, know and feel at the limits of representation as it is currently cultivated and maintained?" (151). I propose that the portrayal of the suffering and <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> the other are created and mediated in some contemporary Performing Arts. Further, I propose the <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> the other appears in a profound manner when they are represented, not in a primarily visual manner, but by appealing to and involving the spectators' other senses, such as the sense of smell, hearing, body perception. From the enormous body of contemporary theatre works that employ the spectator's senses, I choose pieces by Elfriede Jelinek Meg Stuart, Wajdi Mouawad, and Christoph Marthaler. Their performances are multi-sensory encounters with the <b>precariousness</b> <b>of</b> the other, and, as "postdramatic" performances, they are all situated at the edge of drama, in music theatre. In the following, I first introduce Levinas's ethics, a key point of departure for both Butler's and my own work. Secondly, I elaborate on how I translate it in performances of the precarious. Thirdly, I discuss three examples from the international context of theater performances that engage human vulnerability especially strongly...|$|R
