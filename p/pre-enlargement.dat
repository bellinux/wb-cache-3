40|$|The {{relative}} poverty measure {{is the most}} prominent and most–quoted of the EU social inclusion indicators. This paper argues that, while pragmatically defensible in the <b>pre–enlargement</b> setting, the estimates and relative rankings the below– 60 %–of–median–income measure produces in the enlarged EU context is stretching its validity, credibility and hence legitimacy as a prime indicator to an untenable degree. We {{argue that there is}} a need for a better grounded and in the present context more credible poverty standard, complementing and possibly replacing the {{relative poverty}} line. The principal problem with the relative poverty line, as it is currently used, is that it precludes the possible existence of ‘absolute ’ or ‘primary ’ poverty as this is conventionally understood. In the <b>pre–enlargement</b> context it could be taken for granted, for all practical purposes, that vital functionings like adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter were by and large met, hence allowing for a fully relative poverty threshold conveniently defined as some percentage of mean equivalized income. We argue that this is no longer the case in the enlarged EU context. This context requires a measure that keeps with the notion that poverty is essentially relative in advanced economies while at the...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{of voting}} {{patterns}} in the Council of the European Union (EU) have increased since voting records in this institution have become more readily available. This paper builds on earlier work and explores coalition-formation and voting in the Council of the EU for the EU- 15 (i. e., between 1995 and 2004), by analyzing cleavage patterns based on voting records for this institution. Focusing on the <b>pre-enlargement</b> phase, the paper provides new insights into earlier member state voting behavior in the Council {{on the basis of}} a range of independent variables, including governments’ absolute and relative positions on the left-right policy dimension, pro-integration sentiments among domestic publics, governments’ positions as either net beneficiaries or net payers into the EU budget and finally, number of votes in the Council. In methodological terms, we treat vote decisions as panel data and report adjusted standard errors for country-based clusters, using ordered probit regression to explain the prope nsity of EU member states to vote ‘yes’, abstain from voting, or vote ‘no’ in the Council. The ordered probit analysis used to explore the potential relevance of these dimensions provides insights that at times confirm, but also partially contradict, earlier findings on this topic. We notably find strong evidence for a North-South cleavage <b>pre-enlargement,</b> a significant role for the Presidency and moderate evidence for the relevance of public opinion and government left-right positioning in Council voting behavior...|$|E

40|$|Within <b>pre-enlargement</b> Europe, Italy records one of {{the widest}} {{employment}} rate gaps between highly and poorly educated women, as well {{one of the}} largest differences in the share, among working women, of public sector employment. Building on these stylized facts and using the Longitudinal Survey of Italian Households (ILFI), we investigate the working trajectories of three cohorts of Italian women born between 1935 and 1964 and observed from their first job until they are in their forties. We use mainly, but not exclusively, event history analysis in order to identify the main factors that influence entry into and exit from paid work over the life course. Our results suggest that in the Italian context, where employment protection policies have also been used as surrogate measures to favour reconciliation between family and work, and where traditional gender norms still persist, education is so important for women's employment decisions because it represents an investment in 'reconciliation' and 'work legitimacy' over and above investment in human capital...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concisely}} reviews what we {{know about}} the experience of an enlarging European Union with free movement of workers within its borders.

From the sending countries 2 ̆ 019 perspective the risks of out-migration lie in skill shortages in affected occupations or sectors as well as the potential (in) stability of their public finances, whereas the potential benefits may materialize through brain circulation.

A main aim of the paper is to discuss {{the extent to which the}} new EU member states of Eastern Europe display differences and similarities with the other countries of the EU. We find that the Eastern European countries are rather heterogeneous. The Czech Republic and Hungary are not dissimilar to the countries of North-Western Europe; by contrast, households in Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland closely resemble Southern European households.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of the 2004 enlargement and of the 1998 - 2002 accession negotiations on the Common Agri-cultural Policy (CAP) reform. In contrast to the dominant liberal institutional political economy models that explain <b>pre-enlargement</b> CAP reforms in terms of the negative trade related policy externalities, the common budget expenses and the spe-cific role played by the common institutional setting, a critical re-alist explanatory model is proposed. In accordance with the model, the reforms were facilitated by the conflicting interests and the differences in capacity of the capital fixed to agricultural pro-duction in the member states and the candidate countries. The capacity of the agro-capital is defined by comparing the agri-cultural production structures, which were {{in the case of the}} old member states sustaining high levels of the fixed capital and which were in the case of the candidate countries, on average, underdeveloped and under-capitalized. The model is supported by the empirical analysis of the CAP reform and the accession negotiations process...|$|E

We explore sigma- and beta-convergence at a highly disaggregated regional level using spatial and non-spatial techniques. Furthermore, we measure the level of income inequality and decompose it {{by means of the}} Theil index into between country and within country contributions to overall income inequality. The results show that the speed of convergence among regions in the EU is painfully slow. Furthermore, there is a distinct difference between convergence processes at the regional and at the national level. Especially in the EU- 10, the catching-up at the national scale seems to be driven by some growth centers, mainly capital regions. This causes tendencies to divergence at the regional scale. Tests for spatial autocorrelation reveal that regions are strongly affected in their development by neighbouring regions...|$|E

40|$|This article {{uses the}} episode of EU {{enlargement}} in 2004 {{as a natural}} experiment to identify the trade effect of declining border barriers across otherwise well integrated markets. Despite the fact that traditional trade policy measures (tariffs, quantitative restrictions) were already eliminated for most industrial goods in trade between the <b>pre-enlargement</b> EU- 15 countries and eight of the countries that entered the EU in 2004 (EU- 8) 2 as well as among the EU- 8 themselves, EU enlargement is shown to have caused a significant trade creation.

Technology-intensive industries benefitted most strongly from enlargement, and a significant anticipatory effect can also be detected for 2003. These findings highlight the importance of non-policy related border barriers to trade and may also prove useful in assessing the potential for trade integration in the current EU candidate countries.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the factors}} associated with poverty among young people across 13 countries of the <b>pre-enlargement</b> European Union, and examines how these factors differ between countries. Previous {{research has shown that}} young people in most European countries face a higher-than-average risk of poverty; this is to be expected, since young adulthood is a time when people undergo rapid transitions in multiple spheres (education; the labour market; the family), many of which may pre-dispose the young person to poverty. Here, we use data from the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), making use of random effects models and discrete time hazard regressions to examine the role of several factors on a young person's probability of being poor; and on his or her probability of entering and exiting poverty. We also carry out parallel analysis using measures of non-monetary deprivation. Our results show that while many factors are correlated with young people's risks of poverty or deprivation, the largest risk factor by far is moving out of the parental home. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the European Union has increased concerns {{about the role of}} generous welfare transfers in attracting migrants. This paper explores the issue of welfare migration across the 15 countries of the <b>pre-enlargement</b> Union and finds a significant but small effect of the generosity of welfare on migration decisions. This effect, however, is still large enough to distort the distribution of migration flows and, possibly, offset the potential benefits of migration as an inflow of mobile labour into countries with traditionally sedentary native workers. A possible way to eliminate these distortions is the harmonisation of welfare {{at the level of the}} Union. The second part of the paper estimates the costs and benefits of what could be a first step in this direction: the introduction of a uniform European minimum income. The results show that, for a realistic minimum income threshold, the new system would cost about three quarters of what is currently spent on housing and social assistance benefits. Despite its reasonable cost, the distribution of net donors and net receivers across countries is such that the actual implementation of this system would be politically problematic...|$|E
40|$|Notwithstanding the {{numerous}} applications of fuzzy logic in several fields of economics, {{it is surprising}} that, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, so very few applications have been made in modelling approximations of subjective economic variables, such as confidence, satisfaction or even expectations, by objective ones, such as unemployment, output or inflation. This gap in the literature is accompanied by a lack on the availability of data concerning those subjective variables. Given that one of the main concerns of fuzzy logic is to capture approximate rather than exact forms of reasoning, and this also characterises many economic situations, such as in fact forming intrinsically subjective measures of confidence, this logic can and should indeed be used to understand how some of those subjective measures can be approximated by objective ones. This task is accomplished in the paper by the use of data on consumer confidence and on the unemployment rate for the <b>pre-enlargement</b> fifteen European Union member states. The results indicate the clear importance of unemployment on confidence, which is a result that should be taken into account when analysing policy-making that, from a na and/or easy viewpoint, considers confidence as a relevant variable but ignores unemployment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors influencing young people's {{decision to leave}} the parental home, focusing {{on the role of}} income: the young person's own income, and the income of his or her parents. It takes a comparative perspective, comparing countries across the <b>pre-enlargement</b> European Union. In all groups of countries, the young person's own income is positively associated with the probability of leaving home. However, the effects of parental income are more complex. Everywhere, higher parental income is associated with a lower likelihood of leaving home to live with a partner at young ages, and a greater likelihood at older ages. But whereas in Nordic countries, higher parental incomes accelerate home-leaving to partnership at all ages after the late teens, this effect is not seen until a much later age in Southern Europe, and not until after age 35 for Southern European men. This is consistent with existing theory about cross-country differences in the nature of family ties, suggesting that parents preferences for independence versus family closeness differ between countries, and contribute (together with differences in young people's socio-economic situations) to the widely differing patterns of living arrangements observed across Europe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic {{consequences of the}} diversion of migration ﬂows away from Germany towards the UK {{in the course of}} the EUâs Eastern Enlargement. The EU has agreed transitional periods for the free movement of workers with the new member states from Central and Eastern Europe. The selective application of migration restrictions during the transitional periods has resulted in a reversal of the <b>pre-enlargement</b> allocation of migration ﬂows from the new member states across the EU. Based on a forecast of the migration potential under the conditions of free movement and of the transitional arrangements, we employ a CGE model with imperfect labour markets to analyse the macroeconomic eﬀects of this diversion process. We ﬁnd that EU Eastern enlargement has increased in the GDP per capita in the UK substantially, but that the diversion of migration ﬂows towards the UK has reduced wage gains and the decline in unemployment there. The eﬀects of the EU Eastern enlargement are less favourable for Germany, but the diversion of migration ﬂows has protected workers there against a detrimental impact on wages and unemployment.

40|$|Despite {{the general}} {{improvement}} in the EU’s labour market performance, there are still large differences between individual countries. And {{there are differences in}} some fields between the <b>pre-enlargement</b> EU Member States and the recently acceded Member States. One explanation for these differences may be the predominance of former socialist countries with centrally planned economies among new member states. The article deals with the results of the ad hoc labour market survey of the European Commission. One of its subjects is the flexible use of labour. The main findings are: A working week of between 35 and 40 hours, distributed more or less evenly over the five working days, is the rule for the majority of employees. Part-time work is still dominated by women. Overtime is relatively common for most of the full-time employed. When asked if they would be prepared to accept more flexible working time, the interviewees do not favour all possible types of flexibility to the same extent. The most favoured model is either lengthening or shortening the regular working day. In the former socialist countries people work longer hours and they are more flexible with respect to how far they have to travel and the hours they have to work in order to keep their job. ...|$|E
40|$|The 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the EU {{extended}} {{the freedom of}} movement to workers from the twelve new member states mainly from Central Eastern Europe. This study summarizes and comparatively evaluates {{what we know about}} mobility in an enlarged Europe to date. The <b>pre-enlargement</b> fears of free labor mobility proved to be unjustified. No significant detrimental effects on the receiving countries' labor markets have been documented, nor has there been any discernible welfare shopping. Rather, there appear to have been positive effects on EU's productivity. The sending countries face some risks of losing their young and skilled labor force, but free labor mobility has relieved them of some redundant labor and the associated fiscal burden. They have also profited from remittances. Of key importance for the sending countries is to reap the benefits from brain gain and brain circulation in an enlarged EU. For the migrants the benefits in terms of better career prospects have with little doubt exceeded any pecuniary and non-pecuniary costs of migration. In conclusion, the freedom of movement in the EU provides for a triple-win situation for the receiving and sending countries as well as for migrants themselves, provided the risks are contained and efficient brain circulation is achieved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic {{consequences of the}} diversion of migration flows away from Germany towards the UK {{in the course of}} the EU Eastern Enlargement. The EU has agreed with the new member states from Central and Eastern Europe transitional periods for the free movement of workers. The selective application of migration restrictions during the transitional periods has resulted in a reversal of the <b>pre-enlargement</b> allocation of migration flows from the new member states across the EU: Germany as the main destination before enlargement attracts only modest immigration flows since 2004, while the UK and Ireland which have been only marginally affected by immigration prior to enlargement absorb about 60 % of the inflows in the post-enlargement period. The macroeconomic effects of this diversion process is analysed in this paper on the basis of a CGE model which considers wage rigidities. We find that higher migration is associated with larger GDP and employment gains, but also with a smaller wage increase and a smaller decline of the unemployment rate. The diversion of migration flows away from Germany towards the UK yields thus a higher GDP and employment growth in the UK. The joint GDP of Germany and the UK declines by 0. 1 per cent as a consequence of the migration restrictions.
