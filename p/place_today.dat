5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the station}} was proving {{inadequate}} for the passenger numbers, and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926. The new buildings were made of brick; with a large, four-chimneyed building containing most of the facilities; {{as well as a}} separate parcels office. The northern platform had a wooden awning built, which is still in <b>place</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Richmond Council {{announced}} {{the replacement of}} the gaslamps on the bridge with electric lighting. The Richmond Society, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of the bridge, and succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in <b>place</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Giurgiu and Călărași {{were split}} from Ialomița {{and the former}} county of Ilfov, while in 1997, Ilfov County, which had been a {{dependency}} of the municipality of Bucharest for nearly two decades, was reinstated. The county borders set in 1968 are still largely in <b>place</b> <b>today,</b> but the functions of different authorities have changed due to administrative reforms in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to <b>place.</b> <b>Today,</b> the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E
5|$|The M-120 {{designation}} {{was originally}} used {{on two different}} roadways in the state. In 1930, a road from US16 for about a mile at {{the northwest corner of}} Lansing was numbered M-120. In early 1939, the M-174 designation replaced the M-120 moniker on the road. Later that year, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) used the number for a road along the Michigan-Ohio state line. This highway connected to State Route 120 on its east end at the state line and ran west to US127 at Meridian Road along the Hillsdale–Lenawee county line. By the end of 1940, M-120 was extended through Hillsdale County to connect to State Road 120 along the short north–south Michigan–Indiana border. By the middle of 1961, the M-120 designation was retired by the MSHD again. The Ohio and Indiana SR120 highways are still in <b>place</b> <b>today</b> with only the county road in Michigan connecting them.|$|E

25|$|With {{the closing}} of the border, Gibraltar {{received}} its own Constitution. During the 16 years of closure, Gibraltar developed the political system still in <b>place</b> <b>today.</b> Gibraltar obtained not only greater self-government but furthermore, Gibraltarians began to replace British expatriates in the administration.

The seating capacity was reduced to approximately 93,000.|$|E
25|$|Pearson {{has been}} {{credited}} with instituting the world's first race-free immigration system. Credit for who created the policy, however, is disputed, and likely should be shared with John Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's government in 1962 introduced a new race-free policy; however, under the 1962 policy, Americans were still given an advantage. It was in 1967 that Pearson introduced a discrimination-free points-based system which encouraged immigration to Canada, a forerunner of the system still in <b>place</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 60kW {{capacity}} {{wind generator}} {{is located on}} Black Rock Road in Breamlea.

Electricity production ceased at 1200hrs on 17 May 2003 due to an electrical generator burn-out, caused by moisture, salt, and electrical flash-over. The wind generator remains in <b>place</b> <b>today</b> intact.|$|E

25|$|The astronomic {{model on}} which ancient Greek {{navigation}} was based, {{which is still}} in <b>place</b> <b>today,</b> was already extant {{in the time of}} Pytheas, the concept of the degrees only being missing.

Each of the spheres were divided into zones (zonai) by circles (kukloi) in planes at right angles to the poles. The zones of the celestial sphere repeated on a larger scale those of the terrestrial sphere.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Supreme Court, which was established by Article III of the Constitution, the district courts were established by Congress. There is no constitutional requirement that district courts exist at all. Indeed, after the ratification of the Constitution, some opponents of a strong federal judiciary urged that, outside jurisdictions under direct federal control like Washington, D.C. and the territories, the federal court system {{be limited to the}} Supreme Court, which would hear appeals from state courts. This view did not prevail, however, and the first Congress created the district court system that is still in <b>place</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
