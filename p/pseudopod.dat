25|$|To {{create the}} alien water tentacle, Cameron {{initially}} considered cel animation or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. Phil Tippett suggested Cameron contact Industrial Light & Magic. The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM. ILM designed {{a program to}} produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the <b>pseudopod.</b> For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the <b>pseudopod</b> could be accurately composited into the live-action footage. The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed {{for more than a}} month by production and special effects problems. The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.|$|E

50|$|Within the {{traditional}} Sarcodina, amoebae were generally divided into morphological categories, {{on the basis}} of the form and structure of their <b>pseudopods.</b> Amoebae with <b>pseudopods</b> supported by regular arrays of microtubules (such as the freshwater Heliozoa and marine Radiolaria) were classified as Actinopods; whereas those with unsupported <b>pseudopods</b> were classified as Rhizopods. The Rhizopods were further subdivided into lobose, filose, and reticulose amoebae, according to the morphology of their <b>pseudopods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{appearance}} and internal structure of <b>pseudopods</b> {{are used to}} distinguish groups of amoebae from one another. Amoebozoan species, {{such as those in}} the genus Amoeba, typically have bulbous (lobose) <b>pseudopods,</b> rounded at the ends and roughly tubular in cross-section. Cercozoan amoeboids, such as Euglypha and Gromia, have slender, thread-like (filose) <b>pseudopods.</b> Foraminifera emit fine, branching <b>pseudopods</b> that merge with one another to form net-like (reticulose) structures. Some groups, such as the Radiolaria and Heliozoa, have stiff, needle-like, radiating axopodia (actinopoda) supported from within by bundles of microtubules.|$|R
50|$|Lobosa is a {{taxonomic group}} of amoebae {{possessing}} broad, bluntly rounded <b>pseudopods.</b> In current classification schemes, it is a subphylum of Amoebozoa, composed of amoebae that have lobose <b>pseudopods</b> but lack cilia or flagella.|$|R
5000|$|Though amoeba {{locomotion}} is {{assisted by}} appendages like flagella and cilia, {{the main source}} of movement in these cells is pseudopodial locomotion. This process takes advantage of the different consistencies of the endoplasm and ectoplasm to create a <b>pseudopod.</b> <b>Pseudopod,</b> or “false foot” is the term for the extension of a cell’s plasma membrane into what appears to be an appendage that pulls the cell forward. The process behind this involves the gel of the ectoplasm, and sol, more fluid, portion of the endoplasm. To create the <b>pseudopod,</b> the gel of the ectoplasm begins to convert to sol which, along with the endoplasm, pushes a portion of the plasma membrane into an appendage. Once the <b>pseudopod</b> is extended, the sol within begins to peripherally convert back to gel, converting back to the ectoplasm as the lagging cell body flows up into the <b>pseudopod</b> moving the cell forward. [...] Though research has shown aspects of the cytoskeleton (specifically microfilaments) assist with <b>pseudopod</b> formation, the exact mechanism is unknown. Research on the shelled amoeba Difflugia demonstrated that microfilaments lie both parallel and perpendicular to the axis of contraction of the plasma membrane to assist with plasma membrane extension into an appendage.|$|E

50|$|Movement using a <b>pseudopod</b> is {{accomplished}} through increases in pressure {{at one point}} on the cell membrane. This pressure increase {{is the result of}} actin polymerization between the cortex and the membrane. As the pressure increases the cell membrane is pushed outward creating the <b>pseudopod.</b> When the <b>pseudopod</b> moves outward, {{the rest of the body}} is pulled forward by cortical tension. The result is cell movement through the fluid medium. Furthermore, the direction of movement is determined by chemotaxis. When chemoattraction occurs in a particular area of the cell membrane, actin polymerization can begin and move the cell in that direction. An excellent example of an organism that utilizes pseudopods is Naegleria fowleri.|$|E
5000|$|The 10th and 11th {{segments}} of the larva each carries a transverse row of long hooklets that it uses in anchoring itself and in shifting sand.

50|$|Gymnophryidae is a {{small family}} of amoeboids that lack shells and produce thin, reticulose <b>pseudopods.</b> These contain microtubules and have a {{granular}} appearance, owing {{to the presence of}} extrusomes, but are distinct from the <b>pseudopods</b> of Foraminifera. They are included among the Cercozoa (along with Lecythium), but differ from other cercozoans in having mitochondria with flat cristae, rather than tubular cristae.|$|R
50|$|You {{can imagine}} domains as being like {{primitive}} one-celled organisms (like amoebas). They {{are able to}} extend parts of themselves into <b>pseudopods.</b> Imagine that two such organisms extend <b>pseudopods</b> toward {{each other in a}} sort of handshake, and that the cellular material in the area where they are shaking hands is mixing, so that it belongs to both of them. That's an interface.|$|R
40|$|Blebs and F-actin-driven <b>pseudopods</b> are {{alternative}} ways of extending {{the leading edge of}} migrating cells. We show that Dictyostelium cells switch from using predominantly <b>pseudopods</b> to blebs when migrating under agarose overlays of increasing stiffness. Blebs expand faster than <b>pseudopods</b> leaving behind F-actin scars, but are less persistent. Blebbing cells are strongly chemotactic to cyclic-AMP, producing nearly all of their blebs up-gradient. When cells re-orientate to a needle releasing cyclic-AMP, they stereotypically produce first microspikes, then blebs and <b>pseudopods</b> only later. Genetically, blebbing requires myosin-II and increases when actin polymerization or cortical function is impaired. Cyclic-AMP induces transient blebbing independently of much of the known chemotactic signal transduction machinery, but involving PI 3 -kinase and downstream PH domain proteins, CRAC and PhdA. Impairment of this PI 3 -kinase pathway results in slow movement under agarose and cells that produce few blebs, though actin polymerization appears unaffected. We propose that mechanical resistance induces bleb-driven movement in Dictyostelium, which is chemotactic and controlled through PI 3 -kinase...|$|R

5000|$|A 48 kDa {{integral}} membrane phosphoprotein, {{the major}} sperm protein polymerization organization protein (MPOP), {{is the starting}} point of the <b>pseudopod</b> and is required for the localized membrane-associated polymerization of MSP. [...] This protein is distributed in vesicles throughout the pseudopodal membrane. Tyrosine kinases, which are pH sensitive, phosphorylate the tyrosine residues of MPOP localized {{at the tip of the}} <b>pseudopod,</b> thus resulting in the polymerization of the MSP filaments. [...] In Ascaris suum, two MSP-fiber proteins (MFP), MFP1 and 2, with opposite effect on polymerization have been identified. MFP1 inhibits and MFP2 stimulates the MSP assembly. [...] Changes in pH both controls and activates the MSP polymerization throughout spermatogenesis by a pH gradient within the <b>pseudopod</b> of the spermatozoon: assembly occurs at the leading edge where the pH is high, and disassembly of the filaments occurs at the base where the pH is lowered. Degradation of the MSP filaments results in a traction force at the base of the <b>pseudopod,</b> which in turn pulls the cytoskeleton forward. The combination of these two forces is the motive force that allows sperm motility. Attachment of the cytoskeleton to the substratum is required to generate a directional movement.|$|E

40|$|Two motors {{can drive}} {{extension}} of {{the leading edge of}} motile cells: actin polymerization and myosin-driven contraction of the cortex, producing fluid pressure and the formation of blebs. Dictyostelium cells can move with both blebs and actin-driven <b>pseudopods</b> at the same time, and blebs, like <b>pseudopods,</b> can be orientated by chemotactic gradients. Here we ask how bleb sites are selected and how the two forms of projection cooperate. We show that membrane curvature is an important, yet overlooked, factor. Dictyostelium cells were observed moving under agarose, which efficiently induces blebbing, and the dynamics of membrane deformations were analyzed. Blebs preferentially originate from negatively curved regions, generated on the flanks of either extending <b>pseudopods</b> or blebs themselves. This is true of cells at different developmental stages, chemotaxing to either folate or cyclic AMP and moving with both blebs and <b>pseudopods</b> or with blebs only. A physical model of blebbing suggests that detachment of the cell membrane is facilitated in concave areas of the cell, where membrane tension produces an outward directed force, as opposed to pulling inward in convex regions. Our findings assign a role to membrane tension in spatially coupling blebs and <b>pseudopods,</b> thus contributing to clustering protrusions to the cell front...|$|R
