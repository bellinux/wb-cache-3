30|$|<b>Printed</b> {{electronics}} {{device is}} fabricated by several <b>printing</b> methods including the screen <b>printing,</b> gravure <b>printing,</b> and ink-jet <b>printing</b> [5 – 8]. First, screen <b>printing</b> was widely used from long ago {{because it had}} simple <b>printing</b> tools which included stencil and squeegee. However, screen <b>printing</b> is not suitable for fragile substrate due to inevitable contact of stencil with substrate and is not inexpensive because it accompanies large amount of ink. Furthermore, this <b>printing</b> method has a lower resolution than other <b>printing</b> methods. In gravure <b>printing,</b> ink was directly transferred through engraved roll. For this reason, it easily applies to roll-to-roll (R 2 R) process. Gravure <b>printing</b> has benefit of higher throughput because this <b>printing</b> method have advantages such as printable large area and fast <b>printing</b> speed by continuous process. However, a developed R 2 R <b>printing</b> equipment {{can be used by}} ink of one-type and <b>printed</b> structure can be damaged by contact of substrate with roll. Ink-jet <b>printing</b> technology creates a flexible electronics without contact of nozzle with substrate, which produces single droplet contained metal nano-particle through nozzle. This <b>printing</b> method offers relatively lower throughput than other <b>printing</b> methods, because ink-jet printer restricts the number of nozzles and directly draws a circuits of electronics device. However, the resolution is relatively higher than other <b>printing</b> methods, and various substrates are broadly utilized in order to use benefits of ink-jet <b>printing</b> technology. In addition, ink-jet <b>printing</b> provides distinguished advantage such as drop-on-demand <b>printing,</b> no wastage of ink, various functional inks, and non-contact <b>printing.</b> For this reason, research on ink-jet <b>printing</b> technology is required. In particular, RF performance of <b>printed</b> structure has to be investigated in regard to type of substrate because flexible device is fabricated on flexible substrate rather than rigid substrate.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass <b>printing</b> is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from the <b>printing</b> plate onto the <b>printing</b> substrate. The pad <b>printing</b> is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure <b>printing</b> plate. Beside area of the <b>printing</b> elements, on the pad <b>printing</b> plate one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences the <b>printing</b> ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of the <b>printed</b> product. The photopolymer pad <b>printing</b> plate production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between <b>printing</b> and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in the <b>printing</b> elements. The duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of the <b>printing</b> elements. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of the <b>printing</b> elements, consequently on the reproduction of the pad <b>printing</b> plate elements. For this purpose four pad <b>printing</b> plate samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration. Results have shown that second exposure duration significantly influences the <b>printing</b> elements size and therefore should be defined precisely in order to form <b>printing</b> elements of desired depth...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, Anton Gimenez of the Filmoteca de Catalunya {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} this <b>print,</b> which he believed to be in a state of total decomposition, to Serge Bromberg and Eric Lange of the French film company Lobster Films. Bromberg and Lange offered to trade a recently rediscovered film by Segundo de Chomón for the hand-colored <b>print,</b> and Gimenez accepted. Bromberg and Lange consulted various specialist laboratories in an attempt to restore the film, but because the reel of film had apparently decomposed into a rigid mass, none believed restoration to be possible. Consequently, Bromberg and Lange themselves set to work separating the film frames, discovering that only the edges of the film stock had decomposed and congealed together, and thus that many of the frames themselves were still salvageable. Between 2002 and 2005, various digitization efforts allowed 13,375 fragments of images from the <b>print</b> to be saved. In 2010, a complete restoration of the hand-colored <b>print</b> was launched by Lobster Films, the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage. The digitized fragments of the hand-colored <b>print</b> were reassembled and restored, with missing frames recreated {{with the help of a}} black-and-white <b>print</b> in the possession of the Méliès family, and time-converted to run at an authentic silent-film speed, 14 frames per second.
