The article noted that criticisms of the episode ranged from [...] "Kay's overacting and the silly Slitheen-esque monster to {{annoyance}} at how, well, lame the members of LINDA are." [...] Louisa Pearson of The Scotsman noted that hardcore fans would dislike the comedy and the [...] "panto" [...] performance of Kay, but commented, [...] "It's true, this episode came close to being a spoof, but it was actually quite nice to have a rest from the Doctor.

He was positive towards the first 30 minutes, which he described as a [...] "touching little tale" [...] with interesting characters, but called the final 10 minutes [...] "juvenile attack on the audience's intelligence and emotions" [...] that ruined the episode with [...] "a laughable monster and offensive humor at exactly the wrong moment". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan criticised Kay's performance, calling the Abzorbaloff [...] "a marvellous idea and it's a pity his creativity was absorbed by a turn from a visiting comedian". In a review of the series, Stephen Brook of The Guardian stated that he [...] "hated" [...] the episode, describing it as a [...] "parody of Doctor Who fans". The scene where Elton says he and Ursula have [...] "a bit of a love life" [...] was criticised by some commentators, who felt that the resultant implication of having oral sex with a <b>paving</b> <b>slab</b> was unsuitable for Doctor Whos large family audience; others, however, dismissed this dialogue as a harmless joke that children would not understand. [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] was placed in 153rd position in Doctor Who Magazine Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009, which ranked every Doctor Who story to that point in order of preference.|$|E

May's car was un-modified, and subsequently won the challenge by a significant margin.|$|E

Shields launched two appeals against his conviction amid a high-profile campaign, in 2005 and 2006, but they both failed and the original verdict was affirmed.

50|$|The {{three were}} given £2,000 {{to buy a}} {{four-seater}} convertible car. However, they all buy the same car: a BMW 325i. Hammond bought a 1987 model for £1,600 which had done 94,318 miles according to the odometer, and had aftermarket wheels, aftermarket alarm, a lower suspension and extra locks fitted. Clarkson bought a 1988 model for £1,950 which had done 137,488 miles and had a <b>paving</b> <b>slab</b> in the boot (to improve handling) and May a 1989 model for £1,900 with no modifications. Clarkson decided to turn the challenge into a test to see how different the three supposedly identical cars had become over time, so the trio ignored the producers' challenges and devised their own.|$|E
50|$|Shields {{conducted}} two unsuccessful appeals under Bulgarian {{jurisdiction in}} 2005 and 2006 on procedural grounds {{relating to the}} original trial. The 2006 appeal saw his prison sentence cut from 15 to 10 years, but his fine increased to £71,000 and his challenge for a retrial denied. No new evidence was introduced during the appeal and {{the facts of the}} original case were supported by existing evidence. The testimony of number of friends of Shields and the confession of Graham Sankey were dismissed as being biased towards helping to free Shields regardless of facts, inconsistent and inaccurate with Sankey incorrectly describing the weapon used in the attack as a <b>paving</b> <b>slab</b> (...a stone with irregular shape and not a pavement slab... according to police forensic reports).|$|E

50|$|Aside from visual {{observation}} of surface features, most other archaeological {{knowledge of the}} site comes from the 19th century survey carried out by Charles Wilson and Charles Warren. Warren {{was one of the}} first to excavate this area, exemplifying a new era of Biblical archaeology in the 1870s. In 1930, R.W. Hamilton, director of the British Mandate Antiquities Department, carried out the only archeological excavation ever undertaken at the Temple Mount's Aqsa Mosque by the British Mandate, the excavations show a Byzantine mosaic floor underneath the mosque that was likely the remains of a church or a monastery. In addition to the Byzantine mosaic, R.W. Hamilton also found a <b>paving</b> <b>slab</b> in the floor bearing the image of a centaur, dated to the 3rd century CE. It is believed this tile may be related to pagan religious construction on the Temple Mount during the Roman Period (135-325 CE).|$|E
