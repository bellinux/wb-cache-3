40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. Accurate {{assessment}} {{of current and}} future irrigation in the ACT/ACF river basins requires quantification of agricultural irrigation. Irrigated acreage is difficult to measure and project. No systematic monitoring of agricultural water application rates or irrigation volume occurs. Secondary sources must be combined with irrigation acreage estimates to derive irrigation water-use. Several sources and techniques available for determining irrigated acreage and water-use were compared. These approaches included surveys of farmers and experts, <b>physical</b> <b>checks</b> at random. locations, manual and computer analysis of remotely sensed images, crop models, and farmer-reported irrigation intentions. Four counties in Southwest Georgia with predominantly fixed irrigation systems were evaluated. There was good agreement among acres and irrigation volumes determined from surveys, <b>physical</b> <b>checks,</b> models, and image analysis. The four county total irrigation volume averaged 63. 5 mgd for these approaches. The Comprehensive Basins Study and the DNR-EPD permitted irrigation volumes were higher than these four approaches by 65 % and 160 %, respectively. Where mobile irrigation systems are in use differences were greater. Each method has its flaws, gaps, and overlaps. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

We give analytic and numeric results that show that the quadratures studied by Drobný and Jex do not exhibit squeezing if the standard technique of homodyne detection is employed. This is simply shown by a calculation that reveals that the variance in both quadratures is equal for all times. On the other hand, if homodyne detection is not used, the variance would oscillate at the optical carrier frequency hence, squeezing would be unobservable.

40|$|We {{compute the}} single-interval Renyi entropy (replica {{partition}} function) for free fermions in 1 + 1 d at finite temperature and finite spatial size by two methods: (i) using the higher-genus partition function on the replica Riemann surface, and (ii) using twist operators on the torus.

We exhibit this proposal and provide substantial evidence for it. The resulting expressions can be elegantly written in terms of Jacobi forms. Thereafter we argue that the correct Renyi entropy for modular-invariant free-fermion theories, such as the Ising model and the Dirac CFT, is given by the higher-genus computation summed over all spin structures. The result satisfies the <b>physical</b> <b>checks</b> of modular covariance, the thermal entropy relation, and Bose-Fermi equivalence. Comment: 34 page...|$|E

The framework considers multiple sources of risk to health data quality and integrity {{that can result}} {{from the use of}} health information technology (HIT) and can be used to teach health professional students about these risks when using health technologies. This framework encompasses issues and problems that may arise from varied sources, including intentional alterations (e. g. resulting from hacking and security breaches) as well as unintentional breaches and corruption of data (e. g. resulting from technical problems, or from technology-induced errors). The framework that is described has several levels: the level of human factors and usability of HIT, the level of monitoring of security and accuracy, the HIT architectural level, the level of operational and <b>physical</b> <b>checks,</b> the level of healthcare quality assurance policies and the data risk management strategies level.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore the {{different}} factors that affect bulk storage of quarried stone and associated products {{in the day to}} day operation of a profitable business. Swedish stone producers must have accurate knowledge of available products throughout the year in order to provide customers appropriate requirements at the time of need. One difficulty in carrying stock piles of bulk stone products is allowing for variants, such as wind wastage, and water absorbing which have a direct effect on the tonnage available. Customers who order in bulk need to know the dry weight cost {{in order to get the}} correct value of material, and in the case of concrete suppliers, for instance, controlled mixing of their final product. Where volume purchases are the norm, the transport required must know the weight/volume to be safe and legal. The overall requirements then for a successful stone quarrying business are varied; in order to provide a service the range of products must fulfil the needs of customers, be able to control or understand the variations that affect their products as mentioned previously, the impact on density of particle size/density, H 2 O content, flakiness index and screening curve.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of traditional type checking in C {{is limited by}} the presence of type conversions using type casts. Because the C standard allows arbitrary type conversions between pointer types, neither C compilers, nor tools such as lint, can guarantee type safety in the presence of such type conversions. In particular, by using casts involving pointers to structures (C structs), a programmer can interpret any memory region to be of any desired type, further compromising C's weak type system. Not only do type casts make program vulnerable to type errors, they hinder program comprehension and maintenance by creating latent dependencies between seemingly independent pieces of code. To address these problems, we have developed a stronger form of type checking for C programs, called <b>physical</b> type <b>checking.</b> <b>Physical</b> type <b>checking</b> takes into account the layout of C struct fields in memory.
