40|$|Results {{from the}} {{performance}} and <b>test</b> <b>section</b> flow calibration of the 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel are presented. A flow calibration test was conducted in May and June 1987. The goal of the flow calibration test was to determine detailed spatial variations in the 40 - by 80 -ft <b>test</b> <b>section</b> flow quality throughout the tunnel operational envelope. Data were collected for <b>test</b> <b>section</b> speeds up to 300 knots and for air exchange rates of 0, 5, and 10 percent. The tunnel performance was also calibrated during the detailed mapping of the <b>test</b> <b>section</b> flow field. Experimental results presented indicate that the flow quality in the <b>test</b> <b>section,</b> {{with the exception of}} temperature, is relatively insensitive to the level of dynamic pressure and the air exchange rate. The dynamic pressure variation in the <b>test</b> <b>section</b> is within + or - 0. 5 deg at all <b>test</b> <b>section</b> velocities. Cross-stream temperature gradients in the <b>test</b> <b>section</b> caused by the air exchange system were documented, and a correction method was established.

40|$|Free air {{simulations}} {{in conventional}} transonic wind tunnels require improvement which adaptive wall testing techniques can provide primarily by minimizing wall interferences. In addition, these techniques offer other substantial advantages such as increased Reynolds number capability {{and a reduction}} in tunnel drive power. The combination of an adaptive wall <b>test</b> <b>section</b> with a continuous flow cryogenic wind tunnel is unique.

40|$|Considerable {{effort was}} devoted to the {{development}} of two-dimensional adaptive wall <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> The development of fully three-dimensional <b>test</b> <b>sections,</b> however, has not had this same level of effort expended. The limitations on three-dimensional research are the result of the complexity of both the mechanical design and operational aspects. Typical of the mechanical complexities are lack of readily available model and flow visualization access, and problems of sealing between adjacent walls for multi-wall types of <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> The operational aspects are complicated by the necessity for many measurements of the boundary conditions which can be very time consuming. In three-dimensional testing, it is impossible to remove all of the boundary interference. It will be necessary, therefore, to apply residual corrections to the data.

Liquid propylene glycol droplets are pre-mixed with air, and slowly injected into the <b>test</b> <b>section</b> of the shock tunnel. Two <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> are evaluated {{during the course of this}} study.

A cross-section of the flow is illuminated with multiple pulses from Nd:YAG lasers, producing time-resolved visualizations of the seeded volume. The illuminated images are analyzed to quantify droplet velocity and vorticity from time of shock passage to 400 us after shock. Velocity of the shock wave varies between Mach number 1. 67 and 2. 0. Based on Particle Image Velocimetry interrogation and analysis, a comparison is made between the velocity and vorticity fields in these two <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> National Nuclear Security AdministrationMechanical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.
