5|$|The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} disturbance on August26, noting that {{an area of}} convection had an associated circulation. With favorable conditions, the agency assessed a fair <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development.</b> On August27, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as tropical depression south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima, although the circulation was exposed from the convection. The next day, the JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 22W about 945km (565mi) northeast of Saipan, after the thunderstorms began wrapping into the center.|$|E
5|$|The {{state is}} a leader in {{renewable}} energy commercialization; it produces the most wind power in the nation. In 2014, 10.6% of the electricity consumed in Texas came from wind turbines. The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, is one of the world's largest wind farms with a 781.5 megawatt (MW) capacity. The Energy Information Administration states that the state's large agriculture and forestry industries could give Texas an enormous amount biomass for use in biofuels.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September12. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September23, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in shower and thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another burst in convection occurred on September25, likely due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system, which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and their <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> out to 48hours. The tropical wave split on September26, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September27, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation. Although TWOs issued on September27 predicted a high probability for development, the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on August17, the NHC {{anticipated}} that a {{low pressure area}} would form within five days {{to the south of}} the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the East Pacific, with a 30% chance of tropical cyclogenesis. By the next day, the wave was located over Panama, and the NHC upgraded the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> to 60%. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific with accompanying convection, developing a low pressure area on August19. Conditions were favorable for further development, and the thunderstorms increased and became better organized on August20. After an increase in rainbands and outflow around the well-defined center, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on August22 about 370mi (595km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. A strong ridge over the southern United States, later expanding into northern Mexico, steered the system on a west-northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the benefits of}} retaining the canal. The Inland Waterways Association produced a report, entitled The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future, suggesting that the canal had the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset County Council produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the County Council duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.|$|E

25|$|Lord Shackleton's {{report was}} {{delivered}} in 1977 and documented the economic stagnation in the islands.

The report was largely ignored at the time, as it was felt that acting upon it would sour relations with Argentina. A reprise of the report by Lord Shackleton in 1982 following the Falklands War became the blueprint for subsequent economic development of the islands.|$|E
25|$|When a {{prolonged}} agricultural crisis and economic slump after the Napoleonic Wars threatened to cripple the entire educational reform programme, {{the government had}} to resort to a distressingly mechanical method of education, the so-called Bell-Lancaster method imported from the industrial north of England, which reduced the number of teachers by a drastic simplification of the curriculum to enable preposterously large numbers of pupils to be taught by a single individual. After some years, this method provoked increasing opposition from parents, who wanted more liberal and inspiring forms of education. Their demands received vigorous support from the poet-clergyman N. F. S. Grundtvig, who exercised a powerful influence on the development of Danish schools. Grundtvig wanted to reduce the task of children's schools to no more than the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic in order to make room, either at home or at school, for a liberal narrative education that would build on the natural <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> inherent in the child's mind.|$|E

25|$|Several {{months earlier}} the Air Force {{conducted}} a competitive {{evaluation of the}} three existing all-weather interceptor prototypes, the XF-87, the XF-89, and the US Navy's XF3D Skyknight. The evaluators were qualified night-fighter pilots, radar operators, and experienced maintenance non-commissioned officers. The pilots were not impressed {{with any of the}} aircraft and recommended procurement of an interim aircraft that resulted {{in the development of the}} Lockheed F-94 Starfire from the training version of the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. The F-89 proved to be the fastest of the three contenders, although it was in last place in cockpit arrangement and ease of maintenance. One pilot claimed that the XF-89 was the only real fighter and compared the XF-87 to a medium bomber and the XF3D to a trainer. The full Committee on Evaluation overruled those evaluators, preferring the Douglas design and selecting the XF-89, as it had the greatest <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development.</b> The Air Force subsequently canceled the production contract for the F-87 to free up money for the Scorpion.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Chantal can be tracked {{back to a}} {{tropical}} disturbance within the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Trinidad and Tobago on July24. The system crossed westward over the Caribbean Sea, {{and there were no}} signs of organization until July27 near the coast of Honduras. Despite the predictions for slow development from the tropical weather outlooks, it was possible that the system developed a surface low center near Belize City, Belize late on July28. After the system moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, it became disorganized, although the National Hurricane Center indicated in the tropical weather outlook that once it moved into the Gulf of Mexico there was <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development.</b> Although the outflow of the system had appeared impressive on satellite images, the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> seemed uncertain, mostly due to the close proximity to land.

500|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Fitow {{were from a}} {{persistent}} area of convection, or thunderstorms, about 310kilometres (195miles) north-northeast of Palau, {{an island in the}} western Pacific Ocean during mid-late September. At the time, wind shear dislocated the convection to the west of a broad and poorly-defined circulation. Although the system was poorly organized, tropical cyclone forecast models noted the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> to occur. The convection gradually consolidated and outflow increased to the west, indicative of increased organization. Early on September29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared that a tropical depression formed about [...] to the northeast of Palau. Around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began issuing warnings on the depression, giving it the local name Quedan. Early on September30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 22W, noting that the circulation had become increasingly well-defined amid decreasing wind shear.|$|E
500|$|During {{an active}} Madden–Julian oscillatory period over Australian longitudes in late November, a broad {{low-pressure}} area developed within the monsoon trough {{in the southeastern}} Arafura Sea, west of Cape York Peninsula. Due to its <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>development,</b> the Bureau of Meteorology Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Darwin (TCWC Darwin) began monitoring the system on 28November. Tracking westward, the low eventually moved into the Timor Sea three days later and became quasi-stationary in forward motion. Situated within a good outflow environment, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began monitoring the disturbance at 0300UTC on 1December, assessing it with a 'poor' likelihood of cyclogenesis; these probabilities as assessed by the JTWC would increase up until eventual formation. Nonetheless, TCWC Darwin began issuing tropical-related products on the disturbance beginning at 0730UTC the following day. At 0000UTC on 3December, the JTWC analyzed that the tropical low had organized into a tropical depression. Due to weak steering currents, the depression drifted southward and moved ashore the Kimberley coast roughly [...] east of Kalumbaru; this stint over land was short lived, however, and the system tracked back westward, reentering the warm Timor Sea the following day. Positioned within favorable conditions under a subtropical ridge, the depression began to strengthen. At 0400UTC on 5December, TCWC Perth, having assumed local area responsibilities for the tracking of the storm, determined the system to have strengthened into a tropical cyclone. As such, the warning center assigned the name Sam to the storm. Although a tropical cyclone warning was issued twelve hours prior, the JTWC followed suit by classifying Sam as a tropical storm at 1200UTC the same day.|$|E
