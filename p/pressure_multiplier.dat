During the test, supercritical CO 2 (at 10 MPa and 40  ∘C) was injected into {{one end of the}} horizontal core and a X-ray CT scanner (with a resolution of 0. 35  mm× 0. 35  mm) was employed to monitor and record changes in the fluid saturations at 70 sections evenly spaced along the core length to enable 3 D mapping of the saturation profiles throughout the core during the course of CO 2 flooding and imbibition. Analysis of the mean saturation profiles along the core length (obtained by averaging the CT values over each cross-section) revealed a strong influence by the (mean) porosity distribution, though this influence became gradually less pronounced after CO 2 breakthrough. A 1 D model of the core was first constructed to simulate the CO 2 injection process and in particular to history match the evolution of the CT scan CO 2 saturation profiles along the core length with time. It was found that a reasonably match could be achieved by using a porosity-dependent capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>multiplier.</b> The multiplier was also dependent on injection time (CO 2 saturation level).

We evaluated the accuracy of tympanometry in 6 monkeys. Direct application and measurement of ME pressure were achieved with a probe introduced into the mastoid antrum, and tympanometry was done over a large range of applied ME pressures. For all ears, tympanometric pressure was a linear function of applied pressure. At large overpressures, the tympanometric pressure was approximately 40 mm H 20 greater than the applied pressure, {{but there was little}} error in the measurement for applied underpressures. The measurement error was proportional to the ME <b>pressure</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the ratio of the extant volume displacement of the tym-panic membrane to ME volume.

The alkane solutes are n-pentane(p), n-hexane(hx), n-heptane(hp), n-octane(o), n-nonane(n), 2 -methylpentane(mp), 2, 5 -dimethylpentane(dp), 2, 5 -dimethylhexane(dh), 2, 3, 4 -trimethylpentane(tp), cyclohexane(ch), and ethylcyclohexane(ec). The solvent set encompasses most of those studied by Rohrschneider as well as three homologous series of solvents (n-alkanes, 1 -alcohols and 1 -nitriles) and several perfluorinated alkanes and highly fluorinated alcohols. An excellent linear relationship was observed between lnK and the carbon number of n-alkanes.

A qualitative discussion of the gross stability of each medium suggests that the resulting ratio of oceanic to atmospheric energy transport, averaged over the Hadley cell, is roughly equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of water to that of air at constant <b>pressure,</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the ratio of the moist to the dry adiabatic lapse rates near the surface.

40|$|Background—The {{relationship}} between epicardial stenosis and microvascular resistance remains controversial. Exploring {{the relationship is}} critical, as many tools used in interventional cardiology imply minimal and constant resistance. However, variable collateralization may impact well on these measures. We hypothesized that when collateral supply was accounted for, microvascular resistance would be independent of epicardial stenosis.

A temperature and pressure sensing guide wire was used to derive microvascular resistance using the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), defined as the hyperemic distal <b>pressure</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the hyperemic mean transit time. Lesion severity was assessed using fractional flow reserve. For comparison, evaluation of an angiographically normal reference vessel from the same subject also was undertaken.

CAV consists of a progressive diffuse intimal hyperplasia and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, ending in wall thickening of epicardial vessels, intramyocardial arteries (50 - 20 mum), arterioles (20 - 10 mum), and capillaries (< 10 mum).
