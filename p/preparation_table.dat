50|$|The plot {{jumps to}} many years later, after Tinman Wong has died. Jo collapses while {{fetching}} water, and Badger finds her in bed, near death. He takes {{her in his}} wagon to the Ruby City doctor, but she is dead before they arrive. As Badger buys rounds of drinks at the saloon in memory of Little Jo, the undertaker rushes in with his shocking discovery—Little Jo was a woman. The town elders rush back to the undertaker's to inspect. All stand around the <b>preparation</b> <b>table</b> in shock, all except Mrs. Addie (Cathy Haase), the saloon owner, who laughs and laughs.|$|E
5000|$|The city {{kitchen was}} about 15.5 square metres {{in size and}} was {{intended}} to be used by a wife and her mother-in-law. The kitchen had doors leading to the dining room, the bath, and the laundry area. It had a wooden floor, roughly one-fourth of which included underfloor food storage lined with concrete. Two kamado were at one end, and a separate portable stove using charcoal was set {{up in the middle of}} the room. Next to the kamado was a stone sink without a water tap. Next to this sink were storage shelves with pots and pans on top, washed dishes in the middle, and vegetables and miso on the bottom. Next to the portable stove was a large food <b>preparation</b> <b>table,</b> with several drawers to store cooking utensils. Staples such as rice, sugar, and flour were kept in pots beneath this table. Additional shelves at the other end of the room could be accessed from both the kitchen and the dining room. Next to these shelves was another <b>preparation</b> <b>table</b> where foods were served onto individual dishes and then carried to the dining room. Kitchen windows and shoji were installed with glass panes to make the kitchen brighter, and electric lights were hung from the ceiling. This [...] "dream kitchen" [...] was spacious by today's standards, yet it lacked most modern post-industrial conveniences, although many smaller improvements had been made.|$|E

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the {{bacterial}} load and isolate potential pathogens and food spoilage bacteria from kitchen <b>tables,</b> including <b>preparation</b> <b>tables</b> and dining tables. Methods. A total of 53 households gave their consent for participation. The samples were collected by swabbing over an area of 5 [*]cm by 5 [*]cm of the tables and processed for bacterial count which was read as colony forming units (CFU), followed by isolation and identification of potential pathogens and food spoilage bacteria. Result. Knowledge about hygiene was not always put into practice. Coliforms, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., and S. aureus were detected from both dining and <b>preparation</b> <b>tables.</b> The mean CFU and presence of potential pathogens were significantly affected by the hygienic practices of the main food handler of the house, materials of kitchen tables, use of plastic covers, time of sample collection, use of multipurpose sponges/towels for cleaning, {{and the use of}} <b>preparation</b> <b>tables</b> as chopping boards (p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Kitchen tables could be very important source of potential pathogens and food spoilage bacteria causing foodborne diseases. Lack of hygiene was confirmed by presence of coliforms, S. aureus, and Enterococcus spp. The use of plastic covers, multipurpose sponges, and towels should be discouraged...|$|R

50|$|The {{deceased}} {{is placed}} on the mortuary table in the supine anatomical position with the head elevated by a head block. The first step in embalming is to check that the individual is in fact deceased (to avoid premature burial), and then verify the identity of the body (normally via wrist or leg tags). At this point, embalmers commonly perform basic tests for signs of death, noting things such as clouded-over corneas, lividity, and rigor mortis, or by simply attempting to palpate a pulse in the carotid or radial artery. In modern times, people awakening on the <b>preparation</b> <b>table</b> is largely the province of horror fiction and urban legend.|$|E
40|$|Establishing a {{conservation}} tree planting {{can be a}} chal-lenge in semiarid regions like western Nebraska, where annual precipitation of 20 inches or less is the norm. Tree planting failure commonly {{occurs as a result}} of poor site preparation coupled with inadequate weed and grass control the first three to five years after planting. Effective site <b>preparation</b> (<b>Table</b> I) begins the year before planting. The results help young trees survive and grow in several ways: • Increases the soil moisture needed for firm compaction, thereby reducing the risk of air pockets drying out and killing tree roots; • Reduces present and future weed and grass competition...|$|E
30|$|According to our {{previous}} experimental results, an optimal molar ratio of Cd/Zn of 1 / 1 {{was used for}} CdTe 0.5 Se 0.5 cores coated with Cd 0.5 Zn 0.5 S shell for getting high PL efficiencies. To investigate the effect of temperature on the formation of Cd 0.5 Zn 0.5 S shell on CdTe 0.5 Se 0.5 cores, reaction temperature was adjusted from 180 °C to 280 °C. An optimal temperature range {{was found to be}} around 190 °C to 220 °C. In the case of a high temperature (more than 260 °C), the reaction solution became black quickly when TOPS was injected. This is ascribed to the PL quenching of QDs because the high temperature led to large amount defects generated during <b>preparation.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 summarizes the preparation conditions and properties of CdTe 0.5 Se 0.5 cores and CdTe 0.5 Se 0.5 /Cd 0.5 Zn 0.5 S QDs.|$|E

X-Ray Diffraction is a technique used in materials science to identify the crystalline structures that can appear on the object of interest. In this project, the materials of interest are samples extracted from historical painting and pieces of decorated glass and glazed ceramics. The micrometric size of the paint layers {{as well as of the}} colour decoration layers in glass or glazed ceramics requires of a micrometric size beam. Moreover, the complexity of compounds found on those layers (a mixture of original, reaction, weathering and aging compounds) require also of a high brilliance monochromatic beam with tunnable energy. All these requirements force to perform the experiments at a synchrotron light facility. The main goal is to learn about the information that can be obtained from an X-ray diffraction analysis as well as its limitations and in particular the importance of sample <b>preparation.</b> <b>Table</b> of contents List of figures v...|$|E
