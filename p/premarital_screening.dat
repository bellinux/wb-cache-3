First, Chinese Americans are more in favor of eugenic policies than European Americans. Secondly, more stigma would be generated towards genetic attributions of any diseases in Chinese American population. China used to implement restrictions on marriage licenses to people with genetic illnesses, which has made the attitude of Chinese American towards <b>premarital</b> genetic <b>screening</b> more supportive, especially when facing a chance of genetic defects. Moreover, from the perspective of this group of people, knowing whether a marriage partner has family history of mental illness with genetic basis is fairly important.|$|R

In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of five previous published formulas and compared them to our new formula (│ 80 -MCV│×│ 27 -MCH│) in screening of β-thalassemia. Methods: All couples in the <b>premarital</b> β-thalassemia <b>screening</b> program of Roodbar, Iran, for whom molecular analysis had been done, were selected during two years.

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} examines Kuwait’s {{policy on}} compulsory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> and the justifications advanced for it. Introduced under Kuwait Family Law Act 2008 section 31, <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> has become mandatory for prospective spouses {{in order to}} complete the marital process. In the past six years, more than 78, 000 prospective spouses have been screened for genetic disorders and infectious diseases; yet despite its wide application, its justification remains unclear. The primary aim of this thesis is {{to shed light on}} this under-researched policy and to critically evaluate its significance in terms of ethical and legal ramifications. To do so, the thesis aims; to assess whether compulsory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> meets human rights standards and is consistent with the rights of people with disabilities; to determine whether <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> offers a viable and legitimate solution to certain cultural particularities found in Kuwait; to ascertain whether there are other less controversial alternatives to compulsory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening.</b> With this in mind, the justifications advanced for compulsory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> and its impact on internationally recognised human rights principles is evaluated with reference to treaties recognized by the United Nation and ratified by Kuwait. In reflecting on how the policy is justified, the thesis will analyse relevant regulations in other Arab countries to highlight similarities and differences among value systems. To illustrate international developments regarding screening and possible infringement of human rights principles, relevant debates in the UK will also be referred to. The findings question the validity of compulsory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening.</b> The adequacy of consanguinity as a reason to mandate screening for genetic disorders is questioned, as some have viewed this as only one among several factors causing genetic disorders. It also reinforces concerns that compulsory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> disproportionately affects prospective spouses who have genetic disorders and infectious diseases. The potential elimination in these circumstances of the existence of people with disabilities in Kuwait throws its desirability into question. The present study provides essential insights into the value system underlying medical screening, disability issues and human rights regulations in Kuwait. The thesis concludes by proposing other more acceptable and less controversial alternatives for advancing the objectives of compulsory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening.</b> ...|$|E

30|$|The {{prevailing}} wisdom {{has been}} that β-thalassaemia in India principally affects the Sindhi, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi and Muslim communities (Agarwal 2005), although this supposition has been strongly influenced by the more extensive testing undertaken in these sub-populations.

In the interim, it is important that public education programmes, in combination with opportunities for <b>premarital</b> and prenatal <b>screening,</b> should be made available to as wide a range of couples, families and communities as possible.|$|R
40|$|Double {{heterozygosity}} for hemoglobin (Hb) E and S, {{known as}} HbSE disease, is a rare, clinically benign condition involving mild hemolysis. Only 25 {{cases have been}} reported to date. The current literature generally associates HbSE with a benign clinical course, although vaso-occlusive complications have been reported. Although only single case reports were previously available, we have observed 20 cases of HbSE and wish to report them. We examined the records of patients presenting to our hemoglobinopathy center in 2001 - 2013. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for hematological assessment of blood samples with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Eight patients were male and 12 female. Mean hemoglobin electrophoresis values were Hb A 1 : 6. 3 %, Hb E 34. 5 %, HbS: 59. 5 % and Hb F: 1. 9 %. Three patients (15 %) were symptomatic with vaso-occlusive crisis and one had cerebral stroke. These were siblings. The patient with cerebral stroke was using hydroxyurea. The incidence of HbSE disease is rising due to population admixtures and racial intermarriages. Increased numbers of cases of HbSE have been detected after <b>premarital</b> hemoglobinopathy <b>screening</b> in the Antakya and Çukurova regions of Turkey. The aim {{of this study was to}} report large numbers of patients with HbSE diagnosed through the routine HPLC method. The secondary aim was to emphasize that severe vaso-occlusive crisis such as infarction symptoms could be seen in HbSE.     E，S型双杂合性血红蛋白，被称为HbSE症，是一种罕见的，临床上呈良性的病症，通常伴有轻度溶血症状。迄今为止只有 25 个关于此病症的报告。当前通常把HbSE症是作为一种良性病患，尽管已有报告显示出其梗塞并发症的存在。虽然只有极少的相关报告，我们仍研究了 20 个HbSE病例，并希望能陈述我们的发现。   我们检查了 2001 - 2013 年患者在我们血红蛋白病中心提交的检测记录。高效液相色谱法（HPLC）及乙二胺四乙酸被采用以评估收集到的血液样本。患者为 8 名男性， 12 名女性。他们的平均血红蛋白电泳值分别为Hb A 1 : 6. 3 %、Hb E: 34. 5 %、Hb S: 59. 5 %,Hb F: 1. 9 %。其中 3 位（ 15 %）患者患有梗塞的并发症，一位患有脑卒中。这三名患者是兄弟姐妹。患有脑卒中的患者当时使用过羟基脲。HbSE症发病率的上升是由于人口及人种间的混血。在土耳其Antakya 和Çukurova 地区的婚前血红蛋白病的筛查中，发现了HbSE症病例的增加。该研究的目的是报告大量通过高效液相色谱法诊断的HbSE症病例。次要目的是强调例如梗塞的严重并发症会由HbSE症引发。</p...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of genetic blood disorders is high, ranging from 10 - 25 %, in Kuwait. This high prevalence is mainly {{due to a}} preventable cause, namely, consanguineous marriages. One {{of the most successful}} programs in Kuwait implemented to reduce such high prevalence is <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the level of knowledge, attitude and satisfaction among university students regarding <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program, and to find out the factors influencing knowledge, attitude, and satisfaction of the people toward <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 809 students of Kuwait University during July-October 2016. A self-administered questionnaire including 51 questions was handed out to the participants after taking informed consent. The main outcome variables of this study were: knowledge of hereditary diseases, <b>premarital</b> <b>screening,</b> attitude, and satisfaction toward <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program. The mean ± SD of knowledge score about hereditary diseases was 5. 80 ± 2. 9 out of a total of 14, and the knowledge score for <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> was 3. 99 ± 1. 2 out of 6. In univariate analysis, knowledge scores about hereditary diseases were significantly associated with marital status (P = 0. 043), education in medical faculties (P < 0. 001), higher education of father (P = 0. 027), higher education of mother (P = 0. 001), and presence of hereditary disease in the family (P = 0. 003). The level of attitude toward <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program was significantly associated with female gender (P < 0. 001), marital status (P = 0. 023), higher years of study (P = 0. 002), higher family income (P = 0. 019). In multivariate analysis, education in medical faculties and presence of hereditary disease in the family were significant predictors of knowledge about hereditary disease. This study identified some demographic factors which determined the outcome of knowledge about <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> and hereditary disease. Also, the study demonstrated that more than 90 % of the people were not satisfied about the <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program, and more than 70 % had to wait for a long time before receiving the test results.

Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at the students’ clinic from January to April 2011. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 590 unmarried Omani students of both genders. The questionnaire consisted of 3 main parts; the first part was based on socio-demographic data, the second part dealt with the students’ knowledge about the <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program while the third part explored their attitudes towards the screening program. Results: Most of the participants (n= 469; 79 %) were aware about the availability of <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program in Oman. The main sources of information were: school/college (n= 212; 36 %), media (n= 209; 35 %), family and friends (n= 197; 33 %), and/or health services (n= 181, 31 %). The vast majority of the participants (n= 540; 92 %) thought it is important to carry out <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> and agreed to do it. Around half of the participants (n= 313; 53 %) favored having <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> as an obligatory procedure before marriage and about one third (n= 212; 36 %) favored making laws and regulation to prevent marriage in case of positive results. Conclusion: Even though the majority of the participants thought it is important to carry out premarital screening; only half favored making it obligatory before marriage and one third favored making laws and regulations to prevent marriage in case of positive results.

In Palestine, 4 % of the population are known thalassemia carriers with new cases continuing to appear despite the availability of prenatal testing. This study aims to identify factors that influence the decision to retain or abort fetuses affected by β-thalassemia in Palestine. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to select 32 women (72 fetuses) who were at risk of having a baby with β-thalassemia. A questionnaire on prenatal testing, test results, pregnancy outcomes, and factors influencing the decision to terminate the pregnancy were used for this cross-sectional study. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17. Results: Among the fetuses screened, 36 (50 %) were thalassemia carriers and 20 (28 %) had β-thalassemia; 17 (85 %) affected fetuses were aborted. Religious beliefs were the most cited reason for opposing abortion while prior experience with β-thalassemia patients and awareness programs promoted abortions. Mothers who opted to retain an affected fetus had modest educational attainment. Higher educational level was significantly associated with the decision to abort an affected fetus (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background. It is well {{established}} that the Mediterranean and Arab populations {{are at high risk}} for thalassemias in general and for alpha-thalassemia in particular. Yet, reports on alpha-thalassemia in Lebanon are still lacking. In this study, we aim at assessing the incidence of alpha-thalassemia in the Lebanese population. Methods. 230 newborns’ dried blood cards remaining from routine neonatal screening at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were collected for DNA extraction. Samples were screened for the 21 most common α-globin deletions and point mutations reported worldwide, through multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse-Hybridization technique. Results. Upon analyses, the carrier rate of α-thalassemia was found to be 8 %. Two mutations detected the −α 3, 7 single gene deletion found in 75 % of cases and the nongene deletion α 2 IVS 1 [− 5 nt] in the remaining samples. Conclusion. This study is the first dedicated to investigate α-thalassemia trait incidence in Lebanon. Data obtained demonstrates a high carrier rate in a relatively, highly consanguineous population; it also highlighted the presence of two common mutations. These results may be of an important impact on <b>premarital</b> and newborn <b>screening</b> policies in our country...|$|R
40|$|Background: Thalassaemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Mendelian {{disorders}} in Mediterranean area. Iran has about 26, 000 Thalassaemic patients, so it {{is one of the}} most affected countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening program and cost analysis of Thalassaemia prevention program in West-Azerbaijan province of Iran. Methods: This study evaluated the efficacy of Health system′s Thalassaemia prevention program with a sensitivity analysis for its costs. The second five years of the program was evaluated. The economic burden of Thalassaemia is determined by the birth prevalence of the affected infants and the cost that is accrued to treat the infected individuals and was compared with the total cost of screening the couples for thalassemia trait. Results: The average incidence rate of major Thalassaemia was 19. 8 per 100, 000 live births and mean coverage rate of program was 74 %. The rate of canceling the marriage among carrier couples was 53 %. Cost analysis showed that the cost of screening and prenatal diagnosis program was much lower than the cost of treatment in potential thalassaemic patients. Conclusions: The prevention program of Thalassaemia including a <b>premarital</b> and pre-natal <b>screening</b> in west Azerbaijan province is demonstrated to be cost-effective.

40|$|Background: Beta {{thalassemia}} is {{a common}} health problem in Iran especially in Northern provinces. <b>Premarital</b> <b>screening</b> for thalassemia is compulsory in Iran and identification of the carriers is based on primary CBC (Cell Blood Count) and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Silent mutations on β-globin gene have borderline or normal hematological indices that cannot be detected in <b>premarital</b> <b>screening.</b> Material and Methods: A 4 years old boy affected with β-thalassemia was referred to the lab for molecular analysis. During the screening program for β-thalassemia, {{his father and mother}} were diagnosed as α and β-thalassemia carrier respectively.   Results: The results of molecular analysis showed that in addition to the α-globin single gene deletion (α 3. 7) the father have also carried a silent mutation on his β-globin gene named HBB c. 82 G>T or Hb Knossos that was missed in screening program. Conclusion: The presented case shows that using CBC and hemoglobin electrophoresis in <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program for detecting β-thalassemia carriers is not a valid approach and individuals who are carriers of silent β-globin gene mutations are missed in this procedure.

Methods: <b>Premarital</b> <b>Screening</b> data {{reported to the}} Health Authority - Abu Dhabi from April to December 2011 were utilized to estimate tobacco use prevalence among applicants. Smoking prevalence was examined by nationality, age group and gender. Results: Overall, 24. 7 % of <b>Premarital</b> <b>Screening</b> Program applicants were current smokers; 11. 5 % smoked cigarettes, 5. 9 % smoked medwakh (hand-held pipe), 4. 8 % smoked water-pipe and 2. 5 % smoked a combination (more than one type). Men (19. 2 %) {{were more likely than}} women (3. 5 %) to be current cigarette smokers.

40|$|Background: β-thalassemia trait {{is one of}} {{the most}} common geneticdisorders in Mediterranean countries. Previous studies have shown that β-thalassemia trait has a {{protective}} effect against malaria, coronary artery disease, hypertension and Alzheimer disease. We hypothesize that due to the shorter life span of red blood cells and increased hematopoiesis, these patients are at increased risk of developing hematological malignancies. Thus, this study investigated the possible effect of β-thalassemia trait on childhood malignancies. Methods: This was a case-control study that included 432 children withmalignancies (leukemias and lymphomas as well as solid tumors) as the case group and 432 healthy individuals who referred for <b>premarital</b> β-thalassemia trait <b>screening</b> as the control group. All patients underwent a complete blood count as well as hemoglobin electrophoresis. Hemoglobin A 2 ≥ 3. 5 % or hemoglobin F between 2 % and 10 % were considered diagnostic for β-thalassemia trait. The results were compared between groups with the chi-squared test. Results: Mean age of the patients was 7. 08 ± 5. 1 years and mean age inthe control group was 25. 46 ± 7. 3 years. There were 253 (58. 6 %) boys and 179 (41. 4 %) girls among the patients and 308 (71. 3 %) men and 124 (28. 7 %) women among the controls. The prevalence of β-thalassemia trait was 5. 6 % in the case group and 11. 3 % in the control group (P= 0. 001). The mean hemoglobin level was 9. 81 ± 3. 1 g/dL in those with malignancies and 15. 3 ± 1. 7 g/dL in healthy individuals (P< 0. 001).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the replacement of}} the traditional laboratory <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> in Saudi Arabia and other countries that follow the Islamic laws "Healthy Marriage Program" with Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

The traditional <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> consist of couples undergoing a screening process for Sexual Transmitted Infections (STI) and genetic blood disorders prior to becoming engaged or getting married. The traditional screening practice faces many challenges, such as being culturally unaccepted, time consuming, and unorganized. The CDSS would eliminate the challenges of the traditional process by giving marriage agencies, marriage licensors and traditional matchmakers access to insert the national identification number of new couples to see if their potential marriage would be healthy or not. Unhealthy marriages would be required to go through sex/genetic counseling sessions as an attempt {{to prevent the spread of}} the STI's and genetic blood disorders. Saudi Arabia is moving from paper health records to electronic health records (EHR). CDSS would be used as a tool to help health care providers deliver higher quality service by using patients' records stored in EHR. CDSS could potentially minimize clinical visitation and provide treatments to couples before getting engaged...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Saudi Arabia {{has a high}} {{prevalence}} of hereditary hemoglobin disorders. Data has been collected by the Saudi <b>Premarital</b> <b>Screening</b> and Genetic Counseling Program on the {{prevalence of}} sickle cell disease and &# 946;-thalassemia but the outcomes were not quantified. We used six years of <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> data to estimate the burden of sickle disease and &# 946;-thalassemia over the program period and to assess the frequency of at-risk marriage detection and prevention. Design and Setting: Retrospective review, premarital couples attending premarital and genetic counseling clinics with marriage proposals between 2004 and 2009. Methods: Blood samples obtained from all couples with marriage proposals between 2004 and 2009 were tested for sickle cell disease and &# 946;-thalassemia. Test results were shared with all examinees and genetic counseling was offered for all at-risk couples. Marriage certificates were issued irrespective of the results and compliance with medical advice was voluntary. Results: Out of all men and women examined, 70 962 (4. 5 &#x 0025;) and 29 006 (1. 8 &#x 0025;) were carriers or cases of sickle cell disease and &# 946;-thalassemia, respectively. While the prevalence of sickle cell disease was constant between 2004 and 2009 (average 45. 1 per 1000 examined persons, P =. 803), the prevalence of &# 946;-thalassemia steadily decreased from 32. 9 to 9. 0 per 1000 examined persons (P <. 001). The frequency of at-risk couples decreased by about 60 &#x 0025; between 2004 and 2009 (from 10. 1 to 4. 0 per 1000 examined persons, P <. 001). The frequency of voluntary cancellation of marriage proposals among at-risk couples showed more than 5 -fold increase between 2004 and 2009 (from 9. 2 &#x 0025; to 51. 9 &#x 0025;, P <. 001). The eastern region had 58 &#x 0025; of all detected at-risk marriages and showed the greatest decline in detection and increase in prevention over time compared to other regions of Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: Six years of <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> in Saudi Arabia markedly {{reduced the number of}} at-risk marriages, which may considerably reduce the genetic disease burden in Saudi Arabia in the next decades...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in order to determine}} hemoglobipathy trait in Kahramanmaras. METHOD: In this study <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> of hemoglobinopathies {{was performed in}} 11040 subjects between March 2006 and February 2007 who were planning to get married. RESULTS: Thalassemia trait was detected in 261 subjects; hence the rate was determined to be 2. 35 %. Sickle cell anemia trait was detected in 59 subjects; hence the rate was determined to be 0. 54 %. CONCLUSION: These rates are similar to the overall rates of Turkey.

40|$|Background A {{compulsory}} national <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> (PMS) {{program for}} hereditary hemoglobinopathies {{was established in}} the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in February 2004. Termination of pregnancy of affected fetuses is not widely acceptable. Many couples decide to get married regardless of the result. A trend towards coercive interference with this decision is emerging. Objectives To examine the attitude of young educated individuals regarding the national PMS program and its implementation. Methods Eight hundred university students (aged 18 - 29) filled in a self-administered structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the EPI Info Statistical Package version 6.

A total of (N= 64) mothers are chosen as participants. Focus Group Discussion (FGD) is carried out. Majority of the children’s parents is cousins but they are not screened for thalassemia before marriage and despite of the birth of thalassemic child, they are unaware about prenatal diagnosis. The study highlights the need of implementing effective public educational programs and to make <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> compulsory for general public to reduce the prevalence rate of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the wide}} spread of many diseases, advancements in genetic {{engineering}} {{have led to}} considerable improvements in diagnosing these diseases. Therefore, pressure on prospective spouses to undergo premarital medical exams has increased significantly. Many Islamic countries have responded to this emerging need by making some <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> tests compulsory for a marriage. The adoption of these policies comes from the core message of Islam, which encourages counselling to protect future generations and to guarantee the continuity of worshipping God. However, some people reject the compulsory test, considering them against Islam rules. In this letter to the editor, the authors explore the view of Islam towards premarital medical tests...|$|E
40|$|Untreated {{maternal}} phenylketonuria (MPKU) is a {{major cause}} of microcephaly, congenital heart disease, intrauterine growth retardation and mental retardation in the offspring of mothers who have the disease. There is evidence, however, that dietary restriction of phenylalanine in the mother before conception and throughout the pregnancy will reduce the risk of these congenital anomalies in the fetus. It is important to be alert to this preventable cause of developmental retardation and congenital abnormalities in all pregnancies until the stage is reached where every woman of child-bearing age has been through the neonatal PKU-screening program. Family physicians are advised to consider prenatal or <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> for PKU of all female patients of child-bearing age for the next generation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Al-Hassa area {{is one of}} {{the regions}} in Saudi Arabia where hemoglobinopathies are prevalent. The Saudi Ministry Of Heath {{designed}} a protocol for premarital testing after the royal decree in December 2003. The protocol was implemented in a February 2004 order. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of b-thalassemia trait among subjects coming for <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> in the Al-Hassa area. Subjects and Methods : From February 2004 to November 2004, healthy subjects coming to six marriages consultation centers in the Al-Hassa area underwent routine mandatory tests. Subjects were considered to have b-thalassemia trait if they had a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) &# 60; 80 fL and/or a mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) &# 60; 27 pg and a hemoglobin A 2 level&# 62; 3. 2 &#x 0025;. Venous blood was taken into an EDTA tube and the complete blood count and red blood cell indices were measured by a Coulter automated cell counter on the same day of hemoglobin collection. Electrophoresis was done on cellulose acetate. Results: All Saudi participants (n= 8918), including 4218 (47. 3 &#x 0025;) males and 4700 (52. 7 &#x 0025;) females were screened. The prevalence of b-thassemia trait with high hemoglobin A 2 and microcytic hypochromic anemia was 3. 4 &#x 0025; (307 / 8918). Conclusion : In countries with a high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies, a <b>premarital</b> <b>screening</b> program is helpful for identification and prevention of high-risk marriages. With a 3. 4 &#x 0025; prevalence of b-thalassemia trait in premarital couples, future comprehensive programs are needed to know the actual prevalence of b-thalassemia in Al-Hassa...|$|E
