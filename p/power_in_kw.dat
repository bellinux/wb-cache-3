Due to control of power density distribution and due to variation of interaction times during refining and due to transformation of material parameters during prodution, temperature distribution, which must be defined in time and place can be achieved in metal. The high power densities with high heating and colling rates as well as steep temperature gradients, the slight thermic load of the material outside the processing area and the great variety of processing patterns with exact delimittion of the beam shaping and the beam guiding distinguish electron beam processes from conventional ones.

It was intended to suggest performance criteria and performance improvement for the effective cooling system. Methods: The measuring instruments consisted of two flow meters, a power meter and thermocouples. An ultrasonic and a magnetic flow meter measured the flow rate of the water, which was equivalent to heat transfer fluid. The power meter measured electric <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>kW</b> consumed by the heat pump system. T-type thermocouples measured the temperature of {{each part of the}} heat pump system. All of measuring instruments were connected to the recorder to store all the data. Results: When the water temperature supplied into the evaporator of the heat pump system was over 20 °C, the cooling Coefficient Of Performance(COP) of the system was higher than 3. 0. As the water temperature supplied into the evaporator, gradually, lowered, the cooling COP, also, decreased, linearly. Especially, when the water temperature supplied into the evaporator was lower than 15 °C, the cooling COP was lower below 2. 5. Conclusions: In order to maintain the cooling COP higher than 3. 0, we suggest that the water temperature supplied into evaporator from the thermal storage tank should be maintained above 20 °C. Also, stratification in the thermal storage tank should be formed well and the circulating pumps and the pipe lines should be arranged in order for the relativ...|$|E

40|$|A Unitised Regenerative Fuel Cell (URFC) is {{a single}} cell that can {{function}} both as a fuel cell and electrolyser. URFCs have mass and volume savings compared to conventional hydrogen systems employing a separate electrolyser and fuel cell. Hence they have potential applications in electrical energy storage systems {{for a wide range}} of terrestrial and space applications. This paper reviews the current state of art of this promising technology and identifies the main technical challenges to overcome to make the URFC system more technologically and economically viable. The review reveals that the oxygen-side catalyst layer in a URFC is typically more challenging to design and construct, since a bifunctional catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer (GDL) must be made that functions equally well in electrolyser and fuel cell modes. The prime goal in URFC development is to obtain a roundtrip energy efficiency very close that of a system with a separate electrolyser and fuel cell. It is important to develop light weight, long-lived cells resistant to corrosion or other degradation, and retention of structural integrity and strength after repeated cycling and mode switching. There is still a lack of practical designs and operating experience for URFC stacks scaled up to multi-cell stacks with supply <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the <b>kW</b> range. <b>In</b> addition, development of URFC stacks able to deliver hydrogen at elevated pressure up to 20 bar in E-mode is essential.

40|$|Ultrashort pulse lasers are an {{important}} tool in scientific and industrial applications. However, many applications are demanding higher average powers from these ultrashort pulse sources. This {{can be achieved by}} combining direct diode pumping with novel gain media designs. In particular, ultrashort pulse fiber lasers are now delivering average <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> the <b>kW</b> range. However, the design of fiber lasers, producing pulses with high peak-powers, is challenging due to the impact of nonlinear effects. To significantly reduce these detrimental effects in ultrashort pulse fiber amplifers, the combination of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) and large mode area fibers is employed. Using these methods, the pulse energy of fiber lasers has been steadily increasing for the past few years. Recently, a fiber-based CPA-system has been demonstrated which produces pulse energies of around 1 mJ. However, both the stretching and the enlargement of the mode area are limited, and therefore, the impact of nonlinearity is still noticed in systems employing such devices. The aim of this thesis is the analysis of CPA-systems operated beyond the conventional nonlinear limit, which corresponds to accumulated nonlinear phase-shifts around 1 rad. This includes a detailed discussion of the influence of the nonlinear effect self-phase modulation on the output pulse of CPA-systems. An analytical model is presented. Emphasis is placed on the design of novel concepts to control the impact of self-phase modulation. Pulse-shaping is regarded as a powerful tool to accomplish this goal. Novel methods to control the impact of SPM are experimentally demonstrated. The design of these concepts is based on the theoretical findings. Both amplitude- and phase-shaping are studied. Model-based phase-shaping is implemented in a state-of-the-art fiber CPA-system. The influence of the polarization state is also highlighted.
