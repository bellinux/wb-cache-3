The Mg 2 + binding specificity is modulated by two factors: (i) a required electrostatic complementarity and (ii) a structural correspondence between the hydrated ion and its binding pocket that can be estimated by its degree of dehydration and the resulting number and lifetime of the intervening water-mediated contacts.

The detergent formulation {{is a complex}} blend of over 95 % of powders: inorganic salts of alkaline metal called builders, and a system of surfactants composed of anionic and nonionic organic molecules. Two processes were examined: wet granulation prior to compression (processing 1), and direct compression (processing 2). Wet granulation is performed in a laboratory high shear mixer with a blend of powdered raw materials excluding one of the salts, the metasilicate. This blend is called ``initial blend for granulation. '' The granulation parameters studied are the intensity of shear related to the impeller speed, {{and the amount of}} liquid added, water being used as liquid binder.

Compression is performed on a uniaxial laboratory press, either with the granules mixed with sodium <b>pentahydrated</b> metasilicate for processing 1, or with a mix of powdered and pre-granulated raw materials, called here ``initial blend for direct compression,'' for processing 2. The following features of the compacts are considered: mechanical strength, ftiability, density, solubility in cold water, and microscope observation of fractured surfaces. Comparison of compacts showed that prior granulation leads to increased mechanical properties due to higher plasticity and stronger binding with water, while it slightly deactivates the alkaline product.

The manufacture of these materials involves the application of thermal and chemical treatments. This paper focuses on the study of the effect of the heating rate (HR) in two thermal techniques, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermoluminescence (TL), performed on natural ulexite from Bigadiç-Balıkesir (Turkey). The TL measurements were performed at six different heating rates in the range of 25 – 240 °C min− 1. The UV–blue TL emission of natural ulexite shifted toward higher temperatures with increasing heating rate, whereas the intensity decreased. The kinetic parameters of the ulexite (Ea= 0. 65 (9) eV and s= 1. 22 × 1012 s− 1) were calculated using the variable heating rate method. DTA measurements performed in the range of 0. 5 – 10 °C min− 1 displayed similar behavior to that of the TL response, despite the differences in technique and HR values. The DTA results indicated that natural ulexite exhibits two endothermic peaks originating from different processes: (i) a phase transition between the <b>pentahydrated</b> ulexite phase and a triple-hydrated phase and (ii) dehydration, dehydroxylation and alkali and earth-alkali self-diffusion processes in the ulexite lattice.

Our comparative analysis of the three aquaions indicates a clear inverse correlation between the radius of the cation and the binding energy, that indeed increases in the order Mn 2 + < Co 2 + < Mg 2 -. The trend in the binding energies of the <b>pentahydrated</b> cations to the N 7 atom of the guanine is instead Mg 2 + < Mn 2 - < Co 2 +, suggesting a rather different bonding scheme that, for the two transition metals, involves back-donation from the aromatic ring of the guanine to their empty d orbitais. In the gas phase, the three hydrated metals significantly stabilize both G-C base pair geometries, Watson-Crick and reverse Watson-Crick, we investigated.

Conversely, all three metal ions sensibly stabilize the reverse Watson-Crick geometry, also in water.

Phosphate compounds encountered in urine can be dangerous and the use of inhibitors to prevent, slow down or reduce crystallization phases might be very helpful.
