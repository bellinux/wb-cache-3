40|$|The New Faliron steam-electric station, {{the first}} one in Greece, is a listed {{historical}} building. The initial structure was constructed {{at the start of the}} 20 th century but a number of interventions followed until the 1960 s. The structure was built with natural stone masonry, steel trusses and floors (with jack arches and <b>joist</b> fillers) and <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> reinforced with twisted cold formed rebars. The 12. 5 m high masonries practically lack any lateral restraints while large openings (doors, windows) exist. This paper presents brief information on the history of the structure, phases of construction, description of structure (dimensions, types of structural systems, etc), material properties and pathology. In addition, detailed information is presented regarding the assessment performed in accordance with the current code specifications (Eurocodes), including seismic actions. Especially for the masonry, a detailed finite element model was developed, whereas the seismic forces were evaluated through alternative methodologies (modal response spectrum analysis per EC 8 and time history analyses). For the assessment of the RC part a displacement based methodology was applied as it is restrained by the surrounding masonry walls. From the assessment analysis, useful conclusions are drawn regarding the seismic performance of high masonry structures without lateral restraints and the behaviour of similar industrial structures under seismic effects...|$|R

The data collected were subjected to frequency and severity index analyses, Kendall's concordance test and the chi-squared tests to produce a rank ordering of 12 construction related factors. Five factors were identified as being the most important, namely 'appropriateness of use', 'cost', 'constructability', 'speed' and 'health and safety'. These five factors reflect current industry emphasis, and therefore could be adopted as the principal criteria for evaluating and selecting <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> systems during the design stage.

40|$|Recently, many {{residents}} living in apartment buildings in Korea have been bothered by noise {{coming from the}} houses above. In order to reduce noise pollution, communities are increasingly imposing bylaws, including the limitation of floor impact sound, minimum thickness of floors, and floor soundproofing solutions. This research effort focused specifically on the deflection of resilient materials in the floor sound insulation systems of apartment houses. The experimental program involved conducting twenty-seven material tests and ten sound insulation floating <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> specimens. Two main parameters were considered in the experimental investigation: the seven types of resilient materials {{and the location of}} the loading point. The structural behavior of sound insulation floor floating was predicted using the Winkler method. The experimental and analytical results indicated that the cracking strength of the floating <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> significantly increased with increasing the tangent modulus of resilient material. The deflection of the floating <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> loaded {{at the side of the}} specimen was much greater than that of the floating <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> loaded at the center of the specimen.

A slipping incident occurs when the required coefficient of friction (RCOF) exceeds the coefficient of friction (COF) at the claw–floor interface.

40|$|Tensile {{membrane}} {{action is}} a load carrying mechanism in reinforced concrete f-loors at very large deflection. Under ths action, the load carried by the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> can be many {{times higher than the}} design load carrying capacity determined at small deflections. Recent full scale fire tests and fire accidents in steel-framed buildings with reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> have identified tensile membrane action as the main load carrying mechanism. This mechanism is able to transfer the applied loads on the floor to the supporting columns when the supporting steel beams to the floor are damaged and have lost their load carrying capacities The understanding of tensi!e membrane action in reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> has a significant implic tion for the fire protection of steel-framed buildings reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> This is because the supporting steel beams may be allowed to fzil without endangering the safety of the !e bui!ding. Consequently, fire protection to these stee! beams can be reduced or eliminated.
