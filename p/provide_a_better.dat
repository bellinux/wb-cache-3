5|$|Discussion of the disorganized {{attachment}} style sometimes includes {{this style}} {{under the rubric}} of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that will take the individual ever further from the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood. Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> outcome later in the person's life.|$|E
5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows {{that a lack of}} power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the MLS {{expansion}} franchise Sounders FC {{decided to}} develop the Starfire Sports Complex in nearby Tukwila, and the USL team played {{most of the season}} at that facility.

The last match for the USL Sounders at Qwest Field was the 2008 season opener against the rival Portland Timbers. The game ended in a scoreless draw in front of 10,184.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire {{take place}} in the Hoenn region, located some {{distance}} from the Kanto and Johto regions featured in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's great {{elevation}} and the steepness of its flanks <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{view and}} a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa. The high elevation with its risk of altitude sickness, weather concerns, steep road grade, and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult. Until {{the construction of}} roads in the mid-20th century, only the hardy visited Mauna Kea's upper slopes; hunters tracked game animals, and hikers traveled up the mountain. These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak itself accessible to larger numbers of people.|$|E
30|$|The CoDe 2.1 model <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> fit {{around the}} modal age and for old-age {{mortality}} because {{it uses a}} logistic function (the third term in Eq. 1) with an age-dependent slope (see Eq. 2) to capture adult mortality.

5|$|The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary {{was founded}} in 1831 by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York, south of Rochester. In 1850, it was {{resolved}} to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming Genesee College. However, the location was soon thought {{by many to be}} insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> base of support.|$|E
5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
5|$|George Tennant, born in 1765 {{and the son}} of a {{solicitor}} in Lancashire, {{moved to}} the area in 1816, after he had bought the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> shipping point than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him.|$|E
