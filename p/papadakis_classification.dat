5000|$|Cape San Pablo is an {{isolated}} mountain with a rounded shape. It {{is made of}} sedimentary rocks from the Cenozoic Era.The cape spreads across 1,200 metres at hide tide, but the distance decreases significantly at low tide. To the north, there is a bay called “Quemada” (English: Burned) together with another one much deeper bay named cove [...] "San Pablo", which is delimited at the north by the cape [...] "Ladrillero" [...] and the [...] "Champion rock" [...] {{in the same area}} where the river [...] "Ladrillero" [...] flows into the sea.Cape San Pablo has another sea entrance to the south that exposes the seabed at low tide. This area contains a huge wreck, the [...] "Desdemona", a cargo ship made in Germany. In this shallow bay, the San Pablo river flows into the sea. The southern limit of this area is called Gruesa point.The climate is semi-humid, with an annual average temperature of about 6 °C, and annual rainfall (uniformly distributed) of about 350 mm. In the <b>Papadakis</b> <b>classification,</b> its climate is defined as “wet Patagonian”. Strong winds occurs throughout the year, especially during the spring, blowing mainly from the west and south-west quadrants. The coast is usually cliffed but it is also surrounded by lower coastal areas which consist of sand, silt and abundant pebbles. Tidal differences can be remarkable.|$|E

Significant effects of the climate in the area collecting were found for 12 of the 15 morphological and phenological traits analyzed. Morphological and phenological differences appeared between populations collected in areas with different soil type. The results suggest that the use of ecological variables at the sites of origin of the populations can reveal their possibilite of adaptation. The also facilitates the selection of maize populations to be used in breeding programmes for specific agroecological new areas. Peer reviewe...|$|R
