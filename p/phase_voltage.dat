With a non-linear load the relation is not so simple. The load is not linear due to the transmission system, whose diode rectifier results in power only {{being able to be}} extracted over certain voltage levels. Consequently, the DC voltage level limits the amplitude of the generator <b>phase</b> <b>voltage.</b> With a non-linear load the generator <b>phase</b> <b>voltage</b> will reach maximum amplitude which is approximately equal to the DC voltage.

Presently, {{with regard}} to the {{research}} in control of three-phase PWM-VSC under unbalanced dips, most of the literatures gain the current commands through the <b>phase</b> <b>voltages</b> based on the PQ power theory and the control flow is complicate too much.
