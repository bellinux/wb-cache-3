5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular <b>ponyfish</b> and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E

5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including <b>ponyfishes,</b> grunters, tunas, and herring. Cephalopods are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|R
40|$|Fishes of {{the family}} Leiognathidae, popularly called silverbellies, <b>ponyfishes,</b> {{slipmouths}} and toothponies are small to medium sized fishes living at the bottom in shallow coastal waters. They are widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. These fishes are captured in several types of fishing gear including bottom trawls, shore seines, gillnets, bagnets etc. Some species occur in dense schools offering great potentialities for commercial exploitation, especially along the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. A few species enter brackishwaters and estuaries. Being small and scanty of flesh, they are consumed very little in fresh condition but mostly sun dried or salt cured.

40|$|Several {{series of}} trawl survey {{was carried out}} in the coastal waters of southeastern South China Sea using {{commercial}} trawler. Six species of <b>ponyfishes</b> were caught throughout the study. Adult fish species were examined for their systematic differences. Based on systematic differences, a pictorial description of each species was built up. Detail population growth of dominant species was estimated using the allometric regression analysis of length (L) -weight (W) relationship (W = aLb). The results showed that the regression coefficient b was 3. 337 ± 0. 105 for Photoplagios stercorarius, 2. 530 ± 0. 298 for Photopectoralis bindus, 2. 690 ± 0. 330 for Secutor insidiator and 2. 211 ± 0. 507 for Gazza minuta, respectively. Stomach contents analyses revealed feeding guilds of each species of fishes. Mean trophic level for P. bindus was 3. 222 ± 0. 491, G. minuta was 2. 753 ± 0. 291, P. stercorarius was 2. 662 ± 0. 316, S. insidiator was 2. 865 ± 0. 298, Leiognathus jonesi was 2. 490 ± 0. 267 and Leiognathus oblongus was 2. 413 ± 0. 296, respectively. The mean value of RLG for P. stercorarius was 0. 8740 ± 0. 0576, G. minuta was 0. 5135 ± 0. 0942 and P. bindus was 1. 1399 ± 0. 2611. Reproductive biology of the selected species of <b>ponyfishes</b> showed that the gonads were mono-lobed with maturing and matured oocytes stages at time of sampling.

40|$|The {{reflected}} {{patterns and}} colours of terrestrial animals often show a sexual dimorphism associated with visual display, mate recognition and selection. In the sea the structures associated with bioluminescence may also show a marked sexual dimorphism. Some apparent bioluminescent dimorphisms (e. g. differences in photophore numbers) are probably secondary functions of sexual differences in size. A role in sexual communication {{is much more}} likely where specific photophores are developed or enlarged in mature specimens of one sex only but the presence of light organs in female anglerfishes (but not in males) is complicated by a significant size dimorphism. Dimorphisms in dragonfishes and lanternfishes primarily involve the relative enlargement of particular photophores in the males. A sexual role is assumed, but the morphological differences are often small. Most male <b>ponyfishes</b> have enlarged light organs; behavioural observations of free-swimming animals have clearly demonstrated that the males use them to generate bioluminescent sexual signals...|$|R

50|$|The longtail {{butterfly}} ray feeds on bony fishes, in particular <b>ponyfishes</b> {{of the genus}} Leiognathus, as well as molluscs and crustaceans. It is not known to shoal in large numbers. Known parasites of this ray include the nematode Hysterothylacium poecilurai and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium micracantha. Like other {{butterfly ray}}s, this species is viviparous with the young sustained initially by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses. Reproductive activity proceeds throughout the year, with a peak from April to October. The gestation period is unknown, though {{it is possible that}} females bear more than one litter per year. The litter size is at least seven pups and is not correlated with female size. The newborns measure 20 - 26 cm across and look like stingless miniatures of the adult; siblings may differ from each other in color.

40|$|Taxonomic {{analysis}} {{of a group of}} morphologically similar <b>ponyfishes</b> (Perciformes: Leiognathidae) establishes the Leiognathus splendens complex comprising four valid species: L. jonesi James, 1971, widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, from Mauritius to Papua New Guinea, north to Hainan I.

The L. splendens complex can be defined by the following combination of characters: body depth 42 – 60 % of standard length; mouth protruding downward; slender, minute teeth uniserially on jaws; lower margin of orbit above the horizontal through the gape when mouth closed; breast almost completely scaled; lateral line complete, and a dark blotch on top of spinous dorsal fin. Diagnostic characters of the members are as follows: L. jonesi —anterior dorsolateral body surface with a semicircular naked area on nape, and a paler dark blotch on spinous dorsal fin; L. kupanensis —anterior dorsolateral body surface widely naked; L. rapsoni —cheek scaled; L. splendens —anterior dorsolateral body surface completely scaled and a jet black blotch on spinous dorsal fin...|$|R
