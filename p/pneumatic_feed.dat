40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of low-temperature CO 2 capture {{has been investigated}} for an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). The performance of low-temperature capture has been compared with Selexol capture for two different gasification technologies: <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feed</b> (G 1) and slurry feed (G 2). With low-temperature capture the resulting net electric efficiency for the IGCC with G 1 and G 2 gasifiers is 0. 8 and 1. 0 %-point higher than with Selexol. The improved efficiency indicates a clear advantage for low-temperature capture with respect to energy performance. Although further R&D is required, components and technology elements are existing and well known from other applications, indicating low technology barriers...|$|E

40|$|A wet jet zone is {{established}} in many applications wherever feeding and dispersing a liquid, solution or slurry into fluidized bed by gases is needed. In the present study, a {{simple mathematical model}} has been developed to simulate the wet jet in fluidized bed. The different stages involved inside the jet zone have been estimated and analyzed. The evaporation stage of traveling droplets through the jet flare has been treated. The rates of evaporation of each size at all positions along the jet flare have been estimated according to the velocities and surrounding conditions. The final droplet sizes have been determined. Moreover, the total evaporation rate from traveling droplets, before collision either with entrained sand particles or flare boundaries, has been estimated. The traveling droplets, partially evaporated, may collide and settle on entrained sand particles. The model predicts the settlement rates of liquid droplets on entrained sand particles. The total part evaporated from settled liquid has been estimated as well. The study {{has been applied to}} the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feeding</b> of liquid fuel into fluidized bed combustors operating at 850 oC. The model has been utilized to predict the ratio of fuel vapor that releases inside the jet flare. The remaining part is assumed to evaporate inside the emulsion phase. Three different liquid fuels have been considered: a heavy oil, diesel fuel and gasoline. The main independent variables are those related to the injection conditions including the initial velocity of dispersing air, uo, and air to liquid mass ratio, ALR. The model results demonstrate that only very small droplets completely evaporate inside the flare. The liquid settling over the entrained sand particles plays an essential role in the fuel evaporation inside the flare. The phenomenon is dominant at conditions that result in generation of droplets of larger sizes, i. e., heavier fuel, lower uo, and greater ALR. The ratio of vapor fuel released in jet flare increases with lighter fuel, higher uo and lower ALR. At uo= 200 m/s and ALR= 1. 0 nearly all-liquid fuel evaporates inside the flare...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increased}} usage of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) in the newest generation of commercial aircraft, {{the opportunity for}} using PCD drills has also increased. PCD {{has long been the}} preferred solution for the drilling of CFRP. However, given the manufacturing demands of commercial aircraft, a single drilling solution would be required to drill all possible material stack combinations which include CFRP stacked with aluminum (Al) and CFRP stacked with titanium (Ti). All of these possible combinations must be drilled with accuracy, excellent surface finish, minimal coolant usage and minimal exit burr, over the course of thousands of holes in the least amount of time possible.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an automated pre-production particle size distribution analyser for particles in the 20 - 2000 #mu#m size range. This work is follow up to the vibro-spring particle sizer reported by Shaeri. In its most basic form, the instrument comprises a horizontally held closed coil helical spring that is partly filled with the test powder and sinusoidally vibrated in the transverse direction. Particle size distribution data are obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring {{the mass of the}} powder discharged from the spring's coils. The size of the particles on the other hand is determined from the spring 'intercoil' distance. The instrument developed by Shaeri had limited use due to its inability to measure sample mass directly. For the device reported here, modifications are made to the original configurations to establish means of direct sample mass measurement. The feasibility of techniques for measuring the mass of powder retained within the spring are investigated in detail. Initially, the measurement of mass is executed in-situ from the vibration characteristics based on the spring's first harmonic resonant frequency. This method is often erratic and unreliable due to the particle-particle-spring wall interactions and the spring bending. An much more successful alternative is found from a more complicated arrangement in which the spring forms part of a stiff cantilever system pivoted along its main axis. Here, the sample mass is determined in the 'static mode' by monitoring the cantilever beam's deflection following the wanton termination of vibration. The system performance has been optimised through the variations of the mechanical design of the key components and the operating procedure as well as taking into account the effect of changes in the ambient temperature on the system's response. The thesis also {{describes the}} design and development of the ancillary mechanisms. These include the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feeding</b> of the test powder into the spring, the non-interfering spring extension mechanism and means for measuring the cantilever deflection and hence the sample mass via a non-contact transducer. For an automated operation, a control software is developed which car allow an unattended analysis whilst providing particle size distribution in real-time. Data are reported in conjunction with a variety of powders with different size, density and shape. Typical resolutions in terms of size and mass measurement are better than #+-# 10 #mu#m and #+-# 0. 1 g respectively.

The Large Eddy Simulation approach is used for the modelling of the air/fuel two-phase flow. A particular treatment for the solid phase has been designed in order to cope with gravity effects.

40|$|On-line {{continuous}} monitoring of pulverized coal in fuel injection pipes will allow power plant operators to optimize fuel conveying conditions {{and ultimately to}} achieve higher combustion efficiency and lower atmospheric emissions. This paper presents the design, implementation and trials of a prototype instrumentation system for the on-line measurement of pulverized coal on a full-scale power plant. An array of three identical arc-shaped electrostatic electrodes is housed in a sensing head to derive particle flow signals. Pulverized coal flow parameters such as velocity, mass flow rate and fuel distribution among the injection pipes from the same pulverizing mill are obtained by processing the signals and fusing the resulting measurements. On-plant demonstration trials on 560 mm bore <b>pneumatic</b> conveying pipes <b>feeding</b> a 600 MW boiler were undertaken following system evaluation tests on a 50 mm bore laboratory test rig.

40|$|Norway is {{the world}} largest {{producer}} of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In 2013 the Norwegian aquaculture industry produced 1. 2 million metric tons salmon {{with the use of}} 1. 5 million metric tons of commercial feeds. The feeds are delivered to the farms in big bags or in bulk and are conveyed pneumatically to the sea cages. Such harsh treatments expose pellets to stress that may give product loss due to abrasion and fragmentation. <b>Feed</b> loss in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feeding</b> systems is estimated to be in the range of 0. 3 % to 1. 5 %. This equals a yearly additional expense of around 40 to 200 million NOK for the Norwegian salmon industry. To minimize product loss the feed has to be of a consistent and high physical quality. Extrusion processing is a technology that enables production of such feed quality. Physical pellet quality is normally improved by the addition of starch and other binders, but recent research has shown that the protein ingredients in the feed mix also impact the physical quality of extruded feed products. During the last decade several new plant derived protein ingredients has been introduced and partly replaced fishmeal. This has introduced new challenges in fish feed extrusion and stressed the importance to improve the knowledge related to the technical properties of the individual ingredients. The main objectives of this work have been to quantify fishmeal physicochemical properties with significant effects on the extrusion cooking process and physical pellet quality, and to study the plasticization effect of water solubles in fishmeal. Various multivariate analytical techniques have been applied in the studies, such as principal component analysis, partial least squares -and multiple linear regression. In Paper I and II, the impact of variation in fishmeal physicochemical properties were assessed based on standardized extrusion, drying and coating conditions. In Paper III the effect of water-soluble protein level and moisture content on the extrusion process, extrudate phase transitions and physical quality of feed were studied. In Paper IV the influence of fishmeal water solubles and added moisture on glass transition and flow-starting temperature were quantified. The studies in Paper I and II document the complexity of fishmeal as a protein ingredient with significant impact on the extrusion process, starch gelatinization and physical pellet quality. Large differences in technical quality within and between the studied fishmeal types (i. e. herring and sand eel) were observed. The research quantifies a positive effect of increased levels of water-soluble protein on pellet durability and hardness. This can be explained by two different mechanisms: a crosslinking effect of large polypeptides and a plasticizing effect of smaller peptides and amino acids. Differences in peptide size distribution between the two studied groups were identified with the highest level of large polypeptides for herring meal. At an equal level of water-soluble protein, extruded feed containing fishmeal from sand eel had significantly lower physical quality than feed containing herring meal. This can be attributed to differences in thermal and rheological properties between the two studied groups, and improper cooking in the extruder barrel for sand eel based feed mixes. Incomplete cooking or transformation may result in increased levels of particles in the extrudates and poor physical feed quality. The studies also document that fishmeal specifications normally used on the world commodity market inadequately describe the technical properties of fishmeal. In Paper III the effects of water-soluble protein level in fishmeal on extrusion behaviour, phase transitions and physical feed quality were studied. The plasticizing effect of water-soluble protein was comparable to that of moisture. However, in contrast to moisture, addition of water-soluble protein had a positive effect on specific mechanical energy and physical pellet quality. No loss of water-soluble protein during the extrusion process could be observed, confirming that the amino acids and peptides do not form any new covalent bonds in the extrusion process. A non-volatile plasticizer like water-soluble protein will not be removed in the drying process. It will therefore influence the viscoelastic properties of the final product and {{have a positive effect on}} physical pellet quality by establishment of an intermolecular binding network through hydrogen-, ionic bond, and hydrophobic interactions. It can be concluded from the study that water-soluble protein can be used as a processing aid for the fish feed industry, serving multiple purposes as nutrient, plasticizer and binder in extruded fish feed. In Paper IV significant effects of fishmeal water solubles and moisture level on the glass transition and flow-starting temperatures have been documented. The effect of solubles level on the glass transition temperature could be modelled based on the Gordon-Taylor equation. The documented plasticizing effect of water solubles was lower than the effect of moister addition per unit mass, but higher on a molar basis. The plasticization effect can be attributed to the content of low molecular nitrogencompounds. The studied fishmeal model system showed a large composition region of water solubles and moisture with a higher difference between the flow-starting and glass transition temperature than for other reported protein components (i. e. casein, gluten and soya protein isolate). This indicates a reduced temperature effect on viscosity reduction in the rubbery phase for fishmeal in this region. Combined with significantly lower glass transition temperatures, such differences in physicochemical properties may contribute to explain the unique functional properties of fishmeal compared to plant based proteins and casein. This will have positive impact on physical pellet quality and open up the possibility to obtain a satisfactory thermomechanical transformation in the extrusion process at reduced moisture level. </p...|$|R
