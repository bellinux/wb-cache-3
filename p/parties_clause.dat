30|$|Bakkehaug et al. (2016) and Vilhelmsen et al. (2017) have {{developed}} a similar model to schedule the voyages of a fleet of ships considering a minimum time spread between some voyages. The former has used the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic to solve the problem, while the latter has used a Decomposition approach with Dynamic Programming algorithm for column generation. Their model focuses on the time spread between voyages {{in response to a}} charter <b>party</b> <b>clause</b> which requires the voyages to be ‘fairly evenly spread’. This requires the voyage to become the model decision variable with a predetermined route and full-load cargo to be transported in each voyage. This might be true for some contracted cargoes, but not true otherwise. Therefore, these two research papers cannot stand as ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ research area as defined earlier.|$|R

An {{agreement}} with Denny, Mott & Dickson Ltd in 1929 {{said they would}} buy wood from Denny, and lease a timber yard with the option to buy it or take a long lease on certain terms. The contract's first four clauses concerned the timber. Clause 5 provided for the contract's termination on notice by either <b>party.</b> <b>Clause</b> 6 provided for the letting of the timber yard [...] "to enable the foresaid trading agreement to be carried out."

Because of the Control of Timber (No 4) Order 1939, further transactions between the parties became impossible from the end of September, 1939. Denny continued to occupy the timber yard.

30|$|This {{review of}} the {{literature}} on ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ and the review items brought about it reveals the fact that research papers are in common attempting to solve the original problem mentioned {{at the beginning of this}} section but with different review comments. Review comments can be sammarised in using a model with deterministic gross profit objective, with little shipping elements and rules, with no checks for validity, and with no facilities for non-OR users to deliver data and to run and interact with the model. This gives rise to the contribution that has been achieved in this paper, namely, the development of an OR-based decision support system which can optimise the ship voyage outcome considering all possible shipping elements and charter <b>party</b> <b>clauses,</b> gross-profit-per-day objective, deterministic and stochastic cargo transport demand, and sensitivity and what-if analysis. The use of gross-profit-per-day objective under deterministic and stochastic cargo transport demand, assuming multiple ships carrying various cargoes simultaneously along with realistic and validated shipping elements and rules, is here presented for the first time in tramp shipping literature. The state-of-the-art Block-Angular Linear Ratio programming methodology is used to solve this formulation (see SOS voyager optimisation model for details). El Noshokaty (1988) has first developed a shipping model with gross profit per day objective for only one ship using Fractional programming methodology.|$|R

40|$|In this Article, Professor Allen Blair {{examines}} the enforceability of no-reliance clauses [...] contractual disclaimers {{designed to prevent}} parties from relying on extra-contractual representations to prove fraudulent inducement claims. Many courts are skeptical of such disclaimers and either refuse to enforce them or will enforce them only subject to substantial restrictions. These courts base their decisions on generic moral prohibitions against lying. This Article argues, however, that these courts reach their conclusion too easily. They presume that no-reliance clauses can serve no legitimate contract function and thus never provide value to parties. But, {{in at least some}} cases between sophisticated <b>parties,</b> no-reliance <b>clauses</b> can-and do-serve valuable contract functions. With the core assumption made by the majority of courts reluctant to enforce no-reliance clauses dispelled, this Article suggests that at least the generic formulations of a moral prohibition against fraud are insufficient to counterbalance the value gained by autonomous parties choosing what they rationally believe to be in their own best interests...|$|R

5000|$|The {{drafting}} {{of the platform}} was a collective effort guided by high-standing party bureaucrats and officials from think tanks. However, there was wide participation from the intelligentsia. There was some criticism on the end product - a clause stated that all {{the means of production}} was to be owned by the state. When the draft version was presented to the 14th plenum of the 10th Central Committee, critics saw it as a step backward because since the 6th Congress, diversified ownership of the means of production had been recognized. Another point was that it alarmed external and internal investors. The 14th plenum eventually decided to include another clause which acknowledged the diversified ownership of the means of production. At the 11th National Congress, the issue was put to a vote, and 65.04 percent supported the motion of removing the clause which did not recognize the diversified ownership of the means of production. Even if it had stayed, it wouldn't have hurt the <b>party.</b> Another <b>clause</b> stated that Vietnam's goal was to [...] "develop a market economy with socialist orientations, which would have many forms of ownership, many parts, many forms of businesses, and many ways of distribution in the economy." ...|$|R
