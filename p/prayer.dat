40|$|One {{might expect}} that the divine person {{addressed}} in <b>prayers</b> by Indonesian Christians matches those in biblical <b>prayers.</b> However, this seems not always to be the case. Since referential differences in such texts are not always obvious, {{the aim of this}} paper is to define steps for identifying who exactly is being addressed. For that purpose, sample <b>prayers</b> in Indonesian are analysed. These samples consist of <b>prayers</b> from an Indonesian Bible translation, Christian <b>prayers</b> in Indonesian books, and spontaneous <b>prayers</b> by Indonesian Christians, which were recorded and transcribed. The following steps were defined: 1) the grammatical analysis of nouns and pronouns, 2) the listing of relevant instances of referents, 3) the assignment of these instances to certain referents and 4) the comparison of the identified referents with the context of the analysed <b>prayers.</b> The findings show that the person addressed in Indonesian Christian <b>prayers</b> cannot reliably be identified without looking at the context. As for the recorded spontaneous <b>prayers,</b> the socio-religious background and a close look at the actual perception of the person praying are crucial for a reliable identification of the referent. This was done by comparing the results with interview responses of these persons. By applying the four mentioned steps, different addressees can be identified in <b>prayers.</b> In the examples of this analysis, the most significant difference was found between the addressee of <b>prayers</b> in the Bible compared to the addressee in spontaneous <b>prayers.</b> While 9 out of 11 Christians spontaneously address Jesus in their <b>prayers,</b> all investigated biblical <b>prayers</b> do not address Jesus. The findings show that the four steps applied are beneficial to a high degree, but in some circumstances, ambiguity may remain...|$|R
