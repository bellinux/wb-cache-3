Commerce in all its shapes I renounced once and for ever. It was too high--or too low--for me; so it would seem that there remained to me only my old business of <b>professional</b> <b>hunting.</b> Once again I must seek those adventures which I had forsworn when my evil star shone so brightly over a gold mine. What was it to be? Elephants, I supposed, since these are the only creatures worth killing from a money point of view. But most of my old haunts had been more or less shot out. The competition of younger professionals, of wandering backveld Boers and even of poaching natives who had obtained guns, was growing severe. If I went at all I should have to travel farther afield.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, <b>{{professional}}</b> <b>hunting</b> guides {{are used}} by water fowlers {{who do not know}} a local area. They are paid to take clients to hunt on leased, or private property, or hunting in local areas in which these professional guides know where to hunt in large public waterfowl hunting areas. If they use an outboard engine on their boat, they must be registered by the USCG as an OUPV operator in all fifty states, and have that license in their boat during the time of operation, and many states require all waterfowl guides to be registered via the state DNR hunting license. Waterfowlers normally employ a guide for a half day or a whole day of hunting. The cost of hiring a guide varies from one hundred fifty dollars for a half day to four hundred dollars for a day. Guides have boats, blinds, decoys, and dogs for retrieving ducks or geese. They know flight patterns of game and know how to call ducks or geese in. They know how to set up decoys. Some guides specialize in certain types of waterfowl while others will be more generalists. Some guides specialize in sea hunting while others will specialize in bay hunting, river hunting, lake hunting or swamp hunting. Guides may have houses for hunters to sleep for the night. They may provide the service of cleaning the game and keeping it on ice in coolers or refrigerators. Guides may have coffin blinds or more fancy house blinds, that provide seats and heating. Guides are usually registered with the state that they guide in.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of the double rifle has always followed the {{development of}} the double-barrelled shotgun, the two are generally very similar but the stresses of firing a solid projectile are far greater than shot. The first double-barrelled muskets were created in the 1830s when deer stalking became popular in Scotland. Previously single barrelled weapons had been used but, recognising the need for a rapid second shot to dispatch a wounded animal, double-barrelled muskets were built along the same format as double-barrelled shotguns already in common use. These first double-barrelled weapons were black powder, smoothbore muzzleloaders built with either flintlock or percussion cap ignition systems. Whilst true rifling dates from the mid 16th century, the invention of the express rifle by James Purdey [...] "the Younger" [...] in 1856 allowed for far greater muzzle velocities to be achieved through a rifled longarm, significantly improving the trajectory and as such greatly improving the range of these rifles. [...] These express rifles had two deep opposing grooves which were wide and deep enough to prevent the lead bullets from stripping the rifling if fired at high velocities, a significant problem previously. These muzzle loading rifles came in a large variety of calibres, the most common calibres for medium thin skinned plains and deer sized game were [...]400 in, [...]450 in, [...]500 in, [...]577 in and 12 bore (18.5 mm or [...]729 in). For larger thick skinned type game 10 bore (19.7 mm or [...]775 in), 8 bore (21.2 mm or [...]835 in) and 4 bore (26.7 mm or 1.05 in) were used, the last being a specialist elephant hunting calibre. Whilst most of these calibres could be purchased with rifling, the giant 4 bore and the less common 6 bore were rarely rifled, as the increased friction from the rifling caused excessive recoil. Various experimental breech loaders had been in existence since the 16th century, however developments such as the Ferguson rifle in the 1770s and early pinfire cartridges in the 1830s had little impact on sporting rifles due to their experimental nature, expense and the extraordinary strength and reliability of the percussion muzzleloader. [...] In 1858, Westley Richards patented the break open, top leaver breech loading action, whilst a useful development these early break open designs {{had a great deal of}} elasticity in the action and upon firing they sprung open slightly, a problem that gradually worsened with repeated firing and with more powerful cartridges. Many gunmakers tried various methods to rectify this problem, all to little avail until Westley Richards invented the [...] "Dolls head" [...] lock in 1862 which greatly improved rigidity, this was followed by James Purdey's under-locking mechanism in 1863 and W.W. Greener's [...] "Wedge fast" [...] system in 1873, finally the basic break open action known to this day had the strength required to meet the stresses of large-bore projectiles. By 1914, triple, quadruple and even quintuple locking designs could be found in various proprietary actions. In 1861 the centrefire rifle cartridge was invented, and quickly a large number of blackpowder centrefire cartridges were developed in the same calibres as their muzzle loading forebears, [...] including the [...]450/400 Black Powder Express, the extremely popular [...]450 Black Powder Express, the [...]500 Black Powder Express and the [...]577 Black Powder Express, all with various case lengths. The first brass 10 bore, 8 bore and 4 bore cartridges were not developed until 1870, their arrival spelling the end of the muzzle loading era. Until this time all double rifles had external hammers whose fall struck the mechanism which fired the cartridge, however attempts to remove them were well under way. The first [...] "hammerless" [...] action of significance was invented by Thomas Murcott in 1871, known as [...] "The Mousetrap", it was a complex design but it sold in significant numbers. In 1875, Westley Richards employees William Anson and John Deeley patented the [...] "Anson & Deeley" [...] hammerless boxlock action, and in 1878 the Birmingham gunmakers W&C Scott & Son invented the basic sidelock action which was so successful it was immediately adopted by Holland & Holland. By 1900 the boxlock and sidelock hammerless actions had largely superseded the hammer rifles and, with the addition of ejectors and assisted opening, the basic design of the double rifle has changed little to this day. Interestingly, it was Westley Richards who invented the first reliable safety catch for doubles, ejectors, the single selective trigger and the special extractors that enabled rimless cartridges to be used in double rifles, all features found in modern double rifles. In 1898, John Rigby & Company loaded the [...]450 Black Powder Express with smokeless cordite creating the [...]450 Nitro Express, the first Nitro Express cartridge, this was to have a profound impact on sporting cartridge development and the double rifle was to become synonymous with the Nitro Express cartridges. Now in its final form and chambering modern Nitro Express cartridges, the British double rifle entered its golden age at the turn of 20th century and it was to last for the next three decades, with the birth of the White hunter and <b>professional</b> <b>hunting</b> safari industry in East Africa.|$|E

This study used the input-output (social accounting matrix) and multiplier analyses to evaluate {{the economic impact of}} hunting in the regional economy of the Northern Cape province. Data on biltong hunting were derived from a national survey conducted in 2007 and data on trophy hunting were derived from the <b>Professional</b> <b>Hunting</b> Association of South Africa (PHASA). The results indicated that the direct economic impact of hunting in the Northern Cape province economy, resulting from increased expenditure, exceeded R 696. 1 million for 2007.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the enforcement of the law governing commercial kangaroo killing, focusing particularly upon inspectorial practices. Australia’s kangaroo industry is the largest commercial kill of land-based wildlife in the world. <b>Professional</b> shooters <b>hunt</b> kangaroos in rural and remote locations at night. Due to the remote and decentralised nature of the killing, the industry presents unique challenges to law enforcement agencies that are responsible for the enforcement of animal welfare standards. This article focuses upon the role that inspections have in detecting offences within the commercial kangaroo industry. It provides a comparative analysis across the states, highlighting key differences in terms of inspectorial practices and the resulting outcomes. A common theme across all of the jurisdictions is that none of the agencies responsible for enforcement regularly conduct inspections of shooters, making it impossible to ensure that these parties are complying with the National Code of Practice for the Humane Shooting of Kangaroos and Wallabies. Recommendations for reform are offered, including stronger compliance policy, higher rates of inspection, increased resourcing and the introduction of alternative methods of inspection...|$|R
