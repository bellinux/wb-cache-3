40|$|This master thesis has {{investigated}} the possible application of voltage source converters (VSC) for the interconnection of offshore installations, i. e. wind farms and petroleum platforms, in a multiterminal DC (MTDC) grid. The master thesis is written at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of Electric Power Engineering {{and is a}} continuation of the project written during the autumn of 2009. The work has been carried out in cooperation with Statnett SF, the Norwegian TSO, as a contribution to an ongoing research and development program on offshore electrification. The motivation behind this thesis is the possibilities the VSC technology bring about for the realization of renewable wind energy far from shore and supplying petroleum installations from the main onshore grid, thus reducing emissions. A theoretical study has been conducted, describing the VSC technology from basic operation to topics related to the implementation of a high power rated offshore MTDC grid. A suggested model of a small power system was established in the simulation program PSS®E. The model consisted of a four converter MTDC connecting three separate AC systems. One of the AC systems was a simplified representation of a main onshore grid, and the other two were small offshore AC grids made up of a wind farm and a petroleum platform. The MTDC was modeled using ABB 9 ̆ 2 s HVDC Light Open model v 1. 1. 9 - 2, developed for use in PSS®E. A series of dynamic simulations have been performed using the model to demonstrate and analyze the principles of operation for a MTDC and the interaction between the AC systems and the MTDC. The dynamic simulations demonstrate the basic operation of a MTDC with a master-slave control scheme for the active power control, as implemented in the HVDC Light model. The simulation results confirm the functionality of a MTDC as described in the theoretical analysis of the technology. The analysis based on both the literature and simulations conclude that VSC technology is a realistic solution for an offshore grid with the objective of supporting passive network installations far from shore. Simulation results conclude that an advanced control system for the active <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>operation</b> (Poption) of all the converters in a MTDC may greatly improve the performance of the system following a disturbance. Both theoretically and through simulations it has been demonstrated that the VSC MTDC provides stability improvements to the connected AC grid, by actively controlling the injected active and reactive power to the grid. The possibility to use the MTDC as an alternative path for transferring large amounts of power has been investigated, and this was found to be beneficial for the system. The difficulties related to fault protection in a MTDC have been highlighted, and a theoretical analysis concluded that the protection scheme using IGBT circuit breakers is the preferred solution with present available technology...|$|E

Conversely, when the coolant water temperature decreases, its density increases and a greater number of neutrons reach the required thermal energy, increasing the number of fissions per unit of time, creating more heat.

40|$|The {{linearization}} of a {{power flow}} (PF) model is an important approach for simplifying and accelerating the calculation of a <b>power</b> system's <b>control,</b> <b>operation,</b> and optimization. Traditional model-based methods derive linearized PF models by making approximations in the analytical PF model according to the physical characteristics of the power system. Today, more measurements of the power system are available and thus facilitate data-driven approaches beyond model-driven approaches. This work studies a linearized PF model through a data-driven approach. Both a forward regression model ((P, Q) {{as a function of}} (theta, V)) and an inverse regression model ((theta, V) as a function of (P, Q)) are proposed. Partial least square (PLS) - and Bayesian linear regression (BLR) -based algorithms are designed to address data collinearity and avoid overfitting. The proposed approach is tested on a series of IEEE standard cases, which include both meshed transmission grids and radial distribution grids, with both Monte Carlo simulated data and public testing data. The results show that the proposed approach can realize a higher calculation accuracy than model-based approaches can. The results also demonstrate that the obtained regression parameter matrices of data-driven models reflect power system physics by demonstrating similar patterns with some power system matrices (e. g., the admittance matrix).

40|$|We {{consider}} {{single cell}} multi-user OFDMA downlink resource allocation on a flat-fading channel such that average supply power is minimized while fulfilling {{a set of}} target rates. Available degrees of freedom are transmission power and duration. This paper extends our previous work on power optimal resource allocation in the mobile downlink by detailing the optimal <b>power</b> <b>control</b> strategy investigation and extracting fundamental characteristics of power optimal operation in cellular downlink. We find that only a system wide allocation of transmit powers is optimal rather than on link level. The allocation strategy that minimizes overall power consumption requires the transmission power on all links to be increased if only one link degrades. Furthermore, we show that for mobile stations with equal channels but different rate requirements, it is power optimal to assign equal transmit powers with proportional transmit durations. To relate the effectiveness of <b>power</b> <b>control</b> to live <b>operation,</b> we take the power model into consideration which maps transmit power to supply power.
