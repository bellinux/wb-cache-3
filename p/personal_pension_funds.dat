40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} and compares the performance, performance persistence and fund flows for UK equity unit trusts/OEICs and UK equity unit-linked personal pensions over the sample period January 1980 to December 2007. Unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> are an illiquid investment from the investorâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s perspective since any invested capital is inaccessible until retirement whereas for unit trusts/OEICs capital invested can be withdrawn at any time. Since decreasing {{returns to scale}} from fund flows are the equilibrating mechanism in Berk and Green (2004) that results in no persistence in performance the illiquid nature of unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> should ensure more evidence of performance persistence in comparison to unit trusts/OEICs. I find significant evidence using performance ranked portfolio strategies that underlying portfolios that are only composed of unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> have greater performance persistence than unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> that have underlying portfolios that also include at least a unit trust/OEIC. This evidence is consistent with Berk and Green (2004) since the illiquid nature of <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> results in an attenuated performance fund flow relationship restricting the equilibrating mechanism. However, there are anomalies in the performance persistence results in relation to Berk and Green (2004) {{but it could be}} due to the differential between the number of non-surviving unit trusts/OEICs and non-surviving unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> I also find that the performance fund flow relationship based on abnormal returns from a Carhart four factor model for both UK equity unit trusts/OEICs and UK unit-linked personal pensions is convex but the performance fund flow relationship is more attenuated for the unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> For the worst performing unit trusts/OEICs there are outflows on average whereas for unit-linked personal pensions there are fund inflows on average. For performance persistence tests conditional on underlying portfolio fund flows unit trusts/OEICs that have the worst performance but the lowest net fund flows in the ranking period have significantly greater subsequent performance in comparison to the unit trusts/OEICs that have the worst performance but the highest net fund flows in the ranking period. This empirical evidence provides support for Berk and Green (2004) but for the unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> the evidence is less convincing. There is very little evidence that UK equity unit-trusts/OEICs or UK equity unit-linked personal pensions produce abnormal returns. These results are robust across the single index (CAPM) model, the Fama and French three factor model and the Carhart four factor model for both conditional and unconditional models. There is also no evidence that unit trusts/OEICs or unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> can time the market. There is a significantly negative timing effect across unconditional factor models which becomes insignificant for the conditional models. There is also no evidence that unit trusts/OEICs have significantly different performance than unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|E

The study covers 8, 255 <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> from across all 30 ABI investment sectors that operated in the UK in the 1980 - 2009 period. Of these, 4, 531 pension funds are compared against their PPBs. We find convincing evidence that pension funds lack long-term performance targets. The existing PPBs are easy to outperform given that funds are allowed to diversify in assets not included in their PPBs, and the PPBs have a poor long-term performance against T-bills.

40|$|The {{pension fund}} {{industry}} affects an enormous {{proportion of the}} world population and consists of more than $ 20 trillion of assets globally. Hence the performance of pension funds has major effects. This thesis investigates the performance of <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> in the UK, {{one of the leading}} pension industries in the world. It identifies two important factors that are largely overlooked in the related literature: fund’s age and management outsourcing. Based on the ‘career concerns’ argument by Holmström (1999), it tests whether fund performance is age dependent, and in particular, whether funds perform better when they are young than when they ‘mature’. Moreover, one of the major features of the pension fund industry has been the enormous growth in management outsourcing. This thesis addresses this issue and tests whether there are differences in the performance between outsourced and internally managed funds, and investigates potential determinants of the decision to outsource. It argues that a ‘fashion to outsource’ may be partially responsible for the trend. Given that a CAPM-APT based analysis is not appropriate for the data at hand, the thesis employs three alternative performance measures, two of which utilise fund-specific benchmarks. The results show that risk-adjusted returns are statistically insignificantly different from zero but funds significantly outperform their benchmarks. Performance is found to change with fund’s age but this relationship is more complex than a simple ‘career-concern’ argument would predict. Risk-adjusted returns of the internally managed and the outsourced funds are both indifferent from zero but the outsourced funds are better at outperforming their benchmarks. Lastly, there is some evidence of a ‘fashion to outsource’. This research is novel in several ways. It provides the first detailed investigation of the performance of the UK <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> It is the first to address the question of potential factors (other than managerial characteristics) that may explain fund performance. It discusses the rise of outsourcing in the industry and analyses differences/similarities between performance of the outsourced and the internal funds. Finally, it is the first to investigate whether the rapid increase in outsourcing is due to ‘fashion’. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between fund and provider characteristics, and fund performance using a sample of 4, 197 U. K <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> operated by 35 providers over a 30 years ’ period (1980 – 2009). The fund performance is measured {{on an annual basis}} (short-term) and over the whole period of fund operation (longterm). We find substantial differences in which factors explain performance in the short- and long-run and whether the performance is measured against T-bills or against fund chosen prospectus benchmarks. Although big providers tend to perform better than their prospectus benchmarks on an annual basis, they underperform T-bills over the period of fund life. The provider’s extent of specialisation positively covaries with benchmark outperformance measured on an annual basis, but does not result in superior performance over funds ’ operational life. In the long-run, fund performance is positively associated with market concentration and negatively with fund age. We also find that the timing of opening funds matters for their long-term returns, and, on average, funds lose more money during bear markets than they make during bull markets. Policy implications are discussed.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model for the {{accumulation}} phase of a defined-contribution pension plan with cash and n risky assets and non-hedgeable salary risk. The model considers a policyholder who pays a constant proportion of his salary, S(t), into a <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> <b>fund,</b> W (t). At the time of retirement, T, the fund is converted into an annuity which depends not just upon the fund size but also prevailing rates of interest at the time of retirement. The success of any asset-allocation strategy is measured using a terminal utility function that depends on the replacement ratio (that is, pension as a proportion of final salary), or, more generally, on W (T) and the risk-free rate of interest, r(T), at T. The problem considered is how should we invest in order to maximise expected terminal utility. We find that it is optimal to invest in a time and interest-rate-dependent combination of three portfolios. The composition of the three portfolios is shown not to depend on time or on the presence of non-hedgeable salary risk. The precise mix of the three portfolios does, of course, depend upon both of these factors. Finally we consider the power utility function and, in combination with zero nonhedgeable salary risk, develop closed form solutions for the optimal strategy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Becoming {{self-employed}} has {{appeal to}} both genders. For many women, balancing {{work and family}} is a key motivator. However, businesses {{owned and operated by}} women are often very small, with limited turnover. This potentially can have disastrous consequences when these women come to retire, unless a solid retirement savings strategy has been considered. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline many of the issues and implications of a lack of research in this area. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 201 small business owners via a convenience sample derived from various databases. The survey was completed on-line and analysed using SPSS. Findings - Many self-employed women in Australia have neither enough savings for their retirement, or an actual retirement plan. This is exacerbated by the lack of regulation requiring mandatory contributions into a superannuation (<b>personal</b> <b>pension)</b> <b>fund</b> by small business owners, unlike pay as you go employees, whose employers must contribute a certain about on their behalf. Social implications - Middle-to-older aged women are the biggest cohort of homeless people in Australia. This is likely to grow as self-employed Baby Boomers stop working and find they do not have sufficient personal financial resources to fund their retirement. Originality/value - Whereas there is much written about gender and small business ownership, as well as retirement and savings planning, these two areas have not been researched before in Australia. Yet it is an issue for the majority of small business owners, particularly women...|$|R

The increasing importance that <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> have acquired in today’s economy and financial market, raises special attention from investors, financial actors and pundits in the sector. Regarding this economic weight of <b>pension</b> <b>funds,</b> a thorough analysis of the performance of different <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plans in order to optimise benefits need to be undertaken. The research explores criteria and invariants that make it possible to compare the performance of different <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> products. <b>Pension</b> <b>fund</b> companies currently do measure their performances with those of others. Likewise, the individual investing in a pension plan compares different products available in the market. There exist different ways of measuring the performance of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> according to their different schemes. Generally, there exist two main <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plans. The defined benefit (DB) <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plan which is mostly preferred by pension members due to his ability to hold the risk to the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> manager. The defined contributions (DC) <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> plan on the other hand, is more popularly preferred by the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> managers due to its ability to transfer the risk to the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members. One of the reasons that motivate <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members’ choices of entering into a certain programme is that their expectations of maintaining their living lifestyle after retirement are met by the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> strategies. This dissertation investigates the various properties and characteristics of the defined contribution <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> plan with a minimum guarantee and benchmark in order to mitigate the risk that <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members are subject to. For the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> manager the aim is to find the optimal asset allocation strategy which optimises its retribution which is in fact a part of the surplus (the difference between the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> value and the guarantee) (2004) [19] and to analyse the effect of sharing between the contributor and the <b>pension</b> <b>fund.</b> From the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members’ perspective it is to define a optimal guarantee as a solution to the contributor’s optimisation programme. In particular, we consider a case of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> company which invests in a bond, stocks and a money market account. The uncertainty in the financial market is driven by Brownian motions. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the different models...|$|R

Will this lead to higher contributions? Will higher contributions increase labor costs and reduce employment? Does this mechanism exacerbate economic downturns? What are the economic effects of <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> regulation? This paper develops a theoretical model to address these questions. Although its scope is more general, the model captures the main institutional features of the pension system in the Netherlands, a country where the economic effects of the pension shock are widely debated.
