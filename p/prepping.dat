40|$|TALE (three {{amino acid}} loop extension) {{homeodomain}} proteins include the PBC and the MEINOX sub-families. MEINOX proteins form heterodimer complexes with PBC proteins. Heterodimerization {{is crucial to}} DNA binding and for nuclear localization. PBC-MEINOX heterodimers bind DNA also in combination with HOX proteins, thereby modulating their DNA-binding specificity. TALE proteins therefore play crucial roles in multiple developmental and differentiation pathways in vivo. We report the identification and characterization of a novel human gene homologous to <b>PREP</b> 1, called <b>PREP</b> 2. Sequence comparisons indicate that <b>PREP</b> 1 and <b>PREP</b> 2 define a novel sub-family of MEINOX proteins, distinct from the MEIS sub-family. <b>PREP</b> 2 is expressed {{in a variety of}} human adult tissues and displays a more restricted expression pattern than <b>PREP</b> 1. <b>PREP</b> 2 is capable of heterodimerizing with PBC proteins. Heterodimerization with PBX 1 appears to be essential for nuclear localization of both <b>PREP</b> 2 and PBX 1. A comparison between the functional properties of <b>PREP</b> 1 and <b>PREP</b> 2 reveals that <b>PREP</b> 2 -PBX display a faster DNA-dissociation rate than <b>PREP</b> 1 -PBX heterodimers, suggesting different roles in controlling gene expression. Like <b>PREP</b> 1, <b>PREP</b> 2 -PBX heterodimers are capable of forming ternary complexes with HOXB 1.

40|$|Although <b>PrEP</b> {{is not yet}} {{registered}} in Europe, including the Netherlands, its approval and implementation are expected in the near future. To inform future pre-exposure prophylaxis (<b>PrEP)</b> implementation, this study aimed to gain insight into motives and preferences for daily or intermittent <b>PrEP</b> use among Dutch HIV-negative men having sex with men (MSM). Between February and December 2013, semistructured interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached (N = 20). Interviews were analyzed using the Grounded Theory approach. Motives for (not) using daily <b>PrEP</b> were based on beliefs about <b>PrEP</b> efficacy and side effects, preferences for other prevention strategies, self-perceived HIV risk, self-perceived efficacy of <b>PrEP</b> adherence, beliefs about possible benefits (e. g., anxiety reduction, sex life improvement), and barriers of <b>PrEP</b> use (e. g., costs, monitoring procedures). The perceived benefits of intermittent versus daily <b>PrEP</b> use were the lower costs and side effects and the lower threshold to decision to start using intermittent <b>PrEP.</b> Barriers of intermittent <b>PrEP</b> versus daily <b>PrEP</b> use were the perceived need to plan their sex life and adhere to multiple prevention strategies. Although some perceived <b>PrEP</b> as a condom substitute, others were likely to combine <b>PrEP</b> and condoms for sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention and increased HIV protection. Participants preferred <b>PrEP</b> service locations to have specialized knowledge of HIV, antiretroviral therapy, sexual behavior, STIs, patients' medical background, be easily approachable, {{be able to perform}} <b>PrEP</b> follow-up monitoring, and provide support. To maximize the public health impact of <b>PrEP,</b> ensuring high uptake among MSM at highest risk is important. Therefore, targeted information about <b>PrEP</b> efficacy and side effects need to be developed, barriers for accessing <b>PrEP</b> services should be minimized, and perceived self-efficacy to use <b>PrEP</b> should be addressed and improved.

Discussing the hair, Hartley-Thomas said [...] "Elinor's hair is always quite neat and done, where Marianne, being a freer character and more rebellious, she has lots of different looks and lots of wild looks with the hair loose." [...] She also explained that some of the male actors wore wigs because the men in those days would have had a lot more volume to their hair, whereas the modern styles tend to be shorter and clippered.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead <b>prepping</b> the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E
500|$|First Contact was {{the first}} Star Trek film to make {{significant}} use of computer-generated starship models, though physical miniatures were still used for the most important vessels. With the Enterprise-D destroyed during the events of Generations, the task of creating a new starship fell to veteran Star Trek production designer Herman Zimmerman. The script's only guide on {{the appearance of the}} vessel was the line [...] "the new Enterprise sleekly comes out of the nebula". Working with illustrator John Eaves, the designers conceived the new Sovereign Class Enterprise-E as [...] "leaner, sleeker, and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine". Braga and Moore intended it to be more muscular and militaryesque. Eaves looked at the structure of previous Enterprise iterations, and designed a more streamlined, capable war vessel than the Enterprise-D, reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the nacelles. Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes. Working from blueprints created by Paramount's Rick Sternbach, the model shop at effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fabricated a [...] miniature over a five-month period. Hull patterns were carved out of wood, then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature. The model's panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture. The crew had multiple difficulties in <b>prepping</b> the miniature for filming; while the model shop originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass, the material came out tacky. ILM instead cut the windows using a laser. Slides of the sets were added behind the window frames to make the interior seem more dimensional when the camera tracked past the ship.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Since 2015, the World Health Organization {{recommends}} {{pre-exposure prophylaxis}} (<b>PrEP)</b> for all persons at substantial risk for HIV, including HIV-uninfected partners in serodiscordant relationships in resource-limited settings. As <b>PrEP</b> moves from clinical trials to real-world use, understanding facilitators of and barriers to <b>PrEP</b> initiation and adherence {{is critical to}} successful <b>PrEP</b> implementation and rollout. Methods: We conducted 44 in-depth individual or couple interviews with 63 participants (30 without HIV and 33 with HIV) enrolled in the Partners Demonstration Project in Kisumu, Kenya, between August and September 2014. The semi-structured interviews discussed the following: 1) perceived {{advantages and disadvantages of}} antiretroviral therapy (ART) /PrEP; 2) reasons for accepting or declining ART/PrEP and 3) influence of prevention of transmission to partner or infant on ART/PrEP use. Transcripts from the interviews were iteratively analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Our study identified three key factors that may facilitate initiation of <b>PrEP</b> in this population. First, participants using <b>PrEP</b> felt reduced stress and increased trust in their HIV serodiscordant relationships. Second, greater community-wide knowledge of <b>PrEP</b> was thought to likely increase <b>PrEP</b> acceptance. Third, greater education and counselling by providers on <b>PrEP</b> use was also considered to likely increase the adoption of <b>PrEP.</b> We also identified three key barriers to initiation of and adherence to <b>PrEP.</b> First, most participants who declined <b>PrEP</b> expressed doubts about the relative additional effectiveness of <b>PrEP</b> in combination with other prevention tools. Second, perceived stigma related to <b>PrEP</b> use was an important barrier to <b>PrEP</b> initiation. Third, many struggled with overcoming perceived side effects or logistical challenges of taking daily <b>PrEP,</b> particularly when they themselves were not ill. Conclusions: Leveraging the facilitators and overcoming barriers to <b>PrEP</b> uptake may enhance the successful rollout of <b>PrEP</b> among HIV serodiscordant couples in Kenya and other areas in sub-Saharan Africa, thereby reducing sexual transmission of HIV. Further research focused on how best to provide counselling on combination HIV prevention tools in the context of <b>PrEP</b> use is a crucial next step to delivering <b>PrEP...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>PreP</b> is the Aβ-degrading {{protease}} in mitochondria. Immune-depletion of <b>PreP</b> {{in brain}} mitochondria prevents degradation of mitochondrial Aβ, and <b>PreP</b> activity is found diminished in AD patients. It {{has been reported}} that the loss of <b>PreP</b> activity is due to methionine oxidation and this study provides a rational basis for therapeutic intervention in conditions characterized by excessive oxidation of <b>PreP.</b> A recent study also suggests that <b>PreP</b> regulates islet amyloid polypeptide in beta cells.|$|R
40|$|Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (<b>PrEP)</b> {{has been}} {{promoted}} among high-risk populations as an effective HIV biomedical intervention. However, limited research {{is available on the}} significance of culturally informed biomedical interventions for Latino MSM. A total of 159 self-administered Internet surveys were completed by Latino MSM ages 21 - 30 in San Antonio, Texas. The purpose of this research was to develop an instrument that measured Latino MSM attitudes and beliefs towards <b>PrEP,</b> identify associations between demographic factors and <b>PrEP</b> related factors and to suggest culturally appropriate strategies for the promotion of <b>PrEP</b> among the Latino MSM population. Research findings revealed implications for <b>PrEP</b> at the structural and individual level for Latino MSM. Structural level indicators emphasized the importance for raising <b>PrEP</b> awareness among Latino MSM in regards to <b>PrEP</b> related expenses, ameliorating stigmatization of high-risk populations, enhancing access to <b>PrEP</b> informed medical providers, and address mistrust of the government and medical providers role on addressing health disparities among Latino MSM. Overall, the findings for individual factors emphasize the need for patient-centered interventions for Latino MSM. Latino MSM currently on <b>PrEP</b> require supplemental resources to enhance <b>PrEP</b> adherence. Latino MSM not on <b>PrEP</b> require alternate options for <b>PrEP</b> delivery and/or cognitive behavioral approaches minimizing HIV risk behavior for Latino MSM concerned with <b>PrEP</b> toxicity, which may require non-biomedical interventions. Integration of Latino MSM currently on <b>PrEP</b> as peer educators provides a valuable resource for developing culturally informed <b>PrEP</b> interventions for Latino MSM. Peer educators are able to share their experiential knowledge of <b>PrEP</b> contextualized through cultural norms, beliefs, and values...|$|R
