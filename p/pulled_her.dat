5|$|On May 31, 2014 Kai {{appeared}} on West Coast Wrestling Connection, slapping Kylie Sutton for allegedly implying {{that she was}} old. The following week, Kai was scheduled to face Sutton in a match. After refusing to participate, she forced her manager Jonny Fairplay to take her place. Sutton won the match by DQ after Kai entered the ring and attacked her, before referees <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> off.|$|E
5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E

60|$|She found that, {{in all her}} {{outgoings}} and her incomings, he prevented her. Gradually {{she realized}} that she was being borne down by him, borne down by the clinging, heavy weight of him, that he was <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> down as a leopard clings to a wild cow and exhausts <b>her</b> and <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> down.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person <b>pulled</b> <b>her,</b> the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
25|$|As she {{was being}} pulled out, Krekian grabbed another little girl's arm and <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> out as well.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 1944 Citrus {{departed}} Petersburg {{to render}} assistance to ATS Brunswick aground in Wrangell Narrows.

25|$|Three of {{the women}} claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.|$|E
25|$|On July 4, 2007, at 11:00a.m., a 29-year-old female from Fort Wayne, Indiana {{died after}} {{collapsing}} {{near the edge}} of The Wave, falling face-down into two inches of water. Lifeguards immediately responded and <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> out, then attempted to revive her with help from park medical personnel. Resuscitation attempts continued as the victim was transported by ambulance to Jasper Memorial Hospital, where she died. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be congestive heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the twenty}} {{who survived the}} sinking, only one was a female. Anna Boecker was a shy, quiet maid in the {{employment}} of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined the terrified crush of passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna was alone in the treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat spotted her foundering in the water and <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> up to safety.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the agency}} {{representing}} Blair did not send {{her for the}} role, Blair's mother took her to meet with Warner Bros.'s casting department and then with Friedkin. Pamelyn Ferdin, a veteran of science fiction and supernatural drama, was {{a candidate for the}} role of Regan, but was ultimately turned down because her career thus far had made her too familiar to the public. April Winchell was considered, until she developed pyelonephritis, which caused her to be hospitalized and ultimately taken out of consideration. Denise Nickerson, who played Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, was considered, but the material troubled her parents too much, and they <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> out of consideration. Anissa Jones, known for her role as Buffy in Family Affair, auditioned for the role, but she too was rejected, for much the same reason as Ferdin. The part went instead to Blair, a relative unknown until the film's success.|$|E
25|$|Knorr also {{believed}} that her fourth husband, Chet Harris, had turned Suesan into a witch, so Suesan received the worst of Knorr's abuse. After one severe beating, Suesan ran away from home. She {{was picked up by}} police and placed in a psychiatric hospital where she told staff that her mother abused her. Knorr denied the abuse claims and told the hospital staff that Suesan had mental issues. Authorities did not investigate the matter further and released Suesan back into her mother's custody. Knorr punished Suesan for running away by beating her while wearing a pair of leather gloves. She also forced her other children to take turns beating their sister. In the subsequent weeks, Knorr handcuffed Suesan to her bed and ordered her other children to stand watch over her. Knorr refused to let Suesan leave the house and forced her to drop out of school. Knorr also <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> other children out of school, and most of them never advanced past the eighth grade.|$|E

25|$|A {{shocking}} {{series of}} incidents {{occurred in the}} locality of Hessilhead, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie. The servant complained to his master and Gabriel went to his brother at the old Thirdpart mansion for advice. John advised him to seek revenge {{and the next morning}} Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead Castle where they found the lady alone, upon which they grabbed her by the hair, <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> onto the floor, kicked her in the bowels, and bruised her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird, Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds.|$|E
25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after {{a bit more than}} 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of the}} Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E

500|$|Both athletes {{participated in}} the triple jump event. Yordanys Durañona {{qualified}} for the male's event by meeting qualification standards.

500|$|The {{news media}} {{would have liked}} to have it a {{dramatic}} bloody mess—a struggle between mom and pop for the custody of the child. [...] It was nothing like that. [...] It was a simple accident. [...] Kongo was in one part of the double cage, Lulu in another, and between them was a partition of narrow bars. [...] Lulu had Patty Cake in her arms and when Patty reached in between the narrow bars to touch her father, Lulu suddenly <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> away. [...] But Patty's arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke. [...] It was a freak accident. [...] No one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} five months, Pattycake was {{sharing the}} Lion House with Lulu and Kongo at the Central Park Zoo. [...] On March 20, 1973, an {{accident}} occurred that was attributed more to clumsiness than to parenting skills. [...] Although no staff were on hand to see it directly, according to visitors, while little Pattycake was reaching out to her father through the bars of her cage, her right arm became stuck somehow when her mother Lulu <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> away, breaking her right arm. Zoo handlers had to subdue Lulu with a tranquilizer dart to remove Pattycake and treat her injury. [...] While experts considered the incident an accident, the media sensationalized the event.
