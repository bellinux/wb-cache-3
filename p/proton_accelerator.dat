5|$|Homer ignores {{his studies}} and instead focuses on his preconceived notions of college life through {{adolescent}} movies and TV shows, {{such as the}} fictional The School of Hard Knockers, which stereotype college life as pranks, partying and rigid deans. He also insults the college dean, Dean Peterson, believing {{him to be a}} crusty, conservative administrator. In reality, Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young. Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a <b>proton</b> <b>accelerator</b> operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University. The prank involves kidnapping the other school's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-a-lot. However, Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor, and Benjamin, Doug, and Gary are blamed for the incident.|$|E

Such compact sources have the potential to offer access of science and industry to neutrons as local national or regional medium-flux, but high-brilliance neutron facilities. The project aims to deliver a “High-Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) ”, where a compact neutron production and moderator system provide thermal and cold neutrons with high brilliance efficiently extracted in an optimized neutron transport system. With shaping the experiment from the source to the detector a holistic neutron experiment could be set-up for the specific scientific requirements in a flexible and efficient way for the neutron user. This presents a particular challenge for the appropriate neutron transport systems to deliver the full brilliance of the source to the sample. Neutron lenses, ballistic guides and focusing systems will be requested to minimize any loss in brilliance and neutron flux. In this report we will present a brief outline of the JCNS HBS project and discuss resulting requirements on neutron transport devices...|$|R
