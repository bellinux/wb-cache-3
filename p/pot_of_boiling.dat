5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards {{around the kitchen table}} until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water, the water is then reduced to a simmer, and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E

500|$|String hoppers, {{which are}} made of rice flour and look like knitted {{vermicelli}} neatly laid out in circular pieces about [...] in diameter, are frequently combined with tomato sothi (a soup) and curries for breakfast and dinner. Another common item is puttu, a granular, dry, but soft steamed rice powder cooked in a bamboo cylinder with the base wrapped in cloth so that the bamboo flute can be set upright over a clay <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water. This can be transformed into varieties such as ragi, spinach, and tapioca puttu. There are also sweet and savoury puttus. Another popular breakfast or dinner dish is Appam, a thin crusty pancake made with rice flour, with a round soft crust in the middle. It has variations such as egg or milk Appam.|$|E
500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water {{for as long as it}} takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

60|$|This {{used to be}} {{a common}} and much-practised ordeal in Madagascar in days but {{recently}} past. It consisted in the administration of poison. Other ordeals existed in the island--such as passing a red-hot iron over the tongue, or plunging the naked arm into a large <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water and picking out a pebble thrown therein for the purpose of trial. Alas for both innocent and guilty subjected to either trial! But the ordeal most universally in favour was that of the Tangena.|$|E
60|$|Alric did {{not wait}} to hear {{the end of this}} answer, but pushing past the old man, hastened to the trap-door under the eaves and opened it. He found, however, that he could not use his bow in the {{constrained}} position necessary to enable him to shoot through the hole. In desperation he seized a barrel that chanced to be at hand, and overturned its contents on the heads of the foe. It happened to contain rye-flour, and the result was that two of the assailants were nearly blinded, while two others who stood beside them burst into a loud laugh, and, seizing the battle-axes which the others had been using, continued their efforts to drive in the door. By this time old Ivor had joined Alric. He set down the <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water {{by the side of the}} hole, and at once emptied its contents on the heads of the vikings, who uttered a terrific yell and leaped backward as the scalding water flowed over their heads and shoulders. A similar cry from the other door of the house told that the defence there had been equally successful. Almost at the same moment Alric discovered a small slit in the roof through which he could observe the enemy. He quickly sent through it an arrow, which fixed itself in the left shoulder of one of the men. This had the effect of inducing the attacking party to draw off for the purpose of consultation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} day, {{there will}} be a kind of starch-paste {{on the bottom of the}} bowl, with a more or less clear liquid on top, which has to be discarded. Once the liquid has been removed, a small amount of the paste can then be poured into a flat plate or tray, and spread evenly in a thin layer. The whole plate is placed into a large <b>pot</b> full <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> water, where it is steamed for a couple of minutes, and the resulting [...] "pancake" [...] cut into long pieces vaguely resembling noodles.|$|R
5000|$|Another popular {{account is}} {{the legend of}} a Potawatomi named Fleet Foot. In order to win his bride, he was {{required}} to run from his settlement to a point on the river and back before a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> water <b>boiled</b> away. This event {{is thought to have}} occurred in 1810, a couple of decades before the first permanent white settlers. The Potawatomi word kikalamezo appears on an 1823 atlas of the area. The word translates as [...] "boiling pot" [...] or [...] "place where the water boils," [...] and refers to the Fleet Foot legend.|$|R

The remaining forty will fire through the loopholes as long as possible, and will then form round the breastwork and hold it to the last. One man in each gate-tower, when the enemy reach the gate, will lay down his carbine, and attend to the boiling water. Let them each have a small pot as a ladle. But let them throw the water on those pressing toward the gate, not on those who have reached it. Those are our affair." ...|$|R

40|$|How did a {{story that}} was {{recorded}} centuries ago by two German brothers inspire me to immerse paper within <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiling</b> eucalyptus leaves? The Handless Maiden is a relatively obscure fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm which {{tells the story of}} a young girl who, when betrayed and maimed by her family, takes off into the forest to find her own pathway in the world. This traditional German fairy tale has intrigued me since first reading it as a teenager, and it is this story which continues to inform my studio work, research and, accordingly, this paper. My paper, Curious Maidens, investigates the relationship between the fairy tale, The Handless Maiden, the process of plant dyeing, and the art work to have emerged from my studio research, Curious Maidens (series 1 - 19). The paper identifies the notion of wonderment and curiosity as playing central and dynamic roles within each of these three elements. This emotive link, and the nature of curiosity within fairy tales in general, is explored through an investigation of American artist Kiki Smith’s sculpture Daughter, 1999 and substantiated by the theories by Bruno Bettleheim, Marina Warner and Jack Zipes. Curious Maidens concludes by identifying how an active and open curiosity to life can be an empowering, potent and transformative function for females both within fairy tales, and also within life...|$|R
