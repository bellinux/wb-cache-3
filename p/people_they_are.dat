Tess is then killed in the subsequent gunfight, ensuring she never turns.|$|E

25|$|Bureaucratic {{drift in}} American {{political}} science {{is a theory}} that seeks to explain the tendency for bureaucratic agencies to create policy that deviates from the original mandate.

Further, scholars argue that if a bureaucratic agency is designed to represent a single interest, its implementations {{are more likely to}} reflect the views of the <b>people</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> representing than they are the views of the legislature.|$|E
