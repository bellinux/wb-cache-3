40|$|X-ray <b>photofluorography</b> is a {{relatively}} expensive way to detect pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Those patients with suggestive positive chest X-ray still require Mantoux skin testing, blood tests and a positive sputum smear for the acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis to make a definitive diagnosis of PTB. <b>Photofluorography</b> does detect most pulmonary pathological conditions, including lesions suggestive of PTB, and possible cardiac abnormalities. It is more cost-effective for large numbers in urban areas where there is poverty and overcrowding; and it is useful in early detection of cases of PTB. It is impractical {{to use in the}} isolated mountainous areas in the highlands region of Papua New Guinea and in Western Province, and where there is no road system. It cannot detect other forms of TB. In children and infants it is difficult to obtain good quality films and to interpret them. The scoring chart devised by Biddulph and Edwards is an excellent alternative where a diagnosis is not obvious in a chronically ill child. Active case detection by health workers in the field offers an excellent chance of finding TB cases. Although the cost of staining and looking at sputum smears and performing Mantoux tests can also be time consuming, these methods are relatively less expensive and more accurate. A simple method of processing sputum before Ziehl-Neelsen staining using ordinary household bleach vastly improves the detection rate of acid-fast bacilli.

40|$|ROENTGENOGRAPHIC chest {{surveys of}} general {{hospital}} populations are fairly recent innovations. In 1936, Hodges 4 reported a chest x-ray survey of 1101 admissions to the University of Michigan Hospital. He found roentgen evidence of intrathoracic lesions in 90, or 8. 1 per cent of those patients. Examination of their subsequent hospital records revealed 14 in-stances in which pulmonary pathology {{found on the}} survey films had not been recognized clinically. This represented an incidence of 1. 5 per cent. Also in 1936, Pohle et al. 8 reported 1460 hospital admissions with normal lungs on physical examination. In 34, or 2. 3 per cent of this group, x-ray evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis was present, and in four, or 0. 3 per cent, active reinfection tuberculosis was suspected. In 1940, Plunkett and Mikol 7 reported x-raying 4853 admissions to 14 general hospitals in upstate New York and in 128, or 2. 6 per cent, evidence of reinfection tuberculosis was found. No clinical data were presented in this series. During the past 10 years, marked technical improvements have made available a miniature chest photofluorographic technic which was widely used by induction centers, the armed services, and large industrial plants during the war. With this background of previous experience, the United States Public Health Service and local health agencies have sponsored mass chest surveys in various localities throughout the United States. The first report {{in the literature on}} the use of <b>photofluorography</b> in hos-pital surveys appeared in 1941. Douglas and Birkelo 2 reported examining 4727 prospective mothers on 4 by 5 film. In 29, or 0. 61 per cent, roentgen evidence of active tuberculosis was discovered. The first use of <b>photofluorography</b> as a routine hospital procedure ap-peared in April, 1942, when Hodges 5 analyzed 7841 patients admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital during a four month period. He found that 732, or 9. 3 per cent, required more comprehensive x-ray study. Again there was no report of clinical follow-up on the group. In 1945, Scatchard and Duszynski 9 reported the results of a chest surve...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gastric {{cancer is}} the leading cause of death from cancer in Japan. In 2004, there were 50 562 deaths from gastric cancer; they {{accounted}} for 15. 8 % of the total number of cancer deaths. Since 1983, under the Health Service Law for the Aged, gastric cancer screening has been conducted nationwide for all residents aged 40 years and over. Methods: On the basis of the standardized method developed for the Japanese Guidelines for Cancer Screening, the efficacies of various methods for gastric cancer screening were evaluated and the guideline was developed. Results: Four methods for gastric cancer screening were evaluated: <b>photofluorography,</b> endoscopy, serum pepsinogen testing and Helicobacter pylori antibody testing. On the basis of the analytic framework involving key questions, 1715 articles, published from January 1985 to February 2005, were selected using MEDLINE, the Japanese Medical Research Database and other methods. After the systematic literature review, 10 articles were identified as direct evidence and 49 articles as indirect evidence. The studies that evaluated mortality reduction from gastric cancer included five case–control and two cohort studies for radiographic screening. On the basis of the balance of benefits and harms, the recommendations fo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Many {{nuclear weapons}} complex workers were re-quired to undergo medical x-ray {{examinations}} {{as a condition}} of their employment. To ensure that their dose reconstructions are complete, it is necessary to include the contributions from these examinations. X-ray procedures that must be evaluated include: (1) posterior-anterior and lateral radiography, and/or <b>photofluorography,</b> of the chest; (2) anterior-posterior, lateral and oblique lumbar, cervical and thoracic radiography of the spine; and (3) radiography of the pelvis. Each is discussed in the context of conditions that existed during the time the worker was employed. For purposes of dose reconstruction, the x-ray beam size is especially important because the dose conversion factors (DCFs) for each specific body organ depend on whether it was in, or on the periphery of, the primary beam. The approach adopted was to use the DCFs, combined with the entrance kerma, to estimate the organ doses. In cases in which beam output data or information on the primary factors influencing the dose are not available, methods to provide conservative (i. e., claimant-favorable) entrance kerma and dose estimates are adopted. These include specific default values for chest radiography. To account for uncertainties, the estimated doses due to x-ray examinations are increased b...|$|E
40|$|The use in Switzerland {{of three}} chest X-ray imaging {{modalities}} is studied. The frequency and dosimetric aspects associated with chest radiography, chest CT, and <b>photofluorography</b> are investigated and the Swiss figures are {{compared with those}} of other countries. The frequencies are established by means of a nationwide survey performed in 1998, whereas the doses are determined by modelling, based on the technical parameters of the examinations. The annual frequencies of chest radiography, chest CT, and <b>photofluorography</b> are 201, 7, and 7 per thousand population, respectively. The standard effective doses related to these three types of examinations are 0. 057, 9, and 0. 13 mSv, respectively. The collective dose associated with chest X-ray imaging amounts to 606 man. Sv, representing 8. 5 % of the total collective dose due to diagnostic and interventional radiology. The geographic and seasonal variations, as well as the distribution with the medical specialty and with the age of the patient, are established. The Swiss results compare well with the average data published in the literature for other countries of similar health care level. Chest radiography shows a significant decrease with time. It dropped by a factor of 2 in 20 years. The conformity of the indication of chest X-ray modalities with referral guidelines is also investigated.

In the present study we investigated the involvement of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), ICAM- 2 and ICAM- 3 in the process. The ability of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against ICAM- 1, ICAM- 2 and ICAM- 3 to block syncytia was analyzed either in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -activated lymphocytes infected in vitro with primary or laboratory strains of HIV or by coculturing a T cell line stably expressing HIV envelope with PHA-activated lymphocytes. Complete inhibition of syncytia formation was observed only by the simultaneous addition to the cell cultures of all (i. e. anti-ICAM- 1, anti-ICAM- 2 and anti-ICAM- 3) mAb. These results indicate that the interaction between LFA- 1 and ICAM is a critical step in HIV-mediated syncytia formation, and that ICAM- 1, ICAM- 2 and ICAM- 3 are the receptor molecules for the LFA- 1 -dependent syncytia formation...|$|E
40|$|A {{screening}} programme {{for early}} gastric cancer {{was introduced in}} the state of Tachira, Venezuela, in 1980. Screening was performed by <b>photofluorography,</b> using two mobile units. The efficacy of this programme in reducing mortality from stomach cancer was evaluated by means of a case-control study. Cases were 241 individuals who died from stomach cancer in the period 1985 - 89. Ten live controls per case were drawn from the electoral rolls, matched by sex, age and residence. Exposure to the screening examination of cases and controls was assessed through individual linkage with the programme's centralised database. After the exclusion of examinations occurring within the 6 months preceding the case's diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) of dying from stomach cancer for those screened was 1. 26 (CI 0. 83 - 1. 91) and the OR in females was lower than in males: 0. 77 (CI 0. 33 - 1. 78) and 1. 52 (CI 0. 94 - 2. 47) respectively. Odds ratios associated with years since last test and number of tests did not differ significantly from 1. These results show the inefficacy of the programme in reducing mortality from gastric cancer in the area. In an attempt to determine whether this result was due to selection bias, an analysis restricted to subjects who had been screened at least once was performed. When examinations occurring after an index date at various intervals before the case's diagnosis were excluded, the screening test appeared to protect from death, although confidence intervals of the odds ratios are large, for example OR = 0. 47 (CI 0. 24 - 0. 98) when excluding tests within 1 month...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the role of endoscopy in detection and treatment of neoplastic lesions of the digestive mucosa in asymptomatic persons. Esophageal squamous cell cancer occurs in relation to nutritional deficiency and alcohol or tobacco consumption. Esophageal adenocarcinoma develops in Barrett&#x 2019;s esophagus, and stomach cancer in chronic gastric atrophy with Helicobacter pylori infection. Colorectal cancer is favoured by a high intake in calories, excess weight, low physical activity. In opportunistic or individual screening endoscopy is the primary detection procedure offered to an asymptomatic individual. In organized or mass screening proposed by National Health Authorities to a population, endoscopy is performed only in persons found positive to a filter selection test. The indications of primary upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy in opportunistic screening are increasingly developing over the world. Organized screening trials are proposed in some regions of China at high risk for esophageal cancer; the selection test is cytology of a balloon or sponge scrapping; they are proposed in Japan for stomach cancer with <b>photofluorography</b> as a selection test; and in Europe, America and Japan; for colorectal cancer with the fecal occult blood test as a selection test. Organized screening trials in a country require an evaluation: the benefit of the intervention assessed by its impact on incidence and on the 5 year survival for the concerned tumor site; in addition a number of bias interfering with the evaluation have to be controlled. Drawbacks of screening are in the morbidity of the diagnostic and treatment procedures and in overdetection of none clinically relevant lesions. The strategy of endoscopic screening applies to early cancer and to benign adenomatous precursors of adenocarcinoma. Diagnostic endoscopy is conducted in 2 steps: at first detection of an abnormal area through changes in relief, in color or in the course of superficial capillaries; then characterization of the morphology of the lesion according to the Paris classification and prediction of the risk of malignancy and depth of invasion, with the help of chromoscopy, magnification and image processing with neutrophil bactericidal index or FICE. Then treatment decision offers 3 options according to histologic prediction: abstention, endoscopic resection, surgery. The rigorous quality control of endoscopy will reduce the miss rate of lesions and the occurrence of interval cancer...|$|E
