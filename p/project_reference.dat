50|$|The {{earliest}} {{conception of}} ProteomeXchange {{stems from a}} meeting at the HUPO 2005 conference in Munich, where the main proteomics data repositories at the time agreed in principle to exchange their data, and thus provide a means for the user to find public proteomics data at any of the participating databases. In early times the name was written with a capital E (ProteomExchange), but then later (and currently) the X is capitalized (ProteomeXchange) instead. ProteomeXchange began to become reality in an HPP meeting in Barbados in 2009 where Lennart Martens, Eric Deutsch, and Phil Andrews agreed on a set of deliverables and registered the proteomexchange.org domain. ProteomeXchange was then fully developed through the 'ProteomeXchange' Coordination Action grant of the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (<b>project</b> <b>reference</b> 260558).|$|E
50|$|The ProteomeXchange {{consortium}} {{has been}} set up to provide a coordinated submission of MS proteomics data to the main existing proteomics repositories, and to encourage optimal data dissemination.

The earliest conception of ProteomeXchange stems from a meeting at the HUPO 2005 conference in Munich, where the main proteomics data repositories at the time agreed in principle to exchange their data, and thus provide a means for the user to find public proteomics data at any of the participating databases. Due to the rapid development of the field, and the need to first develop suitable standards for data exchange, it took almost ten years from that meeting to actually implement this system, an effort that was funded by the 'ProteomeXchange' Coordination Action grant of the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (<b>project</b> <b>reference</b> 260558).|$|E
5000|$|After a {{visit to}} England mid-1941, General Henry H. Arnold was so {{impressed}} by flight demonstrations of the Gloster E.28/39 he had witnessed that he arranged for the Whittle W.1X turbojet engine to be flown in October 1941 to the U.S in the bomb bay of a USAAC Consolidated B-24 Liberator, along with drawings for the more powerful W.2B/23 engine and a small team of Power Jets engineers, so that the US could develop its own jet engine. As a result, General Electric received a contract from U.S Army Air Corps to build a turbojet based on the W.2B/23. General Electric's extensive experience in turbocharger production made them the natural choice for producing such engine. With utmost secrecy, in October 1941 a small dedicated GE team at Lynn, Massachusetts, began the intensive development of the first US jet engine. GE initially referred to their engine as the Type I.
