40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, debates {{concerning}} the wearing of Islamic dress, the relationship between religious liberty and free speech and the enforcement of religious law have barely been far from the headlines. In the United Kingdom, a number of legal changes have altered the interaction between law and religion. The piecemeal and <b>passive</b> <b>accommodation</b> provided by the common law {{has been replaced by}} the active protection of religious liberty as a positive right. Looking at the Human Rights Act 1998, the new laws on religious discrimination and religious hatred, the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and developments at EU and devolved levels, this collection examines the legal changes that have occurred and how this affects law and religion as an academic discipline. Law and Religion: New Horizons includes thirteen previously unpublished essays by experts in the field and a detailed conclusion by the two editors, examining the changing interaction between law and religion and the new horizons...|$|E
30|$|Another {{perspective}} that conceptualizes the individualization and subjectivity of religious traditions is Leonard Primiano’s idea of “vernacular religion.” Primiano writes that “there is always some <b>passive</b> <b>accommodation,</b> some intriguing survival, some active creation, some dissenting impulse, some reflection on lived experience that influences how these individuals direct their religious lives” (Primiano 1995, 46). What {{is evident from}} both these examples is a dynamic that may not at first appear important because it has become so commonplace: the relative freedom to first interpret and then actively shape one’s own identity. 1 Familiar frameworks of the self once formed by ethnicity, occupation, race, and family (to name a few) are still present but have become increasingly negotiable due {{to a variety of}} factors unique to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. So thoroughly have liberal democratic societies adopted a sense of self that is developmental rather than prescribed, we rarely consider how significantly this concept has altered forms of social and cultural organization. The ability to select, fashion, and then continually augment our identity in ways we hope are positive has come to dominate how we conceive of and construct our lives.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} {{learning}} through work have included how professional identities are formed through participation in work. However, {{we need a}} more elaborated understanding of how professional identities are negotiated at times of rapid change in working practices. This chapter examines the personal strategies that vocational teachers adopt, and the professional identity negotiations that occur, in response to requirements to change professional practices. We report on a study in which open-ended narrative {{interviews were conducted with}} sixteen Finnish vocational teachers. From the teachers' accounts, we identified distinct personal strategies that were adopted to engage with change. The strategies were labeled as follows: (i) professional development, (ii) <b>passive</b> <b>accommodation,</b> (iii) active participation, (iv) a balancing act, and (v) withdrawal. The strategies were aligned to the teachers' individual concerns, and were bound up with the personal resources available in negotiating with the changing character of the work. An account of these strategies offers a new way of understanding how identities are negotiated through an active, personally-shaped process. The study also illuminates how to promote individuals' management of the self and of learning at work. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) is a Shuttle-transported, reusable, {{essentially}} <b>passive</b> {{facility with}} <b>accommodations</b> {{for a wide}} variety of experiments which require a free-flying carrier for exposure in space. Specifically, the LDEF is tailored to provide low-cost accommodations for experiments which have modest requirements for electrical power and data systems, and for experiments which benefit from postflight laboratory investigations with the retrieved experiment hardware. Each experiment for LDEF will be totally self-contained in a tray. As the interface with the facility has been minimized, the LDEF experimenters will be freed from many of the requirements which have complicated development of space experiments in the past...|$|R
40|$|Current {{microscopy}} {{demands the}} visualization of large three-dimensional samples with increased sensitivity, higher resolution, and faster speed. Several imaging techniques based on widefield, point-scanning, and light-sheet strategies {{have been designed}} to tackle some of these demands. Although successful, all these require the illuminated volumes to be tightly coupled with the detection optics to accomplish efficient optical sectioning. Here, we break this paradigm and produce optical sections from out-of-focus planes. This is done by extending the depth of field of the detection optics in a light-sheet microscope using wavefront-coding techniques. This <b>passive</b> technique allows <b>accommodation</b> of the light sheet at any place within the extended axial range. We show that this enables quick scanning of the light sheet across a volumetric sample. As a consequence, imaging speeds faster than twice the volumetric video rate (> 70 [*][*]volumes/s) can be achieved without needing to move the sample. These capabilities are demonstrated for volumetric imaging of fast dynamics in vivo as well as for fast, three-dimensional particle tracking. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to examine family {{accommodation}} in relatives of obsessive-compulsive disease (OCD) patients. Accommodation was assessed {{in a sample}} of 31 relatives of OCD patients by means of the Family Accommodation Scale. Other variables measured as predictors of accommodation were the tendency of a family member to feel guilty, sensitivity to guilt, anxiety sensitivity and the prevalence of a <b>passive</b> communication style. <b>Accommodation</b> was found to be rather widespread in the family members who took part in our study, and they tended to show more accommodation the greater their sensitivity to guilt and the stable tendency to experience this emotion as well as anxiety sensitivity and a passive communication style. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that, among the variables considered, the family member’s sensitivity to guilt is the only factor which can predict accommodation with regard to the patient’s demands for involvement. On the other hand, the small number of family members in the sample and the lack of clinical data on patients (such as the severity, typology and duration of their obsessive-compulsive disorder) pose limits to the generalizability of the results and point to the need for further research...|$|R
40|$|Anisotropy of {{magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS) represents a valuable proxy {{able to detect}} subtle strain effects in very weakly deformed sediments. In compressive tectonic settings, the magnetic lineation is commonly parallel to fold axes, thrust faults, and local bedding strike, while in extensional regimes, it is perpendicular to normal faults and parallel to bedding dip directions. The Altotiberina Fault (ATF) in the northern Apennines (Italy) is a Plio-Quaternary NNW–SSE low-angle normal fault; the sedimentary basin (Tiber basin) at its hanging-wall is infilled with a syn-tectonic, sandy-clayey continental succession. We measured the AMS of apparently undeformed sandy clays sampled at 12 sites within the Tiber basin. The anisotropy parameters suggest that a primary sedimentary fabric has been overprinted by an incipient tectonic fabric. The magnetic lineation is well developed at all sites, and at the sites from the western sector of the basin it is oriented sub-perpendicular to the trend of the ATF, suggesting {{that it may be}} related to extensional strain. Conversely, the magnetic lineation of the sites from the eastern sector has a prevailing N–S direction. The occurrence of triaxial to prolate AMS ellipsoids and sub-horizontal magnetic lineations suggests that a maximum horizontal shortening along an E–W direction occurred at these sites. The presence of compressive AMS features at the hanging-wall of the ATF {{can be explained by the}} presence of gently N–Strending local folds (hardly visible in the field) formed by either <b>passive</b> <b>accommodation</b> above an undulated fault plane, or rollover mechanism along antithetic faults. The long-lasting debate on the extensional versus compressive Plio-Quaternary tectonics of the Apennines orogenic belt should now be revised taking into account the importance of compressive structures related to local effects...|$|E
