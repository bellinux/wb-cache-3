40|$|One of {{the most}} common way to collect the {{traction}} current needed for the underground vehicle operation is by using the pantograph-overhead line system. The periodically check of pantographs and overhead lines is important to assure the correct interaction between the two systems in terms of good current collection quality. The main diagnostic tools are the monitoring of the vertical force between the overhead line and the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> and the vertical acceleration on the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> The <b>pantograph</b> system works under high voltage (1500 V DC in our tests) and high electromagnetic disturbances are present. For this reason, traditional electrical sensors can be used only with particular precautions that complicate the measurement set up. Fibre optic sensors, and in particular fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, are particularly suitable for this application. In this paper, the application of the FBG sensors on a pantograph for the monitoring of underground pantograph-catenary system is presented. FBG sensors are used to measure both the contact force and the vertical acceleration of the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> The same measurements are also gathered with a traditional electrical system, allowing a comparison. The result is a very good agreement between electrical and optical measurements, except in particular frequency ranges where the different positioning of the sensors influences the output limiting the comparison. Moreover, some interesting results on the dynamic behaviour of the pantograph and its interaction with the overhead line are presented. Finally a method to point out the main defects on the overhead line is shown...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA crucial {{system for}} the {{operation}} of high-speed trains is the pantograph catenary interface {{as it is the}} sole responsible to deliver electrical power to the train. Being the catenary a stationary system with a long lifespan it is also less likely to be redesigned and upgraded than the pantographs that fit the train vehicles. This letter proposes an optimization procedure for the improvement of the contact quality between the pantograph and the catenary solely based on the redesign of the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> suspension characteristics. A pantograph model is defined and validated against experimental dynamic characteristics of existing pantographs. An optimization strategy based on the use of a global optimization method, to find the vicinity of the optimal solution, followed by the use of a deterministic optimization algorithm, to fine tune the optimal solution, is applied here. The spring stiffness, damping characteristics and bow mass are the design variables used for the pantograph optimization. The objective of the optimal problem is the minimization of the standard deviation of the contact force history, which is the most important quantity to define the contact quality. The <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> suspension characteristics are allowed to vary within technological realistic limits. It is found that current high-speed railway pantographs have a limited potential for mechanical improvements, not exceeding 10 %– 15 % on the decrease of the standard deviation of the contact force...|$|R
30|$|In {{high-speed}} rail vehicle systems, {{the main problem}} {{is related to the}} interaction between the train pantograph and the catenary. Indeed, when the train runs, the pantograph deforms the catenary and oscillatory motions are induced. Moreover, when the train speed increases, these oscillations may become larger and the loss of contact between the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> and the collector wire could occur. Thus, when the pantograph moves along the catenary, it is fluctuated due to propagation and reflection of the wave on the catenary, which leads to a modification in its dynamics depending on the position [1].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a diagnostic system mainly aimed at overhead line continuous monitoring. The main idea {{is the use}} of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> accelerations to identify the behaviour of contact force, so as to develop a non intrusive maintenance free system able to recognize relevant defects and installable on an ordinary fleet of trains. The proposed set-up is aimed at improving the present-day scheduled catenary and pantograph maintenance, leading towards condition-based maintenance. Meaningful indications about pantograph-catenary interaction are obtained by the processing and analysis of collector accelerations; summary indexes are computed in real time during the train run and compared with alarm limits...|$|R
40|$|Trains current {{collection}} for traction motors is obtained {{by means of}} a sliding contact between the overhead line (OHL) and the collector strips mounted on the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> The normal force by which the collector presses against the contact wire ensures the contact pressure for the electrical contact. As the train speed increases, the variation of contact force between pantograph and catenary increases, and the pantograph-OHL dynamic interaction becomes greater. This condition causes excessive mechanical wear and contact wire uplift (for high values of contact forces), and leads to high percentage of contact loss, arcing and electrically related wear...|$|R
30|$|At present, the {{coupling}} relationship between the pantograph and catenary is not ideal for straddle-type monorail. The power collection quality is poor, and the wear of the contact strip of a pantograph is uneven. Therefore, the key problem of coupling {{relation between the}} pantograph and catenary is the dynamics of a pantograph–catenary system. This paper analyzed the modal of catenary through simulation with finite element model and the vibration modal of pantograph multi-rigid-body dynamic model by simulation in multi-body danamics software ADAMS. A rigid-flexible coupling dynamic model of pantograph–catenary system is established. Finally, extensive research has been made on the influence of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> parameters on the power collection quality.|$|R

50|$|In the UK, the {{pantographs}} {{of older}} vehicles are raised by air pressure, and the graphite contact strips cover some vents in the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> which release the air if a graphite strip is lost, automatically lowering the pantograph to prevent damage.

There are always at least two pantographs so the other one can be used if one is damaged.

40|$|The current {{collection}} for the traction motor of trains is obtained {{by means of}} a sliding contact between the overhead line (OHL) and the collector strips mounted on the <b>pantograph</b> <b>head.</b> As the train speed increases, the variation of contact force exchanged between the pantograph and the OHL, dependent on their dynamic interaction, becomes greater. This condition causes excessive mechanical wear and contact wire uplift (for high values of contact forces), and leads to high percentage of loss of contact, arcing and electrically related wear if too low values of contact forces occur.

40|$|Contacts between {{pantograph}} and catenary are {{the most}} critical parts in the transmission of electrical energy for modern high-speed trains. Contact wire oscillations change combined force between pantograph and catenary, and the contact may even get lost. Therefore special pantographs and catenaries have been developed and further constructive changes are under development. A design criterion includes the permanent contact of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> and contact wire at high speed and the reduction of both aero acoustic noise and wear. Because of complicated dynamic behaviour and very high costs for prototypes, all modifications and new design concepts for the pantograph/catenary system are essentially based on dynamical simulation. Traditional approaches focus on the catenary, which is modelled as set of coupled strings and/or beams, whereas simplified lumped mass models are {{used to describe the}} pantograph.

40|$|As is well known, the {{external}} disturbance (especially the stochastic wind load) has nonnegligible {{effect on the}} operation of pantograph-catenary system, which may cause the strong fluctuation in contact force {{as well as the}} increased occurrence of contact loss. In order to improve the current collection quality of a high-speed railway pantograph-catenary system under a strong stochastic wind field, a sliding mode controller with a proportional-derivative (PD) sliding surface for a high-speed active pantograph is proposed. The nonlinear finite element procedure is employed to establish the catenary model. The fluctuating wind speeds along catenary are simulated using empirical spectrums. The buffeting forces exerted on contact and messenger wires are derived to construct the stochastic wind field along the catenary. A PD sliding surface is properly determined to guarantee that the mechanical impedance of <b>pantograph</b> <b>head</b> at the dominant frequencies of contact force decreases when the sliding surface approaches zero.

40|$|Magnetic {{actuation}} of elasto-magnetic devices {{has long}} been proposed as {{a simple way to}} propel fluid and achieve locomotion in environments dominated by viscous forces. Under the action of an oscillating magnetic field, a permanent magnet, when attached to an elastic tail, is able to generate bending waves and sufficient thrust for propulsion. We study the hydrodynamical effects of the magnetic <b>head</b> <b>geometry</b> using a geometrically exact formulation for the elastic tail elastohydrodynamics. We show that the spherical <b>head</b> <b>geometry</b> fails {{to take full advantage of}} the propulsive potential from the flexible tail. Nevertheless, while elongated prolate spheroids demonstrate a superior swimming performance, this is still regulated by the nature of the imposed magnetic field. Interestingly, the highest swimming speed is observed when the magnitude of the magnetic field is weak due to delays between the orientation of the magnetic moment and the oscillating magnetic field. This allows the stored elastic energy from the deformed tail to relax during the phase lag between the imposed magnetic field and the swimmer’s magnetic moment, favouring in this way the net propulsion. In particular, this result suggests the existence of optimal magnetic actuations that are non-smooth, and even discontinuous in time, in order to fully explore the propulsive potential associated with the relaxation dynamics of periodically deformed elastic filaments...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} volume of {{influence}} (VoI) for electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors is introduced and accurately defined. It enables one {{to better understand}} the response of a magnetic soil to an EMI sensor, as well as the effect of soil inhomogeneity on soil compensation. The VoI is first defined as the volume producing a fraction a of the total response of a homogeneous half-space. As this basic definition is not appropriate for sensor heads with intrinsic soil compensation, a generalized definition is then proposed. These definitions still do not yield a unique VoI, and a constraint must be introduced to reach uniqueness. Two constraints are investigated: one yielding the smallest VoI and the other one the layer of influence. Those two specific volumes of influence have a number of practical applications which are discussed. The smallest VoI is illustrated for typical <b>head</b> <b>geometries,</b> and we prove that, apart from differential heads such as the quad head, the shape of the smallest VoI is independent of the <b>head</b> <b>geometry</b> and can be computed from the far-field approximation.

40|$|The {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) is {{a measurement}} of neuronal activity inside the brain {{over a period}} of time by placing electrodes on the scalp surface and is used extensively in clinical practices and brain researches, such as sleep disorders, epileptic seizure, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of the long term memory loss or memory disorders. The computation of EEG for a given dipolar current source in the brain using a volume conductor model of the head is known as EEG forward problem, which is repeatedly used in EEG source localization. The accuracy of the EEG forward problem depends on <b>head</b> <b>geometry</b> and electrical tissue property, such as conductivity. The accurate <b>head</b> <b>geometry</b> could be obtained from the magnetic resonance imaging; however it is not possible to obtain in vivo tissue conductivity. Moreover, different parts of the head have different conductivities even with the same tissue. Not only various head tissues show different conductivities or tissue inhomogeneity, some of them are also anisotropic, such as the skull and white matter (WM) in the brain. The anisotropy ratio is variable due to the fibre structure of the WM and the various thickness of skull hard and soft bones. To our knowledge, previous work has not extensively investigated the impact of various tissue conductivities with the same tissue and various anisotropy ratios on head modelling. In this dissertation, we investigate the effects of tissue conductivity on EEG in two aspects: inhomogeneous and anisotropic conductivities, and local tissue conductivity. For the first aspect, we propose conductivity models, such as conductivity ratio approximation, statistical conductivity approximation, fractional anisotropy based conductivity approximation, the Monte Carlo method based conductivity approximation and stochastic method based conductivity approximation models. For the second aspect, we propose a local tissue conductivity model where location specific conductivity is used to construct a human head model. We use spherically and realistically shaped <b>head</b> <b>geometries</b> for the <b>head</b> model construction.

Current methods for automatic facial expression recognition assume images are collected in controlled environments in which the subjects deliberately face the camera. Since people often nod or turn their heads, automatic recognition of spontaneous facial behavior requires methods for handling out-of-image-plane head rotations. There are many promising approaches {{to address the problem}} of out-of-image plane rotations. In this paper we explore an approach based on 3 -D warping of images into canonical views. Since our goal is to explore the potential of this approach, we first tried with images with 8 handlabeled facial landmarks. However the approach can be generalized in a straight-forward manner to work automatically based on the output of automatic feature detectors. A front-end system was developed that jointly estimates camera parameters, <b>head</b> <b>geometry</b> and 3 -D head pose across entire sequences of video images. <b>Head</b> <b>geometry</b> and image parameters were assumed constant across images and 3 -D head pose is allowed to vary.

Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods were then used to recover the most-likely sequence of 3 D poses given a sequence of video images. Once the 3 D pose was known, we warped each image into frontal views with a canonical face geometry.

40|$|Abstract—A {{solution}} of the forward problem {{is an important component}} of any method for computing the spatio-temporal activity of the neural sources of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data. The forward problem involves computing the scalp potentials or external magnetic field at a finite set of sensor locations for a putative source configuration. We present a unified treatment of analytical and numerical solutions of the forward problem in a form suit-able for use in inverse methods. This formulation is achieved through factorization of the lead field into the product of the moment of the elemental current dipole source with a “kernel matrix ” that depends on the <b>head</b> <b>geometry</b> and source and sensor locations, and a “sensor matrix ” that models sensor orientation and gradiometer effects in MEG and differential measurements in EEG. Using this formulation and a recently developed approximation formula for EEG, based on the “Berg parameters, ” we present novel reformulations of the basic EEG and MEG kernels that dispel the myth that EEG is inherently more complicated to calculate than MEG. We also present novel investigations of different boundary element methods (BEM’s) and present evidence that improvements over currently published BEM methods can be realized using alternative error-weighting methods.
