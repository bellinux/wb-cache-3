This is called ‘reporting bias’, and it can cause both casual readers and meta-analysts to develop an inaccurate understanding of the efficacy of an intervention.

These include the fuzzy boundaries between learning and teaching research, scholarship and teaching; the <b>positive</b> <b>agendas</b> of ‘learning and teaching’ funding bodies; methodological issues; and para-academic researchers in roles without tenure or academic freedom.

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on partisan agenda setting in Congress focuses on the majority’s ability to exercise negative agenda control.

The other source, largely unexplored in {{the literature}}, is when the majority of the majority party supports legislation that is subsequently defeated.

40|$|This article extends recent {{research}} on partisan agenda {{control in the}} U. S. House of Representatives {{to the issue of}} procedural control of the legislative agenda via special rules. In particular, we draw out a facet of cartel and conditional party government theories that has not been addressed in prior analyses: the simultaneous interrelationship between <b>positive</b> and negative <b>agenda</b> control. Using roll-call data on two procedural matters—votes to order the previous question on a special rule and votes to adopt a special rule—over the 1953 – 2002 period, we found that, in the area of procedural control of the floor agenda, the majority party’s amount of agenda control depends to a significant degree upon the party’s homogeneity and power. In recent work, Cox and McCubbins (2002, 2005) have elabo-rated on their theory of parties in Congress by focusing on the ability of the majority party, as a procedural cartel, to control the floor agenda of the U. S. House of Representatives. In this article, we build upon their efforts by considering the concept of agenda control as it relates to one of the primary mechanisms used to shape the floor agenda: procedural decisions contained in the special rules that govern consid-eration of bills coming before the House. Prior research has been largely confined to questions surrounding the nature of special rules, while the variation in the use of special rules and changes in party success in this area have received much less attention. To further our understanding of this aspect of legislative organization, and to elaborate the theoretical and empirical relationship between <b>positive</b> and negative <b>agenda</b> control, we take as our starting point two closely related perspectives, cartel theory and conditional party government theory. We posit that, although there are not large-scale conflicts between the two theories, there are some differences between them with regard to procedural control...|$|R

40|$|A key {{assumption}} {{underlying the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) {{is that its}} program of trade negotiations will strengthen the world economy and lead to more trade, investment, employment and income growth throughout the world. In the author 2 ̆ 7 s view, the WTO truly is strengthening the world economy and promoting trade and investment {{in many parts of}} the world. Yet the rest of the thesis is debatable. Is it necessarily true that the WTO and the trade negotiations it sponsors are increasing employment and income growth throughout the world? Indeed, even aggregating the world economy into one planetary unit, one wonders whether increased trade (and its ensuing dynamic efficiencies) inevitably increases the quantity of global employment. Even if it does, what is the quality of the jobs created? Does the WTO promote what the International Labour Organization (ILO) calls decent work? Such questions underlie the subject of this article - the neglected employment dimension of the WTO. The author does not propose to answer these questions empirically. Instead, the article endeavors to point out how little the WTO does to monitor these issues or to design trade rules with sensitivity to the objective of employment growth. So far, the WTO has not set any quantitative goals for income or employment growth. The trade ministers have alluded to their desire that the WTO promote the benefit and welfare of their peoples, but the ministers are lackadaisical about keeping WTO negotiations on schedule. In view of the broad nature of international trade law today, the WTO seems to be overlooking many opportunities to promote a <b>positive</b> employment <b>agenda...</b>|$|R

40|$|By what means can {{legislative}} committees exercise {{influence on}} policy outputs? How {{and why do}} committees in different countries differ in their abilities to do so? This dissertation argues that legislative committee power is a multidimensional concept. Committee procedures can be distinguished into three analytic dimensions: 1) committees' <b>positive</b> <b>agenda</b> power, their power to ensure the placement of legislative versions preferred by them on the floor; 2) committees' negative agenda power, their power to delay or block the progress of legislation; and 3) committees' information capacity, institutional incentives granted to them to gather and transmit information. These distinct dimensions benefit different legislative actors. Therefore, they reflect different features of a political system, {{and may not be}} consistently strong or week. Based on an original cross-national data set, the dissertation shows that committee procedures cluster empirically in these three distinct dimensions. Furthermore, the dissertation also demonstrates how legislators' electoral incentives, the composition of multiparty governments, preexisting authoritarian incumbents' uncertainty and bargaining power, and the changes in legislative memberships affect different dimensions of committee power.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{critically}} evaluate {{the influence of the}} Human Rights Act (1998) [HRA] on prison service policies and prison officer understandings of prisoner human rights, in the period from October 2000 to October 2005. Discourse analysis is used to structure the thesis, with the implementation of the HRA located within what Foucault (1972) has called a "discursive formation": that is, the complex interrelationship between penology, law, penal policy, and occupational culture. Utilising a neoabolitionist normative framework, the legitimacy of the current meanings of prisoner human rights are scrutinised, and an alternative promoted. It is argued that in the five year period under review, the HRA has been restrictively interpreted in domestic courts and effectively marginalised in penological discourses and prison service policies. Focus then turns to an empirical study of prison officer occupational culture, conducted in one prison in the North West of England in 2002. The central finding is that in the original starting position of officer-prisoner relationships, prisoners are constructed as ghost like figures whose needs and sufferings are invisible to officers. Justified through psychic distancing, prisoners are othered and constructed as beyond the realm of humanity. The failure of the HRA to institutionalise a human rights culture or expand upon previous meanings of prisoner rights, is located within the inherent double dehumanisation of prison work, populist penological discourses, the limitations of legal interpretation, carceral clawback, and a lack of political will. The thesis concludes with the promotion of an alternative <b>positive</b> rights <b>agenda</b> for citizens, and a call for alternative means of dealing with wrongdoers that recognises their shared humanity.

This community, a coalition constituted by countries of the global South and NGOs developing and promoting a <b>positive</b> political <b>agenda</b> (Kapczynski & Krikorian, 2010), gathers classical NGOs and civil servants with professional recruitment, working with experts, consultants and academics, and informal groups who do not participate to the formal negotiations, but contribute to the elaboration of the political agenda and the mobilization of citizens. This networked form of digital activism is led by {{a very small number}} of actors without traditional forms of democratic representativity or accountability, building legitimacy through do-ocracy.

The paper proposes to study the emergence of a socially very diverse and loose advocacy coalition which has been developing collaboratively a policy agenda. Its way of action is grounded on digital participatory tools and culture, such as liquid democracy.
