The work has brought together a consortium that has developed reliable experimental methods by which <b>processing</b> <b>flows</b> can be achieved in the laboratory and then ranked against numerical simulation. A full rheological characterisation of a selected range of polymers was made and the results compared from different laboratories. The data was fitted {{to a number of}} rheological models. Multi-mode parameter fitting was universal for the linear viscoelastic response. Particular attention was paid to the non linear response of the material. Prototype industrial flow experiments were carried out for a number of geometries in different laboratories and the flow birefringence technique was used to map out the experimentally observed stress fields for different polymers in a range of complex flows that contained both extensional and shear flow components. Numerical simulation was carried out using a number of algorithms and a range of constitutive equations. In order to make a quantitative comparison between experiment and simulation, an Advanced Rheological Tool (ART) module was developed that was able in some cases to quantify the level of fit between the numerically predicted and the experimentally observed stress patterns.
