5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. <b>Police</b> <b>came</b> to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine was {{on holiday}} from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, her two-year-old twin siblings, {{and a group}} of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a {{restaurant}} 55 metres (180ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese <b>police</b> <b>came</b> to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 {{because of a lack of}} evidence.|$|E

25|$|The Hong Kong <b>Police</b> <b>came</b> {{under fire}} for failing to charge police {{superintendent}} Franklin Chu King-wai, now retired, who was filmed hitting civilians with a police baton when uniformed officers were directing a line of passers-by to move along after a protest in Mong Kok on 26 November 2014. The day before Chu was due to retire in July 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) established by a majority decision that a complaint against Chu was justified. The internal Complaints Against Police Office (CAPO) disagreed and sought legal advice from the Department of Justice. Despite the seemingly incontrovertible evidence against Chu, the case remains pending without a prosecution in sight, raising concerns about the partiality of CAPO and the police force as a whole.|$|E
25|$|FPS has {{resided in}} a number of {{different}} agencies over the years. The act of June 1, 1948, authorized the Federal Administrator to appoint special policemen for duty in connection with the policing of all buildings owned and occupied by the United States. In 1949, Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which consolidated real property functions within the newly created General Services Administration. The FPS force, known at the time as the United States Special <b>Police,</b> <b>came</b> under the supervision of the Protection Division of the Public Building Service (PBS). In 1971, the Administrator of GSA signed an order formally establishing the Federal Protective Force, later known as FPS, and the Civil Service Commission authorized the special classification title of Federal Protective Officer (FPO).|$|E

25|$|Despite all {{the foul}} weather facing the ABA, Mennenga, who {{was said to}} be an eternal optimist, hung on. There was one {{instance}} that was probably responsible for him relinquishing his position and BMX the sport he had help nurture, all together. On January 27, 1985, at the GT Supernationals in Pico Rivera, California, a disgruntled woman hurled a cup of coffee into the face of Mennenga. In all his years involved in BMX he had never been attacked physically, but that was only the beginning of his humiliation. After ABA security had to physically remove the spectator from the facility, she filed a false police report that Mennenga assaulted her. The Pico Rivera <b>police</b> <b>came</b> down to the track and arrested Mennenga during the event. The true story eventually came up and the charges were dropped and Mennenga released, but very likely the experience forever soured him on the sport he once loved.|$|E
