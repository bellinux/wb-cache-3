5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. Because {{of the cost of}} importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> fluids (PD fluids).|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. <b>Peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
5|$|N-Acetylcysteine {{has shown}} promise in {{combination}} with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E

25|$|Two {{modalities}} of dialysis {{can be used}} in {{the treatment}} of ADPKD patients: <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> and hemodialysis. Epidemiological data shows that ADPKD affects 5-13.4% of patients undergoing hemodialysis in Europe and in the United States, and about 3% in Japan. <b>Peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> has usually been contra-indicated in ADPKD patients with large kidney and liver volumes, due to expected physical difficulties in the procedure and possible complications; however, recent studies suggest there is no difference in long term morbidity between hemodialysis and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> in ADPKD.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of mild {{caffeine}} intoxication {{is directed}} toward symptom relief; severe intoxication may require <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis,</b> hemodialysis, or hemofiltration.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of an acute overdosage, {{authorities}} recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some {{situations}} {{elimination of the}} poison can be enhanced using diuresis, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hyperbaric medicine, <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis,</b> exchange transfusion or chelation. However, this may actually worsen the poisoning in some cases, so it should always be verified based on what substances are involved.|$|E
25|$|Renal agenesis. Failure of one kidney to form {{occurs in}} {{approximately}} one in 750 live births. Failure of both kidneys to form {{used to be}} fatal; however, medical advances such as amnioinfusion therapy during pregnancy and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> {{have made it possible}} to stay alive until a transplant can occur.|$|E
25|$|It was {{developed}} by Frank Gotch and John Sargent {{as a way for}} measuring the dose of dialysis when they analyzed the data from the National Cooperative Dialysis Study. In hemodialysis the US National Kidney Foundation Kt/V target is ≥1.3, so that one can be sure that the delivered dose is at least 1.2. In <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> the target is ≥1.7/week.|$|E
25|$|While renal {{replacement}} therapies {{can maintain}} people indefinitely and prolong life, {{the quality of}} life is negatively affected. Kidney transplantation increases the survival of people with stage 5 CKD when compared to other options; however, it is associated with an increased short-term mortality due to complications of the surgery. Transplantation aside, high-intensity home hemodialysis appears to be associated with improved survival and a greater quality of life, when compared to the conventional three-times-a-week hemodialysis and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} the {{development}} of a hernia include: smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, pregnancy, <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis,</b> collagen vascular disease, and previous open appendectomy, among others. Hernias are partly genetic and occur more often in certain families. It is unclear if groin hernias are associated with heavy lifting. Hernias can often be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally medical imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other possible causes. The diagnosis of hiatus hernias is often by endoscopy.|$|E
25|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on overdose with ofloxacin. Current advise {{for the management}} of an acute overdose of ofloxacin is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as renal failure and seizure. Seizures have however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage as well as severe psychiatric reactions.|$|E
25|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. N-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit.

2500|$|In {{the context}} of hemodialysis, Kt/V is a pseudo-dimensionless number; it is {{dependent}} on the pre- and post-dialysis concentration (see below). It is not the product of K and t divided by V, as would be the case in a true dimensionless number. [...] In <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis,</b> it isn't dimensionless at all.|$|E
2500|$|Standardized Kt/V, also std Kt/V, {{is a way}} of {{measuring}} (renal) dialysis adequacy. [...] It was developed by Frank Gotch and is used in the United States to measure dialysis. [...] Despite the name, it is quite different from Kt/V. [...] In theory, both <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> and hemodialysis can be quantified with std Kt/V.|$|E
2500|$|On a {{practical}} level, in <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> {{the calculation of}} Kt/V is often relatively easy because the fluid drained is usually close to 100% saturated with urea, i.e. the dialysate has equilibriated with the body.

2500|$|The large {{decline in}} HHD {{seen in the}} 1970s and early 1980s is due to several factors.

2500|$|In the 1990s Lange's health declined, with {{diabetes}} and kidney disorders. In 2002, doctors diagnosed Lange as having amyloidosis, {{a rare and}} incurable blood plasma disorder.

He entered hospital in Auckland in mid-July 2005 to undergo nightly <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> in his battle with end-stage kidney failure.

2500|$|Dr. Bertinot {{checked on}} Joan at 12:30a.m. on March 19. [...] While {{she had not}} improved, she {{appeared}} to have stabilized.

John Hill also felt he could get some sleep and retired to a couch in a hospital records room. [...] By 1:30a.m., both Dr. Lanza and Dr. Hicks had left the hospital. Joan, who had been heavily sedated, was coherent at times. [...] When Hill told her he would be down the hall if needed, she asked the nurse attending her to see {{that her husband was}} made comfortable there.|$|E
2500|$|The {{indication}} for kidney transplantation is end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD), regardless of the primary cause. This {{is defined as a}} glomerular filtration rate <15ml/min/1.73 sq.m. Common diseases leading to ESRD include malignant hypertension, infections, diabetes mellitus, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; genetic causes include polycystic kidney disease, a number of inborn errors of metabolism, and autoimmune conditions such as lupus. Diabetes is the most common known cause of kidney transplantation, accounting for approximately 25% of those in the US. The majority of renal transplant recipients are on dialysis (<b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> or hemodialysis) at the time of transplantation. However, individuals with chronic kidney disease who have a living donor available may undergo pre-emptive transplantation before dialysis is needed. [...] If a patient is put on the waiting list for a deceased donor transplant early enough, they may also be transplanted pre-dialysis.|$|E
2500|$|Emesis (induction of vomiting) is the {{generally}} recommended treatment if a dog has eaten grapes or raisins {{within the past}} two hours. A veterinarian may use an emetic such as [...] apomorphine to cause the dog to vomit. Further treatment may involve the use of activated charcoal to adsorb remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and intravenous fluid therapy in the first 48 hours following ingestion to induce diuresis and help to prevent acute renal failure. Vomiting is treated with antiemetics and the stomach is protected from uremic gastritis (damage to the stomach from increased BUN) with H2 receptor antagonists. BUN, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium levels are closely monitored. Dialysis of the blood (hemodialysis) and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> {{can be used to}} support the kidneys if anuria develops. Oliguria (decreased urine production) can be treated with dopamine or furosemide to stimulate urine production.|$|E
2500|$|Still uneasy {{after his}} second diagnosis, Dr. Bertinot {{consulted}} a colleague, Dr. Frank Lanza, who believed Joan {{to be in}} septic shock. The doctors ordered blood cultures, which would take 72 hours to process. [...] Joan had been a patient at Sharpstown General for six hours when her kidneys began to fail; she was not passing any urine and had edema.

[...] By 8 p.m., Joan Robinson Hill's kidneys had failed to respond and her condition was considered to be [...] "grave". [...] Dr. Bernard Hicks, a kidney specialist, was called in to consult. Dr. Hicks determined Joan was in severe kidney failure. [...] Since Sharpstown General had no dialysis machine, the medical team debated about transferring Joan to Houston Methodist Hospital, where such equipment was available, but Dr. Hicks believed she was too ill to be transferred. [...] The option for treating her at the hospital was to begin <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> [...] Dr. Hicks wanted the consent of John Hill before beginning this procedure and phoned him at the Kirby Drive home at 9:15p.m. [...] Hill left the house after taking the telephone call but did not arrive at Sharpstown General to give his consent until 11 p.m. His wife was conscious and begged him to stay with her, saying that she was frightened.|$|E
