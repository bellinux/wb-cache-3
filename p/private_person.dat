5|$|Ingres' {{portrait}} of Bertin {{was a critical}} and popular success, but the sitter was a <b>private</b> <b>person.</b> Although his family worried about caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as Léon Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and Félix Vallotton. Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.|$|E
5|$|Reitz did {{not stay}} a <b>private</b> <b>person</b> for long. A {{conflict}} between the South African Republic legislature and judiciary resulted in the dismissal of the Chief Justice. Reitz then took up an appointment as judge in early 1898 and quickly {{became part of the}} inner circle of the Transvaal administration. At the time the relationship with the British was already rapidly deteriorating and the government of the South African Republic was taking action to reinforce its national and international position. One of the measures taken was to replace State Secretary W.J. Leyds, who had the Dutch nationality, with a South African. Leyds was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Europe to represent the Republic abroad. Reitz took his place as State Secretary in June 1898, after Abraham Fischer had declined.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearances}} of former Australian cricketer Don Bradman {{in popular culture}} are many and varied. As a player, {{he first came to}} prominence during the 1928/29 season. His record-breaking performances on the 1930 tour of England made him a national hero in Australia. Ironically, Bradman was a <b>private</b> <b>person</b> who did not enjoy the adulation associated with his fame. In cricket, a batsman who enjoys an exceptional run of form over an extended period is sometimes called Bradmanesque.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial Closet {{this small}} {{building}} was situated {{to the east}} of the Temple of Friendship designed by Gibbs and built in 1739.

25|$|Ellington led the {{orchestra}} by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section. As a bandleader, Ellington {{was not a}} strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra {{with a combination of}} charm, humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, <b>private</b> <b>person,</b> he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself.|$|E

She was the first woman and the second black person to lie in state in the Capitol. An estimated 50,000 people viewed the casket there, and the event was broadcast on television on October 31, 2005. A memorial service was held that afternoon at Metropolitan AME Church in Washington, DC.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{seeks to}} give direct effect to the European Convention on Human Rights in {{domestic}} law by enabling claimants {{to bring an}} action in national courts instead of having to take their case before the European Court of Human Rights, as had previously been the case. The Act makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a manner contrary to certain rights prescribed by the Convention and allows a UK court to award a remedy {{in the event of a}} breach. In principle, the Act has vertical effect in that it operates only vis-à-vis public bodies and not private parties. There are however certain situations in which the Act can be indirectly invoked against a <b>private</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1988 the International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine {{was set up}} to {{establish}} whether the famine existed and its cause. Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, however he ignored the request. While the commission was organized along judicial lines, it had no judicial power to compel witnesses to attend or testify. However Tottle's book was examined during the Brussels sitting of the commission, held between May 23–27, 1988, with testimony from various expert witnesses. The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the famine on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a <b>private</b> <b>person</b> without official Soviet assistance.|$|E
25|$|Pressburger was a diffident and <b>private</b> <b>person</b> who, at times, {{particularly}} {{later on}} in his life, could be hypersensitive and prone to bouts of melancholia. He loved French cuisine, enjoyed music, and possessed {{a great sense of}} humour. In appearance he was short, wore glasses, and had a sagacious, bird-like facial expression. He was a keen supporter of Arsenal F.C., a passion he developed soon after arriving in Britain. From 1970 he lived in Aspall, Suffolk and he died in a nursing home in nearby Saxtead on 5 February 1988, due to the complications of old age and pneumonia. He is interred in the cemetery of Our Lady of Grace Church, Aspall. His is the only grave in that Church of England graveyard with a Star of David.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} <b>private</b> <b>person</b> who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
