50|$|In 1977, {{the company}} {{developed}} a non-metallic cut-resistant <b>protective</b> <b>glove</b> for meat processors and industrial applications. The glove had greater dexterity and was warmer to wear than the chain-mail glove products then in use. It manufactured these gloves for 17 years until selling the product line to Wells Lamont in 1996.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent a}} rope burn, riders must wear a <b>protective</b> <b>glove,</b> usually of leather. This glove must be {{fastened}} to the rider's hand since the force the animal is able to exert could tear the glove away. The rider often applies rosin to the glove, which allows for additional grip.|$|R
40|$|The heat resistant, <b>protective</b> <b>glove</b> {{is made up}} {{of first}} and second shell {{sections}} which define a palm side and a backside, respectively. The first shell section is made of a twill wave fabric of a temperature-resistant aromatic polyamide fiber. The second shell section is made of a knitted fabric of a temperature-resistant aromatic polyamide fiber. The first and second shell sections are secured to one another, e. g., by sewing, to provide the desired glove configuration and an opening for insertion of the wearer's hand. The <b>protective</b> <b>glove</b> also includes a first liner section which is secured to and overlies the inner surface of the first shell section and is made of a felt fabric of a temperature-resistant aromatic polyamide fiber and has a flame resistant, elastomenic coating on the surface facing and overlying the inner surface of the first shell section...|$|R
25|$|Orangutans {{have been}} {{observed}} using sticks to apparently measure the depth of water. It {{has been reported that}} orangutans use tools {{for a wide range of}} purposes including using leaves as <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> or napkins, using leafy branches to swat insects or gather water, and building sun or rain covers above the nests used for resting. It has been reported that a Sumatran orangutan used a large leaf as an umbrella in a tropical rainstorm.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide the}} end user {{with a minimum}} {{standard}} of protection, suitable <b>protective</b> <b>gloves,</b> clothing, and a respirator with organic-vapour cartridges is normally worn. Industrial safety during the production process requires special ventilation and continuous measurement of air contamination {{in order not to}} exceed PEL levels, as well as careful attention to personal hygiene. Frequent analysis of workers' serum acetylcholinesterase activity is also helpful with regards to occupational safety, because the action of parathion is cumulative. Also, atropine {{has been used as a}} specific antidote.|$|E
25|$|Since men's {{ice hockey}} {{is a full}} contact sport, body checks are allowed so {{injuries}} are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet (cage worn if certain age or clear plastic visor can be worn), shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, <b>protective</b> <b>gloves,</b> heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century saw {{a series}} of {{significant}} changes. Wide deliveries were outlawed in 1811. The circumference of the ball was specified {{for the first time}} in 1838 (its weight had been dictated 60 years earlier). Pads, made of cork, became available {{for the first time in}} 1841, and these were further developed following the invention of vulcanised rubber, which was also used to introduce <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> in 1848. In the 1870s, boundaries were introduced – previously, all hits had to be run; if the ball went into the crowd, the spectators would clear a way for the fieldsman to fetch it. The biggest change, however, was in how the ball was delivered by the bowler.|$|E
25|$|Each {{student is}} allowed to bring a cat, toad, rat or owl. Along with the {{acceptance}} letter, first-year students are sent a list of required equipment which includes a wand, subject books, a standard size 2 pewter cauldron, a set of brass scales, a set of glass or crystal phials, a kit of basic potion ingredients (for Potions), and a telescope (for Astronomy). The Hogwarts uniform consists of plain work robes in black, a plain black hat, a pair of <b>protective</b> <b>gloves,</b> and a black winter cloak with silver fastenings. Each uniform must contain the wearer's nametag. First years are not allowed a broomstick of their own, though an exception to this rule is made for Harry {{in his first year}} after he demonstrates an excellent ability as a Seeker in Quidditch.|$|E
25|$|Human {{interaction}} with objects {{poses a threat}} of accidental contamination. Moisture and oils from human skin can cause staining of organic materials and corrosion of metals. This risk can be mitigated through implemented handling protocols such as washing hands and wearing <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> to minimize direct contact. Objects may also be enclosed in protective casing to further reduce direct handling when possible. Proper storage techniques, {{such as the use}} of neutral tissue or untreated cotton packed in polyethylene sheeting or acid-free corrugated cardboard, may be used to individually wrap pieces to prevent accidental contamination of objects between handling and display. Storage and display cases should be carefully evaluated for off-gassing risks, and following storage procedures such as those outlined above will all reduce the risk of contaminant damage to objects.|$|E

50|$|A glove {{should be}} worn {{on the playing}} hand to protect against pool-bottom {{abrasion}} and, in some designs, for protection against puck impact on knuckles and other vulnerable areas; however, no rigid protection is permitted. Players may choose to wear a <b>protective</b> <b>glove</b> on both hands, either as additional protection from the pool bottom or, for ambidextrous players, to switch the stick between hands mid-play. A glove used in competition must be a contrasting colour to the wearer's stick, but not orange which is reserved for referees' gloves.|$|R

25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for <b>protective</b> <b>gloves,</b> shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|E
500|$|The rulebooks of the NHL {{and other}} {{professional}} leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state {{that at the}} initiation of a fight, both players must drop their sticks {{so as not to}} use them as a weapon. Players must also [...] "drop" [...] or shake off their <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> to fight bare-knuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games. In the NHL, when a player is fined, his lost pay goes towards the NHL emergency assistance fund. A fined coach's lost pay goes to the NHL Foundation.|$|E

McCartney, who was heavily bandaged and wore <b>protective</b> <b>gloves,</b> wore the numbers [...] "88" [...] and [...] "202" [...] {{on the front of}} his long-sleeved guernsey, signifying the Australian and total numbers of victims, while many in the crowd held up signs saying [...] "Bali 88/202". Other Australian victims were honored in a video shown on the stadium's video screens before the game, and representatives from five Australian rules football clubs who lost players in the attacks were presented to the crowd. Retired Melbourne Demons player Steven Febey and young Demon Steven Armstrong, who suffered shrapnel injuries in the blast, also attended the match.|$|E

25|$|Baseball players use thin, round {{bats and}} wear gloves to field (with the catcher wearing a special, more <b>protective</b> <b>glove),</b> while cricketers use wide, flat bats and field barehanded (except for the wicket-keeper, who wears <b>gloves</b> and <b>protective</b> leg pads). Note that while {{baseball}} fielders' gloves do provide modest protection against impact, {{they are used}} primarily to extend reach and are generally not padded (except for the catcher's glove). In cricket a batsman wears protective gear such as pads, gloves, thigh pads, helmet, a chest guard, an arm pad and a box (A.K.A. a cup), whereas the only required protective gear for baseball batters is an unsecured helmet (as required in major league baseball rule 1.16); many batters also use elbow, shin, ankle, or hand protectors, and most wear a cup (A.K.A. a box) and use batting gloves (similar to golf gloves) to aid grip.|$|R
