40|$|About 50 dusts were {{examined}} on their carcinogenicity in rats mainly after intraperitoneal injection and some after intratracheal instillation. In the i. p. test, very low doses between 0. 05 and 0. 5 mg asbestos led to tumour incidences of about 20 to 80 %. <b>Polyvinyl-pyridine-N-oxide</b> prolonged the tumour latency after injection of actinolite. 60 mg attapulgite from three sources with short fibre lengths were not {{shown to be}} carcinogenic but an attapulgite sample with longer fibres had a moderate effect. Relatively thick rock and ceramic fibres (median> 1 Âµm) induced tumours, but slag and wollastonite fibres did not, probably because of their better solubility. Intratracheal instillation of glass microfibres (20 x 0. 5 mg) led to lung tumours in 5 to 35 rats (0 in control). The carcinogenic potency of an in organic fibre depends on its size and persistency, and possibly also on other properties, especially on the surface. Nickel powder, nickel oxide, nickel subsulfide and cadmium sulfide were a ll found to be carcinogenic in the two tests. Cadmium chloride and cadmium oxide could only be administrated in very slow doses because of their high acute toxicity. A high amount of magnetite (15 x 15 mg i. tr.) led to an unexpected lung tumour incidence of 69 %. The i. p. test in rats proved to be very sensitive for detecting the carcinogenic potency of non-acute toxic natural and man-made mineral dusts as well as metal compounds. This means that, if a high dose {{of one of these}} dusts dues not induced tumours in this test, no suspicion of carcinogenic potency can be substantiated...|$|E
40|$|Effects of silica, diamond dust, and {{carrageenan}} on mouse macrophages {{were studied}} by phase-contrast cine-micrography, electron microscopy, histochemical techniques for lysosomal enzymes and {{measurements of the}} release of lysosomal enzymes into the culture medium. All added materials were rapidly taken up into phagosomes, to which lysosomes became attached. In all cases lysosomal enzymes were discharged into the phagosomes to form secondary lysosomes. Within 24 hr most of the silica particles and enzyme had escaped from the secondary lysosomes and lysosomal enzymes {{were found in the}} culture media. Most macrophages were killed by this time. With nontoxic particles (diamond dust, aluminium-coated silica, or silica {{in the presence of the}} protective agent <b>polyvinyl-pyridine-N-oxide,</b> PVPNO) ingested particles and lysosomal enzymes were retained within the secondary lysosomes for a much longer time, and cytotoxic effects were considerably delayed or absent altogether. It is concluded that silica particles are toxic because they are efficiently taken up by macrophages and can then react relatively rapidly with the membranes surrounding the secondary lysosomes. The particles and lytic enzymes can then escape into the cytoplasm, producing general damage, and thence into the culture medium. It is suggested that hydrogen bonding of silicic acid with lipid and protein constituents of the membrane accounts for the induced permeability. Protective agents such as PVPNO are retamed in lysosomes and preferentially form hydrogen bonds with silicic acid. Carrageenan is demonstrable within macrophages by its metachromatic reaction. It brings about release of enzymes from secondary lysosomes, but much more slowly than does silica. Silica released from killed macrophages is as cytotoxic as the original preparation. It is suggested that repeated cycles of macrophage killing in vivo leads to the mobilization of fibroblasts and fibrogenesis characterizing the disease silicosis...|$|E
