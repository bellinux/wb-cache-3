5000|$|By December 1, 1995, {{disagreements}} {{continued on}} the Republican plan {{to eliminate the}} deficit in seven years. The Clinton administration said that [...] "The Republican budget plan fails to protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment and tax fairness, and therefore, <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>will</b> veto it." [...] There was also a disagreement on the Defense appropriations bill regarding funding for the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. [...] By December 3, 1995, seven of the thirteen appropriations bills had been passed, including the Defense bill, but further negotiations were seen as having reached an impasse, and lawmakers were considering the implications of a second shutdown. Republicans favored reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and farm programs, which had been historically favored by Democrats, {{as well as a}} $245 billion tax cut. Democrats considered the funding of these social programs to be essential, and opposed the size of the tax cut saying it would mainly benefit the wealthy.|$|E

Finally, the parents hit upon {{the idea of using}} reverse psychology, pretending to be Chinpokomon fans themselves — figuring that whatever they like their children will immediately dislike. The trick works, and all the children except Kyle instantly lose all interest. Kyle claims that if he stops liking Chinpokomon now, he will be following the crowd, so he prepares to leave in a fighter jet to bomb Pearl Harbor. A heart-felt and contradictory speech by Stan confuses him into reluctantly getting off the jet.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{serves as}} the {{foreword}} to Implementing U. S. Health Care Reform, a symposium held in 1993. The exact specifications of the new health care system depend on the package that <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>will</b> send to Capitol Hill and the changes that Congress will make in the reform package. Some of the basic structures and organizing principles {{of the new system}} that are being considered by the President are already the subject of intense public scrutiny. The design being considered would involve new relations between {{the federal government and the}} states, between the public and private sectors, and between health care financing and delivery. The federal government would establish the parameters of the new system through national legislation, regulation, and guidelines, with implementation occurring principally at the state level. State flexibility would become a hallmark of the new system, with states having considerable leeway in implementation. Provided that states follow national parameters, they probably could establish very different kinds of health care systems, ranging from a single payer to managed competition within a budget. Given the strong preference among many health policy experts for a single-payer system, it is extremely important to emphasize the states 2 ̆ 7 authority to implement such a system. A large state, for example, might consider establishing a system of managed competition in urban areas, and a single-payer system in rural areas where effective competition is constrained by the small number of consumers and providers. The new system will provide the right to health care to all citizens and lawful residents of the United States, all of whom will receive health security cards, transferable to any area of the country. The card would also guarantee access to health care independent of employment or other eligibility criteria. Therefore, the new system will address the American public 2 ̆ 7 s concern for long-term security in health care [...] coverage would be portable and move with the individual if he or she changed jobs or lived in another part of the country...|$|E
40|$|Past {{literature}} on war powers in American {{foreign policy has}} found that since the Second World War, Congress defers to the President when {{the commander in chief}} introduces U. S. troops abroad. Congress avoids taking a decision-making role prior to the introduction of troops abroad and presidents have traditionally used autonomous political and constitutional arguments to justify their military endeavors. ^ With the arrival of a new Republican majority in the United States 2 ̆ 7 Congress in 1995, a potential for fundamental change in the war powers relationship existed. <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> was faced with a seemingly aggressive legislative branch, especially in the areas of foreign policy making and U. S. deployments authorized by the United Nations. <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> also appeared <b>willing</b> to listen to congressional demands for a substantive role in deployment decisions. ^ In addressing the interplay between Congress and the President over war powers in the first Clinton administration, three case studies of the United States 2 ̆ 7 major military deployments from 1993 to 1996 were conducted. Three chapters address the United States 2 ̆ 7 deployments to Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. The United States 2 ̆ 7 bombings of Iraq in 1993 and 1996 are also examined. This dissertation finds that Congress continued to defer to the <b>President</b> during <b>Clinton</b> 2 ̆ 7 s first term as President in light of an ostensibly activist 104 th Congress. However, the dissertation also shows that in the American deployment to Bosnia, the President 2 ̆ 7 s rhetoric vis-a-vis Congress underwent substantial change compared to the language used by President George Bush. ^ The dissertation also examines the role of partisanship and its impact on war powers, and Congressional views on U. S. participation in U. N. peace-enforcement operations. The study concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of a Congress that acquiesces to a President who can use force abroad unilaterally. ...|$|R
