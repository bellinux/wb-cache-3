Catalyst {{took steps to}} upgrade the mill, including investments to allow the plant to produce finer grades of paper. Snowflake was an early user of deinkling pulp and was amongst {{the first in the}} US to accept single-source recycling materials. This moves some of the recycling work from the recyclers, thus cutting their costs, in exchange for a stronger market position and lower raw prices. However, Snowflake Mill was stuck with a raw <b>product</b> <b>flow</b> which contain contaminants, such as plastic and metals.|$|E

30|$|Unlike in [24], in {{this work}} a {{closed-loop}} system is studied, i.e. in addition to reverse <b>product</b> <b>flows,</b> forward <b>product</b> <b>flows</b> are considered. Fleischmann et al. [8] and Fleischmann et al. [9] study such a closed-loop system as a three echelon network, consisting of warehouses, plants and test centres, where products are recovered. These facilities have to be located optimally, and the quantities of the forward and reverse <b>product</b> <b>flows</b> of the network are to be determined such that costs for opening, transport and for unsatisfied demand and not-collected returned products are minimized under capacity limitations for the <b>product</b> <b>flows</b> between facilities of different network echelons.|$|R

The dotted arrows describe the component flows leaving suppliers or remanufacturing centres, respectively, to plants. The dashed arrows represent the reverse <b>product</b> <b>flows,</b> i.e. the flows from customers to DCCs and from DCCs to remanufacturing centres.
