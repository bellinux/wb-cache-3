Most existing solutions rely solely on DVFS to adapt the power consumption of CPU cores, without coordinating with the last-level on-chip (e. g., L 2) cache. This paper proposes DPPC, a chip-level power partitioning and capping strategy that can dynamically and explicitly partition the chip-level <b>power</b> <b>budget</b> among different CPU cores and the shared last-level cache in a CMP based on the workload characteristics measured online. DPPC features a novel performance-power model and an online model estimator to quantitatively estimate the performance contributed by each core and the cache with their respective local <b>power</b> <b>budgets.</b> DPPC then re-partitions the chip-level <b>power</b> <b>budget</b> among them <b>for</b> optimized CMP performance.

However they pose serious challenges, {{especially in the case}} of high speed unidirectional (e. g., users traveling in high ways or in metros) users, in the form of frequent handovers. The extent of the handover losses depends greatly upon the speed of the user and we showed in our previous paper that optimal cell size increases with speed. Thus in scenarios with diverse users (speeds spanning over large ranges), it would be inefficient to serve all of them using common cell radius and it is practically infeasible to design different cell sizes to different speeds. We alternatively propose to allocate power to an user based on its speed. Higher power virtually increases the cell size.
