The diameter of the individual <b>polypropylene</b> <b>filament</b> was approximately 0.2 microns and diameter of the individual polyester filament was 0.8 microns. The basis weights of the both nonwoven fabrics were 25 grams per square meter. The prime components of this research are polypropylene and polyester nonwoven fabrics. As polypropylene fibre has stereo-regular isotactic molecular structure, due to its high degree of crystallinity, good handling, strength and a high enough melting point for normal use, it is being used in many industrial applications, {{as well as in}} healthcare protective clothing. It has non polar and hydrophobic nature which is a good liquid repellent property. Considering its liquid barrier protection PP nonwoven is used as an outer layer in the developed surgical gown. Polyester nonwoven fabric is used as an inner layer in the developed surgical gown because of its wickability characteristics.

To over-come this deficiency, other researchers have tried to lower the degree of crys-tallinity of this fibre by either tension annealing or blending it with polyethyleneterephtha-late and polystyrene. These physical or chemical modifications have not yet achieved a satisfactory level of enhancement of the textureability of polypropylene. Considering the importance of BCF polypropylene yarns, in this research, the effect of blending polypropylene with 12. 5 and 25 % of polyamide 6 on {{the bulk of the}} final bulked continu-ous filament (BCF) yarn has been investigated. The results show that although both crimp contraction and crimp modulus increase with the temperature and pressure of hot air during texturing, but blending polypropylene with even 25 % of polyamide 6 does not enhance the textureability of BCF yarns.

A new antibiotic- eluting mesh has been manufactured on pre-existing polypropylene prostheses using an airbrush spraying technology.

Since the formation of fiber structure is highly dependent on the processing conditions, the new process will provide a unique operation window to study fiber attenuation and structural formation under high-speed cold air drawing. Based on computational fluid dynamics simulation results, a parametric study was carried out under different process conditions which include processing temperature, air velocity and polymer volume flow rate. Effects of changes in processing variables on the fiber diameter, molecular orientation, crystallinity, tensile strength and other properties were studied.

A small fraction (1 – 3 % w/w) of modified grafted polypropylene has also been included to improve dispersion of the clay. X-ray diffraction of hot-pressed films, coupled with transmission electron microscopic investigation has been used to assess the degree of dispersion of the clay.

In this experimental study, the extent of enhancement in properties achieved {{through the use of}} thermoplastic composite skins combined with a recycled thermoplastic core is demonstrated. The thermal behavior of polypropylene (PP) -based recycled materials and the possibility of turning them into the sandwich panels via a plastic extrusion processing were investigated. A sheet extrudate of recycled thermoplastic composite was sandwiched between two thermoplastic skins on both sides to make the sandwich panels. The core material composed of recycled polypropylene (RPP) and shreds of recycled PP/Fiberglass (e. g. twintex scraps) with the weight ratio of 1 : 1. A commercial thermoplastic skin, TWINTEX, which is a roving made of commingled E-Glass and <b>polypropylene</b> <b>filaments</b> woven into highly conformable fabrics, is used as the face sheets to bond with the core material. A good understanding of principles for manufacturing sandwich panels and performing some experimental optimization leads to making high-strength and strongly-bonded sandwich panels.

40|$|Within the Collaborative Research Centre 639 the {{processing}} chain from filaments up to component parts under {{the focus of}} textile-reinforced thermoplastics is considered. Thereby, thermoplastic hybrid yarns (glass/ <b>polypropylene</b> <b>filaments)</b> are processed to multi-layer knitted fabrics and subsequently to complex spacer structures for lightweight constructions. The applications of hybrid yarns facilitate short flow paths of the matrix systems and thus comparatively low impregnation and consolidation pressures. These process conditions are beneficial for the integration of functional elements as sensors and electronic components in fibre-reinforced thermoplastic parts. Nevertheless, to minimize the strain on these elements during the pressing process, especially in thin-walled components, an adapted lay-up has to be examined. For the variation of the single layer thicknesses the material is excavated in the integration relevant area by a remote laser cutting process. Since high intensities are needed to enable laser cutting of glass-fibre textiles a brilliant laser beam source is recommended. Thereby, the remote-technology is used to deflect the beam onto the material with tiltable scanning mirrors. Furthermore, a precise positioning of the laser cutting pathis required. For this reason a camera positioning system is used to detect the working area of the scanner system. Subsequently, the certain work piece features can be extracted by image processing algorithms. The determined data {{is used for the}} cutting path generation. Since the cutting process is a thermal process, it is necessary to minimize the heat affected zone to a minimum. Therefore, a tailored remote laser cutting strategy was developed. This strategy allows an ablation of the hybrid and the knitting yarn to achieve a full cut or a partial exposure of single layers. Within this work, the enhancement of integration possibilities of sensor elements in thin-walled components will be presented under the focus of locally cut and partial exposed layers of the multi-layer knitted fabrics...|$|R

40|$|The {{currently}} available clinical imaging methods {{do not provide}} highly detailed information about location and severity of axonal injury or the expected recovery time of patients with traumatic brain injury [1]. High-Definition Fiber Tractography (HDFT) is a novel imaging modality that allows visualizing and quantifying, directly, the degree of axons damage, predicting functional deficits due to traumatic axonal injury and loss of cortical projections. This imaging modality is based on diffusion technology [2]. The inexistence of a phantom able to mimic properly the human brain hinders the possibility of testing, calibrating and validating these medical imaging techniques. Most research done in this area fails in key points, such as the size limit reproduced of the brain fibers and the quick and easy reproducibility of phantoms [3]. For that reason, {{it is necessary to}} develop similar structures matching the micron scale of axon tubes. Flexible textiles can play an important role since they allow producing controlled packing densities and crossing structures that match closely the human crossing patterns of the brain. To build a brain phantom, several parameters {{must be taken into account}} in what concerns to the materials selection, like hydrophobicity, density and fiber diameter, since these factors influence directly the values of fractional anisotropy. Fiber cross-section shape is other important parameter. Earlier studies showed that synthetic fibrous materials are a good choice for building a brain phantom [4]. The present work is integrated in a broader project that aims to develop a brain phantom made by fibrous materials to validate and calibrate HDFT. Due to the similarity between thousands of hollow multifilaments in a fibrous arrangement, like a yarn, and the axons, low twist polypropylene multifilament yarns were selected for this development. In this sense, extruded hollow filaments were analysed in scanning electron microscope to characterize their main dimensions and shape. In order to approximate the dimensional scale to human axons, five types of polypropylene yarns with different linear density (denier) were used, aiming to understand the effect of linear density on the filament inner and outer areas. Moreover, in order to achieve the required dimensions, the <b>polypropylene</b> <b>filaments</b> cross-section was diminished in a drawing stage of a filament extrusion line. Subsequently, tensile tests were performed to characterize the mechanical behaviour of hollow filaments and to evaluate the differences between stretched and non-stretched filaments. In general, an increase of the linear density causes the increase in the size of the filament cross section. With the increase of structure orientation of filaments, induced by stretching, breaking tenacity increases and elongation at break decreases. The production of hollow fibers, with the required characteristics, is one of the key steps to create a brain phantom that properly mimics the human brain that may be used for the validation and calibration of HDFT, an imaging approach that is expected to contribute significantly to the areas of brain related research...|$|R
