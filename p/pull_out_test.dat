Composites containing different concentrations of sisal fibre and compatibilizer were produced using a co-rotating twin screw extruder and subsequently injection moulded to retrieve test specimens. These specimens were investigated for tensile and notched impact properties, as well as the final fibre length in the composites was determined. With this data, a simple rule of mixtures model was applied to evaluate the tensile strength and notched impact strength for the interfacial shear strength. Further, single fibre <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>tests</b> have been carried out with sisal fibres from polypropylene. Data for interfacial shear strength, acquired by the single fibre <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>tests</b> fit the data acquired by the evaluation of the mechanical testing very well. Furthermore the presence of a compatibilizer improves the interfacial shear strength, as well as the polypropylene grade shows an influence, which is also found from the single fibre <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>tests.</b> In conclusion this shows good applicability of single fibre <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>tests</b> for estimating composite properties.

40|$|The {{response}} of the interface between matrix pockets and infiltrated fibre bundles, often encountered in 3 D woven composites, has been investigated experimentally. Fibre bundle <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed along with tensile experiments measuring the normal strength of the interface at quasi-static and high loading rates. The {{purpose of this study}} was to generate information that is necessary to numerically model 3 D woven composite materials on the meso scale (yarns, matrix pockets and yarn-matrix interface). The experiments show an increase of the interface strength for both the <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>tests</b> and the tensile tests with loading rate. Failure for the <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> experiments always propagated along the interface between fibre bundle and matrix. However, failure for the tensile tests occurred both at the interface and within the yarn, at approximately the same level of stress. It is therefore concluded that the interface between matrix pocket and yarn can be assumed to have the properties of the bulk yarn material, and does not need to be modelled explicitly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the bond strength between concrete of different ages and between steel and concrete, focusing on the recovery of reinforced concrete structures. To analyze the bond between concrete of different ages, trials with specimens receiving three different types of treatments at the interface between the concrete were performed: brushing; brushing and mortar equal to concrete of substrate and brushing and epoxy layer. Indirect tensile tests and oblique and vertical shear tests at the interface were made. The bond stress between steel and concrete was evaluated by <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>test</b> under the conditions of the bar inserted in the still fresh concrete and when inserted in the hardened concrete with epoxy.

Biomechanical <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>testing</b> is one among several methods used to quantitatively assess the forces required to remove an implant from bone. <b>Pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>testing</b> has the advantage of assessing the biomechanical stress between two materials of different physical and chemical properties, in this case bone and a titanium, implant surface.

To achieve this objective, first geosynthetics are described with reference to their characteristics, functions and possible applications. Secondly, soil-reinforcement techniques are referred, with special attention to soil-reinforcement with geosynthetics and to the importance of soil-geosynthetic interaction on it.
