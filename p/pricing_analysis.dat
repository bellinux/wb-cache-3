Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 76 - 77. We {{study the}} problem of valuing risky projects in incomplete markets. We develop a new method to value risky projects by restricting the so-called gain-loss ratio. We calculate the project value bounds on a numerical example and compare {{the results of our}} method with the option <b>pricing</b> <b>analysis</b> method. The proposed method yields tighter price bounds to the projects than option <b>pricing</b> <b>analysis</b> method. Moreover, for a specific value of gain-loss preference parameter, λ ∗, our new method may yield a unique project value. Interestingly, replicating portfolios are different in the upper and lower bound problems for λ ∗. The results are obtained in a discrete time, discrete space framework. We also extend our method to markets with transaction costs and situations with uncertain state probabilities. Doğruer, Şaziye PelinM. S...|$|E
40|$|Hedonic <b>pricing</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{conducted}} to determine the implicit values of various attributes in {{the market value of}} a good. In this study, hedonic <b>pricing</b> <b>analysis</b> was applied to measure the contribution of grain quality search and experience attributes to the price of rice in two rural towns in the Philippines. Rice samples from respondents underwent quantitative routine assessments of grain quality. In particular, gelatinization temperature and chalkiness, two parameters that are normally assessed through visual scores, were evaluated by purely quantitative means (differential scanning calorimetry and by digital image analysis). Results indicate that rice consumed by respondents had mainly similar physical and chemical grain quality attributes. The respondents' revealed preferences were typical of what has been previously reported for Filipino rice consumers. Hedonic regression analyses showed that grain quality characteristics that affected price varied by income class. Some of the traits or socioeconomic factors that affected price were percent broken grains, gel consistency, and household per capita rice consumption. There is an income effect on rice price and the characteristics that affect price vary between income classes...|$|E
40|$|Inter-company loans do {{not draw}} {{considerable}} attention from Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) {{because they are}} not core business-related transactions, but planning an interest rate for them is actually important in countries with transfer pricing legislation. Nonetheless, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines do not point to concrete direction about methods or approaches to be performed in order to incorporate arm´s length principle in interest rates for future inter-company loans. Transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>analysis</b> for inter-company loans are usually performed applying the Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (CUP method). The CUP method compares the interest rate of inter-company loans with statistical ranges built over interest rates of market comparable transactions. Interquartile Range (IQR) is a common statistical range to establish comparison. In accordance with the CUP method in transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>analysis,</b> Plunkett and Mimura mentioned corporate bonds markets are a rich source of data for identifying market interest rates and for which there is sufficient data to establish comparability" (Plunkett & Mimura, 2005).
