5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> {{change of}} clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, {{to be used}} as the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E

25|$|The du Temple was {{an early}} naval {{water-tube}} boiler, patented in 1876. It was invented by Félix du Temple in France and was tested in a Royal Navy torpedo gunboat. Water tubes were convoluted, arranged in four rows to a bank, and S-shaped with sharp right angle bends. This <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> large tube heating area into a small volume, but made tube cleaning impractical. The drums were cylindrical, with perpendicular tube entry and external downcomers between them.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{invention}} of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we see today.|$|E
25|$|Shahak {{had a deep}} {{affinity}} with Spinoza:}he always <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> copy of The Ethics in his suitcase for reading during his periodic stints of service in the Israel Defense Forces, and had been {{writing a book on}} the philosopher before death intervened. His activities as a public intellectual fighting for human rights causes and for a secular state earned him a reputation for controversy, and frequent abuse. He was regularly spat on, frequently given death threats, and decried variously as an Israel basher, self-hating Jew, traitor, and enemy of the people.|$|E

25|$|Polanski later stated that, in {{the months}} {{following}} the murders, he suspected various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others were reported to have installed security systems in their homes. Writer Dominick Dunne later recalled the tension:The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had ever seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral. In 1994, the Tate/Polanski house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.|$|E
25|$|He {{signed for}} the Hammers as a trainee, aged 14. Lyall helped Ince through troubled school times {{eventually}} signing {{him as a}} YTS trainee, on leaving school, in 1984. He {{is a product of}} the West Ham youth team and made his debut in English football on 30 November 1986 against Newcastle United in the First Division. He became a regular player in 1987–88, proving himself to have all-round qualities of pace, stamina, uncompromising tackling and good passing ability. He also <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> powerful shot, and was awarded with England under-21 honours to go with the youth caps he acquired as an apprentice. He firmly established himself as the successor in West Ham's midfield for the veteran Billy Bonds, who retired at the end of the 1987–88 season. Unfortunately for Ince, West Ham were not enjoying one of their best spells when he broke into the team. Despite having won the FA Cup in 1980 and finished third in the league in 1986, they had failed to sustain their challenge for major honours and finished 15th in 1987 and 16th in 1988, and worse was to follow.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} the Piraeus Athena. Because the room the statue was found in was very close to the main harbor, many scholars believe that the statue had been stored in a harbor’s stoa and were just about to be shipped. Additionally, the Piraeus Athena and other statues were not in random order but seemed to be <b>packed.</b> <b>A</b> coin found near the statues had a date equivalent to 87/86 BC on it, along with a picture of King Mithridates VI. Because it is known that Piraeus was captured by Sulla in 86 BC, many have further speculated two theories. One theory is that the statues were going to be shipped in order to save them from the Roman attack. The second theory is that the statues were being shipped by the Romans to Italy as part of their spoils. It is thought that the statue may have originally come from the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in Piraeus. This is because the peplos in the statue is similar to the drapery of the peplos in the statue of Eirene by Cephisodotus the Elder, who was also known to have made a statue of Athena that resided in the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira. Other scholars believe that the statue may have come from Delos, since three of the statues found with the Piraeus Athena were of Artemis, and Delos was considered the birthplace of Artemis. Additionally, the Romans had captured Delos in 88 BC and therefore the statues could {{have been part of the}} scared funds Mithradates’ general had sent to Delos. Due to the dating, it has been estimated that the Piraeus Athena probably dates back to 360-340 BCE.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{said it was}} [...] "probably the best episode" [...] of the season, and commented that [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] offered a [...] "consistently satisfying show. Like the better episodes, it <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> lot of action into its twenty-three minutes, as Homer’s saga took on a near epic feeling. It also contained more wonderfully bizarre asides than usual {{at this point in}} the series’ run. From the Rastafarians who appear in the crowd when Homer performs 'Baby Elephant Walk', to the existence of the Players’ Ex-Wives section at the ballpark, the episode provided a fun and rich program." [...] In a review of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] felt [...] "a bit flat", but [...] "even in [...] lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the best line of the episode was Homer's [...] "Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat. It also gives me the right— no, the duty— to make a complete ass of myself." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said lines from the episode such as [...] "A Simpson on a T-shirt, I never thought I'd see the day" [...] show a [...] "humorous self-awareness of the emergence of The Simpsons as cultural phenomenon".|$|E
500|$|Wings was an {{immediate}} success upon release and became the yardstick for which aviation films were measured against, in terms of [...] "authenticity of combat and scope of production". One {{of the reasons for}} its resounding popularity was the public infatuation with aviation in the wake of Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight. The Air Corps who had supervised production expressed satisfaction with the end product. The critical response was equally enthusiastic and the film was widely praised for its realism and technical prowess, despite a superficial plot, [...] "an aviation picnic" [...] as Gene Brown called it. The combat scenes of the film were so realistic that one writer studying the film in the early 1970s was wondering if Wellman had used actual imagery of planes crashing to earth during World War I. One critic observed: [...] "The exceptional quality of Wings lies in its appeal as a spectacle and as a picture of {{at least some of the}} actualities of flying under wartime conditions." [...] Another wrote: [...] "Nothing in the line of war pictures ever has <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> greater proportion of real thrills into an equal footage. As a spectacle, Wings is a technical triumph. It piles punch upon punch until the spectator is almost nervously exhausted". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times praised the cinematography of the flying scenes and the direction and acting of the entire cast in his review dated August 13, 1927. Hall notes only two criticisms, one slight on Richard Arlen's performance and of the ending, which he described as [...] "like so many screen stories, much too sentimental, and there is far more of it than one wants." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Many lauded {{the use of}} Starr; for instance, IGN ranked his performance in the episode, along with Paul McCartney's performance in [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] and George Harrison's performance in [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", as the tenth best guest appearance in The Simpsons history. They added that [...] "Although none of these appearances were really large, {{the fact that the}} most popular band of all time appeared on The Simpsons is a large statement on the popularity and importance of the show." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, wrote that [...] "Brush with Greatness" [...] has a [...] "well thought-out" [...] plot and he enjoyed the use of Starr and Marge's previously undiscovered talents. Paul A. Cantor, {{the author of the book}} Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, said the [...] "once again Brian K. Roberts proves his genius with 'Brush with Greatness' in a superb work where Marge cultivates her wonderful artistic side." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "From the opening at Mt. Splashmore through Homer’s diet and the unveiling of Mr. Burns’ controversial portrait, the episode <b>packed</b> <b>a</b> lot of great material. It also expanded Marge’s character in a pleasing way, as it avoided any semblance of sappiness; we needed a break from sentiment after 'Old Money'. Overall, 'Brush with Greatness' provided a terrific episode." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A superb episode, with Marge rightfully centre stage. Despite his general unpleasantness, Mr Burns' gratitude to Marge is both welcome and unexpected. And the dig at Water Parks is spot on." ...|$|E
