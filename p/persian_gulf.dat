5|$|The Australian {{contribution}} to the 1991 Gulf War {{was the first time}} Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and clearance diving team deployed to the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF's capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions imposed on Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{warships}} {{served in}} the Red Sea and <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> {{through much of the}} war. From June to October 1940 HMAS Hobart took part in the East African Campaign, and {{played an important role in}} the successful evacuation of Berbera. In May 1941, Yarra supported an operation in which Gurkha troops were landed near Basra during the Anglo-Iraqi War. In August 1941 Yarra and Kanimbla took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, with Yarra sinking the Iranian sloop Babr near Kohorramshahr and Kanimbla landing troops at Bandar Shapur. A dozen Bathurst class corvettes also escorted Allied shipping in the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> during 1942.|$|E

5|$|On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In {{the middle}} of the month, President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred {{thousand}} troops, along with a strong force of naval support to Saudi Arabia and the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On 7 August, Wisconsin and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and Wisconsin found herself serving alongside her younger sister Missouri, just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both Wisconsin and Missouri launched Tomahawk Missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. Wisconsin also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> Surface Action Group.|$|E

5|$|Unrest {{amongst the}} people of Bahrain began when Britain officially {{established}} complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then ruler of Bahrain. Sheikh Issa {{was the first of}} the Al Khalifa to rule without Persian relations. Sir Arnold Wilson, Britain's representative in the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> and author of The <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> arrived in Bahrain from Muscat at this time. The uprising developed further with some protesters killed by British forces.|$|E
5|$|Whales were {{historically}} {{common in}} continental and marginal waters such as Hallaniyat Islands, along Indian coasts, <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> and Gulf of Aden and recent migrations {{into the gulf}} including by cow-calf pairs. It is unknown whether whales seen in the Red Sea originate in this population, however sightings increased since in 2006 even {{in the northern part}} of the sea such as in Gulf of Aqaba. Individuals may reach the Maldives, Sri Lanka, or further east. Humpbacks have been considered rather vagrant into <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> however new studies indicate more regular presences can be expected.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{available}} charts of the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> were inaccurate or incomplete at the time, Al Qasimi ships could hide from Wainwright's squadron in the uncharted inlets, a problem Wainwright reported {{upon his return}} that resulted in improved British cartography of the area.|$|E
5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, {{he described the}} sea route going {{into the mouth of}} the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Desert Storm, Loring's tankers were {{responsible}} for refueling aircraft transiting the Atlantic. It was also used as a stopover for aircraft travelling to the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> region due to its vital position. The base was also vital because it allowed planes to be maintained, planes which sometimes {{would be unable to}} reach their destination without maintenance. Between 2 August 1990 and 10 May 1991, more than 1,700 aircraft transiting between America and the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> region landed at Loring. These included the C-141 Starlifter, C-5 Galaxy, C-130 Hercules, C-21A, A-4 Skyhawk, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Boeing 707, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, F-111 Aardvark, P-3 Orion, TR-1A Dragonlady, U-2 Dragonlady, B-52 Stratofortress, KC-10 Extender, KC-135 Stratotanker, E-3A Sentry, EA-6B Mercury, and E-8A Joint Stars aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Missouri was {{outfitted}} with 40mm grenade launchers and 25mm chain guns {{and sent to}} take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf.</b> These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating in the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment– a striking contrast to her world cruise months earlier. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, Missouri escorted tanker convoys through the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire control system trained on land-based Iranian Silkworm missile launchers.|$|E

5|$|Missouris {{scheduled}} four-month Western Pacific port-to-port cruise set {{to begin}} in September was canceled {{just a few days}} before the ship was to leave. She had been placed on hold in anticipation of being mobilized as forces continued to mass in the Middle East. Missouri departed on 13 November 1990 for the troubled waters of the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf.</b> She departed from Pier 6 at Long Beach, with extensive press coverage, and headed for Hawaii and the Philippines for more work-ups en route to the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf.</b> Along the way she made stops at Subic Bay and Pattaya Beach, Thailand, before transiting the Strait of Hormuz on 3 January 1991. During subsequent operations leading up to Operation Desert Storm, Missouri prepared to launch Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and provide naval gunfire support as required.|$|E

5|$|After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy {{entered the}} 45 year long Cold War {{and participated in}} the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> War, and the Second <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> War / Iraq War. Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy fell apart, which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. Nuclear power and ballistic missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which were used in the s and s. By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the first}} Gulf War the Royal Australian Navy {{periodically}} deployed a ship to the Gulf or Red Sea to assist in maintaining sanctions against Iraq. Until the outbreak of the Second Gulf War the Australian naval force in the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> continued to enforce the sanctions against Iraq. These operations were conducted by boarding parties from the RAN warships.|$|E
5|$|Alexander sent much of {{his army}} to Carmania (modern {{southern}} Iran) with general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran. Alexander reached Susa in 324BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with land}} trade routes, a Maritime Silk Road {{contributed to the}} flow of goods and {{establishment}} of a Pax Mongolica.
