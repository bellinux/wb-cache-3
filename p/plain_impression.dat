60|$|So {{the little}} cubs took their {{first glimpse of}} the big world, of {{mountains}} and sea and sunshine, and children playing on the shore, and the world was altogether too wonderful for little heads to comprehend. Nevertheless one <b>plain</b> <b>impression</b> remained, the same that you see in the ears and nose and stumbling feet and wagging tail of every puppy-dog you meet on the streets, that this bright world is a famous place, just made a-purpose for little ones to play in. Sitting on their tails in a solemn row the wolf cubs bent their heads and pointed their noses gravely at the sea. There it was, all silver and blue and boundless, with tiny white sails dancing over it, winking and flashing like entangled bits of sunshine; and since the eyes of a cub, like those of a little child, cannot judge distances, one stretched a paw at the nearest sail, miles away, to turn it over and make it go the other way. They turned up their heads sidewise and blinked at the sky, all blue and calm and infinite, with white clouds sailing over it like swans on a limpid lake; and one stood up on his hind legs and reached up both paws, like a kitten, to pull down a cloud to play with. Then the wind stirred a feather near them, the white feather of a ptarmigan which they had eaten yesterday, and forgetting the big world and the sail and the cloud, the cubs took to playing with the feather, chasing and worrying and tumbling over each other, while the gaunt old mother wolf looked down from her rock and watched and was satisfied.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{accuracy}} of Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) {{is dependent on}} many variables ranging from {{the quality of the}} friction skin surface itself, to the ability of the image acquisition device to accurately image the fingerprint, to the feature extract and match software to detect the feature set and declare a correlation (a match/no match) based on some criteria. The genesis of these systems exclusively used rolled impression fingerprint imagery. As AFIS developers attempted to reduce the cost and improve the usability of these systems for commercial applications, <b>plain</b> <b>impression</b> imagery was adopted and total scanned image area was significantly reduced. This paper will attempt to quantify the effects of reduced image area on overall system accuracy in a single finger <b>plain</b> <b>impression</b> environment. The results can be directly applied by AFIS designers as they attempt to meet systems requirements with respect to key accuracy parameters such as false match rates, false non-match rates and the resulting workload caused by the system. ...|$|E
25|$|Exemplar prints, or known prints, is {{the name}} given to {{fingerprints}} deliberately collected from a subject, whether for purposes of enrollment in a system or when under arrest for a suspected criminal offense. During criminal arrests, a set of exemplar prints will normally include one print taken from each finger that has been rolled from one edge of the nail to the other, <b>plain</b> (or slap) <b>impressions</b> {{of each of the}} four fingers of each hand, and <b>plain</b> <b>impressions</b> of each thumb. Exemplar prints can be collected using live scan or by using ink on paper cards.|$|R
5000|$|His 2010 CD, Impressions of a City, {{featuring}} his band, Paul Wertico's Mid-East/Mid-West Alliance, {{has been}} described in reviews as [...] "One of the most impressively spontaneous albums you'll find on this planet - or any other"; [...] "Haunting and memorable…an engaging musical experiment {{and one that is}} highly unique."; [...] "This is musical narrative at its finest. A fanfare for the common (and mechanically exploited) 21st century man and woman."; [...] "Sometimes beautiful, other times tense or just <b>plain</b> spooky, <b>Impressions</b> of a City ought to go some way toward correcting the dubious reputation of avant-garde music."; [...] "A wildly unpredictable journey into one man's apparently inexhaustible sonic imagination." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{fireplace}} hearth in {{the living}} room integrates boulders found on the site and upon which the house was built— ledge rock which protrudes up to a foot through the living room floor was left in place to demonstrably link the outside with the inside. Wright had initially intended that the ledge be cut flush with the floor, but this {{had been one of the}} Kaufmann family's favorite sunning spots, so Mr. Kaufmann suggested that it be left as it was. The stone floors are waxed, while the hearth is left <b>plain,</b> giving the <b>impression</b> of dry rocks protruding from a stream.|$|R
60|$|This {{is a good}} {{exemplification}} of {{the nature}} of 'Bulls', which will be found always to contain in them a confusion of what the schoolmen would have called--objectivity with subjectivity;--in <b>plain</b> English, the <b>impression</b> of a thing as it exists in itself, and extrinsically, with the image which the mind abstracts from the impression. Thus, number, or the total of a series, is a generalization of the mind, an 'ens rationis' not an 'ens reale'. I have read many attempts at a definition of a 'Bull', and lately in the Edinburgh Review; but it then appeared to me that the definers had fallen into the same fault with Miss Edgeworth, in her delightful essay on 'Bulls', and given the definition of the genus, 'Blunder', for that of the particular species. I will venture, therefore, to propose the following: a 'Bull' consists in a mental juxta-position of incongruous images or thoughts with the sensation, but without the sense, of connection. The psychological conditions of the possibility of a 'Bull', it would not be difficult to determine; but it would require a larger space than can be afforded here, at least more attention than my readers would be likely to afford.|$|R
40|$|Eolian bedforms {{occur at}} the {{interface}} between a planetary surface and its atmosphere; they present a proxy record {{of the influence of}} climate, expressed in sediment transport, over that surface. High resolution images (1. 5 - 12 m/pixel) from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera provide glimpses of the most recent events shaping the martian landscape. Thousands of images exhibit small transverse dunes or large eolian ripples that have crest-to-crest spacings of 10 to 60 m, heights of a few to 10 m. Bedforms of the size and patterns seen in the Mars photographs are rarely described among Earth's eolian landforms; in terms of size and morphology, most of these fall between traditional definitions of "ripples" and "dunes". Dunes are composed chiefly of materials transported by saltation, ripples are smaller forms moved along by the impact of saltating grains (traction). The largest reported eolian ripples on Earth (granule ripples, megaripples) are typically smaller than the bedforms observed on Mars; likewise, most dunes are typically larger. The small dunes and large ripples on Mars {{come in a variety of}} relative albedos, despite an early MGS impression that they are all of high albedo. Some ripples occur on the surfaces of sand dunes; these are most likely true granule ripples. However, most of these bedforms occur in troughs, pits, craters, and on deflated <b>plains.</b> Despite <b>impressions</b> early in the MGS mission, they do not occur everywhere (e. g., they are rare on the northern plains) but they do occur at a range of elevations from the highest volcanoes to the deepest basins. Where they occur on a hard substrate among larger sand dunes, the big dunes have over-ridden the smaller bedforms, indicating that the smaller features are older and perhaps indurated or very coarse-grained. At other locales, the small bedforms have been mantled by material settled from suspension, in other cases they are being exhumed and may be lithified. Still other examples are peppered with small impact craters, implying considerable age. These bedforms present a complicated record of the geologically-recent past, one that has involved changes in climate, sediment transport capabilities, and sediment sources and sinks over time...|$|R
