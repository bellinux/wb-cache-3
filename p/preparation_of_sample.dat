As shown in Figure  1, these five samples were made on 3 -L volumes from a single lot of tomatoes through two separate lines. Sample 1 (tomato juice-source) was prepared by mixing crushed tomatoes with water (2.5  kg-tomato/L). For the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> 2, the tomato juice-source was incubated at 28 °C for 96  h after the addition of 0.5 % (g/v) yeast and 0.3 % (g/v) pectinase (alcoholic fermentation). After alcoholic fermentation, the tomato juice was filtered through filter paper (Advantec grade No. 2 qualitative filter paper; Advantec, Tokyo) and diatomaceous earth, and then heat-treated at 90 °C for 1  min. For the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> 3, acetic acid bacteria (on the order of 105 cells) were inoculated into the sample 2 (3  L), after which acetic fermentation was proceeded at 32 °C for 110  h.

Sample 4 was produced by the addition of 0.3 % pectinase to the sample 1 (3  L), followed by incubation at 60 °C for 1  h and heat-treatment at 92 °C for 30  min. To produce sample 5, lactic acid bacteria (105 cells) were added to sample 4 (3  L), and the mixture was fermented at 30 °C for 90  h. The lactic fermented tomato juice was then subjected to heat-treatment at 79 °C for 10  min and filtered as described above (sample 5).|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) is {{a powerful}} technique capable of providing unique information about the structural chemistry of glasses. However, inappropriate procedures for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> surfaces {{or the lack of}} reliable methods to overcome electro-static charging effects during analysis of dielectric materials can cause spurious features to be introduced or intrinsic features to be suppressed in photoelectron spectra which are nominally indicative of bulk phenomena. An adaptation of a biased metal-dot (BMD) energy reference for insulators in XPS to the analysis of fracture surfaces prepared in ultra-high vacuum is described that largely eliminates these difficulties. Based on a study of the charging behavior of SiO glass under conditions of positive and negative bias, a reference of he binding energy scale for an insulator to its surface Fermi level is proposed and shown to be consistent with Schottky barrie...|$|E
