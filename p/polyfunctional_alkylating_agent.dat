40|$|Chemotherapeutic agents {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of cancer often lead to dose-limiting bone marrow suppression and may initiate secondary leukemia. N,N 9,N 0 -triethylenethiophosphoramide (thiotepa), a <b>polyfunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent,</b> is used in the treat-ment of breast, ovarian, and bladder carcinomas and is also being tested for efficacy in {{the treatment}} of central nervous system tumors. Thiotepa produces ring-opened bases such as formamidopyrimidine and 7 -methyl-formamidopyrimidine, which can be recognized and repaired by the formamidopyri-midine glycosylase/AP lyase (Fpg) enzyme of Escherichia coli. Using this background information, we have created constructs using the E. coli fpg gene along with the functional equivalent human ortholog a-hOgg 1.

40|$|The three {{protocols}} of {{the comet}} assay A/N, A/A and N/N were {{for the first time}} applied to the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. The purpose of the experiments was to establish conditions for genotoxic exposure causing DNA damage in Arabidopsis nuclei. This is required for comprehensive gene expression profiling with the intention to screen for genes involved in response of Arabidopsis cells to genotoxic stress. Five chemicals belonging to different classes of mutagens (the monofunctional alkylating agents N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and methyl methanesulfonate, the <b>polyfunctional</b> <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> mitomycin C, the radiomimetic bleomycin and the herbicide maleic hydrazide) were tested. Except for maleic hydrazide, dose-dependent increases in DNA damage were found using the A/N comet assay protocol. While a rapid repair of bleomycin-mediated SSBs and DSBs was found, no significant reduction of DNA migration was observed up to 48 h after treatment with the monofunctional alkylating agents. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

50|$|<b>Alkylating</b> antineoplastic <b>agents</b> have limitations. Their {{functionality}} {{has been}} found to be limited when in the presence of the DNA-repair enzyme O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Cross-linking of double-stranded DNA by <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is inhibited by the cellular DNA-repair mechanism, MGMT. If the MGMT promoter region is methylated, the cells no longer produce MGMT, and are therefore more responsive to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b> Methylation of the MGMT promoter in gliomas is a useful predictor of the responsiveness of tumors to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> {{constitute}} a major class of frontline chemotherapeutic drugs that inflict cytotoxic DNA damage as their main mode of action, {{in addition to}} collateral mutagenic damage. Numerous cellular pathways, including direct DNA damage reversal, base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR), respond to alkylation damage to defend against alkylation-induced cell death or mutation. However, maintaining a proper balance of activity both within and between these pathways is crucial for a favourable response of an organism to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b> Furthermore, the response of an individual to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> can vary considerably from tissue to tissue and from person to person, pointing to genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that modulate <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> toxicity...|$|R

50|$|Since cancer cells, in general, proliferate {{faster and}} with less error-correcting than healthy cells, cancer cells are more {{sensitive}} to DNA damage—such as being alkylated. <b>Alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> are used to treat several cancers. However, they are also toxic to normal cells (cytotoxic), particularly cells that divide frequently, {{such as those in}} the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, testicles and ovaries, which can cause loss of fertility. Most of the <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> are also carcinogenic. Hyperthermia therapy is especially effective at enhancing the effects of <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic or {{acquired}} chemoresistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is a {{major cause}} of treatment failure in patients with malignant brain tumors. <b>Alkylating</b> <b>agents,</b> the mainstay of treatment for brain tumors, damage the DNA and induce apoptosis, but the cytotoxic activity of these agents is dependent on DNA repair pathways. For example, O 6 -methylguanine DNA adducts can cause double-strand breaks, but this is dependent on a functional mismatch repair pathway. Thus, tumor cell lines deficient in mismatch repair are resistant to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b> Perhaps the most important mechanism of resistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is the DNA repair enzyme O 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase, which can eliminate the cytotoxic O 6 -methylguanine DNA adduct before it causes harm. Another mechanism of resistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Consequently, efforts are ongoing to develop effective inhibitors of BER. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase plays a pivotal role in BER and is an important therapeutic target. Developing effective strategies to overcome chemoresistance requires the identification of reliable preclinical models that recapitulate human disease and which can be used to facilitate drug development. This article describes the diverse mechanisms of chemoresistance operating in malignant glioma and efforts to develop reliable preclinical models and novel pharmacologic approaches to overcome resistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report a}} general {{diffusion}} based method to form micrometer-scale lateral chemical gradients in polymer brushes via selective alkylation.
