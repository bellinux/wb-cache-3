40|$|Human health can be {{strongly}} influenced by exposure to solar radiation. Interactions relevant for health take place mainly in the skin. In this context the optics of human skin is of the utmost importance. Reflection, scattering and absorption are the optical properties affecting {{the nature of these}} interactions. By combining a bio-optical model of human skin with advanced radiative transfer theory, we simulated the transport of solar radiation through the skin. The calculated optical properties of the skin can then be combined with action spectra of various <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> to calculate the efficiency spectra of these processes for different skin types. The main result {{of this study is that}} the interaction of solar radiation with skin is found to have considerable temporal variations due to the dynamic changes of the optical properties of the skin induced by solar radiation. In particular, variations in the brown colored melanin pigment are important for the optics of skin.

We have explored the nature of this vulnerability by undertaking comprehensive product analyses of aqueous photolysates of 12 N-p-toluene-sulfonyl peptides with systematically selected structures.

Fluence-response and fluence rate-response relationships have been measured for second positive phototropism by seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. The fluence-response relationships exhibit a single limiting threshold at about 0. 01 micromole per square meter when measured at fluence rates from 2. 4 × 10 − 5 to 6. 5 × 10 − 3 micromoles per square meter per second. The threshold values in the fluence rateresponse curves decrease with increasing time of irradiation, but show a common fluence threshold at about 0. 01 micromole per square meter. These thresholds are the same as the threshold of about 0. 01 micromole per square meter measured for first positive phototropism. Based on these data, it is suggested that second positive curvature has a threshold in time of about 10 minutes. Moreover, if the times of irradiation exceed the time threshold, there is a single limiting fluence threshold at about 0. 01 micromole per square meter. Thus, the limiting fluence threshold for second positive phototropism is the same as the fluence threshold for first positive phototropism. Based on these data, we suggest that this common fluence threshold for first positive and second positive phototropism is set by a single photoreceptor pigment system...|$|R

We conclude from these and other data that a flavin is the photoreceptor pigment for the photoreduction of cytochrome b.

40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} by microorganisms {{is often described}} as a promising sustainable and clean energy source, but still faces several obstacles, which prevent practical application. Among them, oxygen sensitivity of hydrogenases represents one of the major limitations hampering the biotechnological implementation of <b>photobiological</b> production <b>processes.</b> Here, we describe a hierarchical biodiversity-based approach, including a chemochromic screening of hydrogenase activity of hundreds of bacterial strains collected from several ecosystems, followed by mass spectrometry measurements of hydrogenase activity of a selection of the H 2 -oxidizing bacterial strains identified during the screen. In all, 131 of 1266 strains, isolated from cereal rhizospheres and basins containing irradiating waste, were scored as H 2 -oxidizing bacteria, including Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., Enterobacter sp., Rahnella sp., Burkholderia sp., and Ralstonia sp. isolates. Four free-living N 2 -fixing bacteria harbored a high and oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase activity, which was not fully inhibited within entire cells up to 150 - 250 lmol/L O 2 concentration or within soluble protein extracts up to 25 - 30 lmol/L. The only hydrogenase-related genes that we could reveal in these strains were of the hyc type (subunits of formate hydrogenlyase complex). The four free-living N 2 -fixing bacteria were closely related to Enterobacter radicincitans based on the sequences of four genes (16 S rRNA, rpoB, hsp 60, and hycE genes).

40|$|The future {{vision for}} {{hydrogen}} {{is that it}} will be cost-effectively produced from renewable energy sources and made available for widespread use as an energy carrier and a fuel. Hydrogen can be produced from water and when burned as a fuel, or converted to electricity, joins with oxygen to again form water. It is a clean, sustainable resource with many potential applications, including generating electricity, heating homes and offices, and fueling surface and air transportation. To achieve this vision, researchers must develop advanced technologies to produce hydrogen at costs competitive with fossil fuels, using sustainable sources. Hydrogen is now produced primarily by steam reforming of natural gas. For applications requiring extremely pure hydrogen, production is done by electrolysis. This is a relatively expensive process that uses electric current to dissociate, or split, water into its hydrogen and oxygen components. Technologies with the best potential for producing hydrogen to meet future demand fall into three general <b>process</b> categories: <b>photobiological,</b> photoelectrochemical, and thermochemical. <b>Photobiological</b> and photoelectrochemical <b>processes</b> generally use sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.

These can in principle be studied by time-resolved scattering 1, 2, 3 and spectroscopic methods, respectively.

40|$|Degenerative {{diseases}} such as cancer usually involve more than one pathological process. Therefore, attempts to combat such diseases with monotherapeutic approaches may not always do so efficiently. For this reason, the use of combination therapy with modalities that target different disease pathways represents an alternative strategy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has already been established as an alternative therapy {{for the treatment of}} various types of malignant disorders, including oesophageal, lung and bladder cancer as well as other degenerative diseases. This technique involves the administration of a tumor localizing photosensitizer followed by its activation with light of a specific wavelength. In the presence of tissue oxygen, the photoactive sensitizer triggers a series of photochemical and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> that may lead to direct cancer cell damage, tumor microvascular occlusion and host immune response. Due to these multiple actions, PDT has increasingly gained recognition as a potential adjuvant for conventional cancer treatments. Several preclinical studies and some clinical trials suggest that the use of PDT in combination with established treatments or with newly-developed modalities may be of benefit as compared to the individual modalities. In this review, we briefly introduce the reader to the main photobiological aspects of PDT, and then discuss the use of PDT in combination with other pharmacological approaches for the treatment of cancer...|$|E

40|$|Carotenoids are an {{extensive}} group of natural pigments employed {{by a majority}} of organisms on earth. They are present in most organisms, including humans, but can be synthesized only by plants and microorganisms. They perform two major roles in photosynthesis, often in partnership with the more prevalent chlorophylls (Chls) / bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) : light-harvesting and photoprotection. Carotenoids absorb radiation in a spectral region inaccessible to Chls and BChls and transfer the absorbed energy to (B) Chls which, in turn, funnel it into the photosynthetic reaction center (RC). It is determined that the structures and dynamics of excited states of carotenoids found in photosynthetic proteins provide an explanation of their roles as light-harvesting and photoprotective agents. The conjugation length and the type of carotenoids play a big part in understanding the energy transfer from carotenoids to Chls and BChls, because excited-state properties of carotenoids are affected by number of conjugated C=C bonds and their structures. An accurate description of these states is, therefore, the crucial first step in explaining carotenoid photochemistry and understanding the interactions between carotenoids and other molecules in <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes.</b> The research in this thesis, femtosecond ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study the light-harvesting function of carotenoids both in solvent and protein environment.

Based on spectroscopic indications, the light-harvesting function of carotenoids has a bearing on their structures, and specific light-harvesting strategies are explicitly dependent with the structure of the light-harvesting complexes...|$|E
40|$|The interfering {{effect of}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation {{on the natural}} function of biological processes is wavelength specific and the UV spectrum must be weighted with the action spectrum for the process. The UV spectral irradiance may be measured with calibrated spectroradiometers. Alternatively, the biologically effective UV may be measured with broadband devices. This paper reviews the techniques for assessing biologically effective exposures in photobiological experiments. UV meters, such as the Robertson-Berger (RB) meter, or passive dosimeters, such as polysulphone, that possess a spectral response approximating the human erythemal response {{can be used to}} estimate erythemally effective exposure or actinic exposure due to solar UV. The sensitivity of the RB meter is about 0. 56 uW cm- 2 and polysulphone can record an exposure of about 2 mJ cm- 2. For <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> other than erythema these devices are not suitable to determine the exposure. In terms of these applications, a spectrum evaluator consisting of four different types of dosimeter material can be employed to evaluate the UV spectrum of the source. This method can be useful both for solar UV studies and research with UV lamps that possess radiation wavelengths shorter than 295 nm. The device can be used to measure exposures where the actinic and erythemal action spectra differ significantly.

The trunk and the plantar {{region of the}} foot, where no functioning melanocytes were present before exposure, were exposed to UV-A for 14 consecutive days. Both regions revealed a basically similar pattern for new melanogenesis which involved an activation of precursor melanocytes. Essentially all of “indeterminate” cells appeared to be precursor melanocytes, the fine structure {{of which could be}} differentiated even from poorly developed Langerhans cells. New melanogenesis was manifested by 4 stages of cellular and subcellular reactions of these cells as indicated by histochemistry of dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and autoradiography of thymidine incorporation: (a) an initial lag in the activation of precursor melanocytes with development of Golgi cisternae and rough endoplasmic reticulum followed by formation of unmelanized melanosomes (day 0 to 2); (b) synthesis of active tyrosinase accumulated in Golgi cisternae and vesicles with subsequent formation of melanized melanosomes in these cells (day 3 to 5); (c) mitotic proliferation of many of these activated cells, followed by an exponential increase of new melanocytes (day 6 to 7); and (d) melanosome transfer with differentiation of 10 nm filaments and arborization of dendrites, but without any significant change in the melanocyte population (day 8 to 14). The melanosome transfer was, however, not obvious until after 7 days of exposure. The size of newly synthesized melanosomes was similar to that of tail skin where native melanocytes were present before exposure...|$|E
40|$|Steering the {{electrons}} during an ultrafast photo-induced {{process in a}} molecule influences the chemical behavior of the system, {{opening the door to}} the control of photochemical reactions and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes.</b> Electrons can be efficiently localized using a strong laser field with a well-designed temporal shape of the electric component. Consequently, many experiments have been performed with laser sources in the near-infrared region (800 nm) in the interest of studying and enhancing the electron localization. However, due to its limited accessibility, the mid-infrared (MIR) range has barely been investigated, although it allows to efficiently control small molecules and even more complex systems. To push further the manipulation of basic chemical mechanisms, we used a MIR two-color (1800 and 900 nm) laser field to ionize H 2 and D 2 molecules and to steer the remaining electron during the photo-induced dissociation. The study of this prototype reaction led to the simultaneous control of four fragmentation channels. The results are well reproduced by a theoretical model solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the molecular ion, identifying the involved dissociation mechanisms. By varying the relative phase between the two colors, asymmetries (i. e., electron localization selectivity) of up to 65 % were obtained, corresponding to enhanced or equivalent levels of control compared to previous experiments. Experimentally easier to implement, the use of a two-color laser field leads to a better electron localization than carrier-envelope phase stabilized pulses and applying the technique in the MIR range reveals more dissociation channels than at 800 nm...|$|E
40|$|Excited state {{dynamics}} on an ultrafast timescale {{can provide}} insight into primary events in photochemical and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes.</b> In this work, excited state dynamics of two important systems are characterized: unidirectional molecular rotary motors and HBDI derivatives (synthetic chromophores of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)). In both cases, the excited state is selectively probed by ultrafast fluorescence up-conversion with a time resolution better than 50 fs. Molecular motors have biphasic (sub-picosecond and picosecond) fluorescence decays and oscillations attributed to excitation of coherently excited vibrational modes. The fluorescence data were contrasted with excited state decay and ground state recovery kinetics recorded using ultrafast transient absorption. Combining these experimental data with substituent dependence and solvent dependence studies, as well as existing calculations, we proposed a coupled two-state model for dynamics on the excited state potential energy surface. These data have implications for the design and optimisation of optically driven molecular motors. A ‘molecular propeller’ was also studied and shown {{to be more sensitive}} to medium friction than the motor. The GFP experiments focused on determining the effect of alkyl substitution upon excited state dynamics of HBDI. HBDI in solution exhibits a very low quantum yield compared to the chromophore in its protein environment. Large alkyl substituents were found to shift the spectra but to exhibit only small retardation effects upon the excited state decay time, even in highly viscous solvents. This supports an assignment of a volume conserving isomerization mechanism promoting radiationless decay. Substituents which distort the planar structure of the chromophore lead to an enhanced radiationless decay. This provides further evidence for a link between radiationless decay of the excited state and twisting of HBDI...|$|E

The fluence rate of PAR determines the efficiency of photosynthesis, whereas high fluence rates of solar UV radiation inhibit and damage the photosynthetic system of the organisms. Using an Optronic double monochromator spectroradiometer with an optical sensor for irradiance and with a receiver for the fluence rate (4 #pi# geometry) the optical properties of coastal waters of the southern Baltic Sea and of its lagoons were investigated with respect to UV-B induced damage and photoinhibition in Euglena gracilis and Nodularia spumigena. For comparison analogous investigations were performed {{in the waters of}} the open Baltic Sea and of the Mediterranean. It was found that the Baltic Sea waters have to be classified into 15 optical types in the extended Jerlov system due to different concentrations of yellow substance and seston. Depending on the water type the 0. 1 % levels of surface irradiance at 310 nm are found at depths between 0. 30 m (type C 15) and 2. 25 m (type C 2) in the Baltic Sea and up to 16 m in the Mediterranean (type OIII). As phytoplankton populate these top layers of the water column it may be affected by solar UV. In order to investigate the biomass of phytoplankton by remote sensing both the content and vertical distribution of phytoplankton and the optical properties of the coastal lagoons of the southern Baltic Sea were investigated as ground truth.

40|$|Photoinduced {{electron}} transfer {{is involved in}} a number of photochemical and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes.</b> One example of this is photosynthesis, where the absorption of sunlight leads to the formation of charge-separated states by {{electron transfer}}. The redox equivalents built up by successive photoabsorption and electron transfer is further used for the oxidation of water and reduction of carbon dioxide to sugars. The work presented in this thesis is part of an interdisciplinary effort aiming at a functional mimic of photosynthesis. The goal of this project is to utilize sunlight to produce renewable fuels from sun and water. Specifically, this thesis concerns photoinduced electron transfer in donor(D) -photosensitizer(P) -acceptor(A) systems, in mimic of the primary events of photosynthesis. The absorption of a photon typically leads to transfer of a single electron, i. e., charge separation to produce a single electron-hole pair. This fundamental process was studied in several molecular systems. The purpose of these studies was optimization of single electron transfer as to obtain charge separation in high yields, with minimum losses to competing photoreactions such as energy transfer. Also, the lifetime of the charge separated state and the confinement of the electron and hole in three-dimensional space are important in practical applications. This led us to explore molecular motifs for linear arrays based on Ru(II) bis-tridentate and Ru(II) tris-bidentate complexes. The target multi-electron catalytic reactions of water-splitting and fuel production require a build-up of redox equivalents upon successive photoexcitation and electron transfer events. The possibilities and challenges associated with such processes in molecular systems were investigated. One of the studied systems was shown to accumulate two electrons and two holes upon two successive excitations, without sacrificial redox agents and with minimum yield losses.

40|$|Photochemical {{processes}} {{driven by}} high-energy ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in inshore, estuarine, and coastal waters {{play an important}} role in global bio geochemical cycles and biological systems. A key to modeling photochemical processes in these optically complex waters is an accurate description of the vertical distribution of UVR in the water column which can be obtained using the diffuse attenuation coefficients of down welling irradiance (Kd()). The Sea UV Sea UVc algorithms (Fichot et al., 2008) can accurately retrieve Kd (320, 340, 380, 412, 443 and 490 nm) in oceanic and coastal waters using multispectral remote sensing reflectances (Rrs(), Sea WiFS bands). However, SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms are currently not optimized for use in optically complex, inshore waters, where they tend to severely underestimate Kd(). Here, a new training data set of optical properties collected in optically complex, inshore waters was used to re-parameterize the published SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms, resulting in improved Kd() retrievals for turbid, estuarine waters. Although the updated SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms perform best in optically complex waters, the published SeaUVSeaUVc models still perform well in most coastal and oceanic waters. Therefore, we propose a composite set of SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms, optimized for Kd() retrieval in almost all marine systems, ranging from oceanic to inshore waters. The composite algorithm set can retrieve Kd from ocean color with good accuracy across this wide range of water types (e. g., within 13 mean relative error for Kd(340)). A validation step using three independent, in situ data sets indicates that the composite SeaUVSeaUVc can generate accurate Kd values from 320 490 nm using satellite imagery on a global scale. Taking advantage of the inherent benefits of our statistical methods, we pooled the validation data with the training set, obtaining an optimized composite model for estimating Kd() in UV wavelengths for almost all marine waters. This optimized composite set of SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms will provide the optical community with improved ability to quantify the role of solar UV radiation in photochemical and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> in the ocean...|$|E
40|$|The {{excited state}} {{structure}} and dynamics of linear polyenes {{have been the}} subject of numerous investigations in recent sears. This is because linear polyenes like retinal (vitamin A aldehyde) play crucial roles in biological photo-sensory and photo-energy transductions. However, a complete understanding of the excited state properties of linear polyenes and related <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> is not yet available. In the last few years, we have carried out photochemical and photophysical studies of donor-acceptor diphenylbutadienes with specific focus on the question whether or not dipolar twisted excited states are involved in the photoprocesses of linear polyenes. Our approach consists of examining the effects of substituents and media on the singlet excited states of donor-acceptor 1, 4 -diphenylbutadienes. In this context, we have chosen donor-acceptor 1, 4 -diphenylbutadienes [RC 6 H 4 (CH=CH) (n) C 6 H 4 R 1, n = 2, R and R-t are various substituents including CN, NO 2, COOMe, NMe 2, OMe] as model systems and investigated their uv-vis absorption fluorescence and photoisomerization properties in organic solvents of varying polarity, 1, 4 -dioxane-water binary mixtures, and in micelles of SDS, CTAB and Triton-X- 100. The uv-vis absorption spectra of the donor-acceptor dienes are not altered significantly by changing the solvent polarity. However, donor-acceptor groups present on the phenyl rings influence the absorption spectra as expected in terms of mesomeric effects. In contrast, pronounced solvatochromic fluorescence is observed in most of the donor-acceptor dienes studied. The dienes substituted with strong acceptor groups like NO 2 and COOR have been found to exhibit much red-shifted fluorescence, which is highly dependent on solvent polarity; Low-temperature fluorescence studies in ethanol-methanol glass suggest conformational relaxation in the excited state of these dienes. The fluorescence quantum yields of the dienes are generally low, particularly in polar-protic solvents. The dienes with strong acceptor group like NO 2 and COOR exhibit large dipole moment changes (similar to Delta mu, 20 - 28 D) upon excitation. Further, the solvatochromic fluorescence of dienes linearly correlates reasonably well with solvent polarity parameters such as E-T (30) and pi*. Time-resolved fluorescence of some of the dienes is characterized by single exponential fluorescence decay with generally increasing lifetimes in polar solvents. Irradiation of the donor-acceptor E,E-dienes yields the corresponding E,Z-isomer due to one-photon; one-bond photoisomerization of the chain C=C double bond lying close to the acceptor group. The photoisomerization quantum yield increases with increasing solvent polarity. The fluorescence properties of some of the donor-acceptor dienes have been employed to probing the microenvironment of micelles in terms of their micropolarity, probe solubilization site and critical micelle concentration. Both fluorescence lambda (max) as well as the fluorescence intensity can Ire used to probe the microenvironment of the micelles. It has been inferred that the photoprocesses of donor-acceptor diphenylbutadienes initially involve formation of delocalized pi pi* excited state. In polar solvent, tills state can have B-u(+) character, and being ionic in nature, it is stabilized by polar solvents and substituents leading to red-shifted fluorescence. In non-polar solvents, however, the excited state can be of A, nature resulting in weak emission due to forbidden nature of the 2 A(g) (-) [...] > A(g) transtion. Further, the delocalized pi pi* locally excited state (LE) can get stabilized by non-radiative methods to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state. Depending on the polarity of the medium and solvent reorganization the ICT state can decay to a conformationally relaxed twisted nob-planar state from which much red-shifted fluorescence can occur. The photoisomerization can occur from the polar configurationally perpendicular relaxed species (P*) that can exist in equilibrium with the ICT as well as with the conformationally relaxed twisted non-planer excited state depending on the electronic effects of the substituents and the polarity of the solvent. Further, the mechanism of formation, and involvement of such dipolar excited states in <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> mediated by polyenes linear, particularly retinylidene polyenes, is also highlighted.

PCC 6803 {{is a model}} microbe {{for studying}} biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology of <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes.</b> Importance of this bacterium in basic and applied research calls for a systematic, genome-wide description of its transcriptional regulatory capacity. Characteristic transcriptional responses {{to changes in the}} growth environment are expected to provide a scaffold for describing the Synechocystis transcriptional regulatory network as well as efficient means for functional annotation of genes in the genome. Results We designed, validated and used Synechocystis genome-wide oligonucleotide (70 -mer) microarray (representing 96. 7 % of all chromosomal ORFs annotated {{at the time of the}} beginning of this project) to study transcriptional activity of the cyanobacterial genome in response to sulfur (S) starvation. The microarray data were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. We made five main observations: 1) Transcriptional changes upon sulfate starvation were relatively moderate, but significant and consistent with growth kinetics; 2) S acquisition genes encoding for a high-affinity sulfate transporter were significantly induced, while decreased transcription of genes for phycobilisome, photosystems I and II, cytochrome b 6 /f, and ATP synthase indicated reduced light-harvesting and photosynthetic activity; 3) S starvation elicited transcriptional responses associated with general growth arrest and stress; 4) A large number of genes regulated by S availability encode hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function; 5) Hydrogenase structural and maturation accessory genes were not identified as differentially expressed, even though increased hydrogen evolution was observed. Conclusion The expression profiles recorded by using this oligonucleotide-based microarray platform revealed that during transition from the condition of plentiful S to S starvation, Synechocystis undergoes coordinated transcriptional changes, including changes in gene expression whose products are involved in sensing nutrient limitations and tuning bacterial metabolism. The transcriptional profile of the nutrient starvation was dominated by a decrease in abundances of many transcripts. However, these changes were unlikely due to the across-the-board, non-specific shut down of transcription in a condition of growth arrest. Down-regulation of transcripts encoding proteins whose function depends on a cellular S status indicated that the observed repression has a specific regulatory component. The repression of certain S-related genes was paralleled by activation of genes involved in internal and external S scavenging. </p...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{consists}} of a non-toxic photosensitizing agent (FS) administration followed by a laser source resulting in a sequence of photochemical and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damaging cells. The present work evaluated the effects of PDT nanoemulsion-aluminum chloride phthalocyanine (AlClFc) mediated on malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels, which represent indicators involved in oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses. For this purpose, this study used 120 female rats of the Rattus norvegicus species, Wistar race, divided into 5 groups: Healthy (H), with periodontal disease (PD), with periodontal disease and treatment with FS (F), with periodontal disease and treatment with the laser (L); and periodontal disease and treatment with PDT (FL). An experimental model for represent periodontal disease (PD) was induced by ligature (split-mouth). Seven days later the induction of PD, the treatments were instituted according to the groups. In the group treated with PDT was applied 40 μl FS (5 μM) followed by laser irradiation diode InGaAlP (660 nm, 100 J / cm 2). The rats were sacrificed on the 7 th and 28 th day after treatment and tissue specimens were removed and subjected to histological, immunohistochemical methods and enzymatic colorimetric measurements with detection by UV / VIS spectroscopy. Inflammatory changes, connective tissue disorganization and alveolar bone loss were displaying in groups with PD induced. The enzyme dosages showed that MDA levels were higher in PD induced groups, with {{no statistically significant differences}} (p> 0. 05). High levels of GSH were found in groups L (p = 0. 028) and FL (p = 0. 028) compared with PD group, with statistically significant differences. Immunohistochemistry for SOD showed higher immunostaining in L and FL groups, compared to the PD group without statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05). GPx showed lower immunoreactivity in the DP group when compared to the other groups and statistically significant differences were observed between the DPxL groups (p 0, 05). Níveis elevados de GSH foram encontrados nas ratas saudáveis, com diferenças estatísticas significativas, nos grupos L (p= 0, 028) e FL (p= 0, 028), quando comparados com o grupo DP. Imuno-histoquimicamente, a SOD apresentou maior imunomarcação nos grupos L e FL, comparados ao grupo saudável. Sem diferenças estatísticas significativas (p> 0, 05). GPx mostrou imunomarcação significativamente menor no grupo DP, comparado ao saudável (p= 0, 05) e no grupo F, comparado ao DP (p< 0, 05).

40|$|M. Sc. The ideal cancer {{treatment}} modality {{should not only}} cause tumour regression and eradication but also induce a systemic antitumour response, which {{is essential for the}} control of metastatic tumours and long-term tumour resistance. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a current approach in the treatment of various cancers. It involves the administration of a tumour-localizing photoreactive compound, which is activated at a specific wavelength of light. This therapy results in a sequence of photochemical and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> that cause irreversible photodamage to tumour tissues. Eradication is achieved by anti-tumour effects induced in the parenchyma and tumour vascular network. PDT can lead to a rapid cell death response in malignant cells, which has provided insight into the mechanisms behind photokilling. Oesophageal cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and in South Africa remains a problem of epidemic proportions affecting predominantly black males. The appearance of a number of new photosensitizers being developed will not only extend the number of choices for treating specific cancers, but also aid in the effective destruction of various tumour tissues. PDT has been an experimental clinical modality for the past two xii decades and {{has been shown to be}} successful for the treatment of advanced oesophageal cancer where other options have failed. The full potential of PDT as a treatment modality has not been clearly evaluated, which is one of the objectives of this study. Overall, PDT has the potential of being a promising therapeutic option in the effective treatment of oesophageal cancer, and through this study and the elucidation of the mechanisms of PDT action, it will provide a better future for those suffering from oesophageal cancer. A new photosensitizer known as Zinc Sulphophthalo-cyanine (ZnPcSmix) was studied on an oesophageal SNO cancer cell line in order to determine treatment-induced cell viability, cytotoxicity and the pathway followed to cell death. The major observations of this study revealed that PDT using ZnPcSmix resulted in a decrease in cell viability and proliferation, resulting in a cytotoxic response experienced by the cell. The outcome of this study revealed that the SNO cells experience a necrotic mode of cell death after using ZnPcSmix to induce photodamage. This was examined by light microscopy and confirmed by the lack of DNA fragmentation and decreased caspase- 3 and caspase- 7 expression levels. Hsp 70 levels decreased resulting in lowered cytokine TNF-α release from necrotic cells. Hoechst nuclear staining revealed a disorganized nuclear pattern characteristic of necrotic release of cellular contents. The major findings of this study revealed the efficacy of ZnPcSmix as a new photosensitizing drug used during PDT to treat oesophageal cancer resulting in a decrease in cell viability and proliferation. Necrosis was the primary mechanism by which cells pursued death, which was dependent on the photosensitizer dose, cell type and irradiation fluence. ZnPcSmix–induced photodamage seen during PDT offers a new treatment option for patients suffering from oesophageal cancer and shows great promise in effectively treating early-stage oesophageal cancer...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with properties of the excited states of flavins. They {{may be involved in}} some <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes</b> and are models for flavoprotein catalysis. Understanding the spectral properties of flavins is important for interpreting the nature of intermolecular interactions in flavoproteins. The absorption spectra of many flavin derivatives are similar, but the two long wavelength bands are sensitive to both solvent and substituents. Two independent methods for finding the angle between these absorption oscillators are described. The first, measurement of the fluorescence polarisation of a random but rigid array of the chromophore, is a well known technique. The second is novel, and requires the preparation of a partially ordered solution of flavin by selective blanching with plane polarised light of wavelengths absorbed by only one of the absorption bands. The theory of this technique is developed, and it shows that the angle between the absorption oscillators can be calculated from the dichroic ratios of the extinctions of the two bands after bleaching. This angle does not vary much for different flavins, and the same value (around 30 °) is found from both fluorescence polarisation and dichroic bleaching. The directions of the oscillators relative to the axes of the molecule cannot be measured by either technique, but the effects of substituents on absorption spectra suggest that the visible band is polarised approximately parallel to the long axis of the flavin. The first excited singlet of a flavin loses some of its energy by emission as fluorescence, but it also participates in singlet-to-singlet energy transfer. This is demonstrated by fluorescence for two flavin derivatives, using a methyl cellulose film as the supporting matrix. Optical observations are possible under these conditions at higher flavin concentrations than are easily studied in liquid solutions. Excited singlets may also lose energy by intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet state, but no delayed light emission can be detected from aqueous flavin solutions. In a rigid polyacrylamide matrix, however, there is delayed emission, even at room temperature. This is identified as E-type delayed fluorescence on the basic of its spectrum, its temperature and its exciting light intensity dependence. At lower temperatures the delayed fluorescence decreases, and phosphorescence emission dominates. The intensities and lifetimes of the delayed emissions of 12 flavins have been measured in the range 77 °- 315 °K. On plotting the logarithm of intensity or of the reciprocal of half-life (decay is exponential) against the reciprocal of temperature biphasic Arrhenius plots are obtained. These can be interpreted in terms of the activation energies of the various rate processes associated with triplet production and inactivation. The activation energies from delayed fluorescence intensities and half-lives (5. 9 and 2. 6 kcal/mole respectively for FMN) add to a value close to the energy separating the spectroscopic fluorescence and phosphorescence maxima. A kinetic scheme is proposed to account for this. The activation energy for non-radiative decay of the triplet to the ground state can be calculated from the temperature dependence of phosphorescence, and values of about 100 cal/mole are found. Photochemical reactions of the flavin triplet both in the presence and absence of oxygen have been studied. Anaerobically flavins photo-oxidise many amino acids and amines in their high pH forms, with production of dihydroflavin. When DL-phenylglycine is the reducing agent equimolar amounts of benzaldehyde, carbon dioxide and dihydroflavin are produced. The dependence of reaction rate on reducing agent concentration shows saturation behaviour at high concentrations, which is consistent with a steady state kinetic treatment for the reaction. The sensitivity of rates to substituents in the DL-phenylglycine can be described by a Hammett andrho;-value of andminus; 1. 1. On the basis of their photo reactivities towards a series of flavin derivatives it is suggested that DL-phenylglycine and benzylamine react with a similar rate determining step (probably hydrogen abstraction). This is different from the photoaddition of phenylacetate. Anaerobic photoreductions are quenched by some aromatic compounds. From the effects of temperature and by comparison with quenching by potassium iodide it is concluded that inhibition is not simply a collisional process. FAD reacts more slowly in photo seduction than FMN, but in concentrated urea solutions the difference is reduced. Inhibition by aromatic compounds is also reduced under these conditions. This surges to that the forces between flavin triplet and quencher are at least partially hydrophobic. Aerobic flavin photochemistry is followed by measuring oxygen uptake. Two general types of behaviour are found for oxygen concentrations from 2 andmu;M upwards. Either the reaction rate increases as oxygen is consumed (type I) or it falls (type II). The type I reaction pathway is slow photoreduction followed by rapid reoxidation of dihydroflavin. Evidence for this comes from the dependence of reaction rate on oxygen concentration and pH, and from the Hammett andrho;-value for substituted phenylglycines which {{is similar to that of}} anaerobic photoreduction. Oxygen is also a triplet quencher. Rate constants for the reduction and quenching of FMN triplets by EDTA, diethanolamine and DL-phenylglycine (all type I substrates) are deduced from the dependence of reaction rates on oxygen concentration. In each case quenching is over 10 times as efficient as reaction. The rate constants for all three substrates are similar, increasing in the order DL-phenylglycine andlt; EDTA andlt; diethanolamine. The values for EDTA are 1. 38 andsdot; 10 7 M andminus; 1 sec andminus; 1 for reaction and 1. 6 andsdot; 10 8 M andminus; 1 sec andminus; 1 for quenching. These rate constants can be used to predict a concentration dependence of anaerobic photoreduction which agrees well with experiment. The most likely mechanism for quenching is a rapidly reversed electron transfer. Whereas type I substrates are reducing agents for flavin triplets, type II substrates are typically aromatic molecules which quench anaerobic photoreduction. Tryptophan, for example, has type II kinetics and reacts by a complex mechanism in which product inhibition of reaction occurs. The potential of flavin photosensitized destruction of amino acids as a method for selective chemical modification of proteins is investigated. Tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, methionine, cysteine and phenylalanine all react but none of them has the same pH-profile of reactivity. Preliminary experiments on two proteins, L-glutamate dehydrogenase and D-amino acid oxidase show that the method has promise. An investigation of the behaviour of flavins when they act as Hill oxidants with isolated spinach chloroplasts has also been made. In this reaction light is absorbed t-y the chloroplast and flavin reacts in its ground state. The rates of reduction of 10 derivatives have been compared. The order of reactivity la different from that found for some model systems; dark reduction by NADH or dihydrolipoic acid, the redox potentials, and -photo re duct ion by DL-phenylglycine. The rates are independent of flavin concentration, but vary with the concentration of chloroplasts and light intensity. It is suggested that the reactivity to reduction by chloroplasts depends on binding between chloroplasts and flavin as well as on the electronic character of the flavin. The partition coefficients of flavins between water and butan- 1 -ol lend some support to this hypothesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|In the {{experiments}} {{presented in this}} work, third-order, time-resolved spectroscopy {{was applied to the}} disentanglement of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in polyatomic molecules. The motivation for approaching this problem was given by the decisive role that the coupling of nuclear and electronic dynamics plays in the mechanism of photochemical reactions and <b>photobiological</b> <b>processes.</b> In order to approach this complex problem, different strategies within the framework of time-resolved, four-wave mixing spectroscopy were developed that allowed for the dynamic as well as the energetic aspects of vibronic coupling in non-radiative transitions of polyatomic molecules to be addressed. This was achieved by utilizing the influence of optical as well as Raman resonances on four-wave mixing processes. These resonance effects on third-order, optical processes allow for a high selectivity to be attained with respect to the interrogation of specific aspects of molecular dynamics. The development of different strategies within the framework of time-resolved, four-wave mixing spectroscopy for addressing the problem of vibronic coupling began with {{the experiments}} on gaseous iodine. This simple, well investigated molecular system was chosen in order to unambiguously characterize the effect of Raman resonances on four-wave mixing processes. A time-resolved degenerative four-wave mixing (DFWM) experiment was carried out on gaseous iodine that allowed for the dynamics of coherent Stokes Raman scattering (CSRS) as well as a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) to be observed parallel to the dynamics of a DFWM process at different spectral positions of the FWM signal. Here, the state-selectivity of these different FWM processes manifests itself in the vibrational wave packet dynamics on different electronic potentials of iodine. It could be shown that Raman resonances determine the selectivity with which these FWM processes prepare and interrogate nuclear dynamics in different electronic states. With the insight gained into the relevance of Raman resonant processes in FWM spectroscopy, an experimental scheme was devised that utilizes this effect to selectively interrogate the dynamics of a specific vibrational mode within a polyatomic molecule during a radiationless electronic transition. Here, a CARS process was employed to selectively probe specific vibrational modes of a molecular system by variably tuning the energy difference between the lasers involved in the CARS process to be in Raman resonance with the vibrational energy spacing of a particular vibrational mode. Using this aspect of a tunable resonance enhancement within a CARS scheme, this optical process was incorporated in a time-resolved pump-probe experiment as a mode-selective probe mechanism. This type of experimental configuration, that employs four pulsed laser fields, was classified as a pump-CARS scheme. Here, a laser pulse independent of the CARS process initiates the molecular dynamics that are interrogated selectively with respect to the vibrational mode of the system through the simultaneous interaction of the three pulsed fields involved in the CARS process. Time-resolution on a femtosecond timescale is achieved by introducing a time delay between the independent pump laser and the laser pulses of the CARS process. The experimental configuration of a pump-CARS scheme was applied {{to the study of the}} nuclear dynamics involved in the radiationless electronic transition between the first excited singlet state (S 1) and the electronic ground state (S 0) of all-trans-b-carotene. The mode-selective CARS probe allowed for the characteristic timescale with which specific vibrational modes are repopulated in the S 0 state to be determined. From the varying repopulation times of specific vibrational modes, a mechanism with which the full set of vibrational states of the S 0 potential are repopulated subsequent to the internal conversion process could be postulated. Most importantly, the form of nuclear motion that primarily funnels the population between the two electronic states could be identified as the C=C symmetric symmetric stretch mode in the polyene backbone of b-carotene. With this, the reaction coordinate of this radiationless electronic transition could be identified. The experiment shows, that the CARS probe is capable of determining the nuclear motion coupled to a radiationless electronic transition in complex polyatomic systems. The S 1 /S 0 internal conversion process in b-carotene was further investigated with time-resolved transient gratings. Here, the energetic aspects of a non-adiabatic transition was addressed by determining the influence of the vibrational energy on the rate of this internal conversion. In order to compare the rate of internal conversion taking place out of vibrational ground state modes versus this transition initiating out of vibrationally hot modes, the strategy of shifting the probe mechanism in the transient grating scheme to spectral positions within and out of the red flank of the S 1 absorption profile was pursued. The interrogation of different vibrational states was verified by determining the degree of vibrational cooling, taking place parallel to the internal conversion process. With this strategy, it could be shown that vibrationally hot states contribute to the internal conversion with a higher rate than vibrational ground state modes. In summary, different third-order, optical processes in the framework of time-resolved FWM were applied to the study of non-adiabatic dynamics in polyatomic molecules. By utilizing the effect of optical as well as Raman resonances on different FWM processes, it could be shown that third-order, time-resolved spectroscopy is a powerful tool for gaining insight into complex molecular dynamics such as vibronic coupling. The experiments presented in this work showed that the CARS process, as a mode-selective probe in time-resolved experiments, is capable of disentangling nuclear and electronic dynamics. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden verschiedene zeitaufgelöste, optische Prozesse dritter Ordnung zur Untersuchung nicht-adiabatischer Dynamiken in polyatomaren Molekülen vorgestellt. Derartige Dynamiken haben ihre Ursache in Kopplungen zwischen der Kern- und Elektronenbewegung im jeweiligen molekularen System und spielen eine entscheidende Rolle in vielen photochemischen und photobiologischen Prozessen. Es wurden unterschiedliche Strategien im Rahmen der zeitaufgelösten Vierwellenmisch-Spektroskopie entwickelt, die die Untersuchung sowohl dynamischer als auch energetischer Aspekte der vibronischen Kopplung bei strahlungslosen elektronischen Übergängen in polyatomaren Systemen ermöglichen. Dabei wurden sowohl elektronische als auch Raman-Resonanzen ausgenutzt, um eine hohe Selektivität in der Abfrage der molekularen Dynamik zu erzielen. Um den Einfluss von Raman-Resonanzen auf Vierwellenmisch-Prozesse (FWM = four-wave mixing) eindeutig zu bestimmen, wurde zuerst das einfache und gut charakterisierte molekulare System Jod untersucht. Femtosekunden-zeitaufgelöste entartete Vierwellenmischung (DFWM = degenerate four-wave mixing) an gasförmigem Jod ermöglichte eine simultane Beobachtung der Dynamik kohärenter Stokesscher Raman-Streuung (CSRS = coherent Stokes Raman scattering) und kohärenter anti-Stokesscher Raman-Streuung (CARS = coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering) zusammen mit der Dynamik des eigentlichen DFWM-Prozesses durch Detektion an unterschiedlichen spektralen Positionen des FWM-Signals. Die Zustandsselektivität dieser drei FWM-Prozesse, die sich in der Generierung und Abfrage von Schwingungswellenpaketen auf verschiedenen elektronischen Potentialen von Jod manifestiert, konnte innerhalb eines einzigen Messvorgangs charakterisiert werden. Es zeigte sich, dass die Selektivität der unterschiedlichen FWM-Prozesse maßgeblich durch den Einfluss von Raman-Resonanzen bestimmt wird. Basierend auf den so gewonnenen Erkenntnissen über den Einfluss von Raman-Resonanzen bei FWM-Prozessen, wurde ein experimentelles Schema entwickelt, das es ermöglicht, selektiv bestimmte Schwingungsmoden eines polyatomaren Moleküls während eines strahlungslosen elektronischen Übergangs abzufragen. Hierzu wurde ein CARS-Prozess, der auf eine Raman-Resonanz in einem molekularen System abgestimmt wurde, als Abfrageschritt in einem pump-probe-Schema eingesetzt. Dieses experimentelle Schema, bei dem vier gepulste Laser zum Einsatz kommen, wird in Analogie zu einem herkömmlichen pump-probe-Experiment als pump-CARS-Messung bezeichnet. Hierbei regt ein vom CARS-Prozess unabhängiger pump-Laser einen elektronischen Zustand an, dessen Besetzung durch die simultane Wechselwirkung mit den drei Laserpulsen des CARS-Prozesses modenselektiv abgefragt wird. Durch Einführung einer variablen Verzögerungszeit zwischen dem initiierenden pump-Laser und dem CARS-Prozess lässt sich die Relaxationsdynamik auf einer Femtosekunden-Zeitskala auflösen. Diese experimentelle Konfiguration wurde zur Untersuchung der Kerndynamik des strahlungslosen elektronischen Übergangs zwischen dem ersten elektronisch angeregten Zustand (S 1) und dem elektronischen Grundzustand (S 0) des b-Carotin eingesetzt. Die zustandsselektive Beobachtung der internen Konversion liefert die Zeitkonstanten, mit denen ausgewählte Schwingungsmoden im S 0 -Zustand von b-Carotin wiederbevölkert werden. Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass unterschiedlichen Moden unterschiedliche Zeitkonstanten zugeordnet werden konnten, wurde ein Modell aufgestellt, welches die Konversion in den elektronischen Grundzustand in Abhängigkeit von den Schwingungszuständen beschreibt. So konnte festgestellt werden, dass der Populationstransfer beim strahlungslosen Übergang von der S 1 - auf die S 0 -Potentialfläche vornehmlich über die symmetrische C=C-Streckschwingung verläuft. Mit diesem Experiment konnte gezeigt werden, dass ein CARS-Prozess als Abfrageschritt in einem zeitaufgelösten pump-probe Experiment, in der Lage ist, die Kerndynamik zu bestimmen, die mit einem strahlungslosen elektronischen Übergang in einem komplexen polyatomaren Molekül verbunden ist. Der energetische Aspekt des nicht-adiabatischen Übergangs zwischen dem S 1 - und S 0 -Zustand in b-Carotin wurde mittels zeitaufgelöster transienter Gitter untersucht (TG = transient grating). Hierbei wurde der Einfluss der Schwingungsenergie auf die Geschwindigkeit der internen Konversion bestimmt. Um die Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit der internen Konversion aus schwingungsangeregten Zuständen und Moden im Schwingungsgrundzustand des S 1 -Potentials zu vergleichen, wurde das Signal spektral aufgelöst detektiert. Hierbei beinhaltete die rote Flanke des Absorptionsprofils des S 1 -Zustandes die Dynamik der angeregten Schwingungsmoden. Die Abfrage der Dynamik an einer spektralen Position, die sich im Zentrum des Absorptionsprofils befindet, ermöglichte hingegen die Beobachtung der internen Konversion aus dem Grundzustand der Schwingungszustände. Mit der gewählten experimentellen Methode konnte gezeigt werden, dass schwingungsangeregte Zustände mit einer höheren Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit an der internen Konversion teilnehmen als Moden im Schwingungsgrundzustand. Zusammenfassend wurden in dieser Arbeit unterschiedliche optische Prozesse dritter Ordnung zur Untersuchung nicht-adiabatischer Dynamiken in polyatomaren Molekülen angewandt. Durch Ausnutzung von sowohl elektronischen als auch Raman-Resonanzen auf unterschiedliche FWM-Prozesse konnte gezeigt werden, dass optische Prozesse dritter Ordnung ein geeignetes Werkzeug zur Untersuchung komplexer Moleküldynamiken darstellen. Die Experimente in dieser Arbeit verdeutlichten, dass der CARS-Prozess als modenselektiver Abfrageschritt die spezifische Beobachtung von Kerndynamik während eines elektronischen Übergangs erlaubt...|$|E
