60|$|At last {{her father}} woke, and glad enough was she of his human company. They breakfasted upon some {{biscuits}} and water, and afterwards, while Mr. Clifford watched {{near the entrance}} with his rifle, Benita set to work to arrange their belongings. The tent she managed to <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> {{the wall of the}} cave by help of some of the wood which they had carried in. Beneath it she spread their blankets, that it might serve as a sleeping place for them both, and outside placed the food and other things.|$|E
60|$|Usually he was <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> pillows, {{because so}} he breathed more easily. He slept hardly at all.|$|R
60|$|Joan {{found the}} bandit half <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a saddle {{with a damp}} and pallid face, but an {{altogether}} different look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah, Jack! I {{was afraid}} that they had done for you," [...] a voice said, and he saw Tucker and Hill sitting <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a wall.|$|R
60|$|Around a pile {{of rocks}} they found a sailor. He was <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a tree, and was {{suffering}} from some burns on his legs and feet.|$|R
60|$|Finally, <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the cup he {{had once}} won in a {{handicap}} competition, he saw a letter. With a sinking heart he tore open the envelope.|$|R
60|$|He {{went to his}} attic and {{sat down}} on the bed. <b>Propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the wall was the picture. He looked at it with unseeing eyes. He stared dully before him.|$|R
60|$|After {{this came}} another lull, and Henry ran to where Barringford had been placed. He found the old frontiersman <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> some brushwood, over which {{a pair of}} {{blankets}} had been spread. He tried to smile at the youth.|$|R
60|$|That {{picture of}} Mrs. Phillips, <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the pillows, with her make-up box upon her knees was still before {{her when she}} went to bed. All night long it haunted her: whether {{thinking}} or dreaming of it, she could not tell.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} that sigh came a sound of {{something}} falling outside against the door. He opened it to see what might be there. The spaniel John, lying on a cushion of blue linen, with his head <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the wall, darkly turned his eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced out}} of the window. Coketown {{was nothing more than}} a ragged {{hillside}} dotted with a score of black dismal huts <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> dreary mounds of slag and clinkers. It rained in slanting torrents, too, and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to the railroad-tracks.|$|R
5000|$|The entire {{confrontation}} {{had been}} witnessed by a 15-year-old Dublin trainee photographer, John J Horgan, who captured the scene {{moments after the}} shooting, showing Treacy lying dead on the pavement and Price <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a doorway a few feet away. Making a statement to a reporter, Ormonde Winter called the event [...] "a tragedy".|$|R
50|$|Tyburn had {{significance}} {{from ancient}} times and {{was marked by}} a monument known as Oswulf's Stone, which gave {{its name to the}} Ossulstone Hundred of Middlesex. The stone was covered over in 1851 when Marble Arch was moved to the area, but it was shortly afterwards unearthed and <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the Arch. It has not been seen since 1869.|$|R
60|$|He walked off, {{taking the}} letter with him, and, <b>propping</b> it <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the sugar-basin, made but a poor breakfast.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, the building was abandoned and in a state of disrepair. In 2008, wooden planks were <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> its façade in order to prevent it from collapsing. The foundations were also unstable since it was constructed on top of a clay base. The local councils of both Rabat and Mdina lobbied to the government for its restoration.|$|R
60|$|In the High Street {{he stopped}} at Clifford's the gunmaker's, and bought a heavy revolver, {{with a box of}} central-fire cartridges. Six of them he slipped into the chambers, and half-cocking the weapon, placed it in the pocket of his coat. He then made his way to Hastie's rooms, where the big oarsman was {{lounging}} over his breakfast, with the Sporting Times <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the coffee-pot.|$|R
60|$|Sir Isaac Hook {{was still}} sitting <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the stump of the tree, and that for the best of reasons. A length of his own infallible fishing line was twisted and {{tightened}} twice round his throat and then twice round the wooden prop behind him. The leading investigator ran forward and touched the fisherman's hand, {{and it was as}} cold as a fish.|$|R
60|$|I {{was left}} alone with those nine corpses <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> awfully <b>against</b> the naked rock, {{and one of the}} nine the man I had murdered.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{painting}} and diarama made by L of exhibit department for new Washington office, April 1928. A painting {{can be seen at}} center <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> on a brick wall. It depicts a few people standing outside near boulders, trees, and mountains in the background. A second painting of a mountain scene as viewed from a mountaintop can be seen at left. A third, smaller painting can be seen at right <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the wall. Boxes and painting supplies can be seen on the ground...|$|R
60|$|Returning to the river, {{he pulled}} up {{what was left of}} the bushes. These he did not put on the fire, but <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the broad back of the buffalo, forming a little shelter, into which he crawled in an {{endeavor}} to protect himself from the rain. Night was now on him, and he felt certain that he would have to remain in the spot until morning.|$|R
5000|$|This {{painting}} depicts an African American man, Brother Brown, {{sitting on}} a park bench, smoking a pipe, under a tree. He has a cane on at his side, <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the bench. He wears a hat, white button-up shirt, suspenders, brown trousers and dark brown shoes. A large sack sits on the ground by him. [...] "Potatoes" [...] is written on the bag. The man looks at the towards the viewer.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a large}} male lion {{staring into}} the foreground, while others laze around behind it in an outdoor pen at Gay's Lion Farm, ca. 1931. A lion with a thick mane stares into the foreground, while another can be seen lying behind it. Several wooden logs are <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a stand in the {{background}} at right, while more lions sleep in a pile against a tall wire fence at left. Foliage is visible behind the outdoor pen...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{the remains}} of an adobe mill in the Arroyo Hondo located on the Rancho El Refugio del Ortegas, September 5, 1937. A squat shack made of adobe brick is shown nestled against a hill at left, {{just in front of}} {{what appears to be a}} lush tree. Several of its walls have {{collapsed}} into rubble, and wooden beams can be seen <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the remaining walls. The wooden roof, however, appears relatively well kept...|$|R
60|$|Charley was {{to return}} to town that night, and they had not {{therefore}} much time to lose; they went upstairs at once, and found Linda and Uncle Bat in the patient's room. It was a lovely August evening, and the bedroom window opening upon the river was unclosed. Katie, as she sat <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the pillows, could look out upon the water and see the reedy island, on which in happy former days she had so delighted to let her imagination revel.|$|R
50|$|A Feast of Vultures’ cover {{depicts the}} high-stakes world of big money and corruption, and equally the {{real-world}} impact {{of what that}} means. The cover combines a searing picture(Corbis/Getty) - the bed of a farmer who committed suicide, his photograph <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a pillow - with looming skyscrapers. Black-and-white tones heighten the effect of grimness. Together, the two photos form an image that speaks of two Indias and of how devastatingly one of them, and only one of them, could impact the other.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of {{a custom}} house in Yohohama, Japan, [s. d. ]. Thick trees hang over the foreground while the custom house stands several stories tall at center. A large clock can be seen above the large entrance {{of the house with}} {{what appears to be a}} tall bell tower standing above it. In the foreground, a thin pole can be seen <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a similar pole to the left of the entrance. A notes on the bottom of the photograph reads, "Custom House, Yohohama, Japan"...|$|R
60|$|As I {{drained the}} glass now, new life seemed to burgeon within me. I {{remember}} Jeeves, who, however much he may {{go off the}} rails at times {{in the matter of}} dress clothes and in his advice to those in love, has always had a neat turn of phrase, once speaking of someone rising on stepping-stones of his dead self to higher things. It was that way with me now. I felt that the Bertram Wooster who lay <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the pillows had become a better, stronger, finer Bertram.|$|R
6000|$|And as they gallop {{past the}} wounded and the dying lift {{themselves}} {{up from the}} blood-stained earth, and raise their feeble voices to join in that triumphant call: [...] "Vive l'Empereur!" [...] There's an old veteran there, who fought at Austerlitz and at Jena; he has three stripes upon his sleeve, but both his legs are shattered and he lies on the roadside <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a hedge, and as the superb cavalry ride proudly by he shouts lustily: [...] "Forward, comrades! a last victorious charge! Long live the Emperor!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He evidently thinks {{himself on}} top to stay," [...] came from Sam, who had <b>propped</b> himself <b>up</b> <b>against</b> an empty cask. [...] "Oh, {{if only we}} knew {{what had become of}} Dick!" [...] he went on.|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, Interview {{with the}} Vampire by Anne Rice was published. The main character, {{although}} dark, wanted companionship and love. The book, according to music journalist Dave Thompson, slowly created {{an audience for}} gothic rock by word of mouth. The same year saw the punk rock band the Damned debut. The group's vocalist, Dave Vanian, was a former gravedigger who dressed like a vampire. Brian James, a guitarist for the group, noted, [...] "Other groups had safety pins and the spitting and bondage trousers, but {{you went to a}} Damned show, and half the local cemetery would be <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the stage".|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{manufacturing}} {{space at the}} Radio Corporation of America plant, ca. 1940. At center, one can see rows off office space, with desks forming thin dividers between narrow walkways. Most desks have a folding chair <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> them, and at right, one can see a line of {{what appear to be}} filing cabinets. Large ceiling lights hang from the roof overhead.; Photoprint reads: "General view of the major portion of the manufacturing space in the Radio Corporation of America plant located at 11819 W. Olympic Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. This view shows approximately half of the factory floor space"...|$|R
5000|$|Both she and Knocker {{ended up}} in Belgium {{as part of the}} corps which {{included}} Dorothie Feilding and May Sinclair. Initially quartered at Ghent, the unit relocated to Furnes at the end of October where the women worked tirelessly picking up wounded soldiers mid-way from the front and transporting them back to their field hospital at the rear. After the beds ran out, the wounded were laid on the floor or <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the wall. As the dead piled up, the two nurses were told to remove them to the mortuary. Chisholm wrote in her diary: ...|$|R

25|$|The stone {{appears in}} several {{chapters}} of Edward Rutherfurd's novel, London (1997). In the second chapter {{we see it}} as the marker stone for all the roads in Roman Londinium, and also sitting beside the wall of the Governor's Palace as mentioned above as a hypothesis of its use or origin. It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the foundling who is found <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> it. The stone {{is one of the many}} central focus points in the novel that the author uses to tie the different time periods together.|$|R
40|$|Full-length {{shot of a}} woman {{dressed in}} a white, floor-length crocheted dress. She is lying on a fur rug with her back <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> {{cushions}} and rugs. A painted canvas backdrop is creating the impression of the scene being set in a park. Vela (Avgusta) Nigrinova (1862, Ljubljana – 1908, Belgrade) {{was the daughter of}} a Czechoslovakian father and a Slovenian mother. She was married to Davorin Jenko, a Slovenian composer {{and the author of the}} Serbian national anthem 'Bože pravde'. Vela is considered a superb early Serbian actress. For the major part of her acting career she lived in Belgrade and played at the Royal Serbian National Theatre...|$|R
