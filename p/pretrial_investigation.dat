40|$|This {{research}} is {{an assessment of}} the level to which the right to a fair trial as enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights is available in the Republic of Lithuania. It is also intended to fill a void in the literature on the functioning of human rights protection in contemporary Lithuania. Three aspects of Article 6 are considered: judicial independence; the rights of the parties; and implementation of the Convention. Also considered is the residual effect of Soviet cultural history, which appears to continue its affects on Lithuania’s legal system {{to the detriment of the}} right to a fair trial. Although the judiciary appears institutionally independent, its members do not appear independent in fact. Potential parties to litigation may be denied access to a court for some claims. Parties in litigation face the possibility of lengthy proceedings, persons suspected of a crime face potentially lengthy <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigations</b> with indeterminate periods of detention, and targets of criminal investigations can face public opinion assessing guilt, including by political leaders and the prosecution service. The prosecution service also appears institutionally independent, while its members do not appear independent in fact. In considering implementation of the Convention, Lithuania has complied with most of the adverse judgments by the European Court of Human Rights. However, Lithuania’s promise to provide conditions for a fair trial in the national legal order, made when it adopted the Convention, appears in need of substantial improvement. At the most fundamental level there are three areas that would benefit the prospects for a fair trial in Lithuania: increased public education and civic involvement; improve quality of public services by improving legal education and training, including compliance with professional ethics; and developing problem solving techniques focused on improving system functions rather than assigning fault...|$|R

In {{this final}} master's thesis {{the actions of}} {{expertise}} and object‘s research, the rights, duties and responsibilities of subjects who carry out expertises and object‘s research are discussed and requirements to become these subjects are raised. In this work the problems that face experts and specialists performing assigned to them tasks are analysed. Nowadays the procedural action – object‘s research lacks of a more detailed juridical regulation {{as in the case}} of expertise this procedural action is regulated much more widely – both in acts of law and described in the scientific literature. Such today’s situation has an impact on our beliefs evaluating these procedural action thus the subject is relevant today. This work is written following various scientific literature which reflects both the older times and the present, what has changed during that time performing the actions of expertise and object‘s research. Writing this work various acts of law, pieces of legislation, codes, guidelines that establish the functions of expertises and object‘s research are analysed. In addition to the above-mentioned sources of law, the final work follows foreign literature and the Lithuanian Supreme Court practice. Analysing and investigating various acts of law and scientific sources the master's thesis is written using comparative, descriptive (analytical), linguistic methods and the method of analysis of juridical documents. The master's thesis consists of three chapters in which issues related to expertise and object‘s research ranging from interpretation of the concepts to problematic aspects are analysed. In the first chapter general features characteristic of expertises and object‘s research are discussed – the concept of these proceedings in the criminal process is presented. In the first chapter is also explained the importance of the use of special knowledge, the aims of expertises and object‘s research and their appointment procedure are set. Special knowledge used by the subjects of criminal procedure – specialists and experts – ensure a smooth course of the process. The use of this knowledge is not only involved in the criminal process but also performs a very important function- it brings benefit to the investigation of criminal offence and helps to assume the conclusion of specialist and the act of expertise probative power in the process. Specialists and experts are responsible for the proper use of this special knowledge because only they have the competence to solve the answers for these issues that require knowledge. In the second chapter of the work the requirements to become an expert or specialist and the rights, duties and responsibilities of these subjects are presented. Analysing the requirements for functions performed by experts and specialists, it should be noted that the work of these subjects really is very responsible and requires high criteria. The requirements for court experts in statutory order are larger than for specialists but it does not mean that they have more rights than specialists. Specialists are often compared with the experts, perhaps to some purpose, because their duties and responsibilities remain the same and the performed investigations are equally important to the present case. In the last, the third chapter the problematic aspects faced by experts and specialists performing their functions are analysed. Some problems that aren‘t answered until now are distinguished: 1) The equivalence of the actions of expertise and object‘s research. Analysing this problem should be noted that deciding which document is more valid, the written act by the expert or findings of a specialist, it is necessary to follow statutory provisions. In current laws, both the Criminal Procedure Code of Lithuania and other laws there is no statutory provision which would confirm that one action of the process is more reliable than the other. Court practice also does not provide an answer to this question. The authors of the comment of Criminal Procedure Code G. Goda and others are of the opinion that the appointment of a specialist in criminal proceedings is simpler than the one of an expert but in regard to probative information findings of a specialist aren‘t less important than the act of expertise. 2) The equivalence of findings of the <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigation</b> officer performing the functions of a specialist and the ones of a specialist who doesn‘t work in the <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigation</b> office. Analysing this issue the opinions of scientists of criminal proceedings and the standard of Criminal procedure code that regulates the assimilation of the <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigation</b> officer with a specialist are followed. After the analysis on the subject it should be noted that the findings presented by the <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigation</b> officer are equal to the findings of a specialist and have the same probative power. 3) The application of the <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigation</b> actions – inspection, research of the scene of the crime, object‘s research, experiment. Exploring the application of these actions, between which experts and specialists sometimes get confused it is clear that most of the proceedings really have many similarities and specialists and experts sometimes choose not a right investigation or perform it wrong, how it should be performed, or do not understand why exactly such an investigation assign to perform the subjects who have right for that. There is indeed lack of a more detailed juridical regulation and description of certain investigations and in particular of their sorts. Also important are teamwork, training and experience because all of this will help to choose the right investigation and perform it thoroughly. 4) The assessment of findings presented by experts and specialists in regard to admissibility of evidentiary material. Assessing the findings presented by experts and specialists whether they may on the whole be recognized as evidentiary material are followed formal criteria which do not give any information about the content validity of findings presented by above – mentioned subjects, idest they are assessed according to general requirements of Article 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code as the law does not regulate any special standards for the assessment of the findings or acts presented by experts and specialists. In the course of work this and other problems are analysed, generalizations and conclusions are presented...|$|E

In 22 violent offenders undergoing <b>pretrial</b> forensic psychiatric <b>investigation,</b> interpersonal and behavioral features of psychopathy, measured by the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R), were significantly predicted by low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of 5 -HIAA and high CSF concentrations of HVA in multivariate regression models.

40|$|To {{describe}} lifetime {{mental disorders}} among perpetrators of severe inter-personal crimes {{and to identify}} the problem domains most closely associated with aggression {{and a history of}} repeated violent criminality, we used structured interviews, clinical assessments, analyses of intellectual functioning, medical and social files, and collateral interviews in 100 consecutive subjects of <b>pretrial</b> forensic psychiatric <b>investigations.</b> Childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), learning disability, tics and autism spectrum disorders] affected 55 % of the subjects and formed complex comorbidity patterns with adult personality disorders [including psychopathic traits according to the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) ], mood disorders and substance abuse. The closest psychiatric covariates to high Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA) scores and violent recidivism were the PCL-R scores and childhood conduct disorder (CD). Behavioral and affective PCL-R factors were closely associated with childhood AD/HD, CD, and autistic traits. The results support the notion that childhood-onset social and behavioral problems form the most relevant psychiatric symptom cluster in relation to pervasive adult violent behavior, while late-onset mental disorders are more often associated with single acts of violent or sexual aggression...|$|R
40|$|This {{introductory}} text explores the historical {{origins of the}} main legal institutions that came to characterize the Anglo-American legal tradition, and to distinguish it from European legal systems. The book contains both text and extracts from historical sources and literature. The book is published in color, and contains over 250 illustrations, many in color, including medieval illuminated manuscripts, paintings, books and manuscripts, caricatures, and photographs. Two great themes dominate the book: (1) the origins, development, and pervasive influence of the jury system and judge/jury relations across eight centuries of Anglo-American civil and criminal justice; and (2) the law/equity division, from {{the emergence of the}} Court of Chancery in the fourteenth century down through equity’s conquest of common law in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The chapters on criminal justice explore the history of <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigation,</b> policing, trial, and sentencing, as well as the movement in modern times to nonjury resolution through plea bargaining. Considerable attention is devoted to distinctively American developments, such as the elective bench, and the influence of race relations on the law of criminal procedure.

40|$|Unlike rules {{governing}} discovery in civil cases, which {{require that the}} two sides exchange most information about their respective cases, criminal discovery result {{in a much more}} limited flow of information. Many commentators, for many years, have called for the liberalization of criminal discovery statutes and rules. Indeed, some states have heeded the call. But about a dozen states follow the highly restrictive federal rule, which is premised in part on the idea that a defendant should not be entitled to witness names or statements for <b>pretrial</b> <b>investigation,</b> but rather only for cross-examination purposes should the case ever get to that stage. The remaining states fall between the two models. New York is on the restrictive end of the spectrum. Investigation of the prosecution’s case and possible defenses has long been recognized as a core function of defense counsel in a criminal case, one that is necessary to the testing of the facts in our adversarial system. This function has been constitutionalized as the Sixth Amendment duty to 2 ̆ 2 make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. ” This article describes the development of that duty, especially as it relates to recent Supreme Court jurisprudence. Also, there are clear connections among the effective assistance of counsel, the duty to investigate and discovery. This article explores those connections and to urge a Sixth Amendment analysis of restrictive discovery rules and describes how restrictive discovery rules block the delivery of effective assistance of counsel when defense counsel has insufficient information to investigate the case. Finally, this article summarizes the purpose of pretrial discovery in criminal cases and discusses why the three major contentions in support of restrictive discovery-likely perjury by the defendant, lack of reciprocity in the discovery process, and potential witness intimidation-lack validity. This article concludes by suggesting that the prophylactic rule of open file discovery is an appropriate remedy for the constitutional conflict between the duty to investigate and state barriers to the information necessary to carry out that duty...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to replicate previously reported findings of abnormal frontal and/or temporal cerebral blood flow in violent offenders and to control for the influence of major mental disorder (MMD), substance abuse, and current medication. HMPAO-SPECT-CBF and MRI scans from <b>pretrial</b> forensic psychiatric <b>investigations</b> of 21 subjects convicted of impulsive violent crimes were retrospectively re-evaluated. In 16 / 21 subjects, visual assessment of SPECT scans showed some hypoperfusion in the temporal and/or frontal lobes. MRI showed no corresponding structural damage. Quantified regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in defined regions of interest was compared between index cases and 11 healthy control subjects. Index subjects had significant reductions in the right angular gyrus and the right medial temporal gyrus, bilaterally in the hippocampus, and in the left white frontal matter, but they had significantly increased rCBF in the parietal association cortex bilaterally. The aberrations were as frequent and severe among the subjects without MMD, substance abuse, and current medication (n= 7) as in the entire group of index subjects...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{replicate}} {{the relation between}} the CSF HVA: 5 -HIAA ratio and psychopathic traits previously reported in a pilot group of 22 perpetrators of violent crimes. METHODS: CSF monoamine metabolite concentrations in another 28 violent and sexual offenders, aged 45 or below, referred to <b>pretrial</b> forensic psychiatric <b>investigation,</b> were compared to features of psychopathy according to the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). RESULTS: Our previous finding was repeated in the new study group, where the HVA: 5 -HIAA ratio was strongly associated with psychopathic traits (r = 0. 50, p = 0. 010), particularly its behavioural aspects (r = 0. 523, p = 0. 004). In subsamples of individuals from both study groups who had no medication (n = 25) or no current axis I disorder, including a history of mood disorder or substance dependence (n = 21), the HVA: 5 -HIAA ratio remained strongly associated with all psychopathy factors but most closely with the behavioural features. Retrospective assessments of childhood disruptive symptomatology, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or conduct disorder, analysed in relation to the monoamine metabolites, showed the same association with the HVA: 5 -HIAA ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Violent and aggressive behavioural traits with childhood onset and adult expression as psychopathic features are associated with changed activity in the brain dopaminergic system, possibly as a result of serotonergic dysregulation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and aims. Mental {{disorders}} among {{perpetrators of}} violent and sexual crimes {{differ from those}} in the general population in prevalence, course, and patterns of comorbidity. The Göteborg Forensic Neuropsychiatry Projects was initiated to map neuropsychiatric vulnerability factors (disorders, deficits, symptoms, and neurobiological aberrations) among violent offenders and analyze the findings in relation to life histories of violent crimes and aggression. Subjects and Methods. A total of 170 violent and sexual offenders referred to <b>pretrial</b> forensic psychiatric <b>investigation</b> were examined in two Pilot and one Main study. Lifetime psychiatric disorders, including childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit (AD) /hyperactivity disorder (HD), tics, and mental retardation), conduct disorder (CD), adult mental disorders, substance abuse, and personality disorders, including psychopathic traits, were assessed by means of clinical diagnostic interviews, symptom ratings, and neuropsychological tests. Regional and chemical CNS activity and possible pathological changes were investigated by brain imaging (MRI and SPECT) and cerebrospinal fluid analyses (monoamine metabolites, albumin ratios, Ig-indices, tau protein, and GAP- 43). Results. All mental disorders had high prevalences. Within the study group, retrospectively rated childhood AD/HD and CD were independently the closest psychiatric covariates to adulthood psychopathy and violent criminality. Frontotemporal regional blood flow was decreased compared to controls and negatively correlated with interpersonal aspects of psychopathy. The CSF HVA/ 5 -HIAA ratio correlated with all aspects of psychopathy. There was a higher than expected prevalence of protein leakage across the blood-brain barrier and minor pathological changes on MRI scans, but no consistent pattern of brain disease or damage. Interpersonal traits of psychopathy covaried especially with decreased limbic blood flow, while the emotional traits covaried with attention deficits, and the behavioral traits with hyperactivity/impulsivity and CSF HVA/ 5 -HIAA. Conclusion. Childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders and disruptive behaviors are core problems also among adult offenders and call for comprehensive and structured diagnostic practices with a lifetime perspective, including neurobiological assessments, and targeted care with individually designed treatment programs...|$|R
