5|$|Ziggler beat United States Champion Kofi Kingston in a non-title {{match on}} the May 30 episode of Raw, {{leading to a}} {{championship}} match at Capitol Punishment which Ziggler won to earn his first United States Championship. The next night on Raw, Kingston invoked his rematch clause in a {{two out of three}} falls match and won via disqualification, allowing Ziggler to retain. After Jack Swagger suggested to Guerrero that she should manage him in addition to Ziggler, a jealous Ziggler teased tension with Swagger. This, coupled with Ziggler's concurrent feud with Alex Riley, led to Ziggler to defend and retain his United States Championship in a fatal four-way match against Swagger, Riley, and John Morrison at Night of Champions. On the September 19 episode of Raw, Ziggler lost a non-title match to Zack Ryder when guest star Hugh Jackman helped Ryder by punching Ziggler in the face. Although Ziggler later claimed to have a broken jaw due to Jackman's <b>punch,</b> <b>it</b> was reported that the supposed injury was fake. Later that night, Guerrero officially began managing Swagger, and Swagger began interfering in Ziggler's matches to help him win. Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Air Boom for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Hell in a Cell and at Vengeance, where Ziggler also successfully defended the United States Championship against Ryder. He went on to successfully defend the championship against Morrison at Survivor Series. At , Ziggler lost the United States Championship to Ryder.|$|E
25|$|A {{week later}} he faced, Charley White, the man most sports-writers {{believed}} was the natural {{contender for the}} lightweight title. The ten round bout, held in Milwaukee, was a one-sided affair with Welsh landing {{four times as many}} punches as White. Despite White having the stronger <b>punch,</b> <b>it</b> was not until the tenth that he managed to draw blood, and many writers failed to give him even one round.|$|E

25|$|When Life {{was founded}} in 1883, it was {{developed}} as similar to the British magazine, <b>Punch.</b> <b>It</b> was published for 53 years as a general-interest light entertainment magazine, heavy on illustrations, jokes and social commentary. It featured {{some of the greatest}} writers, editors, illustrators and cartoonists of its era, including Charles Dana Gibson, Norman Rockwell and Jacob Hartman Jr. Gibson became the editor and owner of the magazine after John Ames Mitchell died in 1918. During its later years, the magazine offered brief capsule reviews (similar to those in The New Yorker) of plays and movies currently running in New York City, but with the innovative touch of a colored typographic bullet resembling a traffic light, appended to each review: green for a positive review, red for a negative one, and amber for mixed notices.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the game}} {{appeared}} to be over. However, the Steelers were forced to advance the ball towards another score instead of taking a quarterback kneel because the Colts still had three timeouts remaining. But on Pittsburgh's first play, in which Bettis tried to <b>punch</b> <b>it</b> in for an insurance touchdown, he fumbled {{for the first time}} all season when linebacker Gary Brackett popped it from Bettis' hands with his helmet. Indianapolis defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and {{appeared to be}} on his way for an Indy touchdown that would have given the Colts the lead when Roethlisberger made a season saving tackle at the Colts' 42-yard line, spinning around and grabbing his ankle. Eventually, the Colts then advanced to the Pittsburgh 28-yard line, but Vanderjagt, who had been perfect at home in the playoffs, missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal attempt wide right with 17 seconds left, and the Steelers ran out the clock.|$|E

500|$|In 1917 the United States entered World War I, {{and some}} players (including Andy Hastings and Jimmy Dehart) entered {{military}} service. Pittsburgh played an undefeated full season despite the war, {{although it was}} not awarded the national championship. Although the team lacked the previous year's <b>punch,</b> <b>it</b> dominated the opposition. A key aspect of its success was the opposing coaches' inability to address Warner's evolving strategies; according to Powers, [...] "His reverse plays were a mystery, although Pop always was willing to explain them in detail to any other coach".|$|E
500|$|Worsening {{matters for}} Washington, the only {{available}} {{replay of the}} incident showed just his punch, not the scuffle that preceded it. This made the attack appear unprovoked, [...] and Saturday Night Live, then watched {{by an average of}} 30 to 35 million people, replayed the punch countless times as a gag, having cast member Garrett Morris comically defend the <b>punch.</b> <b>It</b> was also the subject of a New York Times editorial and investigated on CBS News by Walter Cronkite. Washington was fined $10,000, and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. The Rockets were furious. Tomjanovich missed {{the rest of the season}} and they felt Washington should at least have done likewise.|$|E
500|$|In December 1956, Manning {{published}} My Husband Cartwright, {{a series}} of twelve sketches about Reggie that had originally appeared in <b>Punch.</b> <b>It</b> was not widely reviewed, and as usual Manning was frustrated and annoyed. The book {{was to be a}} precursor of her portrait of her husband in Fortunes of War, detailing comic episodes that highlighted Reggie's character, including his gregarious nature and interest in social issues: [...] "My husband Cartwright is a lover of his fellow-men. Lovers of their fellow-men can be maddening... While lecturing abroad he suddenly conceived a resentment of 'sights' especially 'useless' sights, such as ruins or tombs. You might suppose that were it not for such distractions as Tiberias, the Valley of the Kings or Hadrian's Villa, tourists abroad would occupy themselves solely in alleviating poverty." ...|$|E

500|$|Silver Star Story Complete {{sold over}} 223,000 units within {{its first year}} in North America, {{including}} the entire production run of the four-disc collector's edition. The game became the highest-selling Working Designs title to date, and the third highest-selling role-playing game of 1999 behind Final Fantasy VIII and [...] [...] A heavy media push in magazines and websites brought recognition to the game, and alerted customers that Working Designs planned to cease production of the title starting December 31, 1999. English reviews of the game were typically favorable, with critics such as Electronic Gaming Monthly remarking that Lunars [...] "plot, writing and voice acting are about the best you'll find", awarding the game an editor's choice gold award. The game's translation was equally applauded by , calling it [...] "spotless", and remarking that Working Designs' unique humor was applied to every bit of text in the game, including weapon descriptions. [...] Official PlayStation Magazine remarked that [...] "what little [...] lacks in visual <b>punch,</b> <b>it</b> more than makes up for in style, story and wholly engrossing gameplay" [...] {{calling attention to the}} game's programming and extra packaging.|$|E
500|$|On March 28, 2014, Blount {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with the Pittsburgh Steelers. On August 20, 2014, Blount and fellow Steeler running back Le'Veon Bell were out cruising in Bell's Camaro with a female, when traffic officer Sean Stafiej pulled over the Camaro operated by Bell around 1:30 p.m. after Stafiej, who was on a motorcycle, noticed a strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. Stafiej found a 20 gram bag of marijuana inside the car. Bell, Blount, and a female passenger all claimed ownership of the marijuana according to police. Bell, 22, {{was taken to a}} hospital to have blood drawn [...] Both Blount and Bell were arrested for marijuana possession. In addition, Bell also received a DUI. On September 7, 2014, Blount scored his first touchdown as a Steeler against the Cleveland Browns. On September 21, 2014, Blount ran for 118 yards on 10 carries and a touchdown against the Carolina Panthers. This game was the only game of the season with 100-plus yards. On November 9, 2014, Blount returned a kick-off for 21 yards and had three carries for 8 yards when he was brought on the field to <b>punch</b> <b>it</b> in on first-&-goal from the one-yard-line, down 20-6 against the New York Jets, halfway through the fourth quarter. On first down, Blount was sent to carry the ball off the left guard for no gain. The Steelers ran the very same play on second down, but the Jets were expecting it and already in the backfield before Blount even got the ball, with Blount's attempt to shake loose going terribly wrong (losing 8 yards) and leaving the Steelers facing third-&-goal from the nine-yard-line. That play marked the final time Blount would touch the ball as a Steeler. [...] On November 17, 2014, Blount left the game against the Tennessee Titans, after not getting a single touch all day for the first time all season, before the game ended (while Pittsburgh was in the [...] "victory formation"). Blount was subsequently released by the Steelers {{as a result of his}} actions. Blount finished his short-term Steelers tenure with 266 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
2500|$|Trailing 7–6, the Gators {{took the}} lead with a key play on defense. [...] Upon {{entering}} the contest in the second quarter, Bulldogs quarterback DJ Shockley was intercepted by Gators safety Guss Scott, who returned it for a touchdown, giving his team a 12–7 lead after a failed two-point conversion attempt. [...] The Bulldogs moved the ball but could not <b>punch</b> <b>it</b> into the endzone, settling for two field goals to take a halftime 13–12 lead. [...] The defenses continued to dominate in the second half, until an early fourth-quarter Gator drive ended with a touchdown pass from quarterback Rex Grossman and gave Florida a 20–13 advantage. [...] The Georgia offense failed to score again and failed to convert a third-down in thirteen attempts as Florida held on for the upset.|$|E

But none of the other machines was so tyrannical as the time-clock. Una admitted to herself that she didn't see how it was possible to get so many employees together promptly without it, and she was duly edified {{by the fact that the}} big chiefs <b>punched</b> <b>it,</b> too....

2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to <b>punch</b> <b>it</b> in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the masonry drill bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and wall plugs.|$|E
2500|$|Albus Dumbledore {{appears in}} some episodes of Robot Chicken voiced by Seth Green. In [...] "Password: Swordfish" [...] when {{the threat of}} the puberty {{creature}} Pubertis is known, Dumbledore gives Harry a stone that might help him fight Pubertis. During this appearance, Dumbledore is an African-American who states that he is played by a different actor in each of the movies. Upon confrontation with Pubertis, Harry rubs the stone two times, which summons ghosts to <b>punch</b> <b>it.</b> When it comes to the third time, Dumbledore appears and tells Harry that the stone can only be warmed up three times a day (four if he takes a week off) and that Pubertis cannot be destroyed since it lives in everyone just like his own demon Wandus Limpus prevents him from having meaningful relationships. In [...] "Tell My Mum", Dumbledore tells the students that Professor Snape suffered a [...] "minor potion accident" [...] and has enlisted Criss Angel as their substitute teacher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{art of the}} {{editorial}} cartoon was further developed {{with the publication of}} the periodical Punch in 1841, founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was Monthly Sheet of Caricatures, printed from 1830 and an important influence on <b>Punch).</b> <b>It</b> was bought by Bradbury and Evans in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term [...] "cartoon" [...] to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and [...] "carttons" [...] for the mural were displayed for the public; the term [...] "cartoon" [...] then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or [...] in Italian. [...] Punch humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the Punch cartoons led to the term's widespread use.|$|E
