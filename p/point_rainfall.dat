40|$|The Albert {{catchment}} (688 km 2) {{is located}} in south east Queensland, Australia. There are no automatic weather stations (AWS) that record fine timescale rainfall located within the catchment, but there are 32 AWS located within a square region (150 km x 150 km) encompassing the catchment. Also, the catchment is under the Mt. Stapylton rainfall radar. For daily rain gauges, 11 are located within the catchment and 266 within the square region. These point datasets were used to generate hourly rainfields over the catchment at a grid resolution of 1 km 2. The daily spatial rainfall model is based on Kriging interpolation with the parameters estimated using <b>point</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> data. Disaggregation of the spatial daily rainfields into hourly rainfields is achieved using the scaled hourly storm profile of the nearest AWS station. In order to test the model, the full hourly radar rainfields were used as input into a GIS rainfall-runoff model, and the generated discharges were considered as the 'TRUTH'. Then, the collocated <b>point</b> daily radar <b>rainfall</b> values were selected to run the spatial rainfall model to generate the daily rainfields. These daily rainfields were then disaggregated into hourly rainfields using the nearest collocated AWS station's radar scale hourly storm profile, which were used as input into the GIS rainfall-runoff model. Discharges at 10 sub-catchments' outlets were compared, assuming the same parameters, topographic, soil and initial conditions. Of the 3 days of different rainfall patterns over the 10 sub-catchments examined, 17 % have NSE values between 0. 84 and 0. 90, the rest having values being greater than 0. 9, indicating a perfect match of simulated radar rainfall modelled runoff to the observed radar rainfall data. With these results, the over 100 years of observed <b>point</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> and limited AWS data can, therefore, be confidently used to generate corresponding hourly rainfields for meaningful hydrological modelling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are {{the best}} tools from which future climate {{scenarios}} can be constructed. GCMs simulate important large-scale features of the Earth’s climate system. However, it is changes in local-scale climate that will most affect rainfall. A popular approach for producing rainfall scenarios at scales relevant for hydrological impact studies is to calculate the average percentage change in GCM grid square rainfall from current to future conditions, with separate calculations for each month, and then to scale observed records of <b>point</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> by these percentage changes. This is termed the perturbation method. The main advantage of this method {{is that it is}} simple and easy to apply. However, the use of monthly GCM outputs ignores possible changes in daily extremes or the frequency of wet days, which are of great interest in hydrological impact studies. A refinement of the perturbation method is presented, which uses a daily pattern of change rather than the average percentage change. These patterns of change are then used to scale ranked historical <b>point</b> daily <b>rainfall.</b> This method is sensitive to the changes in extreme daily rainfalls and changes in the frequency of wet days simulated by the GCM, producing a more realistic sequence of changed daily rainfall, compared to the commonly used approach of simply scaling all the historical rainfall values in each month by the same amount...|$|R

40|$|Model {{studies suggest}} that {{semiarid}} ecosystems with patterned vegetation can respond in a nonlinear way to climate change. This means that gradual changes {{can result in a}} rapid transition to a desertified state. Previous model studies focused on the response of patterned semiarid ecosystems to changes in mean annual rainfall. The intensity of rain events, however, is projected to change as well in the coming decades. In this paper, we study the effect of changes in rainfall intensity on the functioning of patterned semiarid ecosystems with a spatially explicit model that captures rainwater partitioning and runoff-runon processes with simple event-based process descriptions. Analytical and numerical analyses of the model revealed that rainfall intensity is a key parameter in explaining patterning of vegetation in semiarid ecosystems as low mean rainfall intensities do not allow for vegetation patterning to occur. Surprisingly, we found that, for a constant annual rainfall rate, both an increase and a decrease in mean rainfall intensity can trigger desertification. An increase negatively affects productivity as a greater fraction of the rainwater is lost as runoff. This can result in a shift to a bare desert state only if the mean rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of bare soil. On the other hand, a decrease in mean rainfall intensity leads to an increased fraction of rainwater infiltrating in bare soils, remaining unavailable to plants. Our findings suggest that considering rainfall intensity as a variable may help in assessing the proximity to regime shifts in patterned semiarid ecosystems and that monitoring losses of resource through runoff and bare soil infiltration could be used to determine ecosystem resilience.

The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the statistical characteristics of <b>point</b> <b>rainfall</b> and to identify a probability distribution that can model the full spectrum of daily rainfall in the Onkaparinga catchment in South Australia. Daily rainfall data from 1960 to 2010 at thirteen rainfall stations were considered. Statistical moments and autocorrelation coefficients were estimated for rainfall depths at different temporal resolutions. The heterogeneity of monthly rainfall was tested using the Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI). Interannual variability of annual and seasonal PCI was observed. The catchment was characterized by unstable monthly rainfall with PCIs of more than 10 for all rainfall stations. Relatively strong and significant autocorrelation coefficients were observed for rainfall depths at finer (daily and monthly) temporal resolutions. The performance of different distribution models was examined considering their ability to regenerate various statistics such as standard deviation, skewness, frequency distribution, percentiles and extreme values. Model efficiency statistics of modelled percentiles of daily rainfall were found to be useful for optimum threshold selection in the hybrid distributions. A hybrid of the gamma and generalized pareto (GP) distributions was found to be more efficient than any single distribution (Weibull, gamma and exponential) for modelling the full range of daily rainfall across the catchment. In addition to this, a hybrid of the Weibull and GP distributions was also proposed.
