50|$|To {{create his}} {{finished}} work projects, Struzan starts by sketching out drawings on gessoed illustration board, then tinting the draftsmanship with airbrushed acrylic <b>paint,</b> <b>finishing</b> up the highlights and other details with colored pencils and more airbrush if needed. The gessoed foundation allows Struzan {{the luxury of}} being able to accommodate any requested changes to the work. Preferring to work on a 1 to 1 scale, Struzan's one-sheet work would be approximately 27 x 40 inches, the size of a printed movie poster. Working from reference photographs and live models, Struzan has been known, at times, to include depictions of himself, family members and friends in his work. He is known for working very quickly; typically takes him a week to two weeks to finish a painting. With the theatrical release of the Star Wars special editions, Struzan created the three panel triptych within the limited four-week deadline. The poster artwork for John Carpenter's 1982 remake of The Thing was created overnight, having received that assignment less than a day before the finished poster was needed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith the {{expansion}} of human activities, {{there are more and}} more living areasadjacent to industrial and/or agricultural activities such as chemical processes, petroleumprocesses, <b>paint</b> <b>finishing,</b> food processing, livestock farming, composting plants etc. Badodor is part of several nuisances caused by industrial and/or agricultural activities. Hydrogensulfide (H 2 S) is a typical odorous molecule which causes foul odor at very low concentration. This molecule is formed in different industrial installations, in particular in coal combustion,and petrochemical refinery. The separation and/or transformation of H 2 S from gas phase toodorless products are important processes for sustainable development. In this paper, we communicate the preparation of new sorbents for the sorption of H 2 Sfrom a synthetic gas effluent. These sorbents consist in an inorganic phase (hydroxyapatite) ashost particles, and well-dispersed particles of a metal oxide as guest particles which are theactive phase for the removal of H 2 S. At room conditions, iron, lead and zinc doped calciumphosphates were found to be effective for the removal of H 2 S. The performance of thesorbents depends on preparation method and the nature of active phases. This opens newprospects for the treatment of H 2 S from gas phase...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{is intended to}} define Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) test panel configurations that can be employed {{for the purposes of}} evaluating the protection capabilities of Lightning Strike Protection (LSP) materials developed by the Aerospace Industry. The configurations are intended to provide consistent behavior in their response to simulated lightning strikes at pre-defined levels when tested by a capable vendor according to a test procedure written to enable consistent results (ref section 2. 1. 2). In response to an attachment of a simulated lightning strike on a CFRP panel, one can expect to see various levels of ablation and delamination, both through the thickness of the panel and with respect to the amount of panel surface area that exhibits damage. Panel configurations defined in this document include: An "unprotected" configuration 128694 - 1 (ref section 4. 1), consisting of a cured CFRP laminate stackup of tape and fabric prepregs, coated with a typical aerospace primer and <b>paint</b> <b>finishing</b> scheme, attached to aluminum grounding bars intended to draw electrical current from the lightning attachment point to the panel edges and thus to ground. A "protected" configuration 128694 - 2 (ref section 4. 1), wherein a layer of an LSP material form often used in the Aerospace Industry is included in the laminate stackup prior to cure. The CFRP materials, finishes and grounding arrangement for ths configuration are the same as for the "unprotected" configuration...|$|E
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{composite}} manufacturing process that would be able to deliver Class A surface finished products in the context of mould manufacturing methods. The problem required solving was to overcome the time needed to prepare Class A surfaces, by developing a composite manufacturing process that will deliver Class A surface finished products straight from the mould. The process was aimed at the entire development process, from mould and plug design up to the finished product. A literature study and a factory mould survey were conducted with a view to obtain the necessary insights into surface finishing and composite manufacturing. These surveys were followed by seven constructional tests which determined the most appropriate solutions for the proposed manufacturing processes. Test 1 was used to determine a quality finish standard for composites from the sanding grits used to finished composite surfaces versus surface roughness values used in other industries. The standard determined that a P 800 finish has a roughness between 0. 200 and 0. 150 um and constitutes a Class A 3 finish. P 1000 to P 1200 have a roughness between 0. 150 um to 0. 100 um and constitutes a Class A 2 finish. Finally a P 2000 and higher have a roughness of 0. 100 um and lower and constitutes Class A 1 surface finish. After the standard was set, the tests for finishing of the moulds, plugs and parts commenced. Test 2 was conducted on the CNC manufacturing of plugs out of Nuceron 651 tooling board. Tool path parameters were varied in a matrix. The samples with the best surface finish value were cut with a step-over of 0. 5 and feed of 800 mm/min. These parameters were found to be the most influential. Test 2 and 4 revealed that the plug surface finishing should commence with conventional 2 K <b>paint</b> <b>finishing,</b> with a possibility of acrylic split surface. This process produced projected mould surfaces between 0. 150 um and 0. 200 um, which can be categorised as Class A- 3. Test 5 and 6 determined methods for improving the mould surface quality and durability. It was established that the tooling gelcoat should be applied whilst being heated and backed with at least two layers of glass veil and a steady increase of GSM of structural glass fibres to prevent print-through. Test 3 determined that the mould corners could be strengthened with rovings pressed into the corner. It was also established that the moulds surfaces will require finishing after demoulding. The final moulds were manufactured from a fibreglass composite structure with tooling gelcoat surface. A number of guidelines and a set process were developed in order to produce moulds with a surface finish of average 0. 9 um, equivalent to Class A 1. Release agents were tested in Test 7, and the Loctite Frekote 770 -NC release system was deemed appropriate for use with In Mould Coating (IMC) of 2 K Paint. These elements were all synthesised into plug, mould and part manufacturing processes. The proposed processes were validated by the manufacturing of a JS instrument panel, which delivered a Class A 2, 0. 175 um, finish with IMC of 2 K paint. With only a minor sanding of P 3000 grit and polishing, the part was made into a Class A 1 surface, measured at 0. 63 um. The study proved that it is possible to produce Class A finished part with IMC. This method can provide a solution aimed at the elimination of P 600 and lower finishing of composite parts manufactured with IMC. Master...|$|E
