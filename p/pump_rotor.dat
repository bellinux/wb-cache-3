50|$|An inducer is the axial inlet {{portion of}} a {{centrifugal}} <b>pump</b> <b>rotor,</b> the function {{of which is to}} raise the inlet head by an amount sufficient to prevent significant cavitation in the following pump stage. It is used in applications in which the inlet pressure of a pump is close to the vapor pressure of the pumped liquid. Inducers are frequently included in design of turbopumps for liquid propellant rocket engines, although they are used in other applications which require high suction performance.|$|E
50|$|Magnetically coupled pumps, or {{magnetic}} drive pumps, vary {{from the traditional}} pumping style, as the motor is coupled to the pump by magnetic means rather than by a direct mechanical shaft. The pump works via a drive magnet, 'driving' the <b>pump</b> <b>rotor,</b> which is magnetically coupled to the primary shaft driven by the motor.7 They are often used where leakage of the fluid pumped poses a great risk (e.g., aggressive fluid in the chemical or nuclear industry, or electric shock - garden fountains). They have no direct connection between the motor shaft and the impeller, so no gland is needed. There is no risk of leakage, unless the casing is broken. Since the pump shaft is not supported by bearings outside the pump's housing, support inside the pump is provided by bushings. The pump size of a {{magnetic drive}} pumps can go from few Watts power to a giant 1MW.|$|E
50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating <b>pump</b> <b>rotor,</b> {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|E

5000|$|Just before liftoff, the LOX {{turbopump}} in the #8 engine exploded (the pump {{was recovered}} from the debris and found to have signs of fire and melting), the shock wave severing surrounding propellant lines and starting a fire from leaking fuel. The fire damaged various components in the thrust section leading to the engines gradually being shut down between T+10 and T+12 seconds. The KORD had shut off engines #7, #19, #20, and #21 after detecting abnormal pressure and pump speeds. Telemetry did not provide any explanation as to what shut off the other engines. Engine #18, which had caused the booster to lean over 45 degrees, continued operating until impact, something engineers {{were never able to}} satisfactorily explain. It could not be determined exactly why the #8 turbopump had exploded. Working theories were that either a piece of a pressure sensor had broken off and lodged in the pump, or that its impeller blades had rubbed against the metal casing, creating a friction spark that ignited the LOX. The #8 engine had operated erratically prior to shutdown and that a pressure sensor detected [...] "incredible force" [...] in the pump. Vasily Mishin believed that a <b>pump</b> <b>rotor</b> had disintegrated, but Alexander Kuznetsov argued that the NK-15 engines were entirely blameless and Mishin, who had defended the use of Kuznetsov's engines two years earlier, could not publicly come out and challenge him. Kuznetsov succeeded in getting the postflight investigative committee to rule the cause of the engine failure as [...] "ingestion of foreign debris". Vladimir Barmin, chief director of launch facilities at Baikonur, also argued that the KORD should be locked for the first 15-20 seconds of flight to prevent a shutdown command from being issued until the booster had cleared the pad area. The destroyed complex was photographed by American satellites, disclosing that the Soviet Union was building a Moon rocket. After this flight, fuel filters were installed in later models. It also took 18 months to rebuild the launch pad and delayed launches.

The <b>pump's</b> <b>rotor</b> was supported in magnetic bearings. In addition to supporting and controlling the rotor motion, the magnetic bearings also served as active load cells and were used to measure the impeller forces acting on the <b>pump's</b> <b>rotor.</b> The lateral impeller force characteristics, as a function of a normalized flow coefficient, were virtually identical in the four- and five-vane impellers in each respective volute type.

Single volute configurations compared well with the predictions of a published correlation at high flow rates, ϕ/ϕn> 0. 5.

Conference program and proceedings available from [URL] investigation into the vibration characteristics of a ‘Roots and Claws’ based dry vacuum pump under different operating conditions was conducted. An AutoRegressive (AR) -based condition monitoring algorithm was developed and tested on both a fault-free and a pump with an implanted ceramic bearing with an inner race defect at the High Vacuum (HV) end. The investigation provided some in-depth understanding {{of the effects of}} different operating conditions such as speed and load on the vibration of the pump. The first key step in the fault detection scheme was accurate determination of the running speed of the pump. It was observed that the rotating speed of the <b>pump’s</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft on which the bearing case was directly connected to was often less than the set speed of the <b>pump</b> due to <b>rotor</b> slip. The second step was envelope demodulation of the time domain vibration signals where the resonance excited by the fault-induced impacts was identified and the vibration signal were bandpass filtered around the resonant peak. The third step is spectral estimation using parametric-based method of AR modelling. The advantage of the AR method is that it can work with smaller sample sizes and sampling rates compared to the more traditional approach of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and achieve far superior resolution capabilities. The analysis results showed that the effect of actual speed was predominant in the detection of bearing faults as this was the speed that was used in the calculations of the bearing defect frequencies and had to be determined very accurately.
