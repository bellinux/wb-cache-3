40|$|International trade {{plays an}} {{increasingly}} important role in global economics. One growing part of the international economy has been express delivery services. Because various governments that maintain public sector <b>postal</b> <b>monopolies</b> have erected barriers to entry to impede its growth, express delivery has become an important battleground {{within the realm of}} trade. International trade, which initially consisted mainly of the trade of goods, is now increasingly focusing on services. This article focuses on the problem of a particular type of service and the barriers on this service (express delivery) that countries place upon it. Not surprisingly, those countries that are the most competitive and have the fewest barriers to trade and problems of monopolization (i. e., those countries that suffer least from monopolistic behavior in their express delivery market) have the most effective and competitive distribution systems...|$|R

50|$|Attempts {{to enforce}} a royal <b>postal</b> <b>monopoly</b> against the city of Lviv's {{existing}} messenger services led to legal disputes that impeded the implementation of Bandinelli's postmastership. In 1633 his monopoly was reconfirmed by Władysław IV Vasa. Stanisław Lubomirski, voivode of Ruthenia, and Stanisław Koniecpolski, voivode of Sandomierz, issued further patents in support of Bandinelli's postal services. These became viable only after 1639, when Bandinelli became the main rival to the postal services that had been run by the Montelupi family since Sebastiano Montelupi had been appointed master of the royal post at Kraków in 1568. Bandinelli married twice, while in Lwów. His first wife Constance (Constanza) Ubaldini, helped him obtain royal privileges through her father. He built the palace with her dowry, but soon divorced her and remarried Anne Sehnio (Анна Сеґніо). In 1650 he went to Vienna to negotiate a new postal contract with the city, and died there shortly afterwards. He bequeathed his wealth to his four sons, Lauro, Michelangelo, Carlo and Stanislas, {{with the exception of}} the kamienica in Lviv, which went to his wife Anna, to be shared with his two daughters, Costanza and Caterina, for as long as they remained unmarried.|$|E
5000|$|Critics of the {{universal}} service requirement and the statutory <b>postal</b> <b>monopoly</b> include several professional economists advocating for the privatization of the mail delivery system, {{or at least a}} relaxation of {{the universal}} service model that currently exists. Rick Geddes argued in 2000: * First, basic economics implies that rural customers are unlikely to be without service under competition; they would simply have to pay the true cost of delivery to them, {{which may or may not}} be lower than under monopoly.* Second, basic notions of fairness imply that the cross-subsidy should be eliminated. To the extent that people make choices about where they live, they should assume the costs of that decision.* Third, there is no reason why the government monopoly is necessary to ensure service to sparsely populated areas. The government could easily award competitive contracts to private firms for that service.* Fourth, early concerns that rural residents of the United States would somehow become isolated without federally subsidized mail delivery today are simply unfounded. ... Once both sender and receiver have access to a computer, the marginal cost of sending an electronic message is close to zero.|$|E
40|$|Post offices, {{inherited}} from the Industrial Revolution, were monolithic telephone and postal administrations. They were intimately linked to the fabric of nations and {{made significant contributions to}} state finances. From the 1960 s onwards, integrators, such as UPS and FEDEX, started offering end-to-end express services, thus challenging the <b>postal</b> <b>monopoly</b> in new high added value services. Gradually, the liberalization paradigm gained ground. Telecommunications and sometimes financial services were spun off from postal operations. More recently, new policies and priorities started to emerge especially on the development agenda where financial inclusion has become a top priority in the developing world. The question to be addressed is which role, if any, the posts play or could play in ensuring inclusion. Despite an exceptionally scarce research in the field, this paper provides an overview of how these shifts in paradigm have affected postal policy, the postal financial services regulatory framework, the status of the organizations delivering those services and the offerings themselves in developing as well as in developed countries. After a research review, including the regulatory dimension, the paper focuses on how postal financial services institutions in their legal framework have developed bringing to the fore a panorama of a dozen of promising transformations of financial postal services in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|First class {{postage rates}} have been raised once again {{in an effort to}} curb the Postal Service’s {{financial}} problems. This scenario, which has taken place regularly every two or three years, has resulted in first class rates rising faster than inflation. In most industries, an “easy ” solution of this kind is not possible because businesses must compete tosurvive. But then, as Miller (1985) emphasizes, the Postal Service is facilitated by a monopoly on first class mail. Where did the monopoly come from in the first place? Should the Postal Service be allowed to keep avoiding the realities of the marketplace? My view of the beginning of the <b>postal</b> <b>monopoly</b> is pragmatic, as is Miller’s, but I also view the growth of this public monopoly as cyclical rather than constant. Miller says that the Constitution gives onlyCongress the right to conduct postal business. Furthermore, he says the Postal Service took on itself the responsibility for defining a “letter ” and thereby cinched its own monopoly. I believe the Post Office felt the need to do so historically because {{there has always been a}} sizable contingent which did not respect the monopoly pro-vision, especially if service was poor and rates high. Periodic chal-lenges have taken place, often under the benign neglect of the gov-ernment ifnot its official sanction. The historical record suggests tha...|$|E

(Henry IV Part I, 3. 1. 53) Bill number 22, {{introduced}} by Congressman John McHugh in the first session of the 105 th Congress of the United States, proposes the most fundamental changes to American postal laws since 1970, when Congress abolished the Post Office Department and established the United States Postal Service. 2 Since Mr. McHugh chairs the only congressional committee devoted to postal policy 3 and the United States carries about 40 percent of the world’s mail, HR 22 — called the “Postal Reform Act of 1997 ” — has attracted a degree of attention in postal policy circles.

40|$|The Information Revolution is placing severe strains on the {{traditional}} national post office. As the pace of commerce has quickened, private express services have arisen to provide more rapid and reliable delivery services than available from the post office. Telecommunications coupled with improved printing technologies allow large mailers to bypass the first stages of postal distribution. Email has become an increasingly viable substitute {{for all types of}} letters and invoices. Corporate websites routinely handle transactions that once required several postal exchanges. In the postal world, however, change is welcomed by few. The <b>postal</b> <b>monopoly</b> and government status have substantially insulated the post office from the larger world of commerce. Isolation has impeded the incremental changes that allow orderly transformation in most industries. Politically important groups oppose radical change. Armies of postal managers and employees fear (probably correctly) that postal modernization will mean fewer jobs and lower wages for them (although not necessarily for the sector as a whole). Citizens in rural districts believe (probably incorrectly) that adapting the post office to changing times will lead to relatively higher prices or poorer service in the countryside. Nonetheless, in the last decade a cautious European Union has pressed a reluctant postal sector to introduce significant reform. The Postal Directive of 1997, adopted after 10 years of study and debate, placed a ceiling on the scope of postal monopolies and required tighter and more objective regulation of "universal service providers", i. e., national post offices. In 2002, the maximum scope of services that could be reserved for the national post office was lowered again, and regulatory requirements were strengthened in 228 COMMUNICATIONS & STRATEGIES no. 56 small but significant respects.

40|$|European {{postal market}} has been {{challenged}} by changes in services that have questioned traditional postal service monopolies. The postal monopolies had evident lack of competitiveness, were not customer oriented, services were poor and unreliable. Postal services were traditionally state monopolies which had no tradition of flexibility and independence toward changing demand and growing competition in the postal market. Couple with this, technology advances, shifts in customer preferences and diminution in physical delivery demand, active competition from logistic companies and increasing internationalization brought the European Commission to modernize through a full liberalization of the postal services in each member state of the Union. Liberalization pursues to give free entrance to companies and bring competition, improvement in services, profitability and success. Some Member states are still unwilling to open their markets to competition due to anti-market ideologies, corporatist interests and protectionist reflex. On the contrary to the more conservative countries, Sweden was a pioneer in this regard. Swedish has preceded the EU postal liberalization starting in 1993, before any other member State. Sweden abolished the <b>postal</b> <b>monopoly</b> before first EU directive was released and even before it {{became part of the}} European Union (1995). This dissertation examines the liberalization process of the Swedish postal sector and its consequent transformation. The particularity of Posten AB is to be totally owned by the State but having transformed its organization to answer public policies and business objectives. A study of Posten AB’s internal restructuring, business models, key resources and service networking restructuring created an independent public corporation. It also explains a remarkable step toward being an innovative actor in the business of distribution by integrating into its business models electronic messages with physical mail distribution giving more value to the service. The dissertation proceeds to an analysis of competition and competitors faced by each Posten AB’s business division in a fully liberalized postal market. The information obtained is based on secondary research based on reports, articles, European Commission reports, Acts, books, Postal companies’ annual reports and newspapers rated with real customer’s information available in electronic sources. I reviewed and compare the process of partial and full liberalization of the postal sector in different EU member states in different time. This dissertation focused on Swedish liberalization process of the sector precisely because it was achieved before Sweden became part of the European Union. Posten is allowed, beside its public services duties to develop public services duties to develop independent business strategy based on an analysis of market demands. Posten has converted the traditional postal operator into an organization oriented to create and fasten business opportunities and increase competition. Posten brought investments, innovations, state-of-the-art technology and services and products improvements which resulted in sales increases and higher profitability. Posten’s successful experience demonstrates to other European postal services (and around the world) that overcoming actual challenges in postal market, demand to embrace actively the liberalization of services, by organizing its place in the competition and by restructuring toward technology and the accordingly renewed customers demands. The Swedish postal operators demonstrate that the issue is beyond being a survivor of market forces but materialize in the proactive self-organization of its own profitability and success...|$|E
