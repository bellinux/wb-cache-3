50|$|The European Conference of Ministers of Transport {{established}} in 1953 a {{classification of waterways}} that was later expanded {{to take into account}} the development of <b>push-towing.</b> Europe is a continent with a great variety of waterway characteristics, which makes this classification valuable to appreciate the different classes of waterway. There is also a remarkable variety of waterway characteristics in many countries of Asia, but there has not been any equivalent international drive for uniformity. This classification is provided by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport. A low resolution version of that map is shown here.|$|E
40|$|New Profile for the Amsterdam-Rhinecanal The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a new profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The new profile needs to be well navigable and {{requires}} to have stable bank constructions. Simultaneously several social aspects {{have to be taken}} into consideration. The assignment is summarized as follows: Design a new profile of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal with a stable bank protection that takes future developments, durability and recreation into consideration. The history of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal shows that the draft of the vessels that use this canal has increased from 3. 30 to 4. 00 meters. This four-metre draft has been permitted since 1988 and was based on the dimensions of the push tow units. In the late 90 s of the past century, a new generation of inland vessels made its appearance. Around 2002 problems to the bank constructions due to erosion were detected for the first time, possibly caused by the new generation inland vessels. The number of bigger inland vessels, particularly those in the VIa category has strongly increased over the past years together with the engine power and cargo capacity of many vessels (increase in scale). A representative canal section of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal, just north of Breukelen, has been chosen as research site. At this location erosion ranges from 0. 20 to 1. 70 meters within 15 meters distance of the sheet piles. The possible cause of this erosion has been further investigated in this report. Also research has been done to determine the governing hydraulic load, which is generated by governing vessels overtaking another vessel. The governing situation is defined as follows: a Rijnmaxship (135 x 17 x 4. 00 m) overtaking a four barge <b>push-towing</b> vessel (198 x 22. 8 x 4. 00 m). In this situation, the return current is governing compared to a situation when loads from the main and bow thrusters are considered. The return current has been calculated with the 1 D model DIPRO. DIPRO has also been used to validate the 2 D model in Delft 3 D, to further elaborate the return current in the 2 D model. The 2 D model in Delft 3 D has been used to determine the maximum return currents around the two governing vessels. These values have been translated {{to the bottom of the}} canal by calculating the erosion. From these results can be concluded that canal profile (2) has twice the amount of erosion compared to canal profile (3). In this report canal profile (3) is recommended as the new normative canal profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. Canal profile (3) is a combination of a box profile with a sloped upper bank and bottom, with in the middle a waterdepth of 7. 60 meter. The depth in front of the sheet pile is 6. 00 meter. The wet cross section is 751 m 2. The bank construction consists of a sheet pile with a slope. The outcome of this thesis is a design for a new representative canal profile in the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The normative hydraulic load (return current) causes minimum erosion to the canal bottom, which keeps the bank construction stable. Next to this the design proves that environmental and recreational purposes can be well combined in coherence with social developments.

50|$|The Seine is dredged and ocean-going vessels can dock at Rouen, 120 km {{from the}} sea. Commercial craft (barges and <b>push-tows)</b> {{can use the}} river from Marcilly-sur-Seine, 516 km to its mouth.|$|R

The CO2 emissions of a barge carrying 1500 tonnes are three times less {{than those of the}} fleet of trucks required to move this load. A single <b>push-tow</b> 185 m long can carry 300 containers unloaded in a maritime port, compared to 5 fully loaded trains and 200 trucks.|$|R
50|$|The Canal Dunkerque-Escaut is a 189 km {{long series}} of {{historic}} canals, and the canalised river Escaut (Scheldt) that were substantially rebuilt from the mid-1950s up to ca. 1980, with some new sections, from Dunkerque to the Belgian border at Mortagne-du-Nord. Existing canals (listed below) were straightened and widened; and new locks (écluses) were built, also on the river Escaut, from the junction at Bouchain to the border.The route {{is also known as}} the Liaison à grand gabarit (large dimensions, or high capacity, literally large gauge) Dunkerque-Escaut. Some authors have separated the waterway into the canal proper and the canalised river Escaut, but current practice is to use the simple name throughout. The Liaison was designed for large commercial vessels up to 85m long by 11.50m wide (and 143m long <b>push-tows).</b> The entire route is being further upgraded to offer European Class Vb dimensions, for <b>push-tows</b> 185m by 11.50m, and motor barges up to 125m long, as part of the current EU-funded Seine-Escaut-Rhine waterway corridor investments, including the new Seine-Nord Europe Canal.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} other small streams in the {{lowlands}} of France, Belgium and the Netherlands, the destiny of the relatively short river Deûle {{was to become a}} heavily engineered waterway, to serve the transport needs of industry. However, this construction of a wide and deep channel also serves other functions the value of which is recognized by the EU's Water Framework Directive. 'Heavily modified water bodies' like the successive reaches of the Deûle form an environment that is worth preserving for overall environmental benefits that are very different from the hypothetical situation where the stream were to be left in its natural state. Navigation is more than ever the principal function, and upgrading of the waterway downstream of Lille is currently proceeding, to provide European Class Vb dimensions, for <b>push-tows</b> of up to 180m long and 12m in beam.|$|R
