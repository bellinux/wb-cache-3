5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's <b>power</b> <b>base</b> was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{this study}} {{provides}} a conceptual foundation for the effective use of <b>power</b> <b>bases.</b> It has also enhanced understanding about the antecedent of <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> which subsequently resulted in a better knowledge of the employees’ job stress factors fundamental to employees’ work-related attitudes and behaviors. This study also extends extant research on the <b>power</b> <b>bases,</b> mentoring and employees’ job stress and hopefully stimulates {{the need for more}} research incorporating the perspectives of both parties.|$|R
40|$|Although Guanxi, {{political}} climate, {{and power}} are common business {{practices in the}} workplace, the popularity in research {{has yet to be}} intensified. This study aims to explore the effects of Guanxi, political climate, and <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> and the moderating effects of political climate. Questionnaires were issued to workers across service and manufacturing industries and 1099 valid responses were collected. The results from hierarchical regression analyses indicated significant relationships between Guanxi and <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> in various patterns. Significant relationships also emerged between political climate and <b>power</b> <b>bases.</b> Partial mediating effects of political climate were found between the relationships of Guanxi and <b>power</b> <b>bases.</b> Recommendations, suggestions, and conclusions were also presented {{on the basis of the}} empirical findings...|$|R

5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important <b>power</b> <b>base</b> for Eleanor in England.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many sources}} have {{identified}} him as {{a native of the}} rural town of Bisacquino, where he was raised, he was actually born in the city of Palermo. His parents, Accursio Cascioferro and Santa Ippolito, were poor and illiterate. The family moved to Bisacquino when his father became a campiere (an armed guard) with the local landlord, Baron Antonino Inglese, a notorious usurper of state-owned land. The position of campiere often involved Mafiosi. According to other sources, at an early age, the family moved to Sambuca Zabut, where he lived for approximately 24 years before relocating to Bisacquino, his recognized <b>power</b> <b>base</b> in the Mafia.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was {{becoming}} less fashionable as a residence. Goodrich was too distant from London to {{be a useful}} <b>power</b> <b>base,</b> and was gradually abandoned in favour of more stylish residences, Goodrich continued {{to be used as}} a judicial centre however; the antiquarian John Leland noted that some of the castle was used to hold prisoners for the local court during the 1530s, and the castle ditch was sometimes used to store confiscated cattle taken from local farmers.|$|E
5|$|Civil war flared {{again when}} the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the first had {{almost as soon as}} its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a <b>power</b> <b>base</b> and then {{launched}} a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on to crush the army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} {{has a number}} of theoretical and practical implications both for scholars and practitioners, especially in the domain of Organizational Behavior. From a theoretical viewpoint, results of this study revealed the important link between <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> and the importance of having a good relationship between leaders and subordinates, and enhanced further the understanding of the employees’ job stress. Hence, this finding highlights the importance of <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> possessed by leaders as well as recognition of mentoring as a valuable approach for job stress. This study perhaps is the first that has systematically attempted to integrate <b>power</b> <b>bases,</b> mentoring and job stress in organizations.|$|R

5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that {{the scope of this}} economic <b>power</b> <b>base</b> may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were {{at the center of a}} broad regional trade network centered on these resources.|$|E

5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox <b>power</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

30|$|In {{response}} to these potential problems, many forward-thinking organizations are striving to create a positive organizational climate {{in order to keep}} those good employees through various human resource management initiatives (Chew and Chan 2008). While a great deal of past researches was done to investigate the link between <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> and job stress, relatively few researches have been conducted to examine these two components with the presence of mentoring effect. It is important for the company to know what aspects play important roles or have big effect in reducing the job stress of the employees. Moreover, there is a noticeable lack of empirical examination of large Malaysian organizations with regards to the leaders’ <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> on job stress. Hence {{the purpose of this study}} is two folds. First, to investigate the direct relationship between <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> of supervisors on employees’ job stress, and secondly to examine if mentoring will moderate the relationship between <b>power</b> <b>bases</b> and job stress.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} <b>Power</b> <b>Base</b> Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to diversify his <b>power</b> <b>base</b> away from the military, Suharto begin courting support from Islamic elements. He {{undertook}} a much-publicised hajj pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protégé BJ Habibie, the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 riot in Medan.|$|E

However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's <b>power</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

In addition, a great deal of time was spent restructuring party organizations and functions.

In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.|$|E
