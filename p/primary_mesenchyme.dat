Here we show that chronic reduction in the combined epithelial Indian (Ihh) and Sonic (Shh) hedgehog signal leads to mislocalization of intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts, loss of smooth muscle in villus cores and muscularis mucosa as well as crypt hyperplasia. In contrast, chronic over-expression of Ihh in the intestinal epithelium leads to progressive expansion of villus smooth muscle, but does not result in reduced epithelial proliferation. Together, these mouse models show that smooth muscle populations in the adult intestinal lamina propria are highly sensitive {{to the level of}} Hh ligand. We demonstrate further that Hh ligand drives smooth muscle differentiation in <b>primary</b> intestinal <b>mesenchyme</b> cultures and that cell-autonomous Hh signal transduction in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells activates the smooth muscle master regulator Myocardin (Myocd) and induces smooth muscle differentiation. The rapid kinetics of Myocd activation by Hh ligands as well as the presence of an unusual concentration of Gli sties in this gene suggest that regulation of Myocd by Hh might be direct. Thus, these data indicate that Hh is a critical regulator of adult intestinal smooth muscle homeostasis and suggest an important link between Hh signaling and Myocd activation. Moreover, the data support the idea that lowered Hh signals promote crypt expansion and increased epithelial cell proliferation, but indicate that chronically increased Hh ligand levels do not dampen crypt proliferation as previously proposed...|$|R
40|$|Vessel {{formation}} in the lung {{has been described as}} occurring by two mechanisms: proximal, or branch, pulmonary arteries develop via angiogenesis; and distal, smaller vessels form by vasculogenesis. Connections between the proximal and distal vessels establish the final vascular network. The preponderance of vessel formation has been suspected to occur during the canalicular stage of lung development. To test these hypotheses, reporter gene expression under control of the regulatory domain of fetal liver kinase- 1 (flk), an early endothelial cell–specific marker, was used to evaluate mouse lungs from embryonic day 10. 5 (E 10. 5) through 2 wk postnatal age. Morphologic assessment was performed after histochemical staining, and quantification of vessel development by a chemiluminescent assay was compared with overall embryonic lung growth. LacZ expression under flk promoter control allowed: (1) early identification of differentiating endothelial cells of the branch pulmonary arteries; (2) visualization of distal vessels forming in the lung <b>mesenchyme</b> (<b>primary</b> capillary network) with subsequent remodeling; (3) recognition of early continuity between proximal and distal vessels, occurring by E 10. 5; and (4...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMesoderm and mesodermal {{structures}} in the sea urchin embryo are entirely generated by two embryologically distinct populations of <b>mesenchyme</b> cells: the <b>primary</b> (PMC) and the secondary (SMC) mesenchyme cells. We have identified the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as {{a key component of}} the regulatory machinery that controls the formation of both these cell types. ERK is activated in a spatial-temporal manner, which coincides with the epithelial–mesenchyme transition (EMT) of the prospective PMCs and SMCs. Here, we show that ERK controls EMT of both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>mesenchyme</b> cells. Loss and gain of function experiments demonstrate that ERK signaling is not required for the early specification of either PMCs or SMCs, but controls the maintenance and/or the enhancement of expression levels of regulatory genes which participate in the process of specification of these cell types. In addition, ERK-mediated signaling is essential for the transcription of terminal differentiation genes encoding proteins that define the final structures generated by PMCs and SMCs. Our findings suggest that ERK has a central pan-mesodermal role in coupling EMT and terminal differentiation of all mesenchymal cell types in the sea urchin embryo...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{work on the}} {{sea urchin}} endomesoderm gene {{regulatory}} network (GRN) offers many opportunities to study the specification and differentiation of each cell type during early development at a mechanistic level. The mesoderm lineages consist of two cell populations, <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>mesenchyme</b> cells (PMCs and SMCs). The micromere-PMC GRN governs {{the development of the}} larval skeleton, which is the exclusive fate of PMCs, and SMCs diverge into four lineages, each with its own GRN state. Here we identify a sea urchin ortholog of the Twist transcription factor, and show that it plays an essential role in the PMC GRN and later is involved in SMC formation. Perturbations of Twist either by morpholino knockdown or by overexpression result in defects in progressive phases of PMC development, including specification, ingression/EMT, differentiation and skeletogenesis. Evidence is presented that Twist expression is required for the maintenance of the PMC specification state, and a reciprocal regulation between Alx 1 and Twist offers stability for the subsequent processes, such as PMC differentiation and skeletogenesis. These data illustrate the significance of regulatory state maintenance and continuous progression during cell specification, and the dynamics of the sequential events that depend on those earlier regulatory states...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{interactions}} play {{an important}} role in the specification of cell fates in the early sea urchin embryo. An interaction between the two principal populations of mesodermal cells, <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>mesenchyme</b> cells (PMCs and SMCs, respectively), is critical in regulating SMC fates and the formation of the larval skeleton (reviewed by Ettensohn, 1992). Although fate-mapping studies have shown that during normal embryogenesis the skeleton is synthesized exclusively by PMCs, certain SMCs also have the poten-tial to express a skeletogenic phenotype under appropriate experimental conditions (Fukushi, 1962; Langelan and Whiteley, 1985; Ettensohn and McClay, 1988). Elimination of the PMCs by microsurgical or fluorescence-based meth-ods results in the conversion of 60 - 70 secondary mes-enchyme cells to a skeletogenic fate (Ettensohn and McClay, 1988; Ettensohn, 1990 a). During this change in cell fate, SMCs express PMC-specific molecular markers and acquire the ability to respond to migratory cues in the blastocoel normally recognized only by PMCs (Ettensohn and McClay, 1986, 1988). Signals transmitted by the PMCs therefore regulate both the migratory behavior and program of gene expression of SMCs. Several important properties of the cells that switch fate in response to PMC ablation remain unelucidated. The SMCs are a diverse cell population and the normal fate of the skeletogenic SMCs has not been established. Time-lapse videorecordings of PMC() embryos show that some (but not all) SMCs that ingress late in gastrulation switch fate in such embryos (Ettensohn and McClay, 1988).

Independently,armadillo,the β-catenin homolog inDrosophila melanogaster,was identified as a segment polarity gene necessary for the transduction ofwingless (Wnt) signals during embryonic and larval development. Recently, several investigations have also shown that β-catenin plays {{a critical role in}} axial patterning of earlyXenopus,zebrafish, and mouse embryos. In these systems, the localization of β-catenin to the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus is predictive of its role in cell adhesion and signaling. In order to examine the potential role of β-catenin in regulating cell adhesion during embryogenesis, we cloned β-catenin in the sea urchinLytechinus variegatusand characterized its subcellular distribution in cells undergoing morphogenetic movements. Indicative of a role in the establishment and maintenance of cell adhesion, β-catenin is associated with lateral cell–cell contacts and accumulates at adherens junctions from cleavage stages onward. At gastrulation, changes in junctional β-catenin localization accompany several morphogenetic events. The epithelial–mesenchymal conversion that characterizes the ingression of both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>mesenchyme</b> cells coincides with a rapid and dramatic loss of adherens junction-associated β-catenin. In addition, epithelial cells in the archenteron display a significant decrease in adherens junction-associated β-catenin levels as they undergo convergent–extension movements. These data are consistent with a role for β-catenin in regulating cell adhesion and adherens junction function during gastrulation in the sea urchin embryo...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe CyIIa gene of the {{sea urchin}} embryo is a model for study of cis-regulation {{downstream}} of cell-type specification, as CyIIa transcription follows the specification and initial differentiation of the embryonic domains {{in which it is}} expressed. These are the skeletogenic and secondary mesenchyme and gut. We carried out a detailed structural and functional analysis of a cis-regulatory region of this gene, extending 780 bp upstream and 125 bp downstream of the transcription start site, that had been shown earlier to reproduce faithfully the complex and dynamic CyIIa pattern of expression. This analysis revealed that the overall pattern of expression of the CyIIa gene appears to be governed mainly by two independent sets of DNA elements, which are target sites for specific proteins present in blastula-stage nuclear extract. One type of element, which controls a dynamic program of expression in both skeletogenic and secondary mesenchyme cells, contains the consensus-binding site for a member of the ets transcription factor family. The other, which is responsible for the terminal or permanent phase of CyIIa expression in the gut, shares homologies with the late module of the endoderm-specific Endo 16 gene (endo 16 Module B). Oligonucleotides containing replicas of these two target sites fused upstream of a sea urchin basal promoter are sufficient to confer accurate mesenchyme and late gut expression of an injected GFP construct. The finding of a single protein target site that recapitulates CyIIa expression in both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>mesenchyme</b> cells suggests the existence of a pan-mesodermal gene expression program in the sea urchin embryo...|$|R

While useful in clinical practice, patients taking GCs often suffer from skeletal side effects including growth retardation in children and adolescents, and decreased bone quality in adults. On a physiological level, GCs have been implicated in the regulation of chondrogenesis and osteoblast differentiation, as well as maintaining homeostasis in cartilage and bone. We identified the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a potential regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy in a microarray screen of <b>primary</b> limb bud <b>mesenchyme</b> micromass cultures. Some targets of GC regulation in chondrogenesis are known, but the global effects of pharmacological GC doses on chondrocyte gene expression have not been comprehensively evaluated. Results This study systematically identifies a spectrum of GC target genes in embryonic growth plate chondrocytes treated with a synthetic GR agonist, dexamethasone (DEX), at 6 and 24 hrs. Conventional analysis of this data set and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. Transcripts associated with metabolism were enriched in the DEX condition along with extracellular matrix genes. In contrast, a subset of growth factors and cytokines were negatively correlated with DEX treatment. Comparing DEX-induced gene expression data to developmental changes in gene expression in micromass cultures revealed an additional layer of complexity in which DEX maintains the expression of certain chondrocyte marker genes while inhibiting factors that promote vascularization and ultimately ossification of the cartilaginous template. Conclusion Together, these results {{provide insight into the}} mechanisms and major molecular classes functioning downstream of DEX in primary chondrocytes. In addition, comparison of our data with microarray studies of DEX treatment in other cell types demonstrated that the majority of DEX effects are tissue-specific.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> {{cells of}} the sea urchin embryo {{construct}} an elaborate calcareous endoskeletal spicule beginning at gastrulation. This process begins by ingression of prospective <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells into the blastocoel, after which they migrate and then fuse to form a syncytium. Skeleton deposition occurs in spaces enclosed by the cytoplasmic cables between the cell bodies. Experiments are described which probe the role of proteases in these early events of spicule formation and {{their role in the}} continued elaboration of the spicule during later stages of embryogenesis. We find that several inhibitors of metalloproteinases inhibit the continuation of spiculogenesis, an effect first reported by Roeet al. (Exp. Cell Res. 181, 542 – 550, 1989). A detailed study of one of these inhibitors, BB- 94, shows that fusion of <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells still occurs {{in the presence of the}} inhibitor and the formation of the first calcite granule is not impeded. Continued elaboration of the spicule, however, is completely stopped; addition of the inhibitor during the active elongation of the spicule stops further elongation immediately. Removal of the inhibitor allows resumption of spicule growth. The inhibition is accompanied by almost complete cessation of massive Ca ion transport via the <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells to the spicule.

40|$|At {{gastrulation}} in the {{sea urchin}} embryo, a dramatic rearrangement of cells establishes the three germ layers of the organism.

Of particular significance, <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells, which are responsible for production of the embryonic skeleton, {{have been shown to}} obtain extensive positional information from the embryonic ectoderm. In the present study, high resolution Nomarski imaging reveals the presence of very thin filopodia (02 - 0. 4 micron in diameter) extending from <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells as well as from ectodermal and secondary mesenchyme cells. These thin filopodia sometimes extend to more than 80 microns in length and show average growth and retraction rates of nearly 10 microns/minute. The filopodia are highly dynamic, rapidly changing from extension to resorption; frequently, the resorption changes to resumption of assembly. The behavior, location and timing of active thin filopodial movements does not correlate with cell locomotion; instead, there is a strong correlation suggesting their involvement in cell-cell interactions associated with signaling and patterning at gastrulation. Nickel-treatment, which is known to create a patterning defect in skeletogenesis due to alterations in the ectoderm, alters the normal position-dependent differences in the thin filopodia. The effect is present in recombinant embryos in which the ectoderm alone was treated with nickel, and is absent in recombinant embryos in which only the <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells were treated, suggesting that the filopodial length is substratum dependent rather than being <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cell autonomous.

Around hatching there is a large increase in the ability of blastomeres to bind to laminin and this increase correlates temporally with the expression of an integrin on the basal surface all blastomeres. PMCs, after undergoing their epithelial–mesenchymal transition, have a strongly reduced affinity for laminin relative to ectoderm cells and, correspondingly, do not stain for the presence of the integrin. We identified the � integrin cDNA from Lytechinus variegatus by RT-PCR. Overlapping clones were obtained from a midgastrula cDNA library to provide a complete sequence for the integrin. The composite cDNA encoded a protein that was most similar to the � 5 subgroup of vertebrate integrins, but there was not a definitive vertebrate integrin homolog. Northern blots and Western immunoblots showed that the sea urchin integrin, which we have named �SU 2, is present in eggs and during all stages of development. Immunolocalization with specific polyclonal antibodies showed that �SU 2 first appears on the basal cell surface of epithelia at the midblastula stage, at a time correlating with th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{patterning}} of the mesoderm of the {{sea urchin}} embryo is a classical paradigm of epithelial mesenchymal interactions in organogenesis, yet little is known of its molecular basis. Here we address {{the role of the}} homeobox gene,SpMsx,a member of the highly conservedMsxgene family, in this process. Msxgenes have been shown to function in the dorsoventral patterning of the central nervous system inDrosophilaand in a variety epithelial–mesenchymal interactions in vertebrates. We showed previously that theSpMsxgene is expressed during embryogenesis in a complex and dynamic pattern consistent with roles in the development of subpopulations of endoderm, mesoderm, and oral ectoderm. To perturb this pattern of expression and thus probe the function ofSpMsx,we injectedSpMsxmRNA into single-cell zygotes and monitored development morphologically and with a series of territory-specific molecular markers. RT-PCR analysis revealed that injectedSpMsxtranscripts persisted at least until the gastrula stage in amounts comparable to endogenous levels. Injected embryos exhibited deficiencies in the organization of primary and secondary mesenchyme cells within the blastocoelic cavity, as well as abnormalities in spicule number and shape. Defects in the endoderm were also common, including reduced or absent archenterons. Micromere transplantation experiments revealed that the defects in skeletogenic mesenchyme patterning were non-cell autonomous, consistent with findings that cell–cell interactions between ectoderm and the progenitors of the skeletogenic mesenchyme, the <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells (PMCs), are important both for PMC guidance and spicule morphogenesis. Our data, taken together with observations in other organisms on the role ofMsxgenes in embryonic signaling processes, particularly involving the BMP pathway, suggest thatSpMsxmay {{be a part of the}} mechanism by which the ectoderm influences both the arrangement of <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells within the blastocoel and the shapes of the skeletal rods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{previously}} identified a 130 -kD cell surface protein that {{is involved in}} calcium uptake and skeleton formation by gastrula stage embryos of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Carson et al., 1985. Cell. 41 : 639 - 648). A monoclonal antibody designated rnAb 1223 specifically recognizes the 130 kD protein and inhibits Ca ÷ ~ uptake and growth of the CaCO 3 spicules produced by embryonic <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme</b> cells cultured in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that the epitope recognized by mAb 1223 is located on an anionic, asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chain on the 130 -kD protein.

40|$|Abstract. The micromeres {{that arise}} {{at the fourth}} cell {{division}} in developing sea urchin embryos give rise to <b>primary</b> <b>mesenchyme,</b> which in turn differentiates and produces calcareous endoskeletal spicules. These spicules have been isolated and purified from pluteus larvae by washing in combinations of ionic and nonionic detergents followed by brief exposure to sodium hypochlorite. The spicules may be demineralized and the integral matrix dissolves. The matrix is composed of {{a limited number of}} glycoproteins rich in aspx, glux, gly, ser, and ala, a composition not unlike that found in matrix proteins of biomineralized tissues of molluscs, sponges, and arthropods. There is no evidence for collagen as a component of the matrix. The matrix contains N-linked glycoproteins of the com...|$|E
