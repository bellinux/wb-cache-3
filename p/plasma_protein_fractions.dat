Standard treatment is either expansion of the circulating volume by the infusion of <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> or by using dopamine to improve cardiac function. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate by a randomised controlled trial which was the most appropriate treatment. Thirty nine infants were randomised to receive either <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> or dopamine as first line treatment if they became hypotensive within 24 hours of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Seventeen of 19 (89 %) infants responded to dopamine, whereas only 9 / 20 (45 %) responded to <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fraction.</b> The median dose of dopamine needed to increase the blood pressure to at least the 10 th centile was 7. 5 micrograms/kg/min and was infused for a median duration of 18 hours.

40|$|Paradoxical {{hypotension}} during rapid {{infusion of}} <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> (PPF) has {{been attributed to}} vasodilation by bradykinin in PPF. This study employed a canine, controlled right heart bypass preparation to assess changes in systemic vascular resistance and venous capacitance during infusion of PPF and other possibly vasoactive mediators. <b>Plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> caused consistent vasodilation, whereas purified human albumin did not. This vasodilation could be ascribed entirely to acetate, present in PPF as a buffer. Bradykinin in PPF had no effect during venous infusion. Acetate is used widely as a buffer in intravenous and dialysate solutions. Its vasoactive properties must be recognized when such solutions are administered to patients with limited capacity to compensate for sudden vasodilation...|$|R

40|$|A {{hitherto}} unreported {{phenomenon is}} the immediate {{production of the}} spectrum of ferrohemochromogens (in the presence of sodium dithionite) upon the addition in vitro of hydroxyhemin (pH 7. 6 - 7. 8) to the plasmas or sera, {{as well as to}} certain Cohn <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fractions,</b> of all mammalian species thus far examined. This distinctive reaction is characteristic of a coordination complex with heme iron, and is ascribed to a remarkable affinity for heme of certain plasma glycoglobulins, which include hemopexin. Spectrophotometry has permitted estimations of the specific heme-binding capacity (as ferrohemochromogen) of the plasmas, the rate of removal from plasma of injected heme, and the production of bile pigments therefrom.

40|$|The Westergren {{erythrocyte}} {{sedimentation rate}} (ESR) and plasma viscosity were compared in 114 patients and their correlations with total and differential <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> were analysed. There is a linear correlation between these two screening tests. Higher correlation coefficients were obtained between the plasma viscosity and fibrinogen and alpha and gamma globulins than with the ESR. Albumin affected the two tests in opposite directions. The ESR was falsely increased by a fall in haemoglobulin even within two standard deviations from the mean. Both tests gave an appreciable number of incorrect values [...] the plasma viscosity in 21 cases and the ESR in 33. The cause for these is discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT The protein {{concentration}} of 35 pleural effusions was {{compared with that}} in the serum. The ratio of the pleural and serum {{concentration of}} albumin, IgG, IgA, and IgM is always below unity and appears to have no diagnostic value. However, {{the ratio of the}} concentration of these proteins was inversely related to their molecular weight. The underlying mechanism in malignant and inflammatory effusions appear similar and is in keeping with a diffusion process. Immunofluorescent staining of the pleura suggests the intercellular passage of the proteins through the mesothelial barrier. There are very few reports of the distribution of plasma proteins in pleural effusions. The 52 cases studied by Zinneman et al (1957) showed a fair separation between transudate and exudate. All the <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> contained in pleural effusion were in a distribution similar to that in the serum. In nine cases reported by Hirsch et al (1971) it was concluded that the immunoglobuli...|$|E
40|$|Hypercholesterolemia is a {{major risk}} factor for {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD). Interestingly, the consumption of dairy products, namely milk, {{has been shown to}} lower cholesterol. The mechanism of action surrounding this observation has been attributed to the protein fraction of milk. While there have been many studies evaluating the effects of dietary protein sources on cholesterol concentrations, few studies have evaluated specific animal protein components and no human clinical studies regarding the effects of animal <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> on cholesterol metabolism have been conducted. This study examined the effect of an oral serum bovine immunoglobulin protein fraction (bIg) derived from US Department of Agriculture approved beef (aged 0. 05) intervals compared to baseline. The 6 W concentration was significantly lower than the placebo group (P < 0. 05).

The octanoic acid content of PPF was found to influence the results of preservation in five-day storage. Both octanoic acid and oleic acid stimulated oxygen consumption to a similar degree during hypothermic perfusion suggesting that the detrimental effect of octanoic acid was due to direct metabolic stimulation rather than uncoupling of oxidatative phosphorylation.|$|R

The growth response of Con A-activated T lymphocytes to increasing concentrations of SA {{is similar to the}} response to increasing equivalent concentrations of plasma suggesting but not proving that SA is the only growth-stimulating factor in plasma when added to a protein-free culture medium. The growth-promoting effect of SA is not due to the fatty acids or hormones bound to SA but is attributed to the albumin molecule itself or to a factor tightly bound to it. SA can also effectively replace plasma to stimulate proliferation of lymphocytes activated by allogeneic lymphocytes or purified protein derivative of tuberculin...|$|E

Injury of reticuloendothelial system of the liver by x-ray irradiation with 1000 r on the liver depressed catalase activity of the liver and decreased albumin and β-, γ-globulin and increased α-globulin in plasma electrophoresis. Transplantability of the tumor and mortality were elevated. 3. Carcinolytic agents played the same role on catalase activity of the liver and <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> as x-ray irradiation with 1000 r on the liver.

Separation of ovine seminal plasma {{proteins}} in the disc electrophoretic system revealed a consistent pattern of sixteen fractions with some variation among six rams {{in the relative}} amount of minor components, whereas bovine seminal plasma had twelve fractions.

The prealbumin region of the seminal plasma electro-phoretograms contained four fractions in the ovine samples and three fractions in the bovine samples.
