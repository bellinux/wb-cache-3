40|$|Critics {{of affirmative}} action {{policies}} contend that the elimination of racial preferences in college admissions {{would lead to a}} "more-able" student body. We develop a simple model comprised of three classes of college admissions [...] merit, race and legacy [...] to show that it is possible that a change in admissions policy that reduces racial preferences leads to a "less-able" student body. The change in admissions policy may serve only to ensure that more admissions are available for "sale" to wealthy alumni through <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences.</b> In other words, when there are multi-dimensional preferences, reducing or eliminating one dimension of preferences may lead to the unforeseen consequence of producing a "less able" student body.

50|$|<b>Legacy</b> <b>preference</b> or <b>legacy</b> {{admission}} is a preference given by an institution or organization to certain applicants {{on the basis}} of their familial relationship to alumni of that institution, with college admissions being the field in which <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences</b> are most controversially used. (Students so admitted are referred to as legacies or legacy students.) Regarding college admissions, legacy admissions are practiced almost exclusively at American colleges and universities and are virtually unheard of in post-secondary institutions in other countries around the world. <b>Legacy</b> <b>preferences</b> in elite college and university admissions in the U.S. are widespread: almost three-quarters of research universities and nearly all liberal arts colleges grant <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences</b> in admissions. Schools vary in how broadly they extend <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences,</b> with some schools granting this favor only to children of undergraduate alumni, while other schools extend the favor to children, grandchildren, siblings, nephews, and nieces of alumni of undergraduate and graduate programs. Preferential treatment based on legacy routinely grants legacies substantial bonus points on their admissions assessments and extra consideration if their applications are initially rejected. As a body of entering freshmen, legacies almost invariably have substantially lower GPAs and SAT scores than the larger body of entering freshmen, and, during their undergraduate careers, legacies as a body of students typically perform worse than the overall student body. A 2005 analysis of 180,000 student records obtained from nineteen selective colleges and universities found that, within a set range of SAT scores, being a legacy raised an applicant's chances of admission by 19.7 percentage points.|$|R
40|$|College and {{university}} admission <b>preferences</b> for <b>legacy</b> applicants {{have been the}} source of much debate. We seek to build upon the existing literature by providing a detailed empirical portrait of legacies at a private, selective university. In this study, we examine how legacies are distinctive in their admissions profiles, within-college achievement, and post-graduation plans, using data from a panel study of two recent cohorts of students attending Duke University. We find that legacies enter college from households with an abundance of economic, cultural and social capital, but also have lower levels of human capital compared to other students with college graduate parents. Due to this human capital deficit, legacies have lower grades in the first college year, but show little academic underperformance in subsequent semesters. Compared to their pre-college profiles there are few differences in post-graduation plans, although legacies are less likely to plan on being a medical doctor or engineer and have somewhat lower degree aspirations than other students. 2 Admissions <b>preference</b> for <b>legacies</b> – students with parents or close relatives that hav...|$|R

50|$|The Supreme Court upheld race-conscious admissions {{policies}} in its 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision, involving the University of Michigan's law school. With the judges having deep ties {{to their own}} elite post-secondary institutions, and with several being either former legacy students or the parents of legacies, the Court majority was not eager to ask the broader question regarding whether colleges were using race-conscious admissions policies to improve a problem of their own making, one arising from their <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences</b> and other admission practices that over-advantaged white students from economically privileged backgrounds. The only significant criticism of <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences</b> from the Court came from Justice Clarence Thomas, the sole member of the Supreme Court who grew up poor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Legacy</b> <b>preference</b> for {{university}} admissions was devised in 1925 at Yale University, where the proportional number of Jews {{in the student}} body was growing {{at a rate that}} became alarming to the school's administrators. Prior to that year, Yale had begun to incorporate such amorphous criteria as 'character' and 'solidity', as well as 'physical characteristics', into its admissions process as an excuse for screening out Jewish students; but nothing was as effective as <b>legacy</b> <b>preference,</b> which allowed the admissions board to summarily pass over Jews in favor of 'Yale sons of good character and reasonably good record', as a 1929 memo phrased it. Other schools, including Harvard, soon began to pursue similar policies for similar reasons, and Jewish students in the Ivy League schools were maintained at a steady 10% through the 1950s. Such policies were gradually discarded during the early 1960s, with Yale being one of the last of the major schools to eliminate the last vestige with the class of 1970 (entering in 1966). While legacy admissions as a way of screening out Jewish students may have ceased, the practice of giving <b>preference</b> to <b>legacies</b> has continued to the present day. In the 1998 book The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions, authors William G. Bowen, former Princeton University president, and Derek Bok, former Harvard University president, found [...] "the overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates".|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of language-in-education policy and specifically the various roles played by English, Afrikaans, and South Africa's nine officially recognized African languages has long caused significant national controversy {{and is often}} cited as a precipitating cause for the 1976 Soweto uprising. Apartheid-era policy mandated primary instruction in the 'home' language regardless of parental <b>preference,</b> a <b>legacy</b> that continues to shape how parents and students perceive the range of language-in-education choices available in the 'new' democratic South Africa. This paper combines an examination of policy documents and statistical research treating the transition from racially proscribed education to the democratic era with an analysis of current national and academic debates on language-in-education policy to argue that avoiding the replication of apartheid-era power politics must be a central focus in addressing the desire of previously marginalized parents and students for greater access to effective English-language education...|$|R

40|$|Possible {{reasons for}} visits to foreign nations by {{heads of state}} include the {{expansion}} of foreign markets for exports and the attraction of foreign direct investment. These two reasons are investigated in the two chapters that comprise this dissertation. The first chapter explores the role that a head of state may have in promoting exports and how it affects the decision of visiting any given foreign country under the presence of <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences.</b> A theoretical model is proposed and empirically estimated using the data for President Lula 2 ̆ 7 s administration in Brazil from 2003 to 2006. The choice of this administration for empirical investigation is particularly interesting since it was marked by many presidential foreign visits that appeared to have both an export promotion component and <b>legacy</b> <b>preferences.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} export promotion component was important in explaining the export performance during Lula 2 ̆ 7 s administration and that there was a strong legacy intent in the probability of having a visit to a foreign nation. The second chapter explores the role that the relevance of a delegation led by a head of state, visiting a foreign nation, may play in signaling the competitiveness of a country interested in attracting foreign direct investment for the export sector. The analysis shows that the signaling effect can be so important that the choice of a delegation may affect the probability of attracting foreign direct investment even if the intrinsic usefulness of delegation members is zero. There is an indication that the predicted correlation between the relevance of delegations and world salaries can be observed for President Lula 2 ̆ 7 s administration. ...|$|R

The OCR also found that legacies on average were rated lower than applicants who were neither legacies nor athletics in every important category (excluding athletic ability) in which applicants were judged.

In 1925 Yale University, which already had such admissions preferences as [...] "character", [...] "solidity", and [...] "physical characteristics" [...] added a program of <b>legacy</b> <b>preference</b> admission spots for children of Yale alumni, in an explicit attempt to put the brakes on the rising percentage of Jews in the student body.

The importance of the various factors varies between universities, and selectiveness varies significantly, as measured by admissions rate (which depends both on selectiveness and number and type of applicants).

40|$|Background: The Open Source {{development}} paradigm {{has matured}} sufficiently to give greater importance to questions {{on how to}} change the architecture and development processes of individual projects. Objective: We explore the abilities of Open Source projects to perform radical vs. incremental changes and suggest ways to improve them. Methods: We worked qualitatively and performed first a content analysis study of thirteen medium-scale Open Source projects. Using impression from this observational study we conducted an active case study with one large-scale Open Source project to achieve a radical change. Results: We found evidence that Open Source projects prefer incremental changes for software design and implementation {{as well as for}} the introduction of processes and tools. Our results include preliminary explanations for this <b>preference</b> such as <b>legacy</b> constraints and structural conservatism. Limitations: Further work is necessary to validate results widely and add a quantitative assessment to the results. Conclusions: We conclude that project leaders and innovators need to limit the radicality of the means to the goals they want to achieve in their projects, and give some advice on how to do so...|$|R

40|$|The European Commission’s {{promotion}} of public policies for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{is based on}} the non-coercive governance form the Open Method of Coordination. The Commission has only recently initiated a structured dialogue coordinating CSR policies between Member States, which indicates the soft mechanism for compliance, are less advanced. Based on these findings the thesis seeks to challenge the top-down assumption of EU effect inherent in most recent studies of europeanization. An inductive bottom-up research design has been constructed to determine, whether European or domestic factors spur domestic policy change. Based on Vivian Schmidt’s theory on adjustment pressure and Claudio Radaelli’s cyclical definition of europeanization, the thesis identifies Danish Commerce and Companies Agency (DCCA) as the EU disposed discourse entrepreneur who changes the logic of exiting Danish CSR policy within the period 1994 - 2007. The process of Danish CSR policy change is described through a diachronic analysis observing how Danish policy actors’ ideas of CSR change and materialise in different policy discourses over time. The diachronic analysis likewise identifies a rupture in the traditional policy discourse on CSR. These findings provide the ground for a synchronic analysis clarifying whether the theoretical mechanisms of europeanization are in play around the time of rupture. On this background, the thesis identifies a europeanization process of reciprocated progression where EU seeks to affect Danish CSR policy formulation and vice versa. Danish CSR policy change is, however complex and spurred by rivalling domestic and European discursive impulses. DCCA introduces a new EU inspired business-driven CSR concept into Danish policy-making, while more traditional CSR ideas linked to labour market integration of political target groups continues under the auspice of Employment policy. On this background the thesis identifies a domestic absorption of the European CSR policy, as a new EU discourse is introduced while traditional policy- <b>preferences</b> and <b>legacies</b> prevents the establishment of a common CSR understanding among the Danish policy actors. Policy transformation may however emerge in the future, as the policy actors’ perceptions of CSR are increasingly moving towards the European conceptualisation. Hence, the thesis illustrates that EU institutions matter even in a policy area where EU policy processes have barely taken off...|$|R
40|$|This project aims {{to analyse}} how the {{presence}} of national languages in the traditionally Portuguese instructed Mozambican educational system influence the pupils’ linguistic identity. Furthermore, it discusses the role of languages in society {{and whether or not}} mother tongue-based bilingual education {{can be seen as a}} decolonising initiative. This may not seem very problematic at first glance, but if one is to look closer at this, one will realise that this contains several issues including: the concept of mother tongue, the linguistic difference between the urban and rural areas and the aspect of decolonisation. When these tie together, they make the problematised question of language hierarchy, which is investigated in this project. This investigation is carried out using theories on the concept of Mother Tongue by Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, Linguistic Identity by Eric A. Anchimbe, Nativisation by Gregório Firmino and Decolonisation by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o. The project is designed so the reader first will gain background knowledge of Mozambique and the educational situation of the country. After this the different theories are presented, which is used in the analysis and finally debated in the discussion of whether the implementation of the national languages in the traditional Portuguese instructed educational system can be seen as a decolonising initiative. The conclusion of this project stays two faceted, as it in a compressed form, can be seen as a decolonising initiative as well as, on the contrary, a way of enhancing the competence of Portuguese and thus is a considered <b>preference</b> of Portuguese <b>legacy.</b> In that sense if one can accept bilingual education as a step closer to the breaking of the linguistic hierarchy inherited from the colonial era it can be considered to be a decolonising initiative in spite of its limitations and in comparison with the monolingual education.
