25|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>statement</b> is {{therefore}} that the alleles in question {{are not particularly}} beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows {{for more than one}} gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.|$|E

The proportional matrices led to fewer violations of both principles. Moreover, when subjects were trained to construct proportional matrices from written <b>problem</b> <b>statements,</b> they exhibited even fewer violations. utility/preference, decision analysis, problem representation...|$|R
