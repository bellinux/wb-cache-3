500|$|In the Ancient Psychic Tandem Warcast podcast, Zack Smith and Supernatural {{writer and}} {{producer}} Jenny Klein review the episode. Both Smith and Klein expressed an appreciate for Marceline {{as well as}} her voice actress, with the former noting that, [...] "it's <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> to get past the awesomeness that is Olivia Olson." [...] Klein compared the relationship between Marceline and Finn in this episode to the interactions between Kim Kelly (Busy Philipps) and Sam Weir (John Francis Daley), characters from the short-lived sitcom Freaks and Geeks. Klein also commended the [...] "House Hunting Song", applauding {{the fact that it was}} sung by Pendleton Ward; she argued that it was an example of the author speaking directly to the audience, akin to listening to an audiobook.|$|E

500|$|The song {{has been}} {{referred}} to as an [...] "indecent behavior anthem" [...] due to its lyrical content. Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Say Aah" [...] was one of the [...] "popping tracks" [...] which parent album Ready was built around. Commenting on the song's lyrics, Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy stated that, [...] "Its over-abundance of hooks ('we don't buyyyy no drinks at the bar' being a personal favorite) makes it <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> to dislike. And the verse from Brooklyn's Fabolous will bring in even the most hardened of fun-haters." [...] Vibe called the song [...] "the official birthday song of the year", claiming that it was better than Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex".

500|$|Super Smash Bros. Melee {{generally}} {{received a}} positive reception from reviewers, {{most of whom}} credited Melee expansion of gameplay features from Super Smash Bros.

[...] Reviewers compared the game favorably to Super Smash Bros.—IGN's Fran Mirabella III stated that it was [...] "in an entirely different league than the N64 version"; GameSpot's Miguel Lopez praised the game for offering an advanced [...] "classic-mode" [...] compared to its predecessor, while detailing the Adventure Mode as [...] "really a hit-or-miss experience." [...] Despite a mixed response to the single-player modes, most reviewers expressed the game's multiplayer mode as a strong component of the game. In their review of the game, GameSpy stated that [...] "you'll have a <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> time finding a more enjoyable multiplayer experience on any other console." ...|$|E

As regards you I {{can tell the}} story one way,--or the other, just as you please." [...] Lopez, seeing {{it in the same}} light, at last agreed that the story should be told in a manner not inimical to himself. The present project of his life was to leave his troubles in England,--Sexty Parker being the worst of them,--and get away to Guatemala. In arranging this the good word of Mr. Slide might not benefit him, but his ill word might injure him. And then, let him do what he would, the matter must be made public. Should Mr. Wharton hear of it,--as of course he would,--it must be brazened out. He could not keep it from Mr. Wharton's ears by quarrelling with Quintus Slide.|$|R

500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> to lie out of it."

500|$|Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse, the game's main antagonist, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as an antagonist of Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and main antagonist of Wolfenstein (2009). For The New Order, the team achieved closure on his story; {{to do so in}} an effective way, they wanted to find an interesting angle to portray him: his personality is full of enthusiasm, and he appreciates life after his near-death experience in the previous game. When developing the Nazis, Matthies states that the team [...] "didn't want to cartoon-ify them", instead opting to treat them seriously. Gideon Emery, who portrayed Fergus Reid, auditioned {{for his role in the}} game. He described Fergus as [...] "a tough as nails soldier, who gives [...] both support and a <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> time in the process". Matthies felt that Fergus is a type of father figure to Blazkowicz, and that he [...] "only gives negative reinforcement". Conversely, he saw Wyatt as a [...] "sort of son surrogate", as Blazkowicz is tasked as being his protector and mentor, and that he gives [...] "positive reinforcement". Max Hass, a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance, was inspired by the character of Garp from John Irving's novel The World According to Garp. Alex Solowitz portrayed Max in the game. [...] "Max was the most challenging character to cast, which seems counter-intuitive because he's a pretty simple guy on paper, but it took a tremendous actor to pull that off and a long time to find him," [...] Matthies said.|$|E

She ain’t a bad one at bottom, the old girl; she do pounce a bit, and she do worry, but, law bless you, Mr. Anne, it ain’t nothink really—she don’t mean it. W’y, she was down on me like a ’undredweight of bricks this morning. You see, last night she ’ad me in to supper, and, I beg your pardon, sir, but I took the freedom of playing her a chune or two.

5000|$|Aly Semigan of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} song stating [...] "Fox's Glee put the {{ultimate}} earworm {{back in its}} rightful place." [...] She then continued saying [...] "even if you aren't one for show choirs (which, is quite frankly, shocking), it's <b>pretty</b> damn <b>hard</b> to resist."

2500|$|This [...] "remix" [...] {{philosophy}} stems {{partly from}} the Stones' own collaborative family dynamic, and — {{as with the}} insistence on an entirely visual, code-free interface — partly from concern about overwhelming the end user.

2500|$|It's <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> {{to say on}} the {{one hand}} that we feel very {{strongly}} about Pakistani and Indian nuclear testing {{and on the other hand}} the U.S. Senate won't ratify the ...treaty... The last thing the United States wants to see is a resumption of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see. By refusing to ratify this treaty, the United States Senate has done a lot to undermine the arms control agenda that the international community, including Australia, has been working on.|$|E
