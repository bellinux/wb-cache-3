25|$|This {{incident}} {{had another}} effect: the first helmets appeared on batsmen's heads. Initially, Englishman Dennis Amiss sported a motorcycle helmet when batting in WSC, {{and he was}} quickly followed by many other players. Protective cricket equipment developed rapidly, {{and by the end}} of WSC, virtually all batsmen in WSC and official Test matches were sporting some form of <b>protective</b> <b>headwear.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: Many troops {{deployed}} in Iraq and Afghanistan have sustained blast-related, closed-head injuries from being within non-lethal distance of detonated explosive devices. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms associated with blast exposure that {{give rise to}} traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study attempts to identify the precise conditions of focused stress wave energy within the brain, resulting from blast exposure, which will correlate with a threshold for persistent brain injury. Methods: This study developed and validated a set of modelling tools to simulate blast loading to the human head. Using these tools, the blast-induced, early-time intracranial wave motions that lead to focal brain damage were simulated. Results: The simulations predict the deposition of three distinct wave energy components, two of which can be related to injury-inducing mechanisms, namely cavitation and shear. Furthermore, the results suggest that the spatial distributions of these damaging energy components are independent of blast direction. Conclusions: The predictions reported herein will simplify efforts to correlate simulation predictions with clinical measures of TBI and aid in the development of <b>protective</b> <b>headwear...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy and superior temporal orbital rim injury in two-wheeler riders and documentation of the clinical profile of such cases. Design: Retrospective observational study. Materials and Methods: Records of all patients reporting with cranio-orbital injury and vision loss following road traffic accidents between October 1994 and April 2006 were reviewed and from them cases with vision loss solely from indirect optic nerve injury were taken up for study. The prognostic significance of different presenting features, role of intravenous methyl prednisolone (IVMP) and relative risk of superior orbital rim injury to posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (at 95 &#x 0025; confidence interval) was calculated. Results: Out of 129 consecutive cases of cranio-orbital injury, 35 had posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy with minor ipsilateral superior temporal orbital rim trauma and none used any <b>protective</b> <b>headwear.</b> Presenting clinical features like relative afferent pupillary defect (P = 0. 365), optic disc status (P = 0. 518) and visual evoked potential (VEP) (P = 0. 366) were disproportionate to visual loss. Only VEP had prognostic significance. The IVMP did not provide any added therapeutic benefit. The remaining 94 cases sustained direct blinding ocular trauma and 28 of them had associated intracranial pathology. The relative risk of superior temporal orbital rim injury to posterior indirect optic nerve trauma was 2. 25. Conclusion: Superior temporal orbital rim injury, even when minor, carries a potential risk for development of blindness from indirect posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy in two-wheeler drivers. Presenting signs do not correlate with visual status. Only VEP has prognostic significance and the condition is untreatable...|$|E
40|$|Head {{injuries}} to car occupants resulting from crashes on Australian roads {{are a major}} cause of death and permanent brain damage. This report evaluates the benefits that would be likely to accrue from the use of padding materials to reduce the severity of impacts to the head. A review of the international literature was conducted to examine the range of possible countermeasures, with particular reference to padding the upper interior of the passenger compartment. Three sets of data analyses were then carried out: first, a summary of objects typically struck by the head in a representative sample of crashes; secondly, an examination of actual brain injuries sustained in a sample of crashes, and an assessment of likely outcomes had the objects struck by the head been padded; and finally, a HARM analysis to estimate the cost of head injuries and the likely financial benefits from various countermeasures. Results indicate that there is considerable potential for reducing the severity and consequences of impacts to the head by padding the upper interior of the passenger compartment. The total annual benefit of this measure, in terms of reduced HARM, would be about $ 123 million, or $ 154 per car (with a 5 % discount rate). However, an even greater level of protection would be provided by the use of <b>protective</b> <b>headwear.</b> The total benefits associated with headwear {{in the form of a}} soft shell bicycle helmet were estimated to be $ 380 million (assuming a fully airbag equipped fleet), or $ 476 per car ($ 626 for cars without airbags).
