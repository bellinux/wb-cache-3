40|$|Art. 11 of the Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts, {{adopted by}} the Council of the Hague Conference in March 2015 {{contains}} provisions governing {{the relationship between the}} system of law 1 chosen by the parties under Art. 2 (1) (the “chosen law”) and the laws and policies of other systems. It provides as follows: 1. These Principles shall not prevent a court from applying overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the forum which apply irrespective of the law chosen by the parties. 2. The law of the forum determines when a court may or must apply or take into account overriding mandatory provisions of another law. 3. A court may exclude application of a provision of the law chosen by the parties only if {{and to the extent that}} the result of such application would be manifestly incompatible with fundamental notions of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> (<b>ordre</b> <b>public)</b> of the forum. 4. The law of the forum determines when a court may or must apply or take into account the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> (<b>ordre</b> <b>public)</b> of a State the law of which would be applicable in the absence of a choice of law. 5. These Principles shall not prevent an arbitral tribunal from applying or taking into account <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> (<b>ordre</b> <b>public),</b> or from applying or taking into account overriding mandatory provisions of a law other than the law chosen by the parties, if the arbitral tribunal is required or entitled to do so. In brief summary, therefore, the first and third paragraphs address the relationship between the chosen law and certain laws and policies of the forum, the second paragraph addresses the relationship between the chosen law and certain laws of legal systems other than the forum, the fourth paragraph addresses the relationship between the chosen law and the certain policies of the legal system whose laws would have applied but for the parties’ choice under Art. 2 (1) and the fifth paragraph addresses the limits of the application of the chosen law in arbitration proceedings. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the notion of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> (<b>ordre</b> <b>public)</b> in Swiss {{international}} arbitration. The paper analyzes the relevant paragraphs of IPRG, the Swiss Act on Private International Law. Based on legal authorities one can read about the distinction between procedural and substantive public policy in Swiss law. The paper describes several cases, in which the awards of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Tribunal Arbitral du Sport) were challenged at the Federal Tribunal of Switzerland based on the alleged breach of public policy. The author discusses the question whether there can be a supra-national, universal interpretation of the notion of public policy in Swiss law, which is based on the fundamental legal and moral values of the civilized nations. ...|$|E
40|$|Much {{confusion}} has {{revolved around}} {{the nature of the}} public policy defense under Article V(2) (b) of United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (the New York Convention) {{to the point that the}} French term for <b>public</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>ordre</b> <b>public,</b> ought to be changed to désordre public to reflect the general disorder in the discourse on this particular subject. This article takes an in-depth look at the public policy defense and challenges the notion that enforcement States are obliged to consider supranational public policy when deciding whether to recognize or enforce an international arbitral award, except in only a few cases where certain regional obligations are involved. Even then, this is not the type of truly international public policy that is advocated by numerous commentators. Nonetheless, States are free to rely on truly international public policy when deciding on enforcement. Despite the perceived benefits to relying on truly international public policy, there are significant reasons to refrain from pushing for such reliance. While reliance on truly international public policy may help mitigate some of the adverse side effects associated with globalization, it is important to ask what is the price we are willing to pay to counter these side effects. The price should not be the emasculation of the New York Convention itself. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|While {{same-sex}} marriage is visibly gaining momentum (see Germany and Malta this year), many countries have not fully recognised {{the rights of}} same-sex couples. This isually {{takes the form of}} civil unions (e. g. Italy and Greece) or of no recognition (e. g. Poland and Lithuania). However, other solutions are also possible. For instance, some countries recognise only {{same-sex marriage}}s celebrated abroad (e. g. Armenia and Estonia). In Northern Ireland, adoption has been available to same-sex couples since 2013, even though the Northern Ireland Assembly voted against same-sex marriage (Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, Re Judicial Review [2013] NICA 37). However, in many countries where there is no same-sex marriage, these couples cannot access adoption. This is the case in Italy, even though the case that is commented here brings some good news. In Italy, the Adoptions Act (Legge No 183 / 1984) allows only married couples to adopt a minor. Since only heterosexual couples can get married, same-sex couples are de facto excluded from the adoption. However, this regime applies only to internal situations (e. g. two women domiciled in Italy adopting a minor in Italy). Different rules apply to the adoption by same-sex couples in other countries, once the couple asks the Italian authorities (ufficiale di stato civile) the recognition {{of the effects of the}} adoption. This is the topic recently clarified by the Court of Appeals of Genoa, with ordinanza No 1319 of 1 September 2017. The Court holds that same-sex adoptions celebrated abroad should be automatically regognised in Italy by the competent civil servants, without any need for a judicial scrutiny. The main reason is that even though Italian unmarried couples cannot adopt in Italy, there is no <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> or <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> (ordine pubblico) consideration preventing the full recognition of the effects of foreign same-sex adoptions...|$|R

40|$|In this decade, the United States Supreme Court decided {{two cases}} which {{revolved}} around the enforceability of choice of forum clauses contained in transnational commercial contracts. The decisions which the Court rendered reshaped significantly the legal contours of the enforceability of such clauses. In the two cases, the Court signaled that it was prepared to recognize the distinction between what may be termed 2 ̆ 2 internal 2 ̆ 2 <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> and what may be termed 2 ̆ 2 international 2 ̆ 2 <b>public</b> <b>policy.</b> The recognition of this distinction {{is likely to have}} a vital bearing on the right of persons to provide for a specific foreign judicial or arbitral forum as part of the transnational agreement into which they have entered. Before discussing the impact of the two cases on the effectiveness of choice of forum clauses, it is appropriate to define the two varieties of <b>public</b> <b>policy,</b> particularly in terms of how they pertain to issues raised by choice of forum clauses. The relationship between 2 ̆ 2 internal 2 ̆ 2 <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> and 2 ̆ 2 international 2 ̆ 2 <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> was an approximate analogue in the distinction made in French law between <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> interne and <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> international. The distinction is that one set of standards is applied to transactions which are performed in a local context, while another set of standards is applied to transactions which have international elements. An example of the former class of transactions is a contract which is entered into by two nationals and which is to be performed within their country; an example of the latter class of transactions is a contract which is entered into by persons of different nationalities and which is to be performed in a country other than the place where the contract is entered into. The standards required by <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> interne are parts of the total law of the forum from which there may be no derogation. The standards required by <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> international can differ from standards of the local law of the forum, provided that the transaction contains sufficient transnational elements. Nevertheless, there remain certain forum law standards that even transnational transactions must meet. That is, the <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> international of the forum is deemed to include certain of the standards required by the <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> interne of the forum...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{is perhaps}} the most {{elaborate}} venture into applying the idea of ‘unity in diversity’ ever attempted. This ambitious book – the first in English to thoroughly explore this vast and multifaceted ground – convincingly demonstrates {{that there is such a}} thing as an autonomous EU <b>ordre</b> <b>public,</b> and its co-existence with the concepts of <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> of the Member States is indeed intricate. In a cogent, detailed analysis, the author ‘reconstructs’ the legal order of the European Union in a way that best gives meaning to the Treaties, the case law of the Court of Justice, and the various underlying principles of integration that have emerged over the decades. He focuses on instances, or touchstones, in relation to which EU law seems to be building and integrating an <b>ordre</b> <b>public.</b> Among these are the following: 	private international law; 	international trade law and arbitration; 	public international law; 	the ECHR and EctHR; 	<b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exceptions to the four freedoms; 	European citizenship; 	competition law; 	national and EU procedural law; and 	protection of social and labour standards. In-depth inquiry into questions which seem subject to very specific limitations – such as when national or EU courts are under an obligation to raise issues of EU law of their own motion, or norms from which private parties may not deviate – captures the breadth of the EU <b>ordre</b> <b>public,</b> greatly clarifying the concept and the variety of ways it operates. Seeking to reconcile numerous strands and processes of EU law in a principled manner, the book reveals a significant potential for a deeper constitutional framework defining the EU <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> and putting it into operation as a tool to help ensure unity in diversity. It will be welcomed and read closely by jurists, policymakers, and interested academics in Europe and wherever the matter of European integration is studied. nrpages: xvi+ 496 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>policy</b> {{exceptions}} arguably {{exist in}} all fields {{of private and}} commerciallaw, not only in private international law but also in substantive law. In substantive private law, the term 'public policy exception' {{could be used to}} indicate general illegality rules that make an act of private autonomy (a contract, a testament, etc.) invalid when it conflicts with <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> or good morals. In primary EU law, one may call 'public policy exceptions' the derogations from the four freedoms for reasons of <b>public</b> morality, <b>public</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>public</b> security, or public health. Like the <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> exceptions in private international law, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exceptions in substantive private and commercial laws can also be seen as conflict rules. In fact, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exceptions in substantive private law address the conflict between state regulation and policy, on the one hand, and private (self-) regulation and policy, on the other hand. Moreover, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> derogations from the four freedoms regulate the conflict between EU and national law and policy. A long-term research project initiated in Groningen aims at a cross-cutting comparison of interpretations and applications of concepts that function as <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exceptions in different branches of substantive, international, and EU private and commerciallaw.

40|$|In {{order to}} take ethical {{considerations}} of patenting biological material into account, the so-called ‘‘ordre public or morality clause’’ was implemented as Article 6 in the EC directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, 98 / 44 /EC. At first glance, this seems to provide a significant advantage to the European patent system with respect to ethics. The thesis of this paper argues that the <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> or morality clause does not provide sufficient protection against ethically problematic uses of the patent system within the area of life. On the contrary, there are worrisome obstacles to any effective and comprehensive critical analysis of the ethical aspects of bio-patenting, especially {{in the field of}} agriculture. These obstacles can be seen as indirect consequences of the implementation of ethical considerations in form of the <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> and morality clause in the EC Directive. Therefore, Article 6 of the EC Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions seems to ultimately weaken the position of ethics in the debate concerning bio-patenting because the <b>ordre</b> <b>public</b> and morality clause is usually interpreted in an exclusively bio-ethical way in the sense of an ‘‘intrinsic ethics,’’ which is primarily interested in questions regarding the moral status of particular entities. It is argued that an important cause of this phenomenon is that the decisive reasons against bio-patenting are concerns of social ethics, and not bio-ethics...|$|R

40|$|PhD (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{phenomenon}} of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, which encapsulates the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, has been in existence long before the political transformation {{that took place in}} South Africa in 1994. However, the ushering in of the new dispensation saw the integration of the existing <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> In addition, it inevitably heralded the introduction of the new <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> and national guidelines across all sectors of the South African <b>public</b> institutions. <b>Public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, as an integral stage of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, emerged as indispensable towards effective and efficient public service. The basic education, as a public institution, could also not be exempted from such inevitability of heightened <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation. The introduction of the new education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> included the developmental appraisal system (DAS), the whole school evaluation (WSE), the integrated quality management systems (IQMS) and the discipline and safety national guidelines (DSNG). This, consequently, bears testament to what became an inevitable transformation process in South African basic education. Using the DAS, the WSE, the IQMS and the DSNG as points of departure and Empangeni education district as a reference area, the focus of this study has been the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, the internal organisational arrangements and structures for <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation process together with its inherent challenges and an improved model aimed at alleviating or even eradicating such <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. The theoretical models, both descriptive and prescriptive, suggest that the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, which entails namely: <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> agenda, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> formulation, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> adoption, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation and <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> evaluation, is premised on the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> models. Of all the above-listed <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process stages, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stands out as the pinnacle around which the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process revolves. The <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stage, therefore, suggests a point where the influence, the impact and the successes or failures of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process unfold. In light of this inextricable link of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stage to the general <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process that is influenced by models, the effective <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation is, subsequently, embracive of attributes and lessons derived from the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> models. Some of these attributes and lessons, inter alia, include; the mutual participation by all actors involved, rather than dominance by an elite group (derived from the elite/mass model), the identification of institutional structures responsible for the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation (derived from the institutional model) and the accommodation of the implementation review as well as feedback (all indicative of the systems model). The literature review and the empirical data analyses show convergent views that suggest that the effective <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation is directly proportional to the extent of internal organisational arrangements and structures {{as well as to the}} basic functionality of schools as centres for the implementation process. This implies that where internal institutional arrangements and structures are evident and functional, the implementation of <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> is bound to be effective and efficient, while the contrary also holds. Given Empangeni education district being the focal point of the study, it has emerged that the use of personnel from other units and the absence of a district unit designated to solely oversee the coordination, the implementation and the evaluation of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> inhibit the potential of adequately achieving the intended objectives of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> implemented. In case of schools as the institutional centres for <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, empirical data analyses have established an inter-connection between the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation and the schools‟ basic functionality. Consequently, it is in functional schools (i. e. schools where the school management teams and school governing bodies are visible, effective and work collaboratively), where <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation thrives and is effective. The contextualisation of the empirical research analyses to the study focus area, Empangeni Education District (EED), established that its current implementation model faces <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. The most evident challenges, inter alia, include: * the inadequate advocacy of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> to be implemented; * the two or three days, currently accepted as a capacity building period by those expected to implement education related <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> are not proportional to the volume of work to be covered and it suggests an inadequate time-frame for capacity development in the EED's current model; * the material and mechanisms used to perform functional work do not accommodate all role-players (also called actors in this study) according to their demographical needs, like language, which renders them inept to perform to their optimum level; * the primary structure of the current EED's <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is a top-down directional structure which underscores the top-down cascading model; * current communication technology employed, do not take advantage of the 21 century‟s information computer technology in order to make the work environment more user-friendly, efficient and effective; * the simultaneous implementation of education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> poses a challenge to internal organisational arrangements, such as <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation (PPI) structures and personnel, for effective implementation of such policies; and * the evident inadequate continuous and deliberate monitoring of implemented education related <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> Conclusions and inferences drawn from this study suggest that the EED's current <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is inadequate to deal with the identified challenges. Finally, this study proposes a strengthened EED <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> model, which accommodates recommendations to EED's <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. Inherently, the proposed strengthened <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is not limited to dealing with the identified challenges only, but it radically embraces the introduction of systems and internal organisational structures that promote inclusive, collaborative and traceable implementation of education related <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> Doctora...|$|R
