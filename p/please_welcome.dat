There had been Austrian and Italian choirs, but they hardly counted; neither did Spaniards. As the choir tell it in a letter now in the Clwyd archive in Ruthin, there was a tearful welcome with tea and sandwiches when the choir arrived at the Llangollen station from the eisteddfod helpers and the townspeople. Later, the festival's compère Mr Hywel Roberts introduced the choir with the words: [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, <b>please</b> <b>welcome</b> our friends from Germany."

[...] Actress Constance Wu tweeted, [...] "To parade little kids on stage w/no speaking lines merely to be the butt of a racist joke is reductive & gross." [...] Furthermore, 25 AMPAS members of Asian descent, including actors Nancy Kwan, Sandra Oh, and George Takei, and director Ang Lee, signed a letter condemning Rock's skit saying, [...] "In light of criticism over #OscarsSoWhite, we were hopeful that the telecast would provide the Academy a way forward and the chance to present a spectacular example of inclusion and diversity. Instead, the Oscars show was marred by a tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians." ...|$|E

5000|$|At MidAmeriCon, the 22nd Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards, the Hugos, {{were held}} {{for the very first}} time as a stand-alone, {{separate}} event and not given out during a traditional combined guests of honor speeches and awards banquet in the Radisson Muehlebach Hotel. Instead, Sunday evening of the convention, they were presented in the nearby 2600-seat Music Hall of Kansas City's Art Deco Municipal Auditorium complex, in keeping with MidAmeriCon's theme, [...] "Science Fiction and the Arts". [...] As convention members entered the Art Deco opulence of the Music Hall to take their seats, they were greeted by a variety of popular 1930's show tunes playing from the auditorium's speakers. The house lights slowly fading to black, announced the start of the ceremony. Multiple super trooper spotlights began quickly panning the curtained stage area, just as Benny Goodman's original up-tempo show tune [...] "Hoorah for Hollywood" [...] began playing from the speakers. As the tune ended, the spotlights abruptly stopped, just as The Music Hall's house lights slowly began to come up. Max Steiner's dramatic Overture from his score to the 1932 fantasy film King Kong began playing, just as the stage's seven sets of vertical and horizontal drapery were set in motion. The black grand drape opened slowly, revealing six colored vertical and horizontal drapes, opening one after the other, in sync to the movements of one minute and 30 second Steiner composition. While the score was still playing, the stage became fully exposed and MidAmeriCon's logo was projected onto a cyclorama backdrop: [...] "MidAmeriCon Presents (slide dissolve) The 22nd Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards (slide dissolve) The Hugos", and the rousing Steiner composition ended. From offstage, a voice-over by Kansas City actor David Wilson, intoned King Kong dialog, [...] "He was a King and a God in the world he knew (slight pause), but we've tamed and brought him here for you tonight' (slight pause). Ladies and gentlemen, <b>please</b> <b>welcome</b> the 8th Wonder of the Science Fiction World, Mr. Bob Tucker". After the applause died down, toastmaster Bob Tucker began his opening remarks, some humorous, and made several quick announcements. The Hugo Awards were then presented.|$|E
