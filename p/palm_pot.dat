60|$|An upright semi-grand piano {{near the}} door, {{flanked by two}} <b>palms</b> in <b>pots,</b> {{executed}} suddenly all by itself a valse tune with aggressive virtuosity. The din it raised was deafening. When it ceased, as abruptly as it had started, the be-spectacled, dingy little man who faced Ossipon behind a heavy glass mug full of beer emitted calmly what had {{the sound of a}} general proposition.|$|R

60|$|Then we set {{the table}} with all the nice dishes we could find. There was only one long {{tablecloth}} in the sideboard drawer, and there were three holes in it, but we covered them with dishes and put a little <b>potted</b> <b>palm</b> in the middle for a centrepiece.

5000|$|Running west off Zhengyi Jie {{just past}} the mosque, Jingxing Jie leads {{into one of the}} more bizarre corners of the city, with Kunming's huge Bird and Flower Market {{convening}} daily in the streets connecting it with the northerly, parallel Guanghua Jie. The market offers many plants such as orchids that have been collected and farmed across the province. In the small grounds of Wen Miao, a now vanished Confucian temple off the western end of Changchun Lu, there is an avenue of pines, an ancient pond and pavilion, and beds of bamboo, azaleas and <b>potted</b> <b>palms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vonnegut {{does not}} believe that {{traditional}} religions can cure loneliness or provide significant comfort. His take on belief in the afterlife is satirical. In his novel he describes a Church of Jesus Christ the Kidnapped which becomes a dominant American religion in the post-apocalyptic world of the novel [...] Vonnegut finds the church followers' behavior comical:He was jerking his head around in what then seemed an eccentric manner, as though hoping to catch someone peering out at him from behind a <b>potted</b> <b>palm</b> tree or an easy chair, or even from directly overhead, from the crystal chandelier.|$|R
40|$|The {{responses}} of 20 species of ornamental palms and one cycad (Cycas revoluta) to two {{populations of the}} reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis, from southern Florida were studied in two greenhouse experiments conducted in 1989 - 1991 and 1991 - 92. Ornamental <b>palms</b> in <b>pots</b> were exposed to initial population densities of 400 and 1, 500 R. reniformis/l 00 cm³ soil for 16 and 15 months, respectively. Nematode reproduction occurred on Acoelorrhaphe wrightii and Washingtonia robusta, {{but not on the}} other palms or the cycad. In both experiments, nematode numbers on A. wrightii and W. robusta were significantly smaller than those on cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), a susceptible host of the nematode used as a control in these experiments. Nematodes surviving in <b>pots</b> containing nonhost <b>palms</b> for 16 months retained infectivity and were able to reproduce on susceptible cowpea in a bioassay. Sections from Washingtonia robusta roots infected by R. reniformis females showed the nematode feeding on syncytia formed by endodermal, pericyclic, and vascular parenchyma cells {{in a manner similar to}} that reported for other monocot hosts of the reniform nematode...|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the first}} {{guests at the}} {{original}} hotel were President Woodrow Wilson and Mrs. Wilson, who came to represent the national administration for the Newark Board of Trade annual dinner {{as part of the}} 250th anniversary of the city of Newark. The accommodations on the fifth would later be known as the [...] "President's Suite". Designed by Guilbert and Betelle in a Renaissance Revival style, the exterior features granite and cast stone at the base, with brick and terra cotta trim covering the upper stories. The hotel was intended to make use of every luxury and technology available at the time in the hotel industry and would be the very first {{of its kind in the}} city. Perhaps the most impressive structure of the original hotel was the lobby, where huge columns combined with intricate lighting features over a white marble steps, tile floors, and lavish rugs. There were plentiful lounge space, large <b>palms</b> and <b>potted</b> plants, and writing desks and tables on a balcony for afternoon tea. A portrait of Robert Treat was prominently placed over the fireplace mantle.|$|R
50|$|Hacienda Rosalia is {{a former}} sugar {{plantation}} owned by Jose Gaston, one of the sons of Yves Leopold Germain Gaston, a sugar baron of Negros. He is credited as the first to commercially produce cane sugar, the primary product of the province. He was married to Consuelo Ascona and had 8 children. The Gaston Mansion {{was built in the}} 1930s. It is set in lush, verdant and gorgeous garden of flowers, shrubs, trees, <b>potted</b> <b>palms</b> and herbs. Within the grounds are a now-disused swimming pool (used as hiding place during World War II), a Victorian fountain, a pond and a time-worn shoe house (which was used before as a playground).|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} Indo-European house (Indo Europeesche Stijl) or Indische stijl, {{this type of}} country houses appear between 1790-1820. The form of these country houses {{represents}} the perfect expression of the intermingling of Dutch and indigenous (Javanese) architecture. Country houses of this type consisted of a single storey with front verandahs (pringgitan) and rear verandahs (gadri), covered by a high, pitched roof which extended over the verandahs. Often the verandahs were connected to side galleries for full climatic protection. The verandah often had <b>potted</b> <b>palms,</b> cool concrete or marble tiles covered with split bamboo mats. The western reference appears in the neo-classical Tuscan columns supporting the large roof overhang and the decorated doors and windows.|$|R
50|$|Decorated in {{a refined}} Georgian {{decorative}} order and painted white, the room featured delicate plaster work combined with sleek paneling, fluted columns, {{and a white}} marble fireplace. <b>Potted</b> <b>palms</b> on tall stands {{were placed in the}} corners of the room, while shaded sconces and beaded crystal chandeliers provided soft lighting. Comfortable silk-upholstered settees and chairs in shades of yellow and blue were grouped around tables and writing desks for convenience. The windows were lined with pink silk curtains and looked out onto the Promenade Deck, allowing ample sunlight to flood the room. The popularity of this space had proved disappointing aboard the Olympic, and Thomas Andrews had plans to convert part of the room on the Titanic into further passenger quarters.|$|R
5000|$|Her villa, La Mimoseraie, was {{the design}} {{laboratory}} {{in which she}} elevated simplicity to an art form. In 1910, wrote Richardson, [...] "she already stood out for the unconventional sparseness of her rooms, for her disdain of poufs and <b>potted</b> <b>palms</b> and too much passementerie.... She appreciated things that were very fine and simple, above all, things made of linen, cotton, deal, or stone, whose quality improved with laundering or fading, scrubbing or polishing. She attended to the smallest detail in her house". For her, Elegance means elimination. Errazuriz hung curtains of unlined linen, and whitewashed the walls like a peasant's home - a shocking decorating approach in 1914. I love my house as it looks very clean and very poor! she boasted.|$|R
50|$|The Comino brothers, John, Paul, George, and Arthur {{arrived in}} Childers from the Greek island of Kythera {{in the early}} 1900s. Soon after they {{established}} a fruit and refreshment business in the town, apparently at 102 Churchill Street (Coronation Building). The Marble Cafe {{was established in the}} new building erected by Gant and Brand. The business comprised a fruit shop, wine bar, and cafe, which catered to the large population of workers associated with the surrounding sugar farms. The cafe was furnished with silky oak fittings, <b>potted</b> <b>palms,</b> and tables with Italian carrera marble tops, which gave the cafe its name. The cafe was run by Paul Comino until his death in 1978, after which time the fittings were sold.|$|R
40|$|A &# 039; city beach&# 039; is an {{artificial}} landscape of sand, deckchairs, beach umbrellas, <b>potted</b> <b>palm</b> trees, collapsible swimming pools and portable huts temporarily spread onto an urban open space, which {{is open to}} public use. Since 1999, over 350 such beaches have been installed on vacant sites in over I 00 different German cities, mostly {{just for a few}} months each summer. Most have been developed as profit-oriented hospitality ventures by private entrepreneurs. Even for experienced commercial operators. creating these novel environments requires new engagements with public bureaucracy, neighbours and clientele, because these projects are open to a very broad public for a very wide range of uses. This chapter &# 039;s focus is on the small number of city beaches which have been initiated, designed, produced and operated by local citizens...|$|R
