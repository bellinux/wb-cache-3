25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|E

2500|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid.

Similar materials are <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower rate of degradation compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. [...] This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.|$|E

RESULTS: The {{results show that the}} composite material is not cytotoxic when it is in direct and indirect contact with murine fibroblasts. It is not genotoxic and not allergenic. The implantation in rabbit, already after 30 days, shows that around the material there is a rapid bone growth and the material is reabsorbing. The degradation is suitable for its clinical use.

Their subsequent controlled ring-opening polymerisation (ROP) to yield functionalised poly(ester) s is studied and application in micellar self-assembly reported. Chapter 1 reviews the many synthetic strategies that have been employed {{in the preparation of}} functional glycolides, lactides, ε-caprolactones, δ-valerolactones and β-propiolactones. Their subsequent polymerisation and applications are also discussed. Chapter 2 describes the improved synthesis of 3 -(S) - [(benzyloxycarbonyl) methyl]- and 3, 6 -(S) -[di(benzyloxycarbonyl) methyl]- 1, 4 - dioxane- 2, 5 -diones, BMD and malide respectively, from L-malic acid. Controlled organocatalytic ROP of BMD realised functional poly(glycolic acid-co-benzyl α- malate) s (PBMD) with the choice of initiator proving important in determining the resulting molecular weight. Successful hydrogenolysis of these poly(glycolic acid-co-benzyl α-malate) s yielded hydrophilic <b>poly(glycolic</b> acid-co-α-malic <b>acid)</b> s (PGMA) with subsequent degradation studies in H 2 O observing complete degradation after six days. In Chapter 3, the synthesis of 5 -(S) - and 5 -(R) -[(benzyloxycarbonyl) methyl]- 1, 3 - dioxolane- 2, 4 -dione (L-malOCA and D-malOCA respectively) from L- and Dmalic acid respectively is reported. ROP of malOCA with a range of pyridine based catalysts enabled the synthesis of functional poly(benzyl α-malate) s (PBMA). Mechanistic studies revealed the formation of several side products that were eliminated via judicious choice of catalyst and column chromatography. Subsequent hydrogenolysis realised hydrophilic poly(α-malic acid) s (PMA) with degradation studies in H 2 O observing complete degradation after 10 days. Chapter 4 reports the synthesis of novel amphiphilic PEO-b-PBMA block copolymers by the ROP of L-malOCA or D-malOCA from PEO macroinitiators with subsequent self-assembly realising polymeric micelles. Variation in both size dimensions and stability of the micelles through changes in both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic block lengths and their relative ratios was demonstrated. The self-assembly of an equimolar mixture of homochiral PEO-b- P(L-BMA) and PEO-b-P(D-BMA) resulted in the formation of stereocomplexed polymeric micelles.

30|$|The {{advent of}} DES {{technology}} has brought its advantages {{to overcome the}} conventional limitations of BMS. Despite DES’s dramatic influence on clinical practice in vascular intervention, the incomplete endothelialization and hypersensitivity reactions to the polymer coating were major subjects of debate over the risk of implantation (Grabow et al. 2010). All drawbacks caused the first-generation DES to fail. Late thrombosis and delayed healing were two potential risks associating {{with the use of}} DES. Furthermore, their long-term efficiency was questionable since their coating material was not biodegradable and reports of hypersensitivity to DES implantation were reported (Farb et al. 2003; Joner et al. 2006; Lanzer et al. 2008; Nebeker et al. 2006; Virmani et al. 2004 a, b). The long-term presence of non-biodegradable materials in stents leads to late complications such as thrombosis, neointimial hyperplasia, and chronic inflammation (Jiang et al. 2017). It was evident that the newly improved version should have the polymer coating with higher biocompatibility and probable degradability with improved pharmacologic action (Grabow et al. 2010). To circumvent the problems associated with durable polymer-coated DES, the modified second-generation DES made use of biodegradable polymer to enhance the clinical performance. This new treatment has the following properties: (1) the ability to deliver greater amounts of drug {{over a longer period of}} time, (2) the ability to prepare a suitable framework for loading various drugs if necessary, and (3) the ability to overcome unfavorable effects of stenting (Kohn and Zeltinger 2005; Tanguay et al. 1994). Van der Giessen et al. (1992) published their pioneering experimental studies of implanting non-biodegradable polyethylene-terephthalate braided mesh stent in animal models. The first trial for creating a biodegradable scaffold started later in 1996 when the efficiency of five different biodegradable polymers consisting <b>poly(glycolic</b> acid)/poly(lactic <b>acid)</b> PGA/PLA copolymer, poly(caprolactone) (PCL), polyhydroxybutyrate/valerate copolymer, poly(ortho ester), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/poly(butylene terephthalate) as coaters of Wiktor stent was studied for the implantation in animal models (Hårdhammar et al. 1996). The results, however, were not satisfactory to the group and were failed. The primitive clinical trial for biodegrdable failed due to the adverse effects of thrombosis, moderate intimal hyperplasia, and inflammatory response. Lack of manufacturing the engineered polymer for inhibiting inflammation and restenosis led the project to this failure (Garg and Serruys 2010; Van Der Giessen et al. 1996). A fundamental prerequisite for long-term survival of biomaterials is that these materials are compatible with physiological condition, i.e., a successful healing process necessitates not only utilizing biomaterials that is compatible with the host immune system, but also having a profound understanding of the host immune response towards implanted biomaterials (Franz et al. 2011). Later, Lincoff et al. (1997) took advantage of high-molecular weight poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) (321  kDa) for stent coating, and they compared the results with the low-molecular-weight (80  kDa) in a porcine model. The results proved the intense inflammatory neointimal hyperplasia within low-molecular-weight PLLA, while no major adverse effect was reported with high-molecular-weight PLLA. Yamawaki et al. (1998) reported the first successful outcome from the animal model. The contribution of permanent polymer coating in increasing the adverse effects of DES implantation such as delayed healing, late ST, local hypersensitivity reaction, and ISR was confirmed by Busch et al. (2014). Two biostable polymers used for drug-eluting stents, namely PEVA and PBMA, and four biodegradable polymers from the polyesters group, namely PLLA, poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate), poly(4 -hydroxybutyrate) (P(4 HB)), and a polymeric blend of PLLA/P(4 HB) in a ratio of 78 / 22 % (w/w) were chosen for comparison. The material-dependent endothelialization, SMC growth, and thrombogenicity were proved by in vitro tests conducted through cultivating human umbilical venous endothelial cells, human coronary arterial endothelial cells, and human coronary arterial SMCs on the surface of these polymers (Busch et al. 2014). Biodegradation implies the dispersion of polymeric materials as a consequence of macromolecular degradation (Generali et al. 2014; Vert 1989; Vert et al. 1992). Degradation is to be used for those ex vivo mechanisms, whereas biodegradation is restricted to all in vivo mechanism mediated in cells (Onuma and Serruys 2011; Vert 2009). PLA and PGA are of two most ubiquitous polymers that have been exploited in the second-generation DES. Huang et al. (2010) reported promising clinical results on their patented stent (Venkatraman et al. 2008). This is a dual drug-eluting stent (DDES) with two pharmaceutical drugs: one acts as an anti-proliferative (sirolimus) and the other acts as an anti-thrombotic (triflusal). Drugs were loaded in the biodegradable polymer matrix contributing together as coating layers on a CoCr stent. In this study, poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PDLGA) was employed as a drug carrier for its known properties of biocompatibility, biodegradability, and good mechanical strength (Huang et al. 2010). This 2 -layered dual-drug-coated stent was prepared by spray coating a biodegradable polymer loaded with dual drugs on the metallic frame. The presence of triflusal as a drug agent in the polymer accelerated the polymer breakdown. The in vivo results showed promising results from the combination of two drugs on the stent surface in comparison to a bare metal stent, a sirolimus-coated polymer-coated stent, and a pure polymer-coated stent (controls) (Huang et al. 2010). Problems with using polymers as an outer layer of stent have been reported as well. First, the expansion of the stent during deployment may expose the polymer on the outer layer to great amounts of stress that leads to mechanical damage such as cracks, waviness, depressions, and peeling as reported by others (Basalus et al. 2009; Basalus et al. 2012; Otsuka et al. 2007; Wiemer et al. 2010). Second, there might be inflammatory and hypersensitivity reactions of body immune system to some polymers. Biodegradation does not necessarily mean that no sensitivity would not happen as van Beuskeom et al. (2000) have found. They reported the extensive inflammatory responses of these polymers and their fibrocellular proliferation except for poly(metacryloyl phosphorylcholine lauryl methacrylate). Further in a study by van der Giessen et al. (1992), they undertook a comparative study for the rate of thrombosis and neointimal formation in synthetic biodegradable poly (methyl methacrylate) coated and uncoated stainless steel-based stents in animal models (Guildford et al. 2010). Finally, polymers may delay the growth of vascular endothelial cells (Lancaster et al. 2012); all disadvantages that further led to the idea of polymer-free stents (Hu et al. 2015). Further improvement on the performance of DESs will require the well-selected polymer coating matrices with the properties of degradability and low inflammatory response during polymer degradation to allow a quick and complete DES endothelialization (Guildford et al. 2010).|$|R

50|$|All sutures are {{classified}} as either absorbable or non-absorbable {{depending on whether the}} body will naturally degrade and absorb the suture material over time. Absorbable suture materials include the original catgut as well as the newer synthetics <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid,</b> polylactic acid, polydioxanone, and caprolactone. Absorbable (or resorbable) medical devices such as sutures are made of polymers. The polymer materials are based on one or more of five cyclic monomers: glycolide, l-lactide, p-dioxanone, trimethylene carbonate and ε-caprolactone.|$|E
50|$|Glycolic acid is {{a useful}} {{intermediate}} for organic synthesis, {{in a range of}} reactions including: oxidation-reduction, esterification and long chain polymerization.

Commercially, important derivatives include the methyl (CAS# 96-35-5) and ethyl (CAS# 623-50-7) esters which are readily distillable (b.p. 147-9 and 158-159 °C, respectively), unlike the parent acid. The butyl ester (b.p. 178-186 °C) is a component of some varnishes, being desirable because it is nonvolatile and has good dissolving properties.|$|E
5000|$|One of the company's {{long term}} {{investments}} is in <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA).

[...] The company has stated a strategy of committing to invest in PGA for a long period, patiently waiting for market demand to develop. To manufacture PGA, the company invested 100 million in a manufacturing facility in Belle, West Virginia to be located nearby a Dupont plant that produces glycolic acid, a primary feedstock for PGA.|$|E
50|$|They {{are broken}} down by various {{processes}} including hydrolysis (<b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid)</b> and proteolytic enzymatic degradation. Depending on the material, the process can be from ten days to eight weeks. They are used in patients who cannot return for suture removal, or in internal body tissues. In both cases, they will hold the body tissues together long enough to allow healing, but will disintegrate {{so that they do}} not leave foreign material or require further procedures. Initially, there is a foreign body reaction to the material, which is transient. After complete resorption only connective tissue will remain. Occasionally, absorbable sutures can cause inflammation and be rejected by the body rather than absorbed.|$|E
5000|$|Lycasin is a {{trade name}} given by Roquette for {{hydrogenated}} glucose syrup (hydrolysed starch).

Depending on the dextrose equivalent (DE) of the syrup used in the hydrolysis, a variety of products can be made, with the name [...] "lycasin" [...] normally being reserved for lycasin 80/55 (80 referring to the dry content and 55 to the dextrose equivalent). The other grades (e.g. 75/60 and 80/33) {{are referred to as}} Polysorb, but {{should not be confused with}} the <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> suture of the same name which is produced by a different company.|$|E
50|$|The {{next great}} leap {{came in the}} twentieth century. The {{chemical}} industry drove production of the first synthetic thread in the early 1930s, which exploded into production of numerous absorbable and non-absorbable synthetics. The first synthetic absorbable was based on polyvinyl alcohol in 1931. Polyesters were developed in the 1950s, and later the process of radiation sterilization was established for catgut and polyester. <b>Polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> was discovered in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s. Today, most sutures are made of synthetic polymer fibers. Silk and, rarely, gut sutures are the only materials still in use from ancient times. In fact, gut sutures have been banned in Europe and Japan owing to concerns regarding Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. Silk suture is still used, mainly to secure surgical drains.|$|E
5000|$|Suture thread is {{made from}} {{numerous}} materials. The original sutures were made from biological materials, such as catgut suture and silk. Most modern sutures are synthetic, including the absorbables <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid,</b> polylactic acid, Monocryl and polydioxanone {{as well as the}} non-absorbables nylon, polyester, PVDF and polypropylene. The FDA first approved triclosan-coated sutures in 2002; they have been shown to reduce the chances of wound infection. Sutures come in very specific sizes and may be either absorbable (naturally biodegradable in the body) or non-absorbable. Sutures must be strong enough to hold tissue securely but flexible enough to be knotted. They must be hypoallergenic and avoid the [...] "wick effect" [...] that would allow fluids and thus infection to penetrate the body along the suture tract.|$|E
5000|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} and biomaterials {{are also}} of significant interest for tissue engineering and regeneration. Tissue engineering {{is the ability}} to regenerate tissue with the help of artificial materials. The perfection of such systems can be used to grow tissues and cells in vitro or use a biodegradable scaffold to construct new structures and organs in vitro. For these uses, a biodegradable scaffold is obviously preferred as it reduces the risk of immunological reaction and rejection of the foreign object. While many of the more advanced systems are not ready for human therapeutics, there is significant positive research in animal studies. For example, it was possible to successfully grow rat smooth muscle tissue on a polycaprolactone/polylactide scaffold. Further research and development may allow for this technology to be used for tissue replacement, support, or enhancement in humans. One of the ultimate goals of tissue engineering is the creation of organs, such as the kidney, from basic constituents. A scaffolding is necessary to grow the entity into a functioning organ, after which the polymer scaffold would degrade and be safely eliminated from the body. There are reports of using <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> and polylactic acid to engineer vascular tissue for heart repair. [...] The scaffold can be used to help create undamaged arteries and vessels.|$|E
50|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within {{the human body}} to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower rate of degradation compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.Scaffolds may also be constructed from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), is one of the possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E
50|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).Fenestrations in the wrapping material are created at the insertion sites of the extraocular muscles, allowing the attached muscles to be in contact with the implant and improving implant vascularization. Drilling 1 mm holes into the implant at the muscle insertion sites is performed to facilitate vascularization of hydroxyapatite implants. Tenon’s fascia is drawn over the implant and closed in one or two layers. The conjunctiva is then sutured. A temporary ocular conformer is inserted at the completion of the pro- cedure and is worn until the patient receives a prosthesis 4 to 8 weeks after surgery.An elective secondary procedure is required to place the coupling peg or post in those patients who desire improved prosthetic motility. That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, but they have been used to conﬁrm vascularization before peg insertion. Under local anesthesia, a conjunctival incision is created at the peg insertion site. A hole is created into the porous implant to allow insertion of the peg or post.The prosthesis is then modiﬁed to receive the peg or post. Some surgeons have preplaced coupling posts in porous polyethylene implants at the time of enucleation. The post may spontaneously expose or is externalized in a later procedure via a conjunctival incision.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Early-stage oral or oropharyngeal carcinomas {{are often}} treated with {{surgical}} resection. Resulting wounds {{that are too}} large for primary closure can be covered with skin grafts or patches made from various biomaterials. Recently, <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> sheets {{have been used for}} this purpose. Methods: We treated six patients with large wounds resulting from the resection of oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma by grafting <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> sheet patches. All patients were initially treated at the National Cancer Center East Hospital from March 2010 through July 2012. After mucosal resection, the wounds were covered with <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> sheet patches attached with fibrin glue. Oral intake was started 4 days after surgery. Results: Mucosal resection was the initial treatment in seven patients (five with oral squa-mous cell carcinoma and two with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma). The <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> sheet patches became detached in two patients (on the day of surgery and on post-operative day 6), who then required large doses of analgesics. A patient who underwent tooth extraction also required large doses of analgesics. The other four patients required only small doses of analgesics. One patient had bleeding at the surgical site. No adverse effects wer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe high retear rates {{after surgery}} for {{irreparable}} rotator cuff tears {{can be explained}} by the healing capacity potential of tendons and the native rotator cuff enthesis characterised by complex morphological structures, called direct insertion. Many experimental researches have focused on biologically augmenting the rotator cuff reconstruction and improving tendon–bone healing of the rotator cuff. The results of the experimental study showed that the <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> sheet scaffold material allows for the regeneration of not only tendon-to-tendon, but also tendon-to-bone interface in an animal model. We performed a clinical study of the arthroscopic <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> sheet patch graft used for the repair of irreparable rotator cuff tears. One-year clinical results of the repair of irreparable rotator cuff tears by arthroscopic patch graft with a <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> sheet demonstrated improved shoulder function and a significantly lower retear rate, compared with patients treated with a fascia lata patch...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} graft copolymers with a main chain of acrylic nature; the grafts attached to the backbone are composed of a biodegradable polyester, <b>poly(glycolic</b> <b>acid),</b> with well-known applications in medicine. The synthesis {{has been carried out}} by radical polymerisation of methyl acrylate and <b>poly(glycolic</b> <b>acid)</b> chains that have been functionalised previously with a methacrylic residue. These functionalised chains have been synthesised by the ring opening polymerisation of the cyclic dimer of glycolic acid, glycolide, using a functionalised initiator. All the products have been characterised spectroscopically. The thermal properties of the copolymers have also been measured. These results indicate that the copolymers have a biphasic morphology...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nerve allografting is {{regarded}} as a treatment of choice in large neural tissue losses preventing repair by primary anastomosis. In these cases, a synthetic <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> tube is an alternative for nerve grafting. On the other hand, several studies have emphasized the importance of neurotrophic factors on neural regeneration, including substances with potential to optimize neural regeneration, especially the GM 1, an neurotrophic enhancer factor. Objective: to compare, in rats, the neural regeneration degree using histological analysis, regenerated myelinized axons count, and functional analysis with the use of neurotube and GM 1. Methods: This assessment was performed by interposing allograft (group A), <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> tube (group B) and <b>polyglycolic</b> <b>acid</b> tube associated to GM 1 (group C) on 5 -mm sciatic nerve defects. Results: Neuroma formation was found only on group A. Groups A and C showed similar histological patterns, except for the regenerated axons on group C, which were shown to be better organized and myelinized than in group A. Conclusion: on functional recovery, no statistically significant difference was found for the three groups, despite of qualitative and quantitative histological differences found...|$|E
