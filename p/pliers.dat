Affymetrix exon arrays are a commercialized platform used to detect alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale.

However, a systematic comparison of these two algorithms on their effects on high-level analysis of the arrays {{has not yet been}} reported. Results In this study, we showed that <b>PLIER</b> summarization led to over-estimation of gene-level expression changes, relative to exon-level expression changes, in two-group comparisons. Consequently, it led to detection of substantially more skipped exons on up-regulated genes, as well as substantially more included (i. e., non-skipped) exons on down-regulated genes. In contrast, this bias was not observed for RMA-summarized data. By using a published human tissue dataset, we compared the tissue-specific expression and splicing detected by Affymetrix exon arrays with those detected based on expressed sequence databases. We found the tendency of <b>PLIER</b> was not supported by the expressed sequence data.

40|$|Affymetrix microarrays {{have become}} a {{standard}} experimental platform for studies of mRNA expression profiling. Their success is due, in part, to the multiple oligonucleotide features (probes) against each transcript (probe set). This multiple testing allows for more robust background assessments and gene expression measures, and has permitted the development of many computational methods to translate image data into a single normalized "signal" for mRNA transcript abundance. There are now many probe set algorithms that have been developed, with a gradual movement away from chip-by-chip methods (MAS 5), to project-based model-fitting methods (dCHIP, RMA, others). Data interpretation is often profoundly changed by choice of algorithm, with disoriented biologists questioning what the "accurate" interpretation of their experiment is. Here, we summarize the debate concerning probe set algorithms. We provide examples of how changes in mismatch weight, normalizations, and construction of expression ratios each dramatically change data interpretation. All interpretations {{can be considered as}} computationally appropriate, but with varying biological credibility. We also illustrate the performance of two new hybrid algorithms (<b>PLIER,</b> GC-RMA) relative to more traditional algorithms (dCHIP, MAS 5, Probe Profiler PCA, RMA) using an interactive power analysis tool. <b>PLIER</b> appears superior to other algorithms in avoiding false positives with poorly performing probe sets. Based on our interpretation of the literature, and examples presented here, we suggest that the variability in performance of probe set algorithms is more dependent upon assumptions regarding "background", than on calculations of "signal".

30|$|Allene oxide synthase is a {{key enzyme}} in the JA biosynthetic pathway (Turner et al. 2002). The Affymetrix rice array {{contains}} two paralogous genes that encode allene oxide synthase. One of them (Affymetrix probe set ID, Os. 8266.1.A 1 _at) {{was found to be}} upregulated ~ 2.5 -fold by the <b>PLIER</b> algorithm and ~ 1.95 -fold by RMA but was not identified at p[*]<[*] 0.05. The other gene (Affymetrix probe set ID, Os. 7678.1.S 1 _at) has been earlier shown to be involved in JA biosynthesis in rice (Mei et al. 2006). It was identified as being upregulated by the <b>PLIER</b> algorithm (~ 1.7 -fold at p[*]<[*] 0.05) but was not selected as being upregulated using RMA. We assessed the expression of this gene (Os. 7678.1.S 1 _at) by quantitative real-time PCR and found that it was upregulated ~ 2.0 -fold at p[*]<[*] 0.05 following ClsA treatment (Fig.  3; Supplementary Table S 2, for the list of primers). Furthermore, as described above, pathway analysis had revealed the upregulation of two 12 -oxophytodienoate reductase genes (OsOPR 2, Os. 50513.1.S 1 _at; OsOPR 1, Os. 8778.1.S 1 _a_at) that are predicted to be involved in JA biosynthesis (Table  3). ClsA treatment also induced the expression of two paralogous rice chitinase (PR- 3) genes whose Arabidopsis ortholog is involved in a JA-mediated defense pathway (Thomma et al. 1998). ClsA treatment led to increased expression of a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH- 1 gene which has been postulated to modulate methyl JA responses (Ahlfors et al. 2004).

40|$|Abstract Background Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays {{are popular}} {{platforms}} for expression profiling in {{two types of}} studies: detection of differential expression computed by p-values of t -test and estimation of fold change between analyzed groups. There are many different preprocessing algorithms for summarizing Affymetrix data. The main goal of these methods is to remove effects of non-specific hybridization, and to optimally combine information from multiple probes annotated to the same transcript. The methods are benchmarked by comparison with reference methods, such as quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Results We present a comprehensive analysis of agreement between Affymetrix GeneChip and qRT-PCR results. We analyzed the influence of filtering by fraction Present calls introduced by J. N. McClintick and H. J. Edenberg (2006) and 2 mapping procedures: updated probe sets definitions proposed by Dai et al. (2005) and our "naive mapping" method. Because of evolution of genome sequence annotations since the time when microarrays were designed, we also studied {{the effect of the}} annotation release date. These comparisons were prepared for 6 popular preprocessing algorithms (MAS 5, <b>PLIER,</b> RMA, GC-RMA, MBEI, and MBEImm) in the 2 above-mentioned types of studies. We used data sets from 6 independent biological experiments. As a measure of reproducibility of microarray and qRT-PCR values, we used linear and rank correlation coefficients. Conclusions We show that filtering by fraction Present calls increased correlations for all 6 preprocessing algorithms. We observed the difference in performance of PM-MM and PM-only methods: using MM probes increased correlations in fold change studies, but PM-only methods proved to perform better in detection of differential expression. We recommend using GC-RMA for detection of differential expression and <b>PLIER</b> for estimation of fold change.

We have made recent improvements to caCORRECT, including {{the development of a}} model-based data-replacement strategy and integration with typical microarray workflows via caCORRECT's web portal and caBIG grid services. In this report, we demonstrate that caCORRECT improves the reproducibility and reliability of experimental results across several common Affymetrix microarray platforms. caCORRECT represents an advance over state-of-art quality control methods such as Harshlighting, and acts to improve gene expression calculation techniques such as <b>PLIER,</b> RMA and MAS 5. 0, because it incorporates spatial information into outlier detection as well as outlier information into probe normalization. The ability of caCORRECT to recover accurate gene expressions from low quality probe intensity data is assessed using a combination of real and synthetic artifacts with PCR follow-up confirmation and the affycomp spike in data. The caCORRECT tool can be accessed at the website: [URL]. Results We demonstrate that (1) caCORRECT's artifact-aware normalization avoids the undesirable global data warping that happens when any damaged chips are processed without caCORRECT; (2) When used upstream of RMA, <b>PLIER,</b> or MAS 5. 0, the data imputation of caCORRECT generally improves the accuracy of microarray gene expression in the presence of artifacts more than using Harshlighting or not using any quality control; (3) Biomarkers selected from artifactual microarray data which have undergone the quality control procedures of caCORRECT {{are more likely to be}} reliable, as shown by both spike in and PCR validation experiments. Finally, we present a case study of the use of caCORRECT to reliably identify biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma, yielding two diagnostic biomarkers with potential clinical utility, PRKAB 1 and NNMT. Conclusions caCORRECT is shown to improve the accuracy of gene expression, and the reproducibility of experimental results in clinical application.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the changes associated with metabolic pathways during ClsA-induced HR, pathway analysis was performed using RiceCYC 1.2 Software ([URL] For this analysis, we selected genes that were identified as being differentially expressed at ≥ 1.5 -fold and p[*]≤[*] 0.05 by both <b>PLIER</b> and RMA algorithms. Out of the 862 genes deemed to be differentially expressed (363 upregulated and 499 downregulated), we could retrieve the requisite locus information for only 709 genes from the TIGR rice genome database. Out of these, 197 genes could be associated with different metabolic pathways using the RiceCYC 1.2. Interestingly, two paralogous genes encoding putative 12 -oxo phytodienoate reductases that are predicted to be involved in JA biosynthesis as well as four different glutathione-S-transferases were upregulated following ClsA treatment (Supplementary Table S 1). A number of plant glutathione-S-transferases have been reported to be upregulated following pathogen infection (Marrs 1996), and silencing of the gene for a glutathione-S-transferase of Nicotiana benthamiana has been shown to lead to enhanced susceptibility to Colletotrichum orbiculare (Dean et al. 2005). Five putative lipases that are predicted to be involved in triacylglycerol degradation were downregulated.

The second alteration was the removal of all but two decapitations. Initially, several weapons in the game could decapitate enemies, but with the exception of two plot-important decapitations, all such executions were removed. Thirdly, the <b>pliers</b> executions were changed. Originally, a gruesome execution with a <b>pliers</b> involved ripping off the enemy's testicles, whilst a level 2 execution involved tearing open his throat.

Originally, the game had a rating system similar to the first game, whereby the player was rated based on speed and severity of execution types. To achieve a maximum rating, one had to perform a set number of gruesome executions in each level. This rating system was completely removed from the edited version.|$|E

40|$|Probes with runs of 4 or more guanines (G-stacks) {{in their}} {{sequences}} can exhibit {{a level of}} hybridisation that is unrelated to the expression levels of the mRNA that {{they are intended to}} measure. This is most likely caused by the formation of G-quadruplexes, where inter-probe guanines form Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, which probes with G-stacks are capable of forming. We demonstrate that for a specific microarray data set using the Human HG_U 133 A Affymetrix GeneChip and RMA normalisation there is significant bias in the expression levels, the fold change and the correlations between expression levels. These effects grow more pronounced as the number of G-stack probes in a probe set increases. Approximately 14 % of the probe sets are directly affected. The analysis was repeated for a number of other normalisation pipelines and two, FARMS and <b>PLIER,</b> minimised the bias to some extent. We estimate that approximately 15 % of the data sets deposited in the GEO database are susceptible to the effect. The inclusion of G-stack probes in the affected data sets can bias key parameters used in the selection and clustering of genes. The elimination of these probes from any analysis in such affected data sets outweighs the increase of noise in the signal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A new {{microarray}} platform (GeneChip ® Exon 1. 0 ST) {{has recently}} been developed by Affymetrix [URL]. This microarray platform changes the conventional view of transcript analysis since it allows {{the evaluation of the}} expression level of a transcript by querying each exon component. The Exon 1. 0 ST platform does however raise some issues regarding the approaches to be used in identifying genome-wide alternative splicing events (ASEs). In this study an exon-level data analysis workflow is dissected in order to detect limit and strength of each step, thus modifying the overall workflow and thereby optimizing the detection of ASEs. Results This study was carried out using a semi-synthetic exon-skipping benchmark experiment embedding a total of 268 exon skipping events. Our results point out that summarization methods (RMA, <b>PLIER)</b> do not affect the efficacy of statistical tools in detecting ASEs. However, data pre-filtering is mandatory if the detected number of false ASEs are to be reduced. MiDAS and Rank Product methods efficiently detect true ASEs but they suffer from the lack of multiple test error correction. The intersection of MiDAS and Rank Product results efficiently moderates the detection of false ASEs. Conclusion To optimize the detection of ASEs we propose the following workflow: i) data pre-filtering, ii) statistical selection of ASEs using both MiDAS and Rank Product, iii) intersection of results derived from the two statistical analyses in order to moderate family-wise errors (FWER). </p...|$|R

Differential expression analysis with <b>PLIER</b> corrected data was performed using AltAnalyze. Searching for over-representation in biochemical pathways revealed cholesterol metabolism being most prominently affected in DUhTP compared to unselected control mice. Furthermore, pathway analysis by AltAnalyze plus PathVisio indicated significant induction of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis {{in the liver}} of DUhTP mice versus unselected control mice. In contrast, gluconeogenesis was partially inactivated as judged from the analysis of hepatic mRNA transcript abundance in DUhTP mice. Analysis of mRNA transcripts related to steroid hormone metabolism inferred elevated synthesis of progesterone and reduced levels of sex steroids. Abundance of steroid delta isomerase- 5 mRNA (Hsd 3 b 5, FC 4. 97) was increased and steroid 17 -alpha-monooxygenase mRNA (Cyp 17 a 1, FC - 11. 6) was massively diminished in the liver of DUhTP mice.

A second human GeneChip HG U 133 Plus 2 was then examined, followed by a plant chip, Arabidopsis thaliana, and then a bacterium chip, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparisons have also been made between the use of widely recognised algorithms RMA and <b>PLIER</b> for the normalization stage of extracting gene expression from GeneChip data...|$|R
