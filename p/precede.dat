5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must <b>precede</b> the predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order}} to avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately <b>precede</b> the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately <b>precede</b> the predicate.|$|E
5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. The verb {{comes at}} the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers <b>precede</b> the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses <b>precede</b> the verb of the matrix clause.|$|E

5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive <b>precede</b> the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could <b>precede</b> a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both <b>precede</b> and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E

5|$|Anonymous's {{statement}} that Zoltán succeeded {{his father as}} grand prince, or even the idea that Zoltán ever ruled the federation of the Hungarian tribes have also been challenged.

Kristó also says that other Hungarian chroniclers do not make mention of Zoltán's rule, implying that Anonymous only inserted Zoltán into the incompletely preserved list of the grand princes because he knew that all Hungarian monarchs from the House of Árpád descended from him.|$|E
5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German.

Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives <b>precede</b> the noun they modify.|$|E

5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly <b>precede</b> the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E

Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may <b>precede</b> the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E

5|$|This {{one-shot}} {{issue was}} published in March 1993. The story was originally published in graphic-novel form in 1991 as Avengers-Deathtrap: The Vault (1991), but was later reprinted under the Venom label. As a result, the fictional events <b>precede</b> those of Venom: Lethal Protector and are referenced in that series. The issue follows a supervillain prison outbreak at The Vault, led by Brock, that allows the inmates to overrun the prison and take its staff hostage. The Avengers and Freedom Force attempt to defeat the villains in a race against time because the prison's final fail-safe, a powerful explosive device, has been activated by Vault warden Truman Marsh.

5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes <b>precede</b> the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
