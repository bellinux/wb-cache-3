The {{rest of the}} characters are depicted as puppets, made by the Neal Scanlan Studio and Wit Puppets. The show was filmed and produced at 380 Studios, a purpose-built studio near Reykjavík equipped with high-end HDTV production facilities {{and one of the}} largest green screens in the world. The <b>production</b> <b>floor</b> area is 1,800 square meters. The budget for each episode was approximately ISK 70,000,000 (US$1 million), about five times the average cost for a children's television programme at the time, making it [...] "the most expensive children's show in the world" [...] according to Scheving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} {{took place}} at Accent Signage Systems, a sign-making business located in the Bryn Mawr neighborhood of Minneapolis, which is bisected by Interstate 394. Andrew John Engeldinger, {{an employee of the}} firm, was called over to the office of operations director John Souter. Before going to the executive offices, Engeldinger first went to his car, apparently to retrieve a Glock 19 9mm handgun. When he was informed by Souter that he was losing his job, Engeldinger responded with [...] "Oh, really?" [...] and took out the handgun from his holster. A struggle over the handgun ensued between Engeldinger, Souter, and top manager Rami Cooks; gunshots severely wounded Souter and fatally wounded Cooks. Engeldinger then left Souter's office, shooting and killing company founder Reuven Rahamim, who was stepping out of his office, which was next to Souter's. He then left the executive offices and entered a sign-display area, killing Jacob Beneke, an employee from Maple Grove. Engeldinger then moved on to the loading dock area, where he shot and killed a second employee, Ronald Edberg of Brooklyn Center. He also killed Keith Basinski, a UPS driver who was on a delivery, as he was seated in his truck. Engeldinger then entered the <b>production</b> <b>floor</b> and continued firing, fatally wounding production manager Eric Rivers and grazing another employee.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Abundant, eco-friendly, {{continuous}} and free, source of day lighting has a potential {{to reduce the}} consumption of 20 % of lighting load of a garment factory. Various models of daylight harvesting have been experimented with in various <b>production</b> <b>floors</b> with great success. Apart from obvious advantage of energy conservation, harvesting of sunlight has many industrial advantages as well as positive impact on psychological and physiological health of workers in apparel sector. Implementing daylight harvesting solution has many challenges starting from consistency of the sunlight throughout the day & round the year, penetration of light in vertical structure &deep regions, apart from commonly known issues of glare and radiation.

40|$|A factory {{consists}} of numerous production workstations, multiple production lines and many <b>production</b> <b>floors.</b> Due to {{the characteristics of}} just-in-time and make-to-order mode manufacturing, small batches of production materials are required for production lines within {{a short period of}} time in order to facilitate daily production operations. In this paper, a real-time warehouse operation planning system (R-WOPS) for solving small batch replenishment problems is described. Through using R-WOPS, real-time production and warehouse operations are monitored by radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, and a genetic algorithm (GA) technique is applied to formulate feasible small batch replenishment solutions. Simulation tests show that R-WOPS generates pick-up and delivery route plans for small batch replenishment orders very efficiently. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
