The altarpiece of Mettercia is installed in the chapel, hence the other name. Parents of the Hungarian primate Juraj Szatmary had it built, hence the chapel is also called the Chapel of Szatmary.

40|$|Fluid flow {{behaviour}} <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> is of increasing interest {{due to the}} advantages and expanding use of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (known as µPADs). Applications are expanding from those which often have low sample fluid volumes, such as diagnostic testing, to those {{with an abundance of}} sample fluid, such as water quality testing. The rapid development of enhanced features in μPADs, along with a need for increased sensitivity and specificity in the embedded chemistry requires understanding the passively-driven fluid motion <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> to enable precise control and consistency of the devices. It is particularly important to understand the influence of parameters associated with larger fluid volumes and to quantify their impact. Here, we experimentally investigate the impacts of several properties during imbibition <b>in</b> <b>paper,</b> including geometry (larger width and length) and the surrounding conditions (humidity and temperature) using abundant fluid reservoirs. Fluid flow velocity <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> was found to vary with temperature and width, but not with length of the paper strip and humidity for the conditions we tested.
