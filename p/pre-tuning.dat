Both studio and {{transmitter}} facilities were co-sited {{in the same}} building, a 2,000 sq ft concrete structure designed to withstand hurricane winds of 150 miles per hour and earthquakes of magnitude 3 on the Richter scale. The entire plant was self-sufficient, with its own 450-kilowatt diesel generator and a 2,500-gallon water catchment system with filtering unit and compression tank. The station had a powerful transmitter, a Continental Electronics 418-D-2, 100-kilowatt high level plate modulated, with an automatic servo system, allowing <b>pre-tuning</b> of channels in use.

40|$|AbstractSuperconducting quarter-wave {{resonators}} (QWRs) {{will be used}} in the superconducting linac upgrade in {{the frame}} of the HIE-ISOLDE project at CERN. The QWRs are made of bulk copper and have their inner surface covered with sputtered niobium. Their resonant frequency is 101. 28 MHz at 4. 5 K. Each cavity will be equipped with a tuning system to both minimize the forward power and compensate the frequency variations during production and beam operation. After a careful examination of all contributors to the frequency variation, we decomposed them into two components: frequency shift and its uncertainties. A <b>pre-tuning</b> step was subsequently added to the production sequence prior to niobium sputtering to accommodate the frequency shift mainly due to mechanical tolerances during substrate production, substrate surface treatment, niobium sputtering and cooldown process. To this end, the length of the QWR was chosen as a free parameter for the <b>pre-tuning.</b> Consequently the tuning system needs only to compensate the frequency uncertainties and Lorentz force detuning, thus its design has been largely simplified and its production cost was reduced by 80 % comparing to its previous version. We have successfully applied this tuning scheme to five HIE-ISOLDE QWRs and the measured tuning error was 2. 4 ± 1. 9 kHz. This is well consistent with our calculations and well recoverable by the current simplified tuning system. It is worth noticing that the <b>pre-tuning</b> method only involves one-time measurement of the cavity׳s resonant frequency and its outer conductor length. This paper focuses on HIE-ISOLDE high-β QWR, but the method can be applied to HIE-ISOLDE low-β QWRs and other variants of QWR-like cavities...|$|E

In this paper we identify a local linear model only for the constrained first phase, based on which a predictive controller is used to track a suitable engagement signal. The robustness of this controller in the latter two phases is guaranteed by making the constraints inactive and <b>pre-tuning</b> the control parameters based on its closed loop formulation and applying robust stability theorem. This controller is then implemented in real-time on a wet-clutch test setup and is shown to achieve optimal engagement...|$|E

We propose an oracle mechanism delivering grain sizes on-the-fly. It takes historical runtime measurements for different patch and grain sizes as well as the traverse's operations into account, and it yields reasonable speedups.

DBN is an {{interesting}} class of NN, when trained using unlabeled data it works as a features selector, and when trained with labeled data it acts as a classifier. In [273] DBN is used to perform both of these two tasks. More specifically, an auto-encoder is first used for dimensionality reduction. The proposed DBN is composed of multi-layers of RBM and a layer of BP NN. Unsupervised training is performed on every layer of RBM and the final output is fed to the BP NN for classification. Pre-training and <b>pre-tuning</b> the DBN with auto-encoder over 10 iterations, result in an accuracy of 92.10 %, FP of 1.58 % and TP of 92.20 %.

This investigation is done by using input-output-parameter relationship. Then these re-lations are transformed by using iterated integration. They are combined with an original numer-ical derivative estimation based on distribution theory which gives explicit point-wise derivative estimation formulas for each given order. Then new approximate relations, linking block of para-meters and outputs (without derivative) are obtained.

However, an important difficulty {{is to determine}} a priori which probability value is the best suited for a given problem. Besides, {{there is a growing}} demand for up-to-date optimization software, applicable by a non-specialist within an industrial development environment. These issues encourage us to propose an adaptive evolutionary algorithm that includes a mechanism to modify the mutation probability without external control. This process of dynamic adaptation happens while the algorithm is searching for the problem solution. This eliminates a very expensive computational phase related to the <b>pre-tuning</b> of the algorithmic parameters. We compare the performance of our adaptive proposal against traditional genetic algorithms with fixed parameter values in a numerical way.

We also present the architecture of a system that automates the tuning process; it includes several <b>pre-tuning</b> steps that partition and instrument the program, followed by the actual tuning and the post-tuning assembly of the individuallyoptimized parts. Our system, called PEAK, achieves fast tuning speed by measuring a small number of invocations of each code section, instead of the whole-program execution time, as in common solutions. Compared to these solutions PEAK reduces tuning time from 2. 19 hours to 5. 85 minutes on average, while achieving similar program performance.

40|$|The SPIRAL 2 {{project is}} based on a {{multi-beam}} driver facility in order to allow both ISOL and low-energy in-flight techniques to produce intense radioactive ion beams (RIB) in a new Facility. A superconducting linac capable of accelerating 5 -mA deuterons up to 40 MeV is used to bombard both thick and thin targets. These primary beams will be used for the RIB production by several reaction mechanisms (fusion, fission, etc.) The production of high intensity RIB will be based on fission of uranium target induced by neutrons.

40|$|The common cuckoo {{has several}} host-specific races, {{each with a}} {{distinctive}} egg that tends to match its host's eggs. Here, we show that the host-race specializing on reed warblers also has a host-specific nestling adaptation. In playback experiments, the nestling cuckoos responded specifically to the reed warbler's distinctive ‘churr’ alarm (given when a predator is near the nest), by reducing begging calls (likely to betray their location) and by displaying their orange-red gape (a preparation for defence). When reed warbler-cuckoos were cross-fostered and raised by two other regular cuckoo hosts (robins or dunnocks), they {{did not respond to}} the different alarms of these new foster-parents. Instead, they retained a specific response to reed warbler alarms but, remarkably, increased both calling and gaping. This suggests innate <b>pre-tuning</b> to reed warbler alarms, but with exposure necessary for development of the normal silent gaping response. By contrast, cuckoo chicks of another host-race specializing on redstarts showed no response to either redstart or reed warbler alarms. If host-races are restricted to female cuckoo lineages, then chick-tuning in reed warbler-cuckoos must be under maternal control. Alternatively, some host-races might be cryptic species, not revealed by the neutral genetic markers studied so far...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine differences between pre- and post-pubescent males and females in quadriceps (vastus medialis; VM) and hamstrings (medial hamstrings and biceps femoris; HAMS) muscular activation patterns via the root mean square of surface electromyography (SEMG) during self-initiated vertical jump landing. Fifty-eight subjects, divided into age and gender groupings, were compared on kinematic variables during pre-landing (100 msec preceeding initial ground contact), post-landing (100 msec following initial ground contact), and initial-contact-to-maximum-knee-flexion stages. Kinematic variables investigated were (1) SEMG values during each stage of the vertical-jump landing; (2) Co-contraction ratios (CCR), which represented the ratio of normalized hamstrings’ activity to normalized quadriceps’ activity; and, (3) knee angle at initial contact. Results indicated (1) no significant gender differences in variables measured; and, (2) significant developmental level differences. Post-pubescent subjects displayed greater HAMS acitivity and CCR values in the pre-landing stage relative to post-landing stages, indicating that post-pubescent subjects had a greater level of hamstrings co-contraction prior to landing than pre-pubescent subjects. Conversely, pre-pubescent subjects displayed greater post-landing and initial-contact-to-maximum-knee-flexion ratios, indicating a greater level of hamstrings’ co-contraction during post-landing stages than post-pubescent subjects. There {{were no significant differences in}} knee angle at initial contact. The greater level of hamstrings’ co-activation prior to landing by post-pubescent subjects indicated that they used a strategy of <b>pre-tuning</b> the hamstrings prior to landing (more CNS pre-activation) to control the ground reaction forces and anterior tibial displacement experienced by the knee during landing. On the other hand, pre-pubescent subjects controlled these forces by having a greater level of hamstrings’ co-activation during landing, which represents more of a reflexive activation in response to ground impact...|$|E
