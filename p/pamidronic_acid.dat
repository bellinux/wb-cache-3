40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the effect of a}} {{biocompatible}} surface coating layer on the magnetic properties of ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticles. Particles were synthesized by laser pyrolysis and fully oxidized to maghemite by acid treatment. The surface of the magnetic nanoparticles was systematically coated with either phosphonate (phosphonoacetic acid or <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid)</b> or carboxylate-based (carboxymethyl dextran) molecules and the binding to the nanoparticle surface was analyzed. Magnetic properties at low temperature show a decrease in coercivity and an increase in magnetization after the coating process. Hysteresis loop displacement after field cooling is significantly reduced by the coating, in particular, for particles coated with <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid,</b> which show a 10 % reduction of the displacement of the loop. We conclude that the chemical coordination of carboxylates and phosphonates reduces the surface disorder and enhances the magnetic properties of ultrasmall maghemite nanoparticles.

40|$|Zoledronic acid (Zometa(R)) is {{a third-generation}} {{nitrogen-containing}} parenteral bisphosphonate indicated {{for the treatment}} of bone metastases due to solid tumours or multiple myeloma and for hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HCM). In patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3 - 4 weeks for up to 15 months significantly reduced the proportion of patients with >= 1 skeletal-related event (SRE), excluding HCM, compared with placebo. In patients with advanced breast cancer or multiple myeloma, the incidence of SREs was similar in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg or <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> 90 mg every 3 - 4 weeks for up to 25 months but, in breast cancer patients, zoledronic acid reduced the risk of SREs, including HCM, by an additional 20 % compared with <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid.</b> In modelled cost-utility studies comparing direct costs based on efficacy and resource-use data from these and/or other trials, results have varied. In the most recent study performed {{from the perspective of the}} UK NHS and modelled over a 10 -year treatment period in women with advanced breast cancer, intravenous zoledronic acid and oral ibandronic acid were dominant over no treatment. Intravenous zoledronic acid was the most cost effective, in terms of incremental costs per QALY gained, followed by oral ibandronic acid, intravenous <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> and intravenous ibandronic acid. Two other modelled analyses in patients with advanced breast cancer, also conducted from the perspective of the NHS, evaluated the cost utility of three bisphosphonate therapies in patients receiving hormonal therapy or intravenous chemotherapy. Analyses were modelled over 14. 3 months (i. e. expected survival) and assumptions varied markedly from results in clinical breast cancer trials. Also, efficacy assumptions for zoledronic acid were not based on clinical trials with the drug. The results of these analyses suggest that oral ibandronic acid is more cost effective than intravenous zoledronic acid and intravenous <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> in terms of incremental cost per QALY gained. In a global, 15 -month modelled cost-effectiveness analysis of patients with advanced prostate cancer, conducted from a third-party perspective, the incremental cost per QALY gained for zoledronic acid versus no treatment was $US 159 _ 200 (year 2000 value), which is about 3 -fold greater than commonly accepted thresholds for cost effectiveness. In conclusion, a recent modelled economic analysis suggests that intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg is dominant relative to no treatment in the management of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer. In contrast, in patients with advanced prostate cancer, the incremental cost per QALY gained for zoledronic acid 4 mg versus no treatment was predicted to be higher than commonly accepted thresholds. Compared with other bisphosphonates in the setting of advanced breast cancer, intravenous zoledronic acid was more cost effective than oral or intravenous ibandronic acid and intravenous <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> in one study, but less cost effective than oral ibandronic acid in another. Further efficacy and economic data comparing intravenous zoledronic acid with oral ibandronic acid are needed. Meanwhile, zoledronic acid appears to be the most cost effective intravenous bisphosphonate for the management of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer and possibly in patients with different types of advanced solid tumours.

The behavior of osteoblasts and osteoclasts on the dual-surface modified and unmodified Ti disc surface were compared in terms of cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation to examine the potential for use in bone regeneration and tissue engineering. The motivation for the immobilization of PDA on nanotube surface was that PDA, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, suppresses the osteoclast activity and improves the osseointegration of TiO 2 nanotubes.|$|E

Methods: Peripheral blood of ten bone metastatic breast cancer patients was collected for serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 expression detection just before and 2 days after PA infusion. Results: Both IGF- 1 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 concentrations decreased after PA treatment for 48 hours (P 20 % decrease recorded 2 days after PA administration. The decrease of IGF- 1 was more significant in breast cancer patients who had received previous hormonotherapy. Moreover, the progression-free survival of first-line chemotherapy treatment of IGF- 1 modified patients was longer than that of IGF- 1 unmodified patients (P= 0. 009).

40|$|Differentiated Approach to Non-Bacterial Osteomyelitis Treatment in Children: the Retrospective Study Results Background. Low {{efficacy}} of the therapy of children with non-bacterial osteomyelitis remains a topical problem of modern pediatrics and rheumatology. Objective: Our aim {{was to assess the}} efficacy and safety of non-bacterial osteomyelitis treatment in children. Methods. A retrospective study of the case records of children with non-bacterial osteomyelitis has been carried out. The therapy efficacy (remission) was assessed by the following criteria: absence of fever, pain, clinically active lesions, laboratory disease activity. Laboratory and radiological methods were carried out during diagnosis of the pathological process, and subsequently every 3 – 6 – 12 months to assess disease activity depending on the initial injury extent of the skeleton. Clinical activity assessment was carried out by means of a visual analogue scale. Results. We analyzed treatment results of 52 children (68 therapy courses) with non-bacterial osteomyelitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were administered to 19 patients, sulfasalazine — to 7, methotrexate — to 9, <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> — to 18, inhibitors of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α  — to 15.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decade, bisphosphonates (BPs) have {{attracted}} increasing attention as a surface modifier for orthopedic and dental implants. Bisphosphonates are stable pyrophosphates that prevent {{the loss of}} bone mass and are used widely to treat a range of diseases with excess bone resorption, such as bone metastasis, hypercalcemia of a malignancy, and Paget’s disease [13 – 16]. In orthopedic implants, the use of BP is expected to promote osteogenesis at the bone tissue/implant interface by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts. BPs were reported to inhibit the differentiation of the osteoclast precursor and the resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts [17, 18]. Furthermore, BPs alter the morphology of osteoclasts, such {{as a lack of}} ruffled border and disruption of the actin ring, both in vitro and in vivo[19, 20]. García-Moreno et al. reported that BPs enhance the proliferation, differentiation, and bone-forming activity of osteoblasts directly [21]. Recently, <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid,</b> a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, was reported to conjugate the titanium surface and stimulate new bone formations around the implant both in vitro and in vivo, which contribute {{to the success of the}} implant technology [22, 23].|$|E
40|$|Ocular {{adverse effects}} of <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> are rare but well documented. Pamidronate, an {{inhibitor}} of bone resorption used primarily {{in the management of}} tumor-induced hypercalcemia and Paget's disease, is reported to cause conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, and infrequently episcleritis and scleritis. It is hypothesized that an allergic or immunologic phenomenon caused by drug-indued immune complex formation is at fault. The reason why the uvea is a target organ is unclear. The acute inflammatory response seems unrelated to the dose of the drug, the way of administration, or the activity of Paget's disease or malignancy. We report two cases of pamidronate-induced posterior uveitis, following the WHO Causality Assessment Guide of Suspected Adverse Reactions. Uveitis and scleritis have been reported in association with a variety of topical, intraocular, periocular, and systemic medications. Seven criteria were proposed to establish causality of adverse events by drugs. Only systemically administered biphosphonates meet all seven criteria. Where pamidronate is currently considered as the drug of choice in diverse strategies, the adverse ocular effects should be well known to physicians in order to make rapid diagnosis and stop the drug causing adverse reaction. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Zoledronic acid, {{a third-generation}} nitrogen-containingbisphosphonate, {{is a highly}} potent {{inhibitor}} of osteo-clast-mediated bone resorption. Zoledronic acid is indicat-ed {{in the treatment of}} malignancy-induced hypercalcemia and as a preventive agent against osteolytic metastases in advanced cancers. A dose of 4 mg of zoledronic acid has been demonstrated to be effective in clinical trials, with su-perior efficacy to that of 90 mg of <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> in treat-ment of patients with malignancy-induced hypercalcemia. 1 The structure of bisphosphonates is based on that of py-rophosphate, an endogenous compound that regulates bone reorganization. These drugs therefore bind with high affin-ity to hydroxyapatite crystals and prevent the effects of os-teoclasts. 2 Bisphosphonates are divided into 2 classes ac-cording to their chemical structure and mechanism of action. The first class consists of non–nitrogen-containing bisphos-phonates (ie, etidronate, clodronate) that are very similar to pyrophosphate and are metabolized into non-hydrolyzable adenosine triphosphate analogs that accumulate inside osteo-clasts, leading to osteoclast apoptosis. The other class con-sists of more potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (ie, zoledronate, pamidronate, alendronate, ibandronate, rise-dronate) that inhibit farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) synthase, an enzyme of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway, leading to the inhibition of prenylation of small γ-glutamyl transpep-tidase proteins in osteoclasts. The resulting decrease in preny-lated protein levels induces osteoclast apoptosis. 3,...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Bone metastases are a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} in cancer patients. Treatment includes bisphosphonates, which are also associated with avascular osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Our aim was to evaluate the correlation between bisphosphonates and ONJ. Patients and Methods. Of the 539 patients with bone metastases treated in our department from June 2002 to December 2006 with i. v. bisphosphonates, eight (1. 5 %) developed ONJ. Results. The eight patients with ONJ had all been given zoledronic acid, and two had also been treated with <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid.</b> In four of the patients, ONJ was diagnosed during treatment, while in the remaining four it was diagnosed several months after therapy with bisphosphonates had ended. Six of these patients received local noninvasive treatment, of whom five progressed. Two showed apparent autolimitation of the disease. The remaining two patients underwent surgical resection and currently show no signs of relapse. All eight ONJ patients presented with various concomitant risk factors such as paradontopathy, dental extraction, or spontaneous avulsion. Conclusions. Our results show that ONJ can appear months after interruption of treatment and that a surgical approach can be used in suitable cases.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the therapeutic approach to patients with Paget's disease of bone over the last 40 years. In the 1960 s, only symptomatic therapy could be given, with control of pain the main objective. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used agents. From 1968 onwards, antiosteoclastic agents became available, including calcitonin, plicamycin (mithramycin) and etidronate (etidronic acid), a first-generation bisphosphonate. Limitations with these agents, including potentially deleterious effects on bone mineralization with etidronate (etidronic acid), has cleared the way for increasingly potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates, including clodronate (clodronic acid), pamidronate (<b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid),</b> alendronate (alendronic acid) and risedronate (risedronic acid). Even more potent bisphosphonates will become available in the near future. With the newer bisphosphonates, there is some hope for long-term remission (if not definitive healing) of pagetic lesions, as well as prevention of long-term complications in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Thus, indications for therapy have been extended to include younger patients to prevent bone deformity of the limbs and skull, leading to secondary osteoarthritis, facial deformities and potentially to sarcoma transformation; as well as to elderly patients to prevent bone fragility, leading to fracture, and pagetic vascular steal syndromes. The increased potency and longer duration of action of newer bisphosphonates more than compensates for their marginally increased cost compared with older bisphosphonates...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients with {{multiple}} myeloma {{and other forms}} of cancer receiving pamidronate via intravenous (IV) infusion at the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada face 2 treatment options: they can have their entire treatment completed at the clinic using traditional IV therapy (e. g. IV bag and pole) or they can have the treatment initiated at the clinic and then return home to complete the treatment utilising a portable and disposable IV therapy device. Objective: To perform a cost analysis of these 2 treatment options. Perspective: Societal. Methods and patients: Data on all patients {{with multiple}} myeloma who attended the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre for pamidronate therapy from November 1, 1997 to October 31, 1998 were collected from clinic records. As almost all of these patients with multiple myeloma completed their IV therapy at home, comparison to clinic-based therapy was based on derived cost estimates. Cost data, where possible, were acquired from the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre's records. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted. Results: In the base-case scenario for the study period, the incremental cost of the infusion device and training in Canadian dollars ($Can; 1998 values) for the 48 patients (299 cycles) who had their infusion initiated at the clinic but completed at home was $Can 15. 50 /cycle ($Can 4636 for the 299 cycles). If these 48 patients had had their entire infusion at the clinic, the incremental costs of overtime treatment, parking, clinic overheads and lost work or leisure time would have been $Can 68. 49 /cycle ($Can 20 477 for the 299 cycles). Therefore, shifting treatment from the clinic to the home resulted in net cost savings to society of $Can 52. 98 /cycle ($Can 15 841 for the 299 cycles). Sensitivity analysis of best- and worst-cost scenarios did not alter the substantive findings although the relative difference between treatment options varied. In the best-case scenario, home treatment was $Can 95. 97 /cycle ($Can 28 696 for the 299 cycles) less costly than clinic treatment, while in the worst-case scenario, home treatment was $Can 17. 19 /cycle ($Can 5141 for the 299 cycles) less costly than clinic treatment. The results also demonstrated that clinic overheads, the cost of a portable and disposable infusion device and the cost of lost work and leisure time had the greatest impact on incremental costs for each treatment option. Conclusion: Subject to study limitations, a significant cost advantage was demonstrated through the home-based treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma. Key issues that must be addressed in future evaluations include the precise determination of clinic overheads, the valuation of lost work and/or leisure time and the direct cost of portable and disposable infusion devices.

40|$|Background: Tooth {{extraction}} is conventionally performed {{without any}} additional tissue manipulation {{and left for}} healing by secondary intention. Maintaining hard and soft tissue volume after tooth extraction may be crucial to achieve a highly aesthetic restoration and it may also facilitate stability of the results on the long-term. Therefor, different approaches have been proposed to eliminate post-extraction ridge reduction. Today, however, no technique seems {{to be able to}} preserve the entire socket volume. Aim/Hypothesis: To evaluate histomorphometrically the influence of local administration of pamidronate, adsorbed on a deproteinized porcine bone substitute, on extraction socket healing. Material and methods: Two American Fox-hound dogs were used within this proof-of-principle study. Following endodontic treatment of the distal root of the three lower premolars, the teeth were hemisected and the mesial roots were extracted flapless. The sockets were then loosely filled, in a split-mouth fashion, with a deproteinized porcine bone substitute in particulate form (Osteobiol Gen-Os; DPB), rehydrated either with sterile saline (control) or 90 mg/ml <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> solution (Aredia; test). Extraction sockets were sealed with connective tissue punches obtained from the palate and secured with sutures. After 4 months of healing, specimens containing the sockets sites and remaining roots were retrieved and histomorphometrically evaluated. Vertical and horizontal ridge changes were evaluated comparing the section containing the remaining root and the corresponding extraction sites. Results: Histological evaluation of the sections revealed significant differences in healing patterns between test and controls. While the latter group presented complete closure of the sockets with newly formed bone, pamidronate treated sites presented with open socket entrances, only sealed with soft connective tissue. Within the socket, control sites presented with various amounts of newly formed bone and no evidence of DPB; limited amounts of bone healing were observed within test sites, that were filled with DPB mainly embedded in connective tissue. Socket (bone) wall loss in a vertical dimension showed only minor differences between tests and controls sites (buccal: – 1. 01 vs – 1. 15 mm; lingual: – 0. 92 vs – 1. 15 mm;). Horizontal bone loss, measured at a level corresponding to 3 mm below the cemento-enamel-junction (CEJ), was nearly three times higher in control sites (2. 19 1. 81 mm vs. – 0. 80 0. 91 mm;), while no differences were observed between groups at a level corresponding to 5 mm below the CEJ. Conclusion and clinical implications: Local administration of pamidronate adsorbed on a deproteinized porcine bone substitute in particulate form appeared to delay extraction socket healing, but may also reduce post-extraction dimensional changes in the alveolar ridge, in terms of horizontal bone loss. Additionally, pamidronate appears to obstruct resorption of the porcine bone substitute...|$|E
40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study all osteonecrosis of the jaws patients treated at the Department of otorhinolaryngology at the HELIOS clinic Bad Saarow between January 2005 and June 2010 were included. 16 patients with osteoradionecrosis (ORN), 15 {{men and one}} woman, as well as 10 patients with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ), seven men and three women were included. Patients with ORN were significantly younger than the patients with BRONJ (56. 7 years vs. 67. 4 years). The most frequent basic illness of the patients with ORN was an oropharyngeal carcinoma in seven cases, a carcinoma of the oral cavity or hypopharyngeal carcinoma in four cases each and one patient was with a mouth floor carcinoma. Radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy was applied in all patients with a mean dose of 64 ± 6 Gy. In addition 11 of the 16 patients underwent surgery. Multiple myeloma as the basic illness in six patients with BRONJ, two patients suffered from a metastastic prostate cancer and one each on metastastic breast or rectal cancer. Most patients were treated with zoledronic acid, <b>pamidronic</b> <b>acid</b> was at second most frequently applied therapy. The most frequent secondary illness was a coronary heart disease, found in half of the patients. Kidney illnesses and diabetes were frequently found too. In patients with BRONJ all secondary illnesses were more common than in patients with ORN. Alcohol abuse affected half and nicotine abuse {{about a third of}} all patients. Both were significantly more frequent in patients with ORN than with BRONJ. The time period between the start of therapy of the basic illness and the onset of therapy of osteonecrosis was nearly 3 years in both groups. It was striking that all ORN and 80 % of the BRONJ were localised in the lower jaw. All patients were initially treated antibiotically, irrespective of the underlying etiology. 20 patients received clindamycin and six patients cefuroxime. In all patients with infected ORN a decortication with sequestrum excision and modelling osteotomy was carried out. After decortication and long time antibiosis the status improved in seven patients. The other nine patients experienced a relapse despite an initially beneficial therapy. Therefore an operative continuity resection of the lower jaw was carried out. This was successful in seven patients, whereas the endosseous infection progressed in the other two patients. The typical first symptom of the patients with BRONJ was a socket in the half of the cases, which did not heal after tooth extraction. In the half of the patients with BRONJ a combined therapy consisting of long-term antibiosis with clindamycin or cefuroxime and operation, including decortication, was carried out successfully. The other five patients got only a local medical treatment due to the advanced stage of the bone infection, which did not lead to a recovery of the findings in the end. Eventually in 14 / 16 (88 %) patients with ORN and 5 / 10 (50 %) patients with BRONJ a cure was achieved. This was regardless of age or gender, secondary illness, abuse, tumor stage, long time antibiosis or time up {{to the development of the}} osteonecrosis. Only two patients with BRONJ died, one after curing and one without a previous recovery of the osteonecrosis. Deaths were unrelated to osteonecrosis or therapy. Histologically distinctive and reproducible reactions of the tissue were found in ORN. The high cytotoxicity of the radiation led to the osteonecrosis, which was replaced by grain tissues after the resorption. Bisphosphonates lead to increased osteogenesis initially, resulting in typically immuring of the Haversian canals and an accompanying reduction of the complete vessel margin. In addition, the presence of actinomyces drusen was characteristically for a BRONJ. Since the ORN and BRONJ represent very serious complications, which require an extensive medical treatment, the central conclusion is the high importance of a primary prevention...|$|E
