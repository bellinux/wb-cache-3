40|$|Mapping of closely spaced, {{parallel}} extensional {{fractures in}} the Guinevere and Sedna Planitia regions of Venus reveals a concentric pattern of fractures {{around the edge}} of the large topographic rise of Western Eistla Regio. We have constructed 13 transects through these closely spaced parallel fractures (CSPF) and find a mean spacing of between 0. 8 and 1. 2 km. A two-dimensional, nonlayered, fracture mechanics computer model for the formation of CSPF is described. For cracks extended by a remote tensile stress the stress intensity factor controls the depth of penetration, which in turn, governs the spacing between adjacent cracks based upon the stress-shadow principle. The stress required to initiate cracks depends upon the strength of the material; thus spacing of CSPF depends only on the physical properties of the <b>preexisting</b> <b>rock</b> mass. Using a new fracture mechanics apparatus designed to simulate Venusian conditions (90 bar CO 2, 450 C) the fracture toughness of basalt was measured for confining pressures up to 20 MPa and for temperature up to 600 C. Fracture toughness was found to increase from 2. 4 MPam 1 / 2 at ambient pressure to 3. 0 MPam 1 / 2 at 10 MPa confining pressure. Fracture toughness showed no clear trend with temperature. The experimental results for fracture toughness suggest that the <b>preexisting</b> <b>rock</b> mass that fits best with observations contains an inverse square distribution of flaws with maximum sizes of only 20 – 80 cm and that a remote tensile stress of 3 – 6 MPa is required to form the observed CSPF...|$|E

50|$|Monazite geochronology is {{generally}} regarded as a powerful tool to reveal metamorphic history. Metamorphism is the mineral change of textural change in <b>preexisting</b> <b>rocks</b> {{in response to a}} change in environment with different temperatures and pressures. It occurs at a temperature above diagenesis (~200 °C) and below melting (>800 °C). The mineral assemblage formed under metamorphism depends on the composition of the parent rock (protolith) and more importantly, the stability of different minerals in varying temperature and pressure (P-T). A set of mineral assemblage that formed under similar temperature and pressure is called metamorphic facies. Actually, most mineral changes during rock burial, uplift, hydrothermal processes and deformation are associated with metamorphic reactions.|$|R
40|$|The Hess Deep rift valley, at {{approximately}} 2 ° 14 ' N, 101 ° 33 ' W, displays exposures of young, lower crustal and upper mantle rocks formed at the nearby, fast­ spreading East Pacific Rise. A seismic refraction experiment was conducted across the Hess Deep rift valley to provide p-wave travel times between sea floor explosives and Ocean Bottom Seismometers. These travel time data were processed with an iterative, damped least-squares, inverse method {{to produce a}} velocity model of the subsurface structure. The resulting velocity contrasts were interpreted as lithologies originating at different depths and/or alteration of the <b>preexisting</b> <b>rock</b> units. Petrologic and bathymet­ric data from previous studies were used, along with the seismic interpretation, to pro­duce a geologic model. The model supports low-angle detachment faulting with serpentinization of peridotite as the preferred mechanism for creating the distribution and exposure of lower crustal and upper mantle rocks within the Hess Deep. In addition to the geologic information gained from this study, linearity limita­tions of the tomographic inversion {{have been shown to}} be dependent on topography. Topography on the scale of the ray paths has been shown to effectively increase or decrease the velocity gradient, as does the Earth-flattening approximation. Valleys decrease the apparent velocity gradient; whereas, the converse is true for hills. If the velocity gradient is already weak (ie. at depths > 500 m in oceanic crust), then further decrease in gradient beneath a valley produces an environment where ray paths are highly sensitive to model change. Consequently, to avoid violating the linearity assump­tion, model changes beneath a valley must be smaller than for a hill or flat topography...|$|E

Reaction of primitive methane with ferric oxides appears to have oxidized the methane to the vein graphite and reduced the ferric oxides to ferrous-ferric oxide (magnetite).

50|$|In geology, a sill is a tabular sheet {{intrusion}} {{that has}} intruded between older layers of sedimentary rock, beds of volcanic lava or tuff, or even along {{the direction of}} foliation in metamorphic rock. The term sill is synonymous with concordant intrusive sheet.

Sills are fed by dikes, except in unusual locations where they form in nearly vertical beds attached directly to a magma source. The rocks must be brittle and fracture to create the planes along which the magma intrudes the parent rock bodies, whether this occurs along preexisting planes between sedimentary or volcanic beds or weakened planes related to foliation in metamorphic rock. These planes or weakened areas allow the intrusion of a thin sheet-like body of magma paralleling the existing bedding planes, concordant fracture zone, or foliations.|$|R

40|$|Electrokinetic {{phenomena}} {{are believed}} to be the most likely origin of electromagnetic signals preceding or accompanying earthquakes. The intensity of the source current due to the electrokinetic phenomena is determined by the fluid flux and the electrokinetic coupling coefficient called streaming current coefficient; therefore, how the coefficient changes before rupture is essential. Here, we show how the electrokinetic coefficients change during the rock deformation experiment up to failure. The streaming current coefficient did not increase before failure, but continued to decrease up to failure, which is explained in terms of the elastic closure of capillary. On the other hand, the streaming potential coefficient, which is the product of the streaming current coefficient and bulk resistivity of the rock, increased at the onset of dilatancy. It may be due to change in bulk resistivity. Our result indicates that the zeta potential of the newly created surface does not change so much from that of the <b>preexisting</b> fluid <b>rock</b> interface...|$|R
40|$|Inversion {{tectonics}} {{represent a}} key process in many orogens worldwide. The related mechanisms of fault reactivation {{and the effects}} of an articulated preshortening setting on thrust and fold development are still challenging questions. Modes and geometries of inversion have been the object of several analogue models. In this work, we analyzed the inﬂ uence of an articulated high-angle preexisting discontinuity in the development of thrusts using sandbox modeling. The model geometry is based on the architecture of the major faults in the Central-Northern Apennines of Italy, where differently oriented Mesozoic–Cenozoic inherited extensional structures are clearly detectable and display contrasting styles of positive inversion tectonics. Quartz-sand is the analogue material adopted to model Mesozoic–Cenozoic sedimentary successions, and glass microbeads represent <b>preexisting</b> fault <b>rocks.</b> The geometry of the segmented preexisting structure is composed of two segments with the same dip (60 °) : one oblique and another orthogonal to the shortening direction. Our results show that different styles of positive inversion tectonics can coexist and that the obliquity angle between inherited structures and the shortening direction is a leading factor controlling the degree of inversion: The oblique segment of the discontinuity exhibits a complete reactivation, whereas along the orthogonal segment, shortcut is the prevalent mechanism. The oblique element, moreover, represents a cross-strike discontinuity that guides the localization and curved geometry of the thrusts, compartmentalizing the defor mation. Our ﬁ ndings can be applied to foldand-thrust belts characterized by the presence of cross-strike discontinuities...|$|R

Three 65 – 90 km long seismic refraction profiles across {{and along the}} valley, acquired {{as part of the}} 2011 Salton Seismic Imaging Project, were analyzed to constrain upper crustal structure and the transition from sediment to underlying crystalline rock. Both first arrival travel-time tomography and frequency-domain full-waveform inversion were applied to provide P-wave velocity models down to ∼ 7 km depth. The valley margins are fault-bounded, beyond which thinner sediment has been deposited on <b>preexisting</b> crystalline <b>rocks.</b> Within the central basin, seismic velocity increases continuously from ∼ 1. 8 km/s sediment at the surface to > 6 km/s crystalline rock with no sharp discontinuity.

This change occurs at ∼ 3 km depth in most of the valley, but at only ∼ 1. 5 km depth in the Salton Sea geothermal field. We interpret progressive metamorphism caused by high heat flow to be creating new crystalline crust throughout the valley at a rate comparable to the ≥ 2 km/Myr sedimentation rate.

The widespread, early Paleozoic Greenland Group graywackes, which are derived from Proterozoic sources, are modeled {{as the source of}} the crustal end-member mixing with mantle-derived mafic magmas to produce the intrusive rocks. Four different types of models are applied to the isotopic and trace-element (Rb, Sr, Ba, REE) data: simple mixing; mixing with a partial melt of the metasedimentary rock, with or without isotopic equilibrium; and assimilation-fractional crystallization. Based on these models, some constraints may be applied on petrogenesis (e. g., the lack of high Rb concentrations points to the presence of biotite, and HREE depletion points to the presence of garnet); however, the models fail to adequately explain all the data. The New Zealand granitoids show similarities in isotopic character not only to rocks from offshore islands on the New Zealand block, but also to similar-aged granitoids in adjacent regions of Antarctica and Australia. This points to similarities in crustal character between continental blocks formerly proximal in Gondwanaland.

Several stratigraphically distinct units are defined and mapped using morphologic expression, spectral properties, and superposition relationships. Previously unreported exposures of hydrated sulfates and Fe/Mg smectites are identified using MRO CRISM and MEX OMEGA near‐infrared (1. 0 to 2. 5 µm) spectral reflectance observations. Layered deposits with monohydrated and polyhydrated sulfate spectral signatures that occur in association with a northeast‐southwest trending valley are reexamined using highresolution CRISM, HiRISE, and CTX images. Layers that are spectrally dominated by monohydrated and polyhydrated sulfates are intercalated. The observed compositional layering implies that multiple wetting events, brine recharge, or fluctuations in evaporation rate occurred.

40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological Sciences. Brittle {{deformation}} {{dominates the}} detachment fault zone exposed in the Newberry Mountains in southern Nevada, indicating that mid-Tertiary extension faulting occurred at shallow crustal levels. Below the microbreccia ledge marking the fault, the rocks grade from cataclasites to fine crush breccias that extend tens of meters {{into the lower}} plate. The cataclasites are deformed by grain-size reduction. Similar brittle behavior of minerals of contrasting rheology indicates brittle response throughout the deformation. The primary deformation processes in the fine crush breccias are linked, oriented shears and fractures, fold rotations, and pressure solution of porphyroclasts. The shears and fractures are highly asymmetric both in orientation and occurrence, and may have origins in the progressive rotation of a preexisting conjugate pair during subsequent extensional faulting. Superimposed rotational strain related to extensional faulting was accommodated on the favorably oriented synthetic conjugate, offsetting and pulling apart the antithetic conjugate. The shears cut both feldspar and quartz, often breaking perpendicular to cleavage and transecting grain boundaries, indicating deformation in the brittle field. Clorite, epidote, and sericite in pressure shadows and on shear surfaces indicates lower greenschist-grade conditions during faulting. Penetrative anastomosing fracture patterns are developed on all scales throughout the zone. Shears, striae, fibers, and folded porphyroclasts indicate northeast directed, higher over lower, movement of lower-plate <b>rocks.</b> <b>Preexisting</b> deformation may have localized strain, reduced the cohesion and friction values, and facilitated the extensional faulting at its characteristic low angle.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the history of the Pacific Ocean floor coupled with structural, paleomagnetic, and paleobiogeographic studies of the North American Cordillera {{indicate}} that the Pacific floor moved northward and beneath the California continental margin throughout much of Mesozoic time. Northward movement began by Early Jurassic time and possibly as early as Late Triassic time. The northward movement brought equatorial ocean floor into the western Sierran region as an allochthonous ophiolitic basement terrane. Accretion of the oceanic basement was complex, involving both transcurrent faulting and subduction processes. Native basement consisting of Paleozoic borderland sequences and the North American continental shelf sat inboard of the exotic oceanic basement. The contact between the native and exotic terranes was an active break of long duration, herein named the Sierran Foothills suture. The signature of plate convergence in the Sierran region is a composite volcano-plutonic arc. Voluminous magmatism proceeded semicontinuously from Early Jurassic through Late Cretaceous time. Arc rocks of all ages show compositional variations that reflect the nature of the <b>preexisting</b> basement <b>rocks.</b> Gabbroic-basaltic associations occur primarily within the limits of the oceanic basement, whereas voluminous granitic-rhyolitic assemblages are associated with continental basement. The depositional environments of the volcanic arc rocks varied greatly due to tectonic instability within the arc terrane. These environments consisted of an inherited continental shelf, uplifted and eroded continental and oceanic basement, sedimentary basins receiving epiclastic as well as volcaniclastic turbidites, and newly formed intraarc basins floored by juvenile crust. The Mesozoic plate juncture history along the California margin was complex, being dominated by oblique subduction with probable interludes of transform faulting. The Sierra Nevada coincided with the axis of volcano plutonic arc activity from Early Jurassic through Cretaceous time. No consuming plate juncture of Jurassic or younger age can be identified within the Sierran region. Late Triassic to possibly earliest Jurassic consumption occurred in the western foothills during the accretion of the ophiolitic basement terrane. Jurassic consumption occurred west of the Sierran region, but any subduction complex that may have existed was removed by Jurassic and Cretaceous rifting and transcurrent faulting. Cretaceous consumption in the Coast Ranges is marked by the Franciscan Complex. The Sierra Nevada evolved as one composite arc terrane containing numerous internal structural breaks. Deformation of the arc consisted of large-scale dextral wrench faulting with a family of wrench-related structures, oblique rifting, and the development of fold-thrust welts. The result of these processes is a complex igneous and metamorphic terrane consisting of interleaved volcanic arc and older basement fragments that are cut by highly to only slightly deformed plutons of a wide range of ages. Similar structural complexities are evolving today in modern arc terranes with analogous plate-tectonic settings. The processes that operate along a convergent plate juncture that also has a significant strike-slip component are more complex than junctures with normal or near-normal convergence. The unique tectonic style resulting from prolonged oblique convergence is termed transpression after Harland (1971) ...|$|R

The procedure involves grain‐size separation, polytype modeling, and isotopic analysis, creating a mixing line that is used to extrapolate to δD and age of pure authigenic and detrital material.
