40|$|Introduction: Influenza circulates {{every year}} and is {{associated}} with a substantial burden to society. Infrequent influenza pandemics present a serious potential threat to public health. In the response to the 2009 influenza pandemic, one weakness of the public health response was the lack of situational awareness about disease transmissibility, early in the pandemic. In the next pandemic, vaccines are again likely to be delayed while antiviral treatment could be withheld for the most severe infections. Simple <b>personal</b> <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> such as improved hand hygiene and the use of face masks could assist in mitigating a pandemic but their effectiveness remains uncertain. In this thesis I developed and applied two statistical modeling approaches to aid the interpretation of influenza surveillance data collected on population and epidemiological data collected at the individual level. They facilitate improved situational awareness and provide better estimates of the effectiveness of <b>personal</b> <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions.</b> Methods: A key quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the Effective Reproductive Number, R, which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single index case. I extended an existing method for estimation of R in real-time to account for reporting delays and applied it to data on case notifications and hospitalizations associated with pandemic (H 1 N 1) in Hong Kong from June through October 2009. In 2008, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate whether increased hand hygiene and facemasks were effective in reducing influenza transmission in households. Preliminary analysis of the data failed to identify significant effects of the interventions, but did not account for the underlying transmission dynamics. I developed a stochastic transmission model, within the Bayesian framework, to estimate the effectiveness of facemasks and improved hand hygiene in reducing household transmission. Results: The method developed for estimating R was demonstrated to be useful in estimating the real-time transmissibilty of pandemic (H 1 N 1) virus in Hong Kong from June to October 2009, which ranged from 1. 3 - 1. 6 through the phase of increasing incidence. The household transmission analysis was able to identify a moderate effect of improved hand hygiene and facemasks in reducing influenza transmission in households, where the daily interventions efficacies ranged from 18 % to 27 % in hand hygiene group and ranged from 5 % to 13 % in the hand hygiene plus facemasks group. Conclusions: The extended method for estimating R provided a practical tool for the surveillance of influenza transmission and should be useful in future pandemics. Further work is needed to extend the approach to account for age. The household transmission analysis suggested that simple personal interventions should be taken into account in strategies for pandemic mitigation. published_or_final_versionCommunity MedicineMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In an {{influenza}} pandemic, {{the benefit}} of vaccines and antiviral medications will be constrained by limitations on supplies and effectiveness. <b>Non-pharmaceutical</b> public health <b>interventions</b> will therefore be vital in curtailing disease spread. However, the most comprehensive assessments of the literature to date recognize the generally poor quality of evidence {{on which to base}} non-pharmaceutical pandemic planning decisions. In light of the need to prepare for a possible pandemic despite concerns about the poor quality of the literature, combining available evidence with expert opinion about the relative merits of <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> for pandemic influenza may lead to a more informed and widely accepted set of recommendations. We evaluated the evidence base for <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> public health <b>interventions.</b> Then, based on the collective evidence, we identified a set of recommendations for and against interventions that are specific to both the setting in which an intervention may be used and the pandemic phase, and which can be used by policymakers to prepare for a pandemic until scientific evidence can definitively respond to planners' needs. Methods Building on reviews of past pandemics and recent historical inquiries, we evaluated the relative merits of <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> by combining available evidence from the literature with qualitative and quantitative expert opinion. Specifically, we reviewed the recent scientific literature regarding the prevention of human-to-human transmission of pandemic influenza, convened a meeting of experts from multiple disciplines, and elicited expert recommendation about the use of <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> public health <b>interventions</b> {{in a variety of settings}} (healthcare facilities; community-based institutions; private households) and pandemic phases (no pandemic; no US pandemic; early localized US pandemic; advanced US pandemic). Results The literature contained a dearth of evidence on the efficacy or effectiveness of most <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> for influenza. In an effort to inform decision-making in the absence of strong scientific evidence, the experts ultimately endorsed hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, surveillance and case reporting, and rapid viral diagnosis in all settings and during all pandemic phases. They also encouraged patient and provider use of masks and other personal protective equipment as well as voluntary self-isolation of patients during all pandemic phases. Other <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> including mask-use and other personal protective equipment for the general public, school and workplace closures early in an epidemic, and mandatory travel restrictions were rejected as likely to be ineffective, infeasible, or unacceptable to the public. Conclusion The demand for scientific evidence on <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> public health <b>interventions</b> for influenza is pervasive, and present policy recommendations must rely heavily on expert judgment. In the absence of a definitive science base, our assessment of the evidence identified areas for further investigation as well as <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> public health <b>interventions</b> that experts believe are likely to be beneficial, feasible and widely acceptable in an influenza pandemic. </p...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{surveillance}} in Mexico, the US, Canada, Spain and the UK {{has resulted}} in the first data on the new influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus. As of yet, it is still unknown if, how and where further transmission within the Netherlands will take place. Therefore, intensified surveillance in the Netherlands is essential. Information on individual patients and their contacts is available through the compulsory notification of the new influenza. The number of general practitioners and nursing homes participating in surveillance through national networks is extended. In addition mortality statistics and internet-based surveillance are being used (the Dutch Great Influenza Survey). Based on studies on previous flu epidemics and mathematical models we can estimate the expected effect of <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions.</b> The reduction of social contacts, in particular through the closure of schools, hand washing routines and wearing of facemasks if done correctly, are expected to be effective <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> in slowing the transmission of the new influenza virus.

40|$|In {{case of a}} {{pandemic}} influenza outbreak, <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> will likely be the only containment measure at {{the early stages of}} the pandemic when vaccines are not available. NPIs also oer an option for decreasing the probability of creating antiviral resistant viruses product of a mass prophylaxis campaign. In countries where there are not enough resources for vaccines and antivirals, NPIs may be the only mitigation actions available. NPIs have been increasingly used in preparedness plans. We can see recommendations and guidelines regarding the use of NPIs in countries, health departments and universities. Also, researchers all around the world have study the impact of NPI 2 ̆ 7 s in pandemic influenza outbreaks, most of them using simulation as their modeling tool. Our review of the aforementioned plans and literature shows that there is a lack of consensus in how to implement these interventions. They vary widely in the choice of key parameters such as intervention initiation threshold, duration and compliance. We believe that the lack of uniformity in NPI mitigation strategies arise from the uncertainty in the virus epidemiology and the current lack of scientic knowledge about the complex interactions between virus epidemiology with social behavioral factors and mitigation actions. In this dissertation we addressed this problem by modeling pandemic influenza outbreaks using an agent-based simulation approach. The model incorporates detailed popu- lation demographics and dynamics, variety of mixing groups and their contact processes, infection transmission process, and <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions.</b> Using a statistical experimental design approach we examine the influence of characteristic parameters of virus epidemiology, social behavior, and <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> on various measures of pandemic impact such as total number of infections, deaths and contacts. The experimental design approach also yields the knowledge of the extent of interactions among the above parameters. Using this knowledge we develop eective NPI strategies and demonstrate the efficacy of these strategies on large-scale simulated outbreaks involving three dierent scenarios of virus transmissibility. The results show that signicant improvements in the NPI based pandemic mitigation approaches can be attained by the strategies derived from our methodology...|$|R

40|$|Influenza {{is one of}} re-emerging {{infectious}} disease in Thailand. The true burden of influenza is not known and is needed for influenza preparedness. Thailand has a vaccine policy targets at healthcare worker (HCWs), people aged 6 - 24 months or ≥ 65 years, people with chronic medical condition (CMC), and pregnant women. However, amount of vaccine is limited and policy planners need information for vaccine prioritization. The government also promote <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions,</b> but their impact is not well studied. This research aimed to use agent-based model (ABM) to estimate influenza burden in Thailand and assess impact of control measures. The basic reproductive number (R 0) based on Thailand's context is unknown and should be estimated for further studies of influenza dynamics. The R 0 was estimated using formula relating the epidemic growth rate (r) and generation time. The projection of influenza burden was studied by fitting an ABM. The model contains a 58, 354, 744 synthetic Thai population, incorporates people with CMC and HCWs. At start, 100 agents were randomly assigned for initial infection. The model simulated the interactions of individuals with others over 180 days. Impacts of influenza vaccine were simulated at 50 %, 75 % and 100 % coverage. Impacts of face mask wearing and hand washing were simulated at 10 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % coverage. The R 0 estimates ranged from 1. 11 to 1. 77 (median 1. 39). The highest attack rate occurs in school-age children and adolescents (15. 32 %). One Hundred percent coverage of target population policy can avoid morbidity and mortality by 47. 06 % and 59. 61 % in total population respectively. However, the benefit is very small for HCWs (3. 75 % case reduction). The extended policy to include children aged 2 - 18 years old can avoid > 99 % of cases. For <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions,</b> at least 50 % compliance of the combined face mask use and hand washing policy can avoid morbidity and mortality > 98 % for all adherence of mask wearing.

Background.   The health risks of obesity underline the importance of effective evidence-based weight loss interventions for people with learning disabilities as they are at increased risk of being overweight. Data sources. Papers published from 1998 to 2009 were identified through searches of the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Proquest, Medline (PubMed), PSYCHINFO databases, and the Cochrane Library. Review methods.   An integrative review method was used. Studies included were non-surgical or <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> aimed at weight reduction for people with a learning disability. Synthesis of the findings related to study design, participants, types of interventions, outcome measures and participant perspectives. Results.   Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. The most common research design was quasi-experimental pretest and post-test. Few researchers used a clinical trial approach, and there was only one predominantly qualitative study. Interventions were mainly focused on energy intake, energy expenditure or health promotion. Only a few studies incorporated behaviour modification approaches. Conclusion.   Nurses who work with clients with learning disabilities have a key role to play in the management of obesity. Future research needs to focus on qualitative studies of the perceptions of clients and their families, controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of interventions and their costs and sustainability, and longitudinal studies examining weight loss over time...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{time delay}} between {{the start of}} an {{influenza}} pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning. We quantify the distribution of this random time {{in terms of the}} separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions.</b> METHODS AND FINDINGS: The model constructed for this time delay accounts for: (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. CONCLUSIONS: The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} school-based <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> (NPIs) on {{influenza}} A and B transmission in children's households {{has not been}} estimated in published literature. We use data from a large school-based cluster randomized trial of improved hand and respiratory hygiene measures to explore the secondary transmission of influenza A and B in households of laboratory confirmed influenza cases. Data {{were taken from the}} Pittsburgh Influenza Prevention Project, a cluster-randomized trial of NPIs conducted in ten Pittsburgh, PA elementary schools during the 2007 – 2008 influenza season. We estimated two measures of influenza transmissibility in households; the susceptible infectious transmission probability, using variants of the Reed–Frost chain binomial model, and the secondary attack rate. We identified predictors of ILI using a logistic generalized estimating equation model. We estimate the secondary attack rates in intervention households to be 0. 26 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 19 – 0. 34) compared to 0. 30 (95 % CI 0. 23 – 0. 38) in control households. Race and age were significant risk factors for secondary ILI acquisition in this study. We found {{no significant differences between the}} transmission probabilities for infectious individuals in intervention (0. 19, 95 % CI 0. 14 – 0. 25), and control households (0. 22, 95 % CI 0. 16 – 0. 29). Similarly, estimates for secondary attack rates and transmission probabilities for households with confirmed influenza A (0. 31 and 0. 22) were not significantly different from estimates from households with confirmed influenza B (0. 25 and 0. 20).

40|$|Migraine {{remains one}} of the most {{disabling}} disorders worldwide. The high prevalence in the general population and the often-delicate treatment of patients account for that.

The introduction of specific anti-migraine treatment occurred over 20 years ago when the first triptan was approved by regulatory authorities (sumatriptan, 28 December 1992).

40|$|Hypertension is a known {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} disease in adults. Essential hypertension {{in children and adolescents}} is increasing in prevalence in the United States, and hypertension in children may track into adulthood. This increasing prevalence is attributed to the trends of increasing overweight and obese children and adolescents. Family history and being of African-American/black descent may predispose youth to elevated blood pressure. Interventions targeted to reduce and treat hypertension in youth include <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> such as weight reduction, increased physical activity, and dietary changes and pharmaceutical treatment when indicated. The effectiveness of <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> is well documented in adults, but there are limited studies with regards to children and adolescents, specifically in the arena of dietary interventions. Lifestyle modifications such as dietary interventions are the mainstay of recommended treatment for those children and adolescents with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. Given the association of being overweight and hypertension, efficacy of dietary interventions are of interest because of reduced cost, easy implementation and potential for multiple beneficial outcomes such as reduced weight and reduction of other metabolic or cardiovascular derangements. Barriers to dietary interventions often include socioeconomic status, ethnicity, personal, and external factors. The goal of this systematic review of the literature is to identify interventions targeted to children and adolescents that focus on recommended dietary changes related to blood pressure. Dietary interventions found for this review mostly focused on a particular nutrient or food group with the one notable exception that focused on the DASH pattern of eating. The effects of the interventions on blood pressure varied, but overall dietary modifications can be achieved in youth and can serve a role in producing positive outcomes on blood pressure. Increasing potassium and following a DASH diet seemed to provide the most clinically significant results. Further studies are still needed to evaluate long-term effectiveness and to contribute more supporting evidence for particular modifications in these age cohorts. ...|$|R

Findings indicate that both single bouts of activity and chronic physical activity associate with improvedmental health and classroom performance in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and children with autism spectrumdisorders. This review describes the {{research in this area}} and identifies limitations and challenges to the translation of these findings to promote physical activity in clinical practice and educational policy. Concomitant with the pervasiveness of developmental neurobehavioral disorders, trends indicate decreasing participation in physical activity behaviors during childhood (DHHS and DOE, 2000). In particular, children with developmental disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-der (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been found to exhibit lower physical activity participation levels than the general pediatric population (Kim, Mutyala, Agiovlasitis, & Fernhall, 2011; Pan & Frey, 2006).

As a result, several types of psychotropic medications are used “off-label” to mitigate the often troublesome, non-cognitive symptoms of dementia. This practice has come under considerable scrutiny following the 2005 and 2008 FDA black box warnings regarding the increased risk of stroke and death {{associated with the use of}} antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia. Despite the associated risks, psychotropics are still prescribed to people with dementia. The lack of safe, alternative medications highlights the need for <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions.</b> In order for future interventions to be effective, they must target modifiable medication risk factors. Current research surrounding psychotropic medication use in people with dementia focuses on residents of nursing homes. Published work examining medication use among community-dwelling dementia patients is rare and none of the existing studies examine the role of informal caregivers. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate a broad range of care recipient and caregiver characteristics as cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of psychotropic medication both between and within racially and ethnically diverse populations of community-dwelling dementia patients and their informal caregivers. Using data from the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health Trials, we found that caregiver and care recipient characteristics are important predictors of psychotropic medication use among community-dwelling dementia patients, and that the association between care recipient symptoms and medication decreases over time. Significant racial/ethnic disparities in psychotropic medication use between care recipients from three racial/ethnic groups were observed in our final study. Within race analyses revealed significant associations between Hispanic/Latino caregiver social networks and care recipient psychotropic medication use. No clear pattern was observed for other racial/ethnic groups. Future public health efforts should focus on a multidisciplinary approach to dementia care where the knowledge and skills of persons trained in cultural competence and <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> work together with physicians and caregivers to provide a safe alternative to psychotropic medication...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Allocation of {{vaccines}} and {{deployment of}} <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> (NPIs) {{are critical to}} controlling influenza. We examine how these policies can minimize the societal impact. Methods. An engineering systems framing and modeling approach incorporates theories and data on the spread of influenza. Models employed data from the CDC and state governments on cases and vaccine administered during the 2009 H 1 N 1 outbreak, and published literature on how to reduce human-to-human contacts. Results. During the outbreak, barely half of all states received proportional allotments of vaccine in time to protect any citizens, while fewer sought vaccine after the peak. While individuals prone to contract and spread infection drive the progression, diligent hygiene practices and social distancing measures can drive down the number of cases. Conclusions. NPIs are highly effective in reducing the spread of influenza before, but also after vaccine is administered.

40|$|Influenza {{remains one}} of the major {{infectious}} diseases that targets humankind.

We created an ordinary differential equation model with parameter estimates based on the disease symptoms score data to determine various disease stages and parameters associated with infectiousness and disease progression. Having various stages with different intensities of symptoms enables us to incorporate spontaneous behavior change due to the onset/offset of disease symptoms. Additionally, we incorporate the effect of a waning vaccine on delaying the time and decreasing the size of an epidemic peak. Our results showed that the epidemic peak in the model was significantly lowered when public vaccination was performed up to two months past the onset of an epidemic. Also, behavior change in the earliest stages of the epidemic lowers and delays the epidemic peak.

We monitored adherence and tolerability of these NPI within a cluster-randomized trial in households with influenza index patients. We recruited 147 participants in 41 households, 39 (95 %) out of 41 index patients were children (aged < 14 years). In households assigned to wear facemasks, their use peaked on day 4 after symptom onset of the index patient at 73 % and at 65 % for children and adults, respectively. Mean daily frequency of hand disinfection in households assigned to intensified hand hygiene measures peaked at 7 · 7 (day 6) for children and at 10 · 1 (day 5) for adults. The majority of participants reported no problems with mask wearing. Data suggest that usage of NPI can be taught and that measures are well tolerated by adults and even sick children alike...|$|R
40|$|<b>Non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> (NPIs) {{have been}} used since {{the early years of}} public health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{provides}} a standard definition for NPI and what NPI strategies are contained within the definition. This paper seeks to discover if state pandemic influenza plans use the term NPI and its strategies, and if states’ use of NPI strategies in their state pandemic plans is consistent with the CDC definition. To determine how states were defining and using the term NPI and NPI strategies a survey of forty-eight (48) state plans was conducted using each respective states’ pandemic plan. The survey revealed that the majority of states do not conform to the CDC definition, and in fact five (5) states do not use the term NPI at all. Furthermore only four (4) of the states surveyed use the NPI definition and NPI strategies as defined by the CDC. I recommend that those states that do use the term NPI and the NPI strategies be a blue-print for other state plans...|$|R
40|$|Background Voluntary home {{quarantine}} {{of cases}} and close contacts {{was the main}} <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>intervention</b> used to limit transmission of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza (pH 1 N 1) in the initial response to {{the outbreak of the}} disease in Australia. The effectiveness of voluntary quarantine logically depends on affected families having a clear understanding of what they are being asked to do. Information may come from many sources, including the media, health officials, family and friends, schools, and health professionals. We report the extent to which families who entered home quarantine received and used information on what they were supposed to do. Specifically, we outline their sources of information; the perceived usefulness of each source; and associations between understanding of recommendations and compliance. Methods Cross-sectional survey administered via the internet and computer assisted telephone interview to families whose school children were recommended to go into home quarantine because they were diagnosed with H 1 N 1 or were a close contact of a case. The sample included 314 of 1157 potentially eligible households (27...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{logistics}} of handling possible avian influenza outbreaks. The research investigates various aspects of avian influenza relevant to the Hong Kong circumstances, such as literature review and the financial impacts of avian influenza pandemic. Then the paper will focus on various ways to minimise the risks of pandemic, {{such as the use}} of vaccination, <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>intervention</b> (NPI) and poultry-slaughtering centre plan. This paper concentrates on discussing various logistics responses that can help the medical personnels to do their jobs more effectively in a possible avian influenza outbreak. This research concludes that vaccination and the NPI are important measures in countering the avian flu pandemic in the early stage of its widespread. This paper also supports any measures that can trace the infected poultry as a way to prevent an avian influenza outbreak in the very first place. In this aspect, the research investigates about the Singapore experience in operating poultry-slaughtering centres. In view of the current trends, this paper concludes that the establishment of a central poultry-slaughtering centre becomes a less favourable policy options.

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} disease {{dynamics}} on networks can aid {{our understanding of}} how in-fectious diseases spread through a population. Models that incorporate decision-making mechanisms can furthermore capture how behaviour-driven aspects of transmission such as vaccination choices and the use of <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> (NPIs) interact with disease dynamics. However, these two interventions are usually modelled separately. Here, we construct a simulation model of influenza transmission through a contact network, where individuals can choose whether to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs. These decisions are based on previous experience with the disease, the current state of infection amongst one's contacts, and the personal and social impacts of the choices they make. We find that the interventions interfere with one another: because of negative feedback between intervention uptake and infection prevalence, it is difficult to simultaneously increase uptake of all interventions by changing utilities or perceived risks. However, on account of vaccine efficacy being higher than NPI efficacy, measures to expand NPI practice have only a small net impact on influenza incidence due to strongly mitigating feedback from vaccinating be...|$|R

40|$|Protection of ischemic {{myocardium}} {{has been}} attempted {{by a variety}} of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical methods. When the coronary intervention is not indicated by some reasons in patients with ischemic heart failure, medical treatments are expected to offer cardioprotection against the persistence of stenotic/occlusive lesions of the epicardial coronary artery. The pharmaceuticals such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta blocker, Ca antagonist, ATP-sensitive K channel opener and statin, or non-pharmaceutical approaches such as physical exercise, cardiac resynchronization, ventricular assist devices, and preconditioning upon ischemic insults appear to improve myocardial endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) function. Such eNOS activation contributes to amelioration of the cardiac dysfunction and remodeling induced by myocardial ischemia. Therefore, based on clinical evidence and basic research on clinical demand, we postulate a concept of 'myocardial endothelial NO activator' from the standpoint of mechanistic insights beyond the class-effects of each pharmaceutical category and each <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>intervention.</b> In addition to such continuous eNOS activation for treating chronic ischemic heart failure, rapid eNOS activation in the setting of acute ischemic events upon chronic myocardial ischemia by new strategies such as postconditioning seems to be also essential for developing further effective anti-heart-failure therapies...|$|R

With the ever-growing prevalence of dementia, nursing costs are in-creasing, while the ability to live independently vanishes. Dem@Home is an ambient assisted living framework to support independent living while receiv-ing intelligent clinical care. Dem@Home integrates a variety of ambient and wearable sensors together with sophisticated, interdisciplinary methods of im-age and semantic analysis. Semantic Web technologies, such as OWL 2, are ex-tensively employed to represent sensor observations and application domain specifics {{as well as to}} implement hybrid activity recognition and problem detec-tion. Complete with tailored user interfaces, clinicians are provided with accu-rate monitoring of multiple life aspects, such as physical activity, sleep, com-plex daily tasks and clinical problems, leading to adaptive <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions.</b> The method has been already validated for both recognition per-formance and improvement on a clinical level, in four home pilots.

40|$|Context : Compliance for <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>interventions</b> for {{containment}} of Influenza A H 1 N 1 {{is determined by}} community understanding and accurate information by appropriate risk commu-nication strategy. Aims: To assess the baseline awareness of public regarding Influenza A H 1 N 1 and its existing risk communication strategy; and to assess public expressed willingness to comply with containment measures. Materials and Methods: Sample of 300 subjects (> 18 years) coming to primary health centre (PHC) in Delhi was interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. The data was collected from 1 st July to 1 st Sept 2009 by systematic random sampling. Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square test and binary logistic regression. Results: Only 66 (22 %) individuals had complete knowledge about the spread, symptoms, risk groups, and method of prevention for Influenza A H 1 N 1 infection. Knowledge was significantly higher among males and literates. Only 45 (15 %) individuals thought that information given by government on H 1 N 1 is complete and understandable.

40|$|In {{response}} to WHO raising the infl uenza pandemic alert level from phase fi ve to phase six, health offi cials {{around the world}} are carefully reviewing pandemic mitigation protocols. School closure (also called class dismissal in North America) is a <b>non-pharmaceutical</b> <b>intervention</b> that is commonly suggested for mitigating infl uenza pandemics. Health offi cials taking the decision to close schools must weigh the potential health benefi ts of reducing transmission and thus case numbers against high economic and social costs, diffi cult ethical issues, and the possible disruption of key services such as health care. Also, if schools are expected to close as a deliberate policy option, or just because of high levels of staff absenteeism, it is important to plan to mitigate the negative features of closure. In this context, there is still debate about if, when, and how school closure policy should be used. In this Review, we take a multidisciplinary and holistic perspective and review the multiple aspects of school closure as a public health policy. Implications for the mitigation of the swine-origin infl uenza A H 1 N 1 pandemic are also discussed...|$|R
