50|$|A {{metallic}} blue-green thorax reflects {{bronze and}} purple. In some lights, silvery pollen appears on its back, {{as well as}} a dark line that extends along the back. Black setae can be found on both the propleuron and the hypopleuron, with brown setae on the <b>prosternum.</b> There are dark brown or black sclerites located at the wing-base, as well as dark brown or black found on the spiracle. L. illustris has black legs, translucent wings, and does not have a costal spine.|$|E
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} family is that {{the tip of the}} rostrum fits into a groove in the <b>prosternum,</b> where it may be used for stridulation by rasping it against ridges in the groove. The structure of ridges is a stridulitrum, or stridulatory organ to produce sound, a tactic often used to discourage predators. If harassment continues, many species can deliver a painful stab with the proboscis, injecting venom or digestive juices. The effects can be intensely painful and the injection from some species may be medically significant.|$|E
50|$|The Heterocheilidae are {{medium to}} {{moderately}} large (body length 4.2-6.5 mm), fairly robust, brown flies Their postverical bristles {{are long and}} often parallel. Three fronto-orbital bristles are seen. The acrostichal bristles are in a single row with a larger prescutellar pair; the metepisternum is bare. The <b>prosternum</b> is triangular, and extended laterally to the propleuron as a narrow, precoxal bridge. The costa is unbroken and the crossveins are unmarked.The midregion of costa lacks anteroventral spines. The apical section of vein M is nearly straight, terminating posterior of wing apex. Crossvein Bm-Cu is almost aligned with vein CuA2. Vein CuA2+A1 reaches the wing margin.|$|E
5000|$|Adults of Diogmites species hunt as ambush predators, {{taking off}} from a resting {{position}} {{on the ground or}} on branches to intercept other flying insects, or to pounce on perching/crawling prey. After prey capture, these flies will feed in a characteristic posture that has earned this genus the common name of Hanging Thieves: they will hang from plant stems or leaves suspended by one or both front legs, with the other legs holding and manipulating the prey while feeding. Presumably the relatively long legs and reduced <b>prosternum</b> of the genus are part of adaptations to facilitate feeding during this suspended posture.|$|E

50|$|Legs {{comparatively}} {{long with}} prominent bristles, {{the length of}} the hind legs often roughly equals {{the length of the}} entire body. Forelegs about two-thirds as long as hind legs, with a short but distinctive curved spine at the anterior edge of each tibia. The claws of the hind legs are less than twice as long as the pulvilli. As is typical for Dasypogoninae, the harder cuticle of the <b>prosternum</b> is separated from the neck by an area of flexible cuticle that presumably allows for greater freedom of movement of the forelegs. It should be noted however that this feature also occurs in some members of other asilid subfamilies.|$|E

5000|$|Insects in {{the family}} Elateridae are {{commonly}} called click beetles (or [...] "typical click beetles" [...] to distinguish them from the related families Cerophytidae, Eucnemidae, and Plastoceridae). Other names include elaters, snapping beetles, spring beetles or skipjacks. This family was defined by William Elford Leach (1790-1836) in 1815. They are a cosmopolitan beetle family characterized by the unusual click mechanism they possess. There are a few closely related families in which a few members have the same mechanism, but all elaterids can click. A spine on the <b>prosternum</b> can be snapped into a corresponding notch on the mesosternum, producing a violent [...] "click" [...] that can bounce the beetle into the air. Clicking is mainly used to avoid predation, although it is also useful when the beetle is on its back and needs to right itself. There are about 9300 known species worldwide, and 965 valid species in North America.|$|E
50|$|The holotype X. sakhnovi {{specimen}} is {{a mostly}} complete adult beetle, {{with the left}} legs, antennae and prontal region are all damaged, and the left half of the insect shows blackening (possibly from the amber having been processed with an autoclave). Overall the specimen has a body length of 3.2 mm and has a width in the humeral region of 1.1 mm being elongated and flattened in shape. In general the coloration of the beetle was a uniform dark grey, with setae in some ares of the <b>prosternum.</b> The species is distinguished from extant Xylolaemus {{and at least one}} undescribed Baltic amber fossil in that the end segments of the antennae do not form a tight club; rather, they form a loose club and the tenth segments is {{the same size as the}} other segments. Also, X. sakhnovi is smaller overall, and the elytra do not have the patches of setae seen in the modern species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prothorax}} is {{the foremost}} {{of the three}} segments in the thorax of an insect, and bears the first pair of legs. Its principal sclerites (exoskeletal plates) are the pronotum (dorsal), the <b>prosternum</b> (ventral), and the propleuron (lateral) on each side. The prothorax never bears wings in extant insects, though some fossil groups possessed wing-like projections. All adult insects possess legs on the prothorax, though in a few groups (e.g., the butterfly family Nymphalidae) the forelegs are greatly reduced. In many groups of insects, the pronotum is reduced in size, but in a few it is hypertrophied, such as in all beetles (Coleoptera), in which the pronotum is expanded to form the entire dorsal surface of the thorax, and most treehoppers (family Membracidae, order Hemiptera), in which the pronotum is expanded into often fantastic shapes that enhance their camouflage or mimicry. Similarly, in the Tetrigidae, the pronotum is extended backward to cover the flight wings, supplanting {{the function of the}} tegmina.|$|E

Labrum is coated with dense, mostly appressed, white or off -white pubescence with 8-10 long, suberect, translucent setae. Pronotum with very slightly protuberant, broadly rounded lateral tubercles with greatest projection slightly behind middle; with weakly raised dorsal tubercles with following arrangement: large oval prominence at middle, surrounded by four smaller prominences (two anterolateral, two posterolateral). Pronotum with slight anteromedial elevation at margin. Pronotum mostly covered in appressed pubescence of several colors (white, pale green, tawny, and ochre). Ochraceous pubescence forms twoindistinct anterolateral maculae. Pronotum with slight constriction before anterior and posterior margins, with constrictions (particularly posteriorly) lined with row of separate, large punctures. Additional smaller punctures scattered over pronotal disk, someobscured by pubescence. <b>Prosternum</b> smooth, impunctate, covered with uniform, appressed, white or tawny pubescence. Prosternal process broad between procoxae, about 3/4 width of procoxa in most specimens. Scutellum moderately to densely tawny or ochraceous pubescent (occasionally with white pubescence at base and pale iridescent green pubescence at apex); broadly rounded posteriorly. Mesosternum smooth, impunctate, covered with uniform, appressed pubescence, less dense on anterior 1/3 which is deeply constricted. Mesosternal process between mesocoxae very broad, widely separating mesocoxae by about 1.25 × width of mesocoxa. Metasternum covered with appressed, white, off white, to slightly pale green pubescence, becoming mottled at sides and on lateral thoracic sclerites.|$|E
5000|$|Pygidicranidae is {{a family}} of earwigs, {{formerly}} placed in the suborder Forficulina, now in the suborder Neodermaptera. The family currently contains twelve subfamilies and twenty six genera. Eight of the subfamilies are monotypic, each containing a single genus. Of the subfamilies, both Astreptolabidinae and Burmapygiinae are extinct and known solely from fossils found in Burmese amber. [...] Similarly Archaeosoma, Gallinympha, and Geosoma, which have not been placed {{into any of the}} subfamilies, are also known only from fossils. Living members of the family are found in Australia, South Africa, North America, and Asia. [...] The monotypic genus Anataelia, described by Ignacio Bolivar in 1899, is found only on the Canary Islands. [...] As with all members of Neodermaptera, pygidicranids do not have any ocelli. The typical pygidicranid bodyplan includes a small, flattened-looking body, which has a dense covering of bristly hairs (setae). The pair of cerci {{at the end of the}} abdomen are symmetrical in structure. The head is broad, with the fourth, fifth and sixth antenna segments (antennomeres) that are not transverse. In general Pygidicranids also have equally sized ventral cervical sclerites, and in having the rearmost sclerite separated from, or only touching the center of the <b>prosternum.</b> [...] Cannibalism of young has been observed in at least one species in the family, Challia hongkongensis, in which an adult female was found eating a still-living nymph of the same species. The same species in a different area has been observed possibly eating fruits or seeds, making the species an omnivore.|$|E
