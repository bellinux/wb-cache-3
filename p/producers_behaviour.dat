40|$|The {{international}} market of wine {{has been characterized}} by growing competition, expecially in recent years. Wine {{is one of the}} main agroalimentary products for Italian export. From wine export depends Italian balance of trade. In this context, the study aims to identify the role of quality wine, which is strongly linked to the geographical location. In fact, this relation seems to be a strong tool in favour of international competition. To this purpose we will describe the multifunctional role of wine growing in a specific area, the Collio, in Italy. Then we will analyse the chosen data set. The data were collected by quality wine producers that are partner of a Consortium. The Consortium safeguards and attests the quality of wine production. Finally, in order to study the data we used descriptive statistics and the twostep cluster analysis technique of spss®. The use of twostep analysis represented a first exploratory application of appropriate statistical techniques to study the relationship among some variables. This technique alongside models of wine <b>producers</b> <b>behaviour</b> permits the analyst to explore wine production segmentation by describing different types of wine producers strategies. Each group was characterised by common behavioural features, which we have outlined below. By observing the clusters of wine producers, we noted that: i) group " 1 ": it was the largest; it was characterized by wine producers which used little or enough promotion, that encouraged the regional Consortium creation and had low regional market for their products (max 25 %); ii) group " 2 ": it was characterized by little or enough promotion; some of the wine producers of this group supported the regional Consortium creation, while others were not likely to encouraged it; it was characterized by middle-high regional market quota (more than 25 %); iii) group " 3 ": it was the smallest; its wine producers used a lot promotion; there was not a homogeneous support in favour of regional Consortium creation; regional market quota was low (max 25 %); iv) group " 4 ": it was similar to group " 1 ", but there was an important difference as regards regional Consortium, in fact, it did not encouraged its creation; it had low regional market quota (max 25 %). The information we collected was sufficient to construct a market segmentation model. This type of examination seems to be very useful to wine producers. In fact, it give them the opportunity to understand the strategies of their competitors. Undoubtedly, the data collected allowed us to analyse the role of local territory and the importance of local identity to typical products. Such analysis has become increasingly important for the wine sector, in which there is a specific institution - the Consortium - that has the duty to guarantee and promote mark guaranteeing quality. The Consortium gives wine producers the opportunity to increase the knowledge of consumers about the wine quality. From the data collected we observed the importance of Consortium to wine producers. At the same time, it is generally acknowledged that it is fundamental for wineries to promote local territory to increase the value of its products. Nevertheless, only bigger wine producers hope for the development of territorial brand and the cooperation among several stakeholders. ...|$|E

In this paper we analyse how observed heterogeneity in productivity is affected by endogenous <b>producer</b> <b>behaviour,</b> {{and to what extent}} shifts in firm specific productivity parameters will affect aggregate industry productivity. We find that endogenous <b>producer</b> <b>behaviour</b> and equilibrium adjustments may strongly affect observed productivity of firms and aggregate industry productivity. This makes it problematic to interpret them as structural parameters. The main lesson from the paper is that identification of such parameters should rely on structural models, in which the equilibrium determinants of observable productivity for individual firms, the distribution of output shares over firms, and the number of firms are taken into account. One may otherwise draw very misleading conclusions about changes in structural parameters from observed productivity variations, either between firms or for an industry over time.

We specify four regional models that may illustrate the approach. The first determines the optimal output level for factories that emit pollutants which reduce the crop output of neighboring farmers.

Our simulation shows that all policies can increase aggregate surplus given most calibrations; though, the largest effects are attributed to vaccine introductions, which reduce expected damages from foodborne illness among vaccinated consumers without shifting firm costs. However, unaware consumers and aware consumers who choose not to vaccinate experience no change in expected damages when a vaccine is introduced but face a higher price of food because of the stronger demand of food from vaccinated consumers...|$|R

The most effective seem to be incentive-based instruments as taxes on energy products and electricity because they efficiently influence consumer and <b>producer</b> <b>behaviour</b> in order to mitigate energy consumption. This thesis is motivated by increasing requirements of implementing such environmental policy into individual tax systems. Energy taxation increases prices of the products, thus leads to the lower energy consumption and the emission abatement.

The many dimensions of the problem have been extensively discussed in the literature and a recognition of the interaction between economic, biological and social objectives have led to an acceptance of its multidisciplinary nature. When studying sustainability in agriculture, two aspects which cannot be ignored are (i) any measure must include economic as well as biological criteria and (ii) the dynamic nature of the production system and the environment (both physical and economic) must be accounted for.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an attempt to analyse the {{political}} economy of regulation by examining two commodity markets in Sierra Leone - an importable rice market and an exportable coffee market for the period 1964 - 1986. The main goals of the thesis are: (i) to estimate the welfare costs of rent seeking in the rice market, and (ii) to examine <b>producer</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the light of a state monopsony which pays a farm gate price to coffee producers well below the World market price. The thesis begins with a review of the rent-seeking literature to provide a framework for the empirical work. A model is constructed for the rice market in which consumers self-select across three segments of the market: (a) queuing for rice at controlled prices, (b) paying a politician a premium for a Rice Purchasing Authority (RPA) or "chit", and (c) buying rice in the free market at higher clearing prices. A model is also constructed to explain the behaviour of a representative coffee farmer who faces a choice between selling his output in the official market or selling it illegally himself or to traders who smuggle. The empirical results suggest: (i) that a substantial volume of resources was allocated to rent seeking (5. 3 % of GDP) on rice imports alone in 1986, and (ii) econometric results confirm that the short-run output response of coffee producers depends on other factors rather than the official (marginal) price of their output on its own...|$|R
50|$|Martin Hollis and Edward J. Nell's 1975 book offers both a {{philosophical}} critique of neo-classical economics and an {{innovation in the}} field of economic methodology. Further they outlined an alternative vision to neo-classicism based on a rationalist theory of knowledge. Within neo-classicism, the authors addressed consumer behaviour (in the form of indifference curves and simple versions of revealed preference theory) and marginalist <b>producer</b> <b>behaviour</b> in both product and factor markets. Both are based on rational optimizing behaviour. They consider imperfect as well as perfect markets since neo-classical thinking embraces many market varieties and disposes of a whole system for their classification. However, the authors believe that the issues arising from basic maximizing models have extensive implications for econometric methodology (Hollis and Nell, 1975, p. 2). In particular it is this class of models - rational behavior as maximizing behaviour - which provide support for specification and identification. And this, they argue, is where the flaw is to be found. Hollis and Nell (1975) argued that positivism (broadly conceived) has provided neo-classicism with important support, which they then show to be unfounded. They base their critique of neo-classicism not only on their critique of positivism but also on the alternative they propose, rationalism. Indeed, they argue that rationality is central to neo-classical economics - as rational choice - and that this conception of rationality is misused. Demands are made of it that it cannot fulfill.|$|R

The study was based on empirical data collected during November 1994 to May 1996, covering three seasons, from 21 farms spread over Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Kasaragod districts of the state. The sample covered a total area of 61. 06 ha. Of the 11 explanatory variables considered in the model, the size of the farm, casual labour and chemical fertilizers were found statistically significant. It was also observed that the factors such as age of pond, experience of the farmer, feed, miscellaneous costs, number of seed stocked and skilled labour contributed positively to the output. The estimated industry production function exhibited unitary economies of scale. The estimated mean output was 3937 kg/ha. The test of multi-co-linearity showed that there is no problem of dominant variable. On the basis of the marginal product and the given input-output prices, the optimum amounts of seed, feed and casual labour were estimated. They were about 97139 seed, 959 kg of feed and 585 man-days of casual labour per farm.

40|$|Purpose – To {{identify}} {{factors that}} could influence consumer perceptions relating to meat production and areas where further development would be of assistance to British agriculture. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative semi-structured interviews of a quota sample of Scottish meat purchasing consumers. Findings – Results indicate that consumer views on meat production vary widely and that while there are some differences between rural and urban consumers the differences are rarely simple. Views were expressed {{on a variety of}} factors including livestock producers, agricultural production, certification and traceability. Relatively few consumers were routinely concerned with assurance labels. Consequently, knowledge of underpinning standards was limited. Primary sources of meat were the major supermarket groups with a distinct bias towards older consumers among those who preferred to shop in small butchers shops. Attitudes towards producers were mainly positive but some consumers remained sceptical about <b>producer</b> <b>behaviour</b> during hard times. Research limitations/implications – While more research would clearly be required to consider a broader spectrum of UK consumers, these current data indicate that consumer understanding of food information and indeed their interest and credibility of the current systems is a subject that would benefit from much wider research. The practical implications for the development of Government policy and for the idividual producers are substantial and would benefit from considerable clarification. Originality/value – Prior research concerning meat production and the views of consumers is limited. Theses findings have implications for future sector-based communications to consumers, in that equal emphasis should be given to both rural and urban consumers. More collaborative communications measures must be implemented to ensure consumer awareness/understanding of underpinning assurance label standards and bring about loyal purchase preferences for British produce...|$|R
40|$|The Utility Theory, {{which forms}} the {{fundamental}} {{framework of a}} significant area of economic science devoted {{to the study of}} consumer behaviour, has always been met with objection and criticism from many economists and it continues to do so. The inability to quantify utility and the dubiousness of the comparative evaluation of different consumer combinations of goods continue to give rise to attempts to supplement, amend or improve the existing theory of supply and demand. Such attempts should be recognized as reasonable and necessary, as many people reading the extensive literature on the utility theory are certain that they are reading a psychology textbook. One of the possible alternatives of the utility theory is an attempt to view consumer behaviour {{in the same way as}} <b>producer</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In my opinion, dividing economic agents into consumers and producers is a grave error.
