50|$|The PDP-1 was {{supplied}} standard with 4096 {{words of}} core memory, 18-bits per word, and ran at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. It was constructed using many System Building Blocks that were packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks were themselves packaged {{into a single}} large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lay at table-top height {{at one end of}} the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard input/output solution, a <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two peripherals, the Type 30 vector graphics display, and a Soroban Engineering modified IBM Model B Electric typewriter that was used as a printer. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified Friden Flexowriter, which also contained its own <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including magnetic tape systems, punched card readers and punches, and faster <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> and printer systems.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1949 in Kent, Washington, United States by Philip Renshaw, {{the company}} was a leading {{manufacturer}} of <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> readers. In 1970 Tally developed line matrix printer technologies and became {{a leader in the}} printer industry.|$|E

50|$|Input to {{the machine}} was {{performed}} {{in the form of}} punched paper tape, after experiments with punch cards proved unsatisfactory. The machine was controlled through a console which allowed programs to be stepped through one at a time, and featured CRT displays which showed the contents of registers. Output was through a standard teleprinter or to <b>punch</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
50|$|For storage, {{the systems}} could write out {{a stream of}} {{characters}} as they were received from the host, allowing them to be played back locally to recreate the display. Storage options included the 4911 <b>punch</b> <b>tape,</b> the 4912 using cassette tapes based on a Sykes TT120 mechanism, and later added the 4923 based on the 3M DC300 digital tape system.|$|E
50|$|While {{replaced}} by an electronic version later on, line printers initially used a piece of looped physical paper <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> to control {{the movement of the}} paper while printing. This tape is called a carriage control tape and was mounted on the printer. The length of the carriage control tape had to be exactly the same at the length of one sheet of paper. The looped carriage tape was moved synchronously with the stream of endless paper.|$|E

50|$|The Z1 {{contained}} {{almost all}} the parts of a modern computer, i.e. control unit, memory, micro sequences, floating-point logic and input-output devices. The Z1 was freely programmable via <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> and a <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> reader. There was a clear separation between the <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> reader, the control unit for supervising the whole machine and {{the execution of the}} instructions, the arithmetic unit, and the input and output devices.The input tape unit read perforations in 35-millimeter film.|$|R

5000|$|The Sphere I was a {{personal}} computer completed in 1975 by Michael Donald Wise and Monroe Tyler of Sphere Corporation, of Bountiful, Utah. [...] The Sphere I featured a Motorola 6800 CPU, onboard ROM, a big Monitor, 4 KB of RAM, and a keyboard with a numeric keypad. Sphere I. The Sphere I was among the earliest microcomputers. [...] Michael touted it as the first [...] "true PC" [...] because it had a keyboard, a number pad, a monitor, external storage, and did not run on a <b>punch</b> <b>tape.</b> When Byte Magazine did its annual history of the computer, it always included Sphere 1, showing that prior microcomputers lacked the user I/O interface built into the Sphere I.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike Parsons's {{original}} {{punched card}} design, the MIT design used standard 7-track <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> for input. Three {{of the tracks}} were used to control the different axes of the machine, while the other four encoded various control information. The tape was read in a cabinet that also housed six relay-based hardware registers, two for each axis. With every read operation the previously read point was copied into the [...] "starting point" [...] register, and the newly read one into the [...] "ending point" [...] register. The tape was read continually and the number in the registers incremented with each hole encountered in their control track until a [...] "stop" [...] instruction was encountered, four holes in a line.|$|E

50|$|Computer systems {{generally}} {{consist of}} three main parts: the {{central processing unit}} (CPU) that processes data, memory that holds the programs and data to be processed, and I/O (input/output) devices as peripherals that communicate with the outside world. An early computer might contain a hand-wired CPU of vacuum tubes, a magnetic drum for main memory, and a <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> and printer for reading and writing data respectively. A modern system might have a multi-core CPU, DDR4 SDRAM for memory, a solid-state drive for secondary storage, a graphics card and LCD as a display system, a mouse and keyboard for interaction, and a Wi-Fi connection for networking. In both examples, computer buses of {{one form or another}} move data between all of these devices.|$|E
50|$|MOBIDIC was a 36-bit binary machine, {{a common}} word size for early computers. The system used 36-bit data throughout, but stored it as 40-bit values to add {{additional}} sign and parity bits, and two spares. This {{allowed it to}} store the full range from -(1 - 2−36) to +(1 - 2−36). Machines were normally equipped with two parallel banks of core memory with 4096 words each, but was expandable to seven banks maximum. It could support up to 63 tape drives, <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> input and output, {{as well as a}} Flexowriter. One connection could also be dedicated to sending data to another MOBIDIC system. The tape drives used one of the spare bits in the 40-bit word as a STOP indicator.|$|E
50|$|LINCtape is also {{remembered for}} its reliability, which {{was higher than}} that of the diskettes which supplanted it. LINCtape {{incorporated}} a very simple form of redundancy—all data was duplicated in two locations across the tape. LINC users demonstrated this by punching holes in a tape with an ordinary office paper <b>punch.</b> <b>Tape</b> damaged in this way was perfectly readable. The formatting track made operation almost independent of tape speed, which was, in fact, quite variable. There was no capstan; the motion of the tape during reading and writing was directly controlled by the reel motors. There was no fast forward or rewind - reading and writing was performed at fast forward and rewind speeds. In some modes of operation, the data transfers were audible over the built-in loudspeaker and produced a very characteristic series of harsh bird-like squawks with varying pitch.|$|E

5000|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 28 was {{a machine that}} would run at 100 words-per-minute with less maintenance than that required by a contemporary teletypewriter running at 60 words-per-minute. Additional design criteria included the requirements to run quieter and be lighter than previous teleprinters. The Model 28 equipment was also designed to successfully operate in {{a wider range of}} temperatures and operate in moving vehicles. [...] The Model 28 equipment adjustments are made by turning screws and not by bending metal bars and levers as is done in the later Model 32 and Model 33 series of teleprinters. The Model 28 printing unit frame is lighter due to the use of stamped sheet metal instead of cast iron. The Model 28 ASR allowed the user to operate the keyboard to <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing an incoming message.|$|E
50|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 33 was {{a machine that}} would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment {{of the time and}} operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal bars and levers. Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. However, the base was die cast, but self-tapping screws were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. In another cost saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and page printer mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the keyboard to <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing something else. Independent use of the paper tape punch and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{commands}} {{for the experimental}} parts were programmed [...] "by hand" [...] to produce the punch tapes that were used as input. During the development of Whirlwind, MIT's real-time computer, John Runyon coded a number of subroutines to produce these tapes under computer control. Users could enter a list of points and speeds, and the program would calculate the points needed and automatically generate the <b>punch</b> <b>tape.</b> In one instance, this process reduced {{the time required to}} produce the instruction list and mill the part from 8 hours to 15 minutes. This led to a proposal to the Air Force to produce a generalized [...] "programming" [...] language for numerical control, which was accepted in June 1956. Doug Ross was given leadership of the project and was made head of another newly created MIT research department. He chose to name the unit the Computer Applications Group feeling the word [...] "application" [...] fit with the vision that general purpose machines could be [...] "programmed" [...] to fill many roles.|$|E

5000|$|The Air Force Numeric Control and Milling Machine {{projects}} formally {{concluded in}} 1953, but development continued at the Giddings and Lewis Machine Tool Co. and other locations. In 1955 {{many of the}} MIT team left to form Concord Controls, a commercial NC company with Giddings' backing, producing the Numericord controller. Numericord {{was similar to the}} MIT design, but replaced the <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> with a magnetic tape reader that General Electric was working on. The tape contained a number of signals of different phases, which directly encoded the angle of the various controls. The tape was played at a constant speed in the controller, which set its half of the selsyn to the encoded angles while the remote side was attached to the machine controls. Designs were still encoded on paper tape, but the tapes were transferred to a reader/writer that converted them into magnetic form. The magtapes could then be used on any of the machines on the floor, where the controllers were greatly reduced in complexity. Developed to produce highly accurate dies for an aircraft skinning press, the Numericord [...] "NC5" [...] went into operation at G&L's plant at Fond du Lac, WI in 1955.|$|E
50|$|This section {{describes}} a work session on this computer, at one typical installation in 1975. The programmer might arrive, {{to work on}} a Fortran-II program that he had already started writing in the previous session, carrying a teleprinter paper listing of that program that has been annotated with the new changes that are to be made, and the <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> that contains the machine-readable source code of the program. He would first need to turn on the computer at the switch on the conventional mains socket on the wall, and then at the front-panel on/off switch. Since the magnetic core memory, which is non-volatile memory, would generally still contain the previous user's program, the programmer might need to load the punched tape called Minisystem (containing the object code of a small, memory monitor program). This tape, which was stored in a small cardboard box on a shelf near the computer, would be entered from the left of the tape-reader. The tape-reader {{was an integral part of}} the front panel of the computer, and would spill out the tape that it had read, on to the floor, on the right-hand side. Once read, the Minisystem could be started by flicking the Run switch on the front panel.|$|E
