40|$|The {{vegetable}} {{field research}} has been enriched in recent years of new breeding techniques providing alternative and hopefully more efficient techniques than the traditional breeding and selection of plant organisms. Among these techniques the cisgenesis and the genome editing have earned the attention from the government Authorities, {{so much so that}} the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry recently decided to allocate some financial resources for their development. The paper, after exploring the different kinds of results that can derive from the application of cisgenesis and genome editing into the vegetable field, tries to shed light on the implications that may arrive by the legal protection of these results. One issue, in particular, that is predominate in the reflection conducted in the text, in other words the risk - which is also supported by the decision of the EPO’s Enlarged Board of Appeal known as "Tomatoes / Broccoli II" of 2015 - an overlap of IPRs on the same biological material, either by <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>right</b> or by patent...|$|E

40|$|According to the Plant Variety and Plant Seed Act of Taiwan, {{right-holders}} have {{exclusive right}} on importing/exporting the propagating materials, harvested {{materials and products}} made directly from the harvested materials of the protected variety. However, border measures provisions and punishment are void in the Act and its Enforcement Rules. It {{is a threat to}} plant variety protection that people bring those materials to other places for propagation and then re-import to Taiwan. For instance, China has been reported the major country where plant materials from Taiwan and Japan were exported to for further propagation and then ship back to the original market, even though China has implemented counterfeit policy to stop such situation. Furthermore, both EU and Japanese Customs Reports show that China has become the main source where illegal products come from. On the contrary, products come from South Korea have declined due to the implementation of export suspension. It is worth mentioning that since Taiwan and China have a close relationship on quite a few areas, to tighten the export suspension measure may be able to stop this issue from happening and to lower the possibility of illegal re-importation. Recently, passenger carry-on luggage and post/express have become means of passing illegal products and it is recommended that export and import suspensions to be coordinated closely in order to reach the goal of “stop of illegal cases”. The application procedures made especially for perishable goods in EU, and criminal punishment of <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>right</b> infringement and the PVP G-Men system in Japan are all role models for Taiwan. Agreements signed with both EU and Japan to mutually accept the application of <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>right</b> of citizens from the said states, and the IPR cooperation agreement with China all suggest that a complete PVR border measures system should be taken as the next step to fight against illegal cases. 我國植物品種及種苗法規定，品種權人專有排除他人未經其同意，而輸出入受保護品種種苗、收穫物及其直接加工物之行為。然而，我國目前並無植物品種權邊境管制之執行規定與罰則，而植物品種外流事件不斷發生，使得權利保護受到考驗。我國與日本的植物品種主要外流國家皆為中國，雖然中國已宣示打擊侵害智財物品，然而，從歐盟、日本近年來的海關統計資料顯示，查扣物品之來源國仍以中國為首，此一情形值得與中國交流密切的我國注意。此外，日本海關資料亦指出，韓國海關嚴格執行疑似侵權物品之禁止出口，使得來自該國的案件與貨品數量逐年下降，顯示以禁止進口與出口雙管齊下的方式，才能達到「治本」的目標。而近年來，旅客行李以及郵件、快遞寄送等已逐漸成為侵權物品之傳遞方式，亦值得我國重新檢視現行進出口管制制度。歐盟、日本分別以單獨立法及法規增訂的方式來制定智慧財產權邊境管制辦法，當中並包含植物品種權。日本種苗法除了保有刑事責任，並因應侵權事件的發生將刑責提高；此外，PVP G-Men制度的成立，亦提供了品種權保護諮詢服務與權利侵害調查協助。而歐盟不但提供優於TRIPs協定之保護內容，並針對易腐壞物品制定查扣與後續處理之相關規定等，兩國的經驗都值得我國參考。在我國陸續與日本、歐盟、中國等地建立智慧財產權合作關係後，交流機會日益增加，建立完善的植物品種權邊境管制措施來查緝以及防止未經授權、許可之植物材料及其產品輸出入，提升對農業智慧財產權保護，是我國需要努力的方向。第一章	緒論	 1 第一節	國際條約	 1 第二節	問題之提出	 10 第三節	研究動機與目的	 16 第四節	研究方法與範圍	 18 第五節	研究架構與定義	 20 第二章	歐盟植物品種權保護暨邊境管制制度	 25 第一節	植物品種保護	 25 壹、概述	 25 貳、保護內容	 25 第二節	邊境管制制度	 28 壹、概述	 28 貳、海關依職權查扣	 29 參、權利人申請	 31 肆、簡易處理程序	 33 伍、保證金	 34 陸、海關統計資料	 36 柒、歐盟與TRIPs協定邊境管制措施比較	 43 第三節	案件評析	 45 壹、案件	 45 貳、評析	 47 第四節	小結	 49 第三章 日本植物品種權保護暨邊境管制制度	 51 第一節	種苗法	 51 壹、概述	 51 貳、定義	 53 參、保護內容	 54 肆、罰則	 59 第二節	關稅法	 59 壹、概述	 59 貳、保護內容與程序	 60 第三節	G-Men制度	 65 壹、概述	 65 貳、運作與服務項目	 65 參、侵權調查與協助	 66 第四節	案件評析	 68 壹、案件	 68 貳、評析	 70 第五節	統計分析	 71 壹、海關統計資料	 71 貳、權利侵害事件	 77 第六節	小結	 84 第四章 我國植物品種保護制度	 87 第一節	植物品種及種苗法	 87 壹、概述	 87 貳、定義	 87 參、保護內容	 88 肆、植物品種權之輸出/輸入	 91 伍、外交所需植物種苗輸出	 93 陸、植物品種權之效力不及-免責權	 95 柒、罰則	 96 第二節	貿易法規	 96 壹、概述	 96 貳、定義	 97 參、保護內容及罰則	 97 肆、貨品輸出/輸入管理辦法	 98 伍、限制輸出/輸入貨品表	 98 第三節	海關緝私條例	 100 壹、概述	 100 貳、定義	 100 參、保護內容	 100 肆、罰則	 101 第四節	小結	 101 第五章	法律與執行之問題與建議	 105 第一節	法律依據之問題與建議	 105 壹、實踐國際條約之規定	 105 貳、我國貨物進出口管制法規問題	 106 參、建議	 108 第二節	執行層面之問題與建議	 110 壹、統籌協調及執行面	 111 貳、查扣物之處置面	 113 參、辨識度面	 114 肆、旅客行李及包裹寄送之檢查面	 116 伍、外交所需植物品種之種苗輸出面	 121 陸、刑事責任面	 122 柒、公權力介入與私權保障面	 127 捌、其他問題	 130 第三節	小結	 132 第六章	結論	 137 參考文獻	 143 附錄	 153 附錄一 TRIPs協定條文摘錄	 153 附錄二 UPOV 91 年公約條文	 160 附錄三 Council Regulation (EC) No 1383 / 2003 條文	 175 附錄四 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1891 / 2004 條文及申請表格	 185 索引	 19...|$|E

We use a game-theoretic approach to model strategic interactions between breeders and farmers. The model allows farmer privilege, whereby farmers save seed one year to plant in the future, and we show a point-of- sale royalty with either or both of the remaining royalties is optimal, whether or not we allow the possibility of farmers under-paying royalties through under-declaring output or saved seed. We also develop a Principal–Agent model, in which risk-neutral breeders share the risk with risk-averse farmers. In this model, the optimum royalty depends on various parameters, including the costs of compliance and enforcement. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Economics, 201...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the current legal protection for agricultural biotechnological inventions in Europe and the U. S. It has been a subject of debate whether plants and agricultural biotechnological inventions which includes plants, transgenic <b>plants</b> and <b>plant</b> <b>varieties,</b> can {{be the subject of}} patent protection, in addition to or {{as an alternative to the}} protection afforded by <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>rights.</b> Biotechnological patents have been criticized for granting an excessive scope of protection to proprietors, whereas <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>rights</b> have been slighted for not providing enough protection. Hence, this research is built on a few main themes, namely; the discussion of IP protection for agricultural biotechnological inventions as currently in practice in Europe and the U. S., as well as the deliberation on the current system as practised in Malaysia. The research also discusses the issue of the interface between the patent regime and <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>rights</b> over agricultural biotechnological inventions as there are possible overlaps between the two systems, notwithstanding the exclusivity of protection of <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> under the PVR system. The research looks at the prospect for Malaysia as a developing country to enhance its current IP framework and legislation in order to develop its agricultural biotechnology industry. Hence, it focuses on whether there is a single system as a model of IP regime to be adopted by Malaysia in order to provide the best IP protection for its agricultural biotechnology industry. The comparative approach is inevitable, in referring to the European model and the American model as a guide. The relevant factors such as the different setting, society and economic strength are given due consideration in coming up with the proposal to amend the current intellectual property law and legal system in Malaysia. At the end, the thesis puts forward a model for Malaysia to further develop its system...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{concentration}} {{levels in}} the ownership of intellectual property <b>rights</b> over <b>plant</b> <b>varieties</b> worldwide. An analysis of data for 30 UPOV member-countries shows {{a high degree of}} concentration in the ownership of <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>rights</b> for six major crops at the national level in the developed world. Much of this concentration has arisen owing to the rapid consolidation of the seed industry through mergers and acquisitions, especially in the 1990 s. A high degree of concentration in the ownership of <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> <b>rights,</b> in combination with recent efforts to strengthen <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> protection regimes, is likely to have significant effects on the prospects for future innovation in plant breeding and the distribution of market power between companies.

These implications for developing countries are likely to become apparent {{in the context of the}} rapid spread of <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> protection and access legislation, emerging changes in the international exchange regime for plant material and liberalised investment policies permitting foreign investment in the seeds sector.
