He reports no <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>cough</b> and no contact with ill persons in his community. He {{does not appear to}} be in distress. His temperature is 37 °C, his pulse 84 beats per minute, and his respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute. On auscultation of the lungs, no rales are heard; scattered wheezes are heard in the lung bases. How should he be evaluated and treated? Summary and Recommendations The patient described in the vignette most likely has a viral infection causing uncomplicated acute bronchitis. On the basis of data from clinical trials, antibacterial agents are not recommended. Chest radiography is not indicated, given the absence of signs of pneumonia on physical examination. In the absence of an influenza outbreak in the community, no rapid testing for viral causes should be ordered, and no antiviral therapy should be prescribed; influenza is especially unlikely in a patient who is afebrile. In the absence of a history of contact with a person with suspected pertussis (or a person with a history <b>of</b> persistent <b>cough),</b> this diagnosis is unlikely. If <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>cough</b> developed later or if whooping or post-tussive vomiting occurred, testing for pertussis would be reasonable. The patient should be advised that the cough may persist for an additional 10 to 21 days and that infrequently, it persists longer. For his wheezing and shortness of breath with activity, clinical experience suggests that a β 2 -agonist such as albuterol may provide relief, although data from clinical trials are inconsistent. On the basis of clinical experience, the patient might be offered short-term use of codeine or hydrocodone-containing preparations or inhaled corticosteroids if the cough is persistent, although data from trials to support their use are lacking...|$|R
40|$|Pertussis or {{whooping}} cough is typically characterised by <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> with a whooping sound during inhalation. It {{is thought to}} be under-diagnosed generally. Whooping cough is caused by Bordetella pertussis and is highly contagious. Although childhood immunisation has been effective in preventing the disease, outbreaks in Australia have been associated with waning immunity in older children and adolescents. The peak incidence of infection now occurs in people aged 15 or older. When given early in the illness, antibiotics can decrease the infectious period, but have no effect on the duration or severity of disease. Symptomatic treatment of cough has shown no clear benefit. Antibiotic prophylaxis of contacts is recommended for certain high-risk groups, but there is limited evidence of its effectiveness.

40|$|Pertussis is an {{epidemic}} disease caused by Bordetella pertussis {{and also to}} a lesser extent by Bordetella parapertussis. Classical illness lasts 4 - 8 weeks and is characterized by <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> with posttussive vomiting and whooping; however, 47. 4 % of primary infections last 4 weeks or less. Whole cell pertussis vaccines are generally highly efficacious. All whole cell vaccines are reactogenic, causing fever and local reactions in many vaccinees. In the past, these vaccines were thought to cause infant deaths and brain damage. However, several large epidemiologic studies indicate that whole cell vaccines do not cause infant deaths or neurologic disease. Recent studies indicate that neither immunization nor infection give long-term immunity. As a result, B. pertussis infections are endemic in adult populations. The future control of B. pertussis will require immuniza-tion schedules with new acellular vaccines that include booster doses in older children and adults. Pertussis (whooping cough) has been and remains an en-demic disease with significant morbidity and mortality [1 - 4].

40|$|SUMMARY Anthropometric {{measurements}} {{were made on}} 360 primary school children {{with a history of}} whooping cough and on 711 controls. Altogether 245 (68 %) cases and 469 (66 %) controls had taken tests of reading attainment and a smaller number had taken tests of intelligence. No {{significant differences were found between}} cases and controls in any of the anthropometric measurements nor in reading age or intelligence quotient after controlling for social class and parental smoking. Whooping cough is, in general, unlikely to cause subsequent deficiency in physical or mental development. During an attack of whooping cough, cyanosis during <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> is common and is sometimes accompanied by episodes of apnoea, particularly in infancy. " The pathology of the now rare whooping cough encephalopathy is that of severe vascular damage with anoxic changes, ' 5 6 but the long-term effects of cerebral hypoxia on the survivors of the illness are unknown. Previous studies, mainly conducted in the prevaccination era, have suggested an association between a history of whooping cough and mental deficiency 7 - 10 or behavioural disturbance. 10 11 The only modern study found that a small, uncontrolled group of children hospitalised for whooping cough was more likely to be rated intellectually abnormal at age 5. 12 Neither is it known whether whooping cough, which may be a protracted illness with persistent vomiting and weight loss,"w has any effect on physical development. The resurgence of whooping cough in recent years 4 and the risks-benefits debate over vaccination" 3 make these questions of current concern. We have thus studied indices of school performance and the physical development of children with a history of whooping cough compared with a control group.

40|$|Introduction: Bordetella {{pertussis}} is {{an important}} human pathogen that causes whooping cough (pertussis), an endemic illness responsible of significant morbidity and mortality, especially in infants and children. Worldwide, {{there are an estimated}} of 16 million cases of pertussis, resulting in about 195, 000 child deaths per year. In Peru, pertussis is a major health problem that has been on the increase despite immunization efforts. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of B. pertussis among children under five years of age suspected to have whopping cough in Cajamarca, Peru. Methodology: Children diagnosed with whooping cough admitted to the Hospital Regional de Cajamarca from August 2010 to July 2013 were included. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained for B. pertussis culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection. Results: In 133 children, the pertussis toxin and IS 481 gene were detected in 38. 35 % (51 / 133) of the cases by PCR, while only 9. 02 % (12 / 133) of the Bordetella cultures were positive. The most frequent symptoms in patients with positive B. pertussis were <b>paroxysm</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> 68. 63 % (35 / 51), cyanosis 56. 86 % (29 / 51), respiratory distress 43. 14 % (22 / 51), and fever 39. 22 % (20 / 51). Pneumonia and acute bronchial obstructive syndrome were present in 17. 65 % (9 / 51) and 13. 72 % (7 / 51) of the cases, respectively. Conclusions: B. pertussis is responsible for an important proportion <b>of</b> whooping <b>cough</b> in hospitalized children in Cajamarca. Epidemiologic surveillance programs for B. pertussis are essential in Peru, especially in children who could most benefit from the vaccine...|$|R

[...] "Yes," [...] said the king, [...] "brothers have need of brothers' aid. Would to God that mine were still alive." [...] In saying this he directed a meaning glance toward Godwin, which seemed to insinuate, as, in fact, the king had sometimes done before, that Godwin had had some agency in young Alfred's death. Godwin was displeased. He reproached the king with the unreasonableness of his surmises, and solemnly declared that he was wholly innocent of all participation in that crime. He imprecated the curse of God upon his head if this declaration was not true, wishing that the next mouthful of bread that he should eat might choke him if he had contributed in any way, directly or indirectly, to Alfred's unhappy end. So saying, he put the bread into his mouth, and in the act of swallowing it he was seized with a <b>paroxysm</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> and suffocation. The attendants hastened to his relief, the guests rose in terror and confusion. Godwin was borne away by two of his sons, and laid on his bed in convulsions.

60|$|Not long before, a {{ship from}} Peru had brought an influenza, and it now raged in the island, and {{particularly}} in Papeete. From all round the purao arose and fell a dismal sound <b>of</b> men <b>coughing,</b> and strangling as they coughed. The sick natives, with the islander's impatience of a touch of fever, had crawled from their houses to be cool, and, squatting on the shore or on the beached canoes, painfully expected the new day. Even as the crowing of cocks goes about {{the country in the}} night from farm to farm, accesses <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> arose and spread, and died in the distance, and sprang up again. Each miserable shiverer caught the suggestion from his neighbour, was torn for some minutes by that cruel ecstasy, and left spent and without voice or courage when it passed. If a man had pity to spend, Papeete beach, in that cold night and in that infected season, was a place to spend it on. And of all the sufferers perhaps the least deserving, but surely the most pitiable, was the London clerk. He was used to another life, to houses, beds, nursing, and the dainties of the sick-room; he lay here now, in the cold open, exposed to the gusting of the wind, and with an empty belly. He was besides infirm; the disease shook him to the vitals; and his companions watched his endurance with surprise. A profound commiseration filled them, and contended with and conquered their abhorrence. The disgust attendant on so ugly a sickness magnified this dislike; at the same time, and with more than compensating strength, shame for a sentiment so inhuman bound them the more straitly to his service; and even the evil they knew of him swelled their solicitude, for the thought of death is always the least supportable when it draws near to the merely sensual and selfish. Sometimes they held him up; sometimes, with mistaken helpfulness, they beat him between the shoulders; and when the poor wretch lay back ghastly and spent after a <b>paroxysm</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing,</b> they would sometimes peer into his face, doubtfully exploring it for any mark of life. There is no one but has some virtue: that of the clerk was courage; and he would make haste to reassure them in a pleasantry not always decent.|$|R
40|$|Pertussis {{may cause}} severe illness in young infants {{and result in}} {{complications}} such as apnea, cyanosis, feeding difficulties, pneumonia, and encephalopathy. Infants and other patients with severe pertussis may require hospitalization for supportive care; for very severe cases, intensive care facilities may be required. Corticosteroids and albuterol (a B 2 -adrenergic stimulant) may be effective in reducing <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> but further evaluation is required before their use can be recommended. 1, 2 Therapeutic use of pertussis-specific immunoglobulin is currently under investigation. Antimicrobial agents have had varying effects in reducing pertussis symptoms and clearing B. pertussis from the respiratory system, and have been used extensively for treatment and prophylaxis. ERYTHROMYCIN Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has shown substantial in vitro and in vivo activity against B. pertussis. 3 - 6 Because it {{has been successful in}} rapidly clearing B. pertussis from the nasopharynx, erythromycin has been the antimicrobial agent of choice for the treatment of pertussis. Effectiveness of Erythromycin Studies have shown that B. pertussis can no longer be isolated from the nasopharynx of most patients with pertussis following five days of erythromycin therapy. 7 - 10 In a few studies, culture positive cases were detected up to seven days after commencing treatment. 11, 12 Because relapses have been observed after completion of 7 - 10 days of treatment 2, 8, 9, 13 - 15 with erythromycin, 14 days of treatment has been recommended. 1, 16 More recently, a study by Halperin, et al. indicated that the difference between failure rates (2. 7 %) after 7 days of erythromycin treatment (n= 74) and 14 days of treatment (1. 06 %, n= 94) was not statistically significant. 17 Erythromycin can be used for two purposes in the control and prevention of pertussis: 1. Treatment to modify clinical symptoms of pertussis by administering to symptomatic patients. 2. Prevention of secondary spread of pertussis by administering to: a.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{worldwide}} {{incidence of}} whooping cough (pertussis) {{has been estimated}} at 48. 5 million cases and nearly 295, 000 deaths per year. In low-income countries, the case-fatality rate among infants may {{be as high as}} 4 %. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta 2 -adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); MEDLINE (1950 to March 2009); EMBASE (1980 to March 2009); AMED (1985 to March 2009); CINAHL (1982 to March 2009) and LILACS (March 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. The primary outcome was frequency of <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing.</b> Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay. MAIN RESULTS: Ten trials were included of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135) from high-income countries. Study quality was generally poor. Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1. 9 (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 4. 7 to 8. 5). One study on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of - 3. 1 whoops per 24 hours (95 % CI - 6. 2 to 0. 02) but no change in hospital stay (- 0. 7 days) (95 % CI - 3. 8 to 2. 4). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (- 3. 5 days) (95 % CI - 15. 3 to 8. 4) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per 24 hours (- 0. 22) (95 % CI - 4. 13 to 3. 69).

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Background: There {{are between}} 20 - 40 million cases of {{whooping}} cough annually world-wide, 90 % of which occur in developing countries, {{resulting in an}} estimated 200 - 300 O 00 fatalities each year. Much of the morbidity {{is due to the}} paroxysmal cough. Corticosteroids, salbutamol (a β₂- adrenergic stimulant), and pertussis-speciﬁc immunoglobulin have been proposed as standard treatment for the cough. Antihistamines have also been administered. No systematic review of the effectiveness of any of these interventions or others has been performed. Objective: in this systematic review we aim to assess the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce the severity of the coughing paroxysms in whooping cough in children and adults. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials of any intervention that reduced the severity of the coughing paroxysms in whooping cough; excluding antibiotics and vaccines. Study selection: All interventions aimed at reducing the severity of the coughing paroxysms in children or adults with whooping cough with any of the following outcome measures met inclusion criteria for the review; i) frequency of <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> <b>coughing</b> (primary outcome), ii) frequency of vomiting, iii) frequency of whoop, iv) frequency of cyanotic spells, v) development of serious complications, vi) mortality from any cause, vii) side effects due to medication, viii) admission to hospital, and ix) duration of hospital stay. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials register, Acute Respiratory infectious Disease Group Specialised Trials register, MEDLINE, LILACS, scanned reference lists of identiﬁed trials, contacted authors of identiﬁed trials and the relevant pharmaceutical companies. Data collection and analysis: Studies were selected, quality assessed and data extracted by two reviewers independently. Results: Nine studies satisﬁed the inclusion criteria but four had insufficient data for further meta-analysis of our pre-speciﬁed outcomes. Studies were old and poorly reported. The largest study had a total sample size of 49 and the smallest study nine. All studies were performed in industrialised settings. Eligible studies assessed diphenhyramine, pertussis immunoglobulin, dexamethasone and salbutamol. No statistically significant beneﬁt was found for any of the interventions. Diphenhydramine was associated with a mean increase of 1. 90 coughing spells per 24 hours [95 %Cl - 4. 66; 8. 46] and pertussis immunoglobulin a mean decrease in hospital stay of 0. 70 days [95 % Cl - 3. 79; 2. 39]. and a mean reduction of 3. 10 whoops per 24 hours [95 % CI - 6. 22; 0. 02]. Dexamethasone resulted in a mean decrease in hospital stay of 3. 45 days [95 % Cl - 15. 34; 8. 44] and salbutamol in a weighted mean decrease in coughing paroxysms of 0. 95 per 24 hours [95 % Cl - 6. 21; 4. 31]. Reviewers' conclusion: Although assessments have been performed on a whole range of interventions, including diphenhyramine, pertussis immunoglobulin, dexamethasone and salbutamol, insufﬁcient evidence exists to draw conclusions about the effects of any of them...|$|E
40|$|Pertussis, or {{whooping}} cough, is {{a highly}} communicable respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The infection begins with a 1 – 2 week onset stage characterized by a runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever and a mild cough that gradually becomes more severe. During the 1 – 6 week paroxysmal cough stage, the person has bursts, or <b>paroxysms,</b> <b>of</b> numerous rapid <b>coughs,</b> apparently due to difficulty expelling thick mucus from the tracheobronchial tree. At the end <b>of</b> the <b>paroxysm,</b> a long inspiratory effort is usually accompanied by a characteristic high-pitched “whoop. ” During a paroxysm, the individual may become cyanotic; children and young infants, especially, appear very ill and distressed. Vomiting and exhaustion commonly follow the paroxysmal episode. 1 (Videos of children exhibiting pertussis paroxysms are available at...|$|R

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease of airways with widespread narrowing of air passage {{which may be}} relieved spontaneously or {{as a result of}} therapy and, clinically it is characterized by <b>paroxysms</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea, <b>cough</b> and wheezing. Inflammation and broncho-constriction are the two major hallmarks in the pathology of Asthma. Shirishadi is a polyherbal drug used in the management of bronchial asthma by Ayurvedic practitioners from decades. Shirisha (Albezzia lebbeck), Nagarmotha (Cyprus rotandus) and Kantakari (Solanum xanthocarpum) are the ingredient herbs of this compound. Hence, the present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the bronchodilator and anti-anaphylactic activity of Shirishadi Polyherbal compound. Experimental models studied were egg albumin induced anaphylaxis in guinea pigs and Anti-Cholinergic activity was studied on Isolated Frog Heart and Frog Rectus Muscle. The extract produced 30 + 0. 23 % inhibition in maximum contraction produced by Acetylcholine which is much less than that produced by standard drug (99. 9 %), moreover the dose of extract that produced the visible effect is much higher than that used for therapeutic purpose suggesting that antiasthmatic effect of drug is not due to Acetylcholine antagonism activity. Neither Acetylcholine efficacy nor its potency decreases significantly with increasing dose of drug. Drug increased the cardiac tone and stimulate the cardiac contractility but unable to prevail over complete inhibition of heart rate produced by Acetylcholine. The drug produced significant protection against egg albumin induced anaphylactic shock characterized by decrease in intensity and delay in the development of symptoms of dyspnoea, asphyxia and collapse. All these findings reveal the bronchodilator and anti-anaphylactic activity of Shirishadi compound indicating its beneficial use in asthma...|$|R
