2500|$|The {{defendant}} {{and others}} were indicted for a conspiracy to conceal assets from a trustee in bankruptcy. The defendant Oppenheimer set up a previous adjudication upon a former indictment for the same offense that it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations in the bankruptcy act for offenses against that act; an adjudication since held to be wrong in another case. This defense was presented in four forms entitled respectively, demurrer, motion to quash, <b>plea</b> <b>in</b> <b>abatement,</b> and plea in bar. After motion by the Government that the defendant be required to elect which of the four he would stand upon he withdrew the last-mentioned two, and subsequently the court granted what was styled the motion to quash, ordered the indictment quashed and discharged the defendant without day. The Government brings this writ of error treating the so-called motion to quash as a plea in bar, which in substance it was.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have said}} that General McClellan's volume is rather a <b>plea</b> <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> of {{judgment}} than a report. It was perfectly proper that he should endeavor to put everything in its true light, {{and he would be}} sure of the sympathy of all right-minded men in so doing; but an ex parte statement at once rouses and justifies adverse criticism. He has omitted many documents essential to the formation of a just opinion; and it is only when we have read these also, in the Report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, that we feel the full weight of the cumulative evidence going to show the hearty support in men and confidence that he received from the Administration, and, when there were no more men to be sent, and confidence began to yield before irresistible facts, the prolonged forbearance with which he was still favored. Nothing can be kinder or more cordial than the despatches and letters both of the President and Mr. Stanton, down to the time when General McClellan wrote the following sentences {{at the end of an}} official communication addressed to the latter: [...] "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you, or to any other persons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this army." [...] (28th June, 1862.) We shall seek no epithet to characterize language like this. All but the most bigoted partisans will qualify it as it deserves. We have here a glaring example of that warping of good sense and good feeling which the consciousness of having a political stake at risk will produce in a gallant soldier and a courteous gentleman. Can General McClellan, after a year to grow cool in, either himself believe, or expect any one else to believe, that the President and the Secretary of War would [...] "do their best to sacrifice" [...] an army of a hundred and fifty thousand brave men, in order to lessen his possible chances as a candidate for the Presidency? It was of vastly more importance to them than to him that he should succeed. The dignified good temper of Mr. Lincoln's answer to this wanton insult does him honor: [...] "I have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements; I thought you were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I could. I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself." [...] Mr. Stanton could only be silent; and whatever criticisms may be made on some traits of his character, he is quite safe in leaving the rebuke of such an imputation to whoever feels that earnestness, devotion, and unflagging purpose are high qualities in a public officer.|$|E
50|$|At {{common law}} an {{abatement}} in pleading or <b>plea</b> <b>in</b> <b>abatement,</b> was a defence to legal proceedings, {{which did not}} contest {{the principle of the}} plaintiff's right to relief, but contended that the plaintiff had made a procedural error, and needed to bring fresh proceedings, which followed the correct procedure. The objection could deal with among others, place, time, or method of assertion. The <b>plea</b> <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> was abolished as a particular form of response by the defendant when common-law pleading was replaced by Code Pleading and later by pleading rules, such as the federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E
50|$|Successful {{assertion}} of <b>pleas</b> <b>in</b> <b>abatement,</b> merely pause proceedings until {{the problem is}} remedied. There were two fundamental styles of abatement. The first was <b>abatement</b> <b>in</b> proceedings which would merely suspend the proceeding until the error was fixed. <b>Abatement</b> <b>in</b> law would terminate it completely, although it could be restarted at the plaintiff's request. The second term is more common. It has now been abolished in {{most if not all}} common law jurisdictions.|$|R
60|$|Certainly I do {{not mean}} to say that a work of art should be looked at {{by the light of the}} artist's biography, or {{measured}} by our standard of his character. Nor do I reckon what was genuine in Petrarch--his love of letters, his refinement, his skill in the superficial graces of language, that rhetorical art by which the music of words supplants their meaning, and the verse moulds the thought instead of being plastic to it--after any such fashion. I have no ambition for that character of valet de chambre which is said to disenchant the most heroic figures into mere every-day personages, for it implies a mean soul no less than a servile condition. But we have a right to demand a certain amount of reality, however small, in the emotion of a man who makes it his business to endeavor at exciting our own. We have a privilege of nature to shiver before a painted flame, how cunningly soever the colors be laid on. Yet our love of minute biographical detail, our desire to make ourselves spies upon the men of the past, seems so much of an instinct in us, that we must look for the spring of it in human nature, and that somewhat deeper than mere curiosity or love of gossip. It should seem to arise from what must be considered on the whole a creditable feeling, namely, that we value character more than any amount of talent,--the skill to be something, above that of doing anything but the best of its kind. The highest creative genius, and that only, is privileged from arrest by this personality, for there the thing produced is altogether disengaged from the producer. But in natures incapable of this escape from themselves, the author is inevitably mixed with his work, and we have a feeling that the amount of his sterling character is the security for the notes he issues. Especially we feel so when truth to self, which is always self-forgetful, and not truth to nature, makes an essential part of the value of what is offered us; as where a man undertakes to narrate personal experience or to enforce a dogma. This is particularly true as respects sentimentalists, because of their intrusive self-consciousness; for there is no more universal characteristic of human nature than the instinct of men to apologize to themselves for themselves, and to justify personal failings by generalizing them into universal laws. A man would be the keenest devil's advocate against himself, were it not that he has always taken a retaining fee for the defence; for we think that the indirect and mostly unconscious <b>pleas</b> <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> which we read between the lines in the works of many authors are oftener written to set themselves right in their own eyes than in those of the world. And in the real life of the sentimentalist it is the same. He is under the wretched necessity of keeping up, at least in public, the character he has assumed, till he at last reaches that last shift of bankrupt self-respect, to play the hypocrite with himself. Lamartine, after passing round the hat in Europe and America, takes to his bed from wounded pride when the French Senate votes him a subsidy, and sheds tears of humiliation. Ideally, he resents it; in practical coin, he will accept the shame without a wry face.|$|R
50|$|Generally, a plea {{could be}} dilatory or peremptory. There were {{three kinds of}} dilatory plea: to the jurisdiction, in suspension, or <b>in</b> <b>abatement.</b> The first {{challenged}} the court's jurisdiction, the second {{asked the court to}} stay the action, and the third asked the court to dismiss the action without prejudice to the other side's right to bring the claims in another action or another court. A peremptory plea had only one kind: a <b>plea</b> <b>in</b> bar. A party making a <b>plea</b> <b>in</b> bar could either traverse the other side's pleading (i.e., deny all or some of the facts pleaded) or confess and avoid it (i.e., admit the facts pleaded but plead new ones that would dispel their effect). A traverse could be general (deny everything) or specific. Either side could plead imparlance in order to get more time to plead on the merits. Once the case was at issue, the defendant could reopen the pleadings in order to plead a newly discovered defense (and start the whole sequence again) by filing a plea puis darrein.|$|R

5000|$|Other special pleas used in {{criminal}} cases include the plea of mental incompetence, challenging {{the jurisdiction of the}} court over the defendant's person, the plea in bar, attacking the jurisdiction of the court over the crime charged, and the <b>plea</b> <b>in</b> <b>abatement,</b> which is used to address procedural errors in bringing the charges against the defendant, not apparent on the [...] "face" [...] of the indictment or other charging instrument. Special pleas in federal criminal cases have been abolished, and defenses formerly raised by special plea are now raised by motion to dismiss.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} the {{participation}} by an environmental group in a permit market does not necessarily result in more investment <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> or even less pollution. There is a U-shaped relationship between the emission per unit of output and the extra weight given by the environmental group to the reduction of emissions. For high values of this weight, firms invest less <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> but also produce less. For lower values, firms invest more <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> but also produce more, which may result in higher emissions levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} trade with heterogenous firms, where firms invest <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> technology and thereby {{have an impact on}} their level of emissions. The model shows how firm productivity and firm exports are both positively related to investments <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> technology. Emission intensity is, however, negatively related to firms' productivity and exports. The basic reason for these results is that a larger production scale supports more fixed investments <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> technology and, <b>in</b> turn, lower emissions per output. In contrast to the standard models of heterogeneous firms, firms' productivity, and thus export performance, is not exogenous, but endogeneously determined by firms' investment <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> technology. We derive closed form solutions for firm-level abatement investments and emissions per output, and test the empirical implications of the model using detailed Swedish firm-level data. The empirical results strongly support the model. CO 2 -emissions; heterogeneous firms; international trade...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the {{implications}} of corruption and political instability for firm investment <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> technology. <b>In</b> our theoretical set-up, a firm has an incentive to under-invest <b>in</b> <b>abatement</b> technology <b>in</b> order to gain a political advantage. The prediction that emerges is that greater corruptibility increases the level of abatement technology investment. This occurs because the strategic incentive to under-invest in pollution control technology declines when policymakers become more corruptible. Moreover, the model predicts that political instability raises abatement technology investment. Using steel-sector panel data from 41 countries for the years 1992 - 1998, we find empirical support for these predictions. ...|$|R
