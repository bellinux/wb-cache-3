50|$|In the full-cell process, {{the intent}} is to keep {{as much of the}} liquid absorbed into the wood during the <b>pressure</b> <b>period</b> as possible, thus leaving the maximum {{concentration}} of preservatives in the treated area. Usually, water solutions of preservative salts are employed with this process, but it is also possible to impregnate wood with oil. The desired retention is achieved by changing the strength of the solution. William Burnett patented this development in 1838 of full-cell impregnation with water solutions. The patent covered the use of zinc chloride on water basis, also known as Burnettizing. A full-cell process with oil was patented in 1838 by John Bethell. His patent described the injection of tar and oils into wood by applying pressure in closed cylinders. This process is still used today with some improvements.|$|E
40|$|Although sapwood of pine {{species is}} {{generally}} considered to be readily treated with preservatives, penetration is sometimes variable. The cause of this variability is poorly understood. This study evaluated the effect of geographic source, method of drying, and treatment parameters on penetration of a preservative in red pine lumber. Lumber from Wisconsin and Michigan was air or kiln dried and then conditioned to uniform equilibrium moisture content. Matched specimens were then treated with schedules that vaned in intensity of vacuum and <b>pressure</b> <b>periods.</b> The results indicate that penetration was influenced by anatomical properties inherent to the geographic source of the material. Adequate penetration was achieved using treatment schedules with longer <b>pressure</b> <b>periods,</b> but these schedules also resulted in higher weight gains.

50|$|The {{first rule}} regards the {{recording}} of moves. A player with {{less than five minutes}} remaining, in a game where there is not a 30-second or greater time increment per move, is not required to keep score as usual. However, if the player makes the time control, he must update the scoresheet before making a move as soon as the flag falls, marking expiry of the first, and now passed, time control. If only one player is in time trouble and not recording moves, the opponent's scoresheet may be used to update the score. In the case of mutual time pressure, where both players have stopped recording the moves, the tournament director or an assistant should be on hand to record the moves as they are played, and their notes can be used to update the scoresheets upon passage of the time control. If the game score is not recorded by anybody during the time <b>pressure</b> <b>period,</b> the players shall endeavor to reconstruct the moves of the game, {{under the control of the}} tournament director; if this is not possible the game continues with the next move being regarded as the first move of the next time control.|$|E

40|$|The geology and {{groundwater}} geochemistry are described for a 1400 km 2 breathing well zone within a Middle Devonian, karstic carbonate aquifer system in southwestern Ontario. Breathing wells are unusual because they draw in or emit {{large volumes of}} air, depending on fluctuations in atmospheric pressure which causes an exchange of gases between the atmosphere and the subsurface. To better understand this connection, geochemical, hydraulic, and barometric data were used to investigate interconnectivity within the breathing well zone. Spatial and temporal analyses reveal that {{a significant amount of}} unsaturated void space exists within the Lucas Formation, and that hypoxic and high CO 2 gases are emitted during low atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>periods.</b> The groundwater chemistry displays elevated trace metals (e. g.

Our results showed that the percent conidia germination and growth of germ tubes and mycelia of P. macadamiae were greatest at 26 degrees C, with better conidia germination associated with high relative humidity and free water.

Exposure of fruit stages later than match-head-sized and pea-sized fruit generally caused no further increases in disease incidence or premature abscission. Climatic conditions were found to have a strong influence on the behaviour of P. macadamiae, the host, oil accumulation, and the subsequent impact of husk spot on premature abscission. Our findings suggest that fungicide application should target fruit at the match-head-sized stage of development in order to best reduce yield losses, particularly in seasons where oil accumulation in fruit is prolonged and climatic conditions are optimal for P. macadamiae...|$|R
