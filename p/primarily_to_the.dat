5|$|During {{the late}} Third Intermediate Period, Old Kingdom {{mortuary}} temples enjoyed {{a revival of}} interest due <b>primarily</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archaizing style favoured by the kings of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 760–656 BCE).

5|$|King John {{undertook}} some building {{works at}} Windsor, but <b>primarily</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accommodation {{rather than the}} defences. The castle played a role during the revolt of the English barons: the castle was besieged in 1214, and John used the castle as his base during the negotiations before {{the signing of the}} Magna Carta at nearby Runnymede in 1215. In 1216 the castle was besieged again by baronial and French troops under the command of the Count of Nevers, but John's constable, Engelard de Cigogné, successfully defended it.|$|E
5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn <b>primarily</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> words. The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E
5|$|Protection of British {{interests}} in the region fell <b>primarily</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy, supported by the military forces of the East India Company. Naval strategy sought to eliminate enemy forces in the region and provide convoy protection to the large East Indiamen merchant ships and smaller company ships which transported goods and wealth between Britain and its Asian colonies and trade partners. The French Navy maintained commerce raiding operations in the region throughout the war; particularly light frigate squadrons and privateers deployed in an effort to disrupt British trade, supported as the conflict developed by the allies the French accrued {{in the course of the}} war, particularly the Batavian Republic and Spain.|$|E

5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due <b>primarily</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{technologies}} are characterized as either passive or active {{depending on the}} way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator.
