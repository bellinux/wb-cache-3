25|$|The QAPF diagram {{has four}} {{minerals}} or mineral groups chosen as important cornerstones of the classification. These are quartz (Q), Alkali feldspars (A), plagioclase feldspars (P), and feldspathoids (F). F and Q for chemical reasons {{can not exist}} together in one <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock.</b> Other minerals may and almost certainly occur in these rocks as well {{but they have no}} significance in this classification scheme. So, the whole diagram is actually composed of two ternary plots (QAP and FAP). To use the classification, the concentration (the mode) of these minerals must be known and recalculated to make their sum 100%. For example: a <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> that contains no alkali feldspar and no feldspathoids but contains lots of pyroxenes (neglected in this diagram), plagioclase feldspar and few quartz grains is probably gabbro (located at the right edge of the diagram, near P). This diagram does not determine whether a rock is gabbro, diorite, or anorthosite. There are another criteria used to decide that. Note that this diagram is not used for all plutonic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are the most important plutonic rocks that have separate classification diagrams.|$|E

60|$|After a short halt {{to examine}} the rude ruins {{reported}} by Mr. Clarke,[EN#21] we resumed the ascent of the Surr, whose left bank still defines {{the eastern edge of}} the Shárr. The latter presently puts forth the jagged spine of black and repulsive <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock,</b> which notes the Sha'b Makhúl, the corresponding versant of the Nakb Abú Sha'r. The Bedawin, who, as usual, luxuriate in nomenclature, distinguish between the eastern and western faces of the same block, and between the Wadys of the scarp and the counter-scarp. For instance, the eastern front of the Ras el-Kusayb is called Abú Kurayg (Kurayj). This is natural, as the formations, often of a different material, show completely different features.|$|E
60|$|Only {{one other}} rock, met with in both {{arms of the}} Beagle Channel, deserves any notice, namely a granulo-crystalline mixture of white albite, black {{hornblende}} (ascertained by measurement of the crystals, and confirmed by Professor Miller), and more or less of brown mica, but without any quartz. This rock occurs in large masses, closely resembling in external form granite or syenite: in the southern arm of the Channel, one such mass underlies the mica-slate, on which clay-slate was superimposed: this peculiar <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock</b> which, as we have seen, occurs also in Hardy Peninsula, is interesting, from its perfect similarity with that (hereafter often {{to be referred to}} under the name of andesite) forming the great injected axes of the Cordillera of Chile.|$|E

The granulitic impactites, however, have bulk and mineral compositions that fall {{between the two groups}} defined by the pristine nonmare samples of Warren and Wasson (1977). Thus the granulitic impactites may have originated by metamorphism of mixed impactites in early breccia sheets. The catalog, representative of the lunar crust before the end of heavy bombardment, suggests a crust with over 78 vol. % plagioclase and about equal proportions of material with noritic and troctolitic affinity...|$|R
6000|$|Thence {{we passed}} through the dry Báb ("sea gap"), cut by a torrent in the regular line of the coralline cliff, {{the opening of the}} Wady Melláh, off which lay our Sambúk. Marching up the Wady Maka'dah, our {{experienced}} eyes detected many small outcrops of quartz, formerly unobserved, in the sole and on the banks. The granite hills, here as throughout Midian, were veined and dyked with two different classes of <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock.</b> The red and pink are felsites or fine-grained porphyries; the black and bottle-green are the coarse-grained varieties, easily disintegrating, and forming hollows [Illustration with caption: Fortification on the cliff commanding the right bank of Wady Sharma'.] in the harder granite. The ride was made charming by the frontage of picturesque Jebel 'Urnub, with its perpendicular Pinnacles upon rock-sheets dropping clear a thousand feet; its jutting bluffs; its three huge flying Buttresses, that seemed to support the mighty wall-crest; and its many spits and [...] "organs," [...] some capped with finials that assume the aspect of logan-stones. There was no want of animal life, and the yellow locusts were abroad; one had been seized by a little lizard which showed all the violent muscular action of the crocodile. There were small long-eared hares, suggesting the leporide; sign of gazelles appeared; and the Bedawin spoke of wolves and hyenas, foxes and jackals.|$|E
6000|$|The space, {{from under}} which {{volcanic}} matter on the 20th was actually erupted, is 720 miles in one line, and 400 miles in another line {{at right angles}} to the first: hence, in all probability, a subterranean lake of lava is here stretched out, of nearly double the area of the Black Sea. From the intimate and complicated manner in which the elevatory and eruptive forces were shown to be connected during this train of phenomena, we may confidently {{come to the conclusion that}} the forces which slowly and by little starts uplift continents, and those which at successive periods pour forth volcanic matter from open orifices, are identical. From many reasons, I believe that the frequent quakings of the earth on this line of coast are caused by the rending of the strata, necessarily consequent on the tension of the land when upraised, and their injection by fluidified rock. This rending and injection would, if repeated often enough (and we know that earthquakes repeatedly affect the same areas in the same manner), form a chain of hills;--and the linear island of St. Mary, which was upraised thrice the height of the neighbouring country, seems to be undergoing this process. I believe that the solid axis of a mountain differs in its manner of formation from a volcanic hill, only in the molten stone having been repeatedly injected, instead of having been repeatedly ejected. Moreover, I believe that it is impossible to explain the structure of great mountain-chains, such as that of the Cordillera, where the strata, capping the injected axis of <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock,</b> have been thrown on their edges along several parallel and neighbouring lines of elevation, except on this view of the rock of the axis having been repeatedly injected, after intervals sufficiently long to allow the upper parts or wedges to cool and become solid;--for if the strata had been thrown into their present highly-inclined, vertical, and even inverted positions, by a single blow, the very bowels of the earth would have gushed out; and instead of beholding abrupt mountain-axes of rock solidified under great pressure, deluges of lava would have flowed out at innumerable points on every line of elevation.

6000|$|Early on March 14th we {{ascended the}} Wady el-Káimah, which showed a {{singular}} spectacle, and read us another lecture upon {{the diversity of}} formation which distinguishes this region. An abrupt turn then led over rough ground, the lower folds of the Umm Furút, where a great granite gorge, the Nakb Abú Shár, ran up to a depression in the dorsum, an apparently practicable Col. Suddenly the rocks assumed the quaintest hues and forms. The quartz, slaty-blue and black, was here spotted and streaked with a dull, dead white, as though stained by the droppings of myriad birds: there it lay veined and marbled with the most vivid of rainbow colours-- reds and purples, greens and yellows, set off by the pale chalky white. Evident signs of work were remarked in a made road running up to the Jebel el-Marú (proper), whose strike is 38° (mag.), and whose dip is westward. It is an arête, a cock's-comb of snowy quartz some sixty feet high by forty-five broad at the base; crowning a granitic fold that descends abruptly, with a deep fall on either side, from the [...] "Mother of Plenty." [...] This strangely isolated wall, left standing by the denudation that swept away the containing stone, had been broken by perpendicular rifts into four distinct sections; the colour became whiter as it neared the coping, and each rock was crowned with a capping that sparkled like silver in the sudden glance of the [...] "cloud-compelling" [...] sun. The sight delighted us; and M. Lacaze here made {{one of his most}} effective croquis, showing the explorers reduced to the size of ants. As yet we had seen nothing of the kind; nor shall we see a similar vein till we reach Abú'l-Marwah, near our farthest southern point. I expected a corresponding formation upon the opposite eastern versant: we found only a huge crest, a spine of black <b>plutonic</b> <b>rock,</b> intensely ugly and repulsive. As we rode back down the [...] "Valley of the Perpendiculars," [...] the aspect of the Jebel el-Marú was épâtant--to use another favourite camp-word. Standing sharply out from its vague and gloomy background made gloomier by the morning mists, the Col, whose steep rain-cut slopes and sole were scattered with dark trees and darker rocks, this glittering wall became the shell of an enchanted castle in Gustave Doré.|$|E

30|$|Past {{geomagnetic}} field intensity (paleointensity) provides important information to constrain the deep Earth dynamics and evolution. For paleointensity studies, {{it is crucial}} to test the fidelity of various rock types as paleointensity recorders. The fidelity of lavas have been confirmed by comparing paleointensity estimates from historical lavas with a known field intensity (e.g., Coe and Grommé, 1973; Oishi et al., 2005), although actual paleointensity reconstruction is far from trivial due to the complexity of natural materials. Unfortunately, lavas are prone to weathering, so fresh samples are difficult to obtain for the geological past. Consequently, many high-quality paleointensity data for the Precambrian originate from <b>plutonic</b> <b>rocks</b> (Tarduno et al., 2007; Selkin et al., 2008; Donadini et al., 2011).
