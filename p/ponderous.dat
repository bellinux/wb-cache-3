5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look <b>ponderous</b> and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a <b>ponderous</b> fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E
5|$|After a {{succession}} of counterattacks, {{toward the end of}} August the Libyans finally drove the 400 Chadian soldiers out of the town. This victory–the first by Libyan ground forces {{since the start of the}} Toyota War–was apparently achieved through close-range air strikes, which were followed by ground troops advancing cross-country in jeeps, Toyota all-terrain trucks, and light armored vehicles. For the Libyans, who had previously relied on <b>ponderous</b> tracked armour, the assault represented a conversion to the desert warfare tactics developed by FANT. To highlight the victory, Gaddafi flew foreign journalists to the region, so the news of his victory could reach the headlines.|$|E
5|$|Embuscade was {{the next}} to surrender, having been {{battered}} in the opening exchanges by Magnanime, and further damaged by long-range fire from Foudroyant during the pursuit. Overhauled by several larger British ships, Captain de la Ronciére surrendered at 11:30 rather than allow his ship to be destroyed. Magnanime, suffering the effects of her engagement with Hoche, took possession of Embuscade and continued to follow slowly behind {{the rest of the}} fleet, while Robust, which had suffered severely in her duel with Hoche, remained alongside her erstwhile opponent to take possession. The direction of the French squadron's flight, following the direction of the wind, took them across the path of the straggling British ships, beginning with the Foudroyant. Most of the frigates were able outrun this <b>ponderous</b> enemy, but Bellone was less fortunate and a speculative shot from the battleship detonated a case of grenades in one of her topmasts. This began a disastrous fire which was eventually brought under control, but at a significant cost in speed. She was soon closely attacked by Melampus and suffered further damage. Nearby, the struggling Coquille surrendered after being outrun by the approaching Canada; Warren ordered the slowly following Magnanime to take possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} Romanticism {{began to show}} in the farmhouses around the mid-19th century, shortly after its debut in the estates. Like their neoclassical predecessors, they took as much {{inspiration}} from popular German forms as from the landowners' homes. The farmhouses built during this period are large, square, hipped-roof structures with <b>ponderous</b> cornices and large porches to match. While there are no houses in this style left in the district, some older barns and other farm buildings show it.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing GA-1 (company {{designation}} Model 10) was {{an armored}} triplane. Designed in 1919, it was {{powered by a}} pair of modified Liberty engines driving pusher propellers. The first of the Engineering Division's heavily armored GAX series (ground attack, experimental) aircraft, the <b>ponderous</b> airplane was intended to strafe ground troops while remaining immune to attack from the ground as well as from other enemy aircraft. It was so well armored that its five-ton weight proved excessive.|$|E
25|$|A {{poll found}} that Dryden's {{potential}} pool of support exceeded that of his opponents, due mainly to his former NHL career. However, his fundraising efforts left him well behind the top tier of leadership contenders (Michael Ignatieff, Gerard Kennedy, Stéphane Dion and Bob Rae). A variety of media pundits criticized Dryden's <b>ponderous</b> speaking style and limited French. Supporters argued that few people were strongly opposed to him and that if he ran he could attract more support on later ballots as a consensus candidate.|$|E
25|$|It {{should also}} be noted that it was usually only the frigates which took prizes; the ships of the line were far too <b>ponderous</b> to be able to chase and capture the smaller ships which {{generally}} carried treasure. Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little. This was not that he had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail.|$|E
25|$|This {{elaborate}} structure often appears <b>ponderous</b> to Western eyes, but it {{was extremely}} well adapted {{to the demands of}} the war effort, and its built in overlapping, duplication and redundancy made it resilient and able to adjust to defections, captures or deaths among its members. While the North Vietnamese and their allies made elaborate attempts to camouflage the organizational arrangements that drove the war, it is important to note that both the armed Viet Cong (properly the PLAF), and the regular troops of the NVA were ultimately one joint force. Each had its distinct local characteristics, recruitment paths, resource bases, and missions, but collectively they were controlled as one by Hanoi, and are treated as such in official communist histories of the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to different backgrounds and histories, {{each of the}} races have characteristic philosophies of starship design. Minmatar ships tend to be quite fast but fragile, and rely on their high speed maneuverability to evade the tracking systems of heavier weapons, while themselves using projectile weapons such as artillery or autocannons, more sophisticated kin to today's munitions technology. Amarr ships are <b>ponderous</b> and densely armored and pack batteries of powerful laser-based energy weaponry. Gallente ships are sleek and well designed and armored and specialize in deploying fleets of robotic drones while mounting hybrid weapons that operate using superconducting magnets to accelerate mass toward targets at great speed (see Railgun). Finally, Caldari ships are typically poorly armored and not particularly fast but utilize powerful energy shields, and make extensive use of torpedo/missile launchers and hybrid guns, favoring engagement at extreme ranges. However, there are exceptions to these general rules in each race.|$|E
25|$|Their parents' {{marriage}} was unhappy, however, particularly as Maria Clotilde preferred the quieter, more duty-filled life {{that she felt}} they should maintain, while Napoléon Joseph preferred the faster, more entertainment-filled lifestyle of the French court. Another factor in their unhappy {{marriage was}} the circumstances leading up to their espousal. Maria Clotilde had been only 15 when they were married, while he had been over 37 years old. The marriage had also been negotiated out of political reasons during the conference of Plombières (July 1858). As Maria Clotilde was too young at the time for marriage, Napoléon Joseph had {{had to wait until}} the following year; many had disapproved of the speed he undertook collecting his young bride in Turin. Their marriage was often compared to that of an elephant and a gazelle; the bridegroom had strong Napoleonic features (broad, bulky, and <b>ponderous)</b> while the bride appeared frail, short, fair-haired, and with the characteristic nose of the House of Savoy.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the shell varies between 50mm and 165mm, its {{diameter}} between 100mm and 120mm. The large, <b>ponderous,</b> shell has a conical shape, appearing subperforate. It is covered by a corneous striate, brown or yellowish cuticle usually lost on the upper whorls. Its color beneath the cuticle is white, longitudinally striped with crimson, violet or reddish brown. The base of the shell is maculate or radiately strigate with a lighter shade of the same. The spire is strictly conical. The apex is acute, usually eroded. The shell contains 8-10 whorls. The upper ones are tuberculate at the sutures, and spirally beaded, the following flat on their outer surfaces, smooth, separated by linear suture. The body whorl is expanded, dilated and compressed at the obtuse periphery, more or less convex below, indented at the axis. The umbilical tract is covered by a spiral pearly deeply entering callus. The aperture is transverse and very oblique. The columella is oblique, terminating in a denticle below, and with a strong spiral fold above, deeply inserted into the axis. The operculum is circular, thin, corneous, orange-brown, and composed of about 10 whorls.|$|E
25|$|Hercules and Cacus was {{commissioned}} by the Medici pope Clement VII, who had been shown a wax model. The supplied block of Carrara marble was not big enough to execute Bandinelli's wax model. He had to make new wax models, {{one of which was}} chosen by the pope as the final draft. Bandinelli had already carved the sculpture as far as the abdomen of Hercules, when during the 1527 Sack of Rome, the pope was taken prisoner. Meanwhile, in Florence, republican enemies of the Medici took advantage of the chaos to exile Ippolito de' Medici. Bandinelli, a supporter of the Medici, was also exiled. In 1530 Emperor Charles V retook Florence after a long siege. Pope Clement VII subsequently installed his illegitimate son Alessandro de' Medici as duke of Tuscany. Bandinelli then returned to Florence and continue work on the statue till completed in 1534, and transported from the Opera del Duomo to its present marble pedestal. But from the moment it was unveiled, it faced ridicule; Cellini compared the <b>ponderous</b> group to 'a sack full of melons'. Afterwards, the Bandinelli tried to sabotage Cellini's career. The statue was restored between February and April 1994.|$|E
25|$|From then {{until the}} dawn of the French Revolution, English modes of {{decoration}} in bookplates, as in most other chattels, follow at some years' distance the ruling French taste. The main characteristics of the style which prevailed during the Queen Anne and early Georgian periods are: ornamental frames suggestive of carved oak, a frequent use of fish-scales, trellis or diapered patterns, for the decoration of plain surfaces; and, in the armorial display, a marked reduction in the importance of the mantling. The introduction of the scallop-shell as an almost constant element of ornamentation gives already a foretaste of the Rocaille-Coquille, the so-called Chippendale fashions of the next reign. During the middle third of the century this rococo style (of which the Convers plate gives a typical sample) affects the bookplate as universally as all other decorative objects. Its chief element is a fanciful arrangement of scroll and shell work with curveting acanthus-like sprays—an arrangement which in the examples of the best period is generally made asymmetrical in order to give freer scope for a variety of countercurves. Straight or concentric lines and all appearances of flat surface are studiously avoided; the helmet and its symmetrical mantling tends to disappear, and is replaced by the plain crest on a fillet. The earlier examples of this manner are tolerably <b>ponderous</b> and simple. Later, however, the composition becomes exceedingly light and complicated; every conceivable and often incongruous element of decoration is introduced, from cupids to dragons, from flowerets to Chinese pagodas. During the early part of George III.'s reign there is a return to greater sobriety of ornamentation, and a style more truly national, which may be called the urn style, makes its appearance. Bookplates of this period have invariably a physiognomy which at once recalls the decorative manner made popular by architects and designers such as Chambers, the Adams, Josiah Wedgwood, Hepplewhite and Sheraton. The shield shows a plain spade-like outline, manifestly based upon that of the pseudo-classic urn then very alive. The ornamental accessories are symmetrical palms and sprays, wreaths and ribands. The architectural boss is also an important factor. In many plates, indeed, the shield of arms takes quite a subsidiary position {{by the side of the}} predominantly architectural urn.|$|E
500|$|Melody Maker {{reviewer}} similarly opined: [...] "From whichever direction one approaches Wish You Were Here, {{it still}} sounds unconvincing in its <b>ponderous</b> sincerity and displays a critical lack of imagination in all departments." ...|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Fred Licht {{notes that}} Goya's brushwork appears [...] "clumsy, <b>ponderous,</b> and rough" [...] and lacking finish compared to his earlier work. Licht believes {{this was a}} deliberate ploy to physically convey dismay at human inadequacy and his own feelings of personal doubt. Unique in the series, Witches' Sabbath was not significantly altered by Goya after his initial work.|$|E
500|$|In 1912, the Norwegian {{explorer}} Roald Amundsen {{wrote of}} the Ross expedition that [...] "Few people of the present day are capable of rightly appreciating this heroic deed, this brilliant proof of human courage and energy. With two <b>ponderous</b> craft - regular [...] "tubs" [...] according to our ideas - these men sailed right {{into the heart of}} the pack , which all previous explorers had regarded as certain death ... These men were heroes - heroes in the highest sense of the word." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, he {{released}} his autobiography, Transformed, which was co-written by Peter Jeffs. It received generally positive reviews: Christianity Magazine said {{the book was}} a [...] "disarmingly honest account of Primus's triumphs and struggles {{on and off the}} pitch" [...] while FourFourTwo described it as [...] "an antidote to the 'me-me-me' tales that weigh down the shelves". Rival football magazine When Saturday Comes was more critical, pointing out its [...] "sometimes ungrammatical and often <b>ponderous</b> style" [...] and going on to say [...] " [...] book is also full of cliches".|$|E
500|$|Evening {{found the}} fleets {{approximately}} [...] apart, sailing northwest. Both were conducting hasty repairs {{and attempting to}} ready themselves for what all assumed would be another day of battle on 30 May. Significantly, Lord Howe was unaware that to the northeast, over the same sea as the previous day's action had been fought, the <b>ponderous</b> convoy of merchant ships was passing, having successfully evaded British pursuit. Unlike his opponent Villaret knew {{the location of the}} convoy, which was joined that evening by the battered Montagnard. Escorting the convoy, Admiral Nielly had been apprised of the situation by Montagnards captain, and had left his escort duties to reinforce Villaret.|$|E
500|$|David Blair {{stated that}} [...] "Mugabe's {{collected}} writings amount to {{nothing more than}} crude Marxism, couched in the <b>ponderous</b> English of the mission school", remarking that they were heavily informed by Marx, Mao Zedong, and Frantz Fanon, and displayed little originality. Blair noted that Mugabe's writings called for [...] "command economics in a peasant society, mixed with anti-colonial nationalism", and that in this he held [...] "the same opinions as almost every other African guerrilla leader" [...] of that period. Mugabe argued that following the overthrow of European colonial regimes, Western countries continued to keep African countries {{in a state of}} subservience because they desired the continent's natural resources while preventing it from industrialising.|$|E
500|$|Three {{tracks that}} each clock at over six minutes {{make up the}} second half. [...] Each is in a plodding Black Sabbath-esque sludge metal style with <b>ponderous</b> lyrics of unrelenting self-hate. [...] On [...] "Three Nights" [...] Rollins compares himself to feces stuck to his shoe: [...] "And I've been {{grinding}} that stink into the dirt/ For a long time now". [...] Against a slow, heavy, start-and-stop bass riff and a constant drum thudding, Rollins closes [...] "Scream" [...] with a bellow after delivering the Ginn-penned lines: [...] "I may be a big baby/ But I'll scream in your ear/ 'Til I find out/ Just what it is I am doing here".|$|E
500|$|Its {{influence}} {{can be seen in}} the dismissive {{stare and}} overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, [...] "Stein's <b>ponderous</b> bulk and sexual preference". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her [...] "massive, monumental presence". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, [...] "That's Madame Bertin!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber of the New York-based Daily News {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "It suffers from a {{similarly}} meandering melody and <b>ponderous</b> progression. The grandeur of its arrangement easily upstages the tune", but [...] "even so, the luster of Adele's tone, and the bravura arc of her vocal, makes it enjoyable enough. And, fifty years down the line, isn't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} too soon to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", but at the same time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E
500|$|The 8th plenum of the 5th Central Committee (10–17 June 1985)and its antecedents the 6th (3–10 July 1984) and the 7th (11–17 December 1984) plenumsinstructed {{the party}} to direct a {{performance}} review of its organization, personnel and efficiency. Lê Đức Thọ, head of the Central Organizing Commission, said the party had become [...] "a cumbersome and <b>ponderous</b> mechanism, only marginally efficient, marked by ill-defined responsibilities and poorly divided functions." [...] He further stated that confusion within the party over operational responsibilities between the central party leadership, mass organizations and the state, and between higher and lower party echelons had developed into a serious problem, and that a cynical collective mindset within the party had taken hold and manifested itself through corruption, inflexibility and dishonesty.|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} critic Martha Bayles, Tommy did not mix rock with {{classical}} music, as its [...] "rock opera" [...] title may have suggested, but instead was [...] "dominated by the Who's mature style: <b>ponderous,</b> rhythmically monotonous hard rock". Bayles {{argued that it}} was more acceptable to audiences than the art rock [...] "concoctions" [...] of the time because of the cultural climate during the late 1960s: [...] "Tommy was considered more authentic, precisely because it consists of hard rock, rather than doctored-up Mussorgsky... and avoids the typical pseudoromantic themes of art rock (fairy-tale bliss and apocalyptic angst) in favor of the more up-to-date subject of popular culture itself." [...] High Fidelity magazine also characterized the Who's album as a [...] "reasonably hard-rock version" [...] of the opera.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Max Jakob Friedländer notes how St. George seems hesitant and {{unsure of}} himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. He has a very young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedländer [...] "forms a strange contrast to the aged, <b>ponderous</b> canon". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet while simultaneously presenting the donor, and [...] "this seems to embarrass him". George is the only figure whose feet are exposed. The uncertain manner in which he gestures to the Virgin gives {{the impression of a}} shy and uncertain nature; and he raises his helmet in a hesitant manner. Friedländer observes that George's head is slightly inclined, his face [...] "twisted into an empty smile".|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s Gielgud had more successes as a {{director}} than as an actor. He directed the first London performance of Britten's opera A Midsummer Night's Dream (1961) at Covent Garden and Hugh Wheeler's Big Fish, Little Fish on Broadway, the latter winning him a Tony for Best Direction of a Play in 1961. His performance as Othello at Stratford {{in the same year}} was less successful; Franco Zeffirelli's production was thought <b>ponderous</b> and Gielgud [...] "singularly unvehement." [...] As Gaev in The Cherry Orchard to the Ranevskaya of Ashcroft he had the best of the notices; his co-star and the production received mixed reviews. The following year Gielgud directed Richardson in The School for Scandal, first at the Haymarket and then on a North American tour, which he joined as, in his words, [...] "the oldest Joseph Surface in the business." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Alonso Duralde of TheWrap {{said the}} film [...] "serves up jokes that don't land and thrills that don't thrill." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ant-Man [...] "is a lightweight, cliché-riddled origins story that veers between inside-joke comedy, <b>ponderous</b> {{redemption}} story lines and admittedly nifty CGI sequences that still seem relatively insignificant {{compared to the}} high stakes and city-shattering destruction {{that take place in}} most of the Avengers movies." [...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Ant-Man is a cut-and-shut muddle, haunted by [...] ghost, produced by a high-end hot dog factory, by turns giddying and stupefying." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that it is [...] "a film that will surely be popular, given Marvel's marketing might, but one that's woefully short on coherence and originality." [...] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said, [...] "It's difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly. Which, from all available evidence, is exactly what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Benton Quest, age 55, {{retired from}} {{government}} research and operated from the [...] "Quest Compound" [...] {{on the coast}} of Maine. Driven by curiosity, he was [...] "consulted by individuals, governments and corporations" [...] to investigate enigmatic events. Described as [...] "single-minded—almost to the point of obsession—in his pursuit of knowledge", he often encountered trouble as [...] "his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self-preservation." [...] Jessie appreciated his <b>ponderous</b> sense of humor. The show's promoters summarized him as the [...] "benevolent king" [...] archetype. Bandit the family dog also appeared in the series. Lawrence removed Bandit's clownish origins, stressing that Bandit could not understand English, nor reliably save the family from perilous situations. Summarizing the group's behavior, Lawrence wrote, [...] "Jonny's response to danger will be close to Race's. Jessie's intrigue with mysterious, unexplained phenomena will be close to Dr. Quest's and Hadji, with his roots in a different culture and a more spiritual approach to life, is different again." ...|$|E
500|$|For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post {{thought the}} film was [...] "undeniably easy on the eyes", and further added [...] "maybe too easy to prevent the mind from {{wandering}} and the lids from drooping." [...] Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces, calling them [...] "more <b>ponderous</b> than sensational" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from [...] "From Russia, With Love" [...] or [...] "You Only Live Twice" [...] or [...] "The Spy Who Loved Me" [...] or [...] "Moonraker." [...] This is a Bond waiting for something inspired to push it over the top." [...] The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that [...] "For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot" [...] although he did say that the film is [...] "slick entertainment" [...] with a tone that is [...] "consistently comic even when the material is not." ...|$|E
500|$|However, The Guardians Alexis Petridis {{review was}} very negative. She criticised Burgess' vocal styling as [...] "the Awful Falsetto", saying that [...] "not even {{a mass of}} special effects can stop Burgess' {{shortcomings}} shining through", and calling the track one of the album's new ideas that [...] "flop". Similarly, Matt D'Cruz from Drowned in Sound also criticised Burgess' [...] "strained" [...] vocal, calling it [...] "proving a poor fit for the Chems' stuttering rave pianos and <b>ponderous</b> beats." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media agreed on the [...] "unremarkable verses and nasally vocals", although the song, along with [...] "Galvanize", {{reminded him of the}} duo's [...] "early B-Boy/techno days," [...] but both of them missing the ferocity and sub-bass rattlings of their [...] "earlier cousins." [...] The latter song was also said by Plagenhoef to be [...] "far better." [...] Another negative review came from Slant Magazine, where journalist Eric Henderson called the track one of the album's [...] "unsuccessful interpolations of UK grime." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1921, Barrymore portrayed {{a wealthy}} Frenchman in New York {{in the film}} The Lotus Eater, with Colleen Moore. In September, Barrymore and Oelrichs went to Europe on holiday; cracks were {{appearing}} in their relationship, and {{she fell in love}} with a poet during their extended stay in Venice. In October, Oelrichs returned to New York and Barrymore traveled to London to film the exterior scenes for his latest movie, Sherlock Holmes, in which he played the title role. He then returned to New York to work on the film's interior scenes in January 1922. Barrymore became involved in the pre-production work for the film and provided designs for Moriarty's lair. The film was released later that year and was generally thought [...] "a little dull and <b>ponderous,</b> with too many intertitles", although James W. Dean of The Evening News of Harrisburg opined that [...] "the personality of Barrymore is the film's transcendent quality".|$|E
500|$|However Fraser McAlpine {{gave the}} song a mixed review, {{awarding}} it {{three out of}} five stars. He pointed out that fans of the group would be divided on the song. [...] "Something hidden deep in the song's DNA is engagingly bad, or worryingly good, and it's got everyone's quality alarms jangling like a wind-chime in a hurricane ... appreciation for the bit where they sing [...] "begging to get back together" ... It's slow, moody, <b>ponderous,</b> a little bit boring at times, but {{when it gets to}} that bit, it's ... the good bit." [...] He also called the song a [...] "grower" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review saying, [...] "'Missing You' is a post-break-up song with a modishly rave-tinged production... and after a few spins the chorus wiggles into your brain like a tapeworm that missed the turning marked 'digestive tract' ... The charts? Sorted. Your hearts? Well, that's a matter of personal preference of course, but, the odd rocky patch excepted, they've had ours since 'Up'." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Knight of the National Post {{wrote that}} the film was able to capture the wistfulness and the {{unpredictable}} tone of Ishiguro's novel, but added that it [...] "spills the beans much sooner". Mark Jenkins of NPR called Never Let Me Go a [...] "remarkably successful adaptation" [...] of Ishiguro's book, but acknowledged that Romanek and Garland [...] "do make a few missteps", which were mostly {{the result of the}} limitations imposed by turning the novel's contents into a film. Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman described the film as feeling like a [...] "period piece" [...] and rated it a C+. Reuterss Stephen Farber called the film a disappointment, because although it was [...] "expertly acted, impeccably photographed, intelligently written" [...] and [...] "even intermittently touching", Never Let Me Go is [...] "too parched and <b>ponderous</b> to connect with a large audience". He said the film should have laid out more completely the logic of its parallel universe, such as the cloning process. He found its theme of the dangers of medical experimentation [...] "rather tired".|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and <b>ponderous</b> rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole thing could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|E
500|$|Andy Shaw of Grovel on {{the other}} hand had a more {{negative}} response, praising the artwork of Dave McKean and calling it [...] "brilliant", but criticized Morrison's story as claustrophobic and [...] "has more <b>ponderous</b> psychology than action and, as a result, not enough room to fit any decent action in." [...] Shaw would later add that Morrison's work [...] "doesn't stand up to his rivals," [...] and that [...] "mixing the history of the asylum – famous dumping ground for Batman's psychotic foes – with a typical Batman adventure is interesting enough, but Morrison throws too much at the hero in too small a space. This makes Batman's journey through Arkham's finest nutters appear too easy – more of a stroll through a fairground haunted house with a few old chums than a serious battle for his life. Coupled with an anti-climatic ending, there's little feeling of impending disaster – the chronicled event should probably appear in Batman's casebook of over-hyped walkovers." [...] Morrison himself admitted that the amount of symbolism made him [...] " [...] up being accused of doing the most pretentious Batman book ever.|$|E
