The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour.

It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

Before writing this work I first studied the essential literature concerning the management <b>of</b> <b>law</b> firms, particularly regarding the possibility <b>of</b> <b>process</b> management in these companies. Then I studied the literature on process management and modeling. After a literature search, I attended a meeting with a midsize law firm manager, who provided me with valuable information about the specifics and problems in the field. My main goal was to emphasize the uniqueness <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> firms field, where the functional management model prevails over the process management model, to design general process model, to map the key <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> the functions of the software solutions available on the Czech market and to discuss the need for or the appropriateness <b>of</b> introducing <b>process</b> management in companies in advocacy field. Chapter Theoretical background and issues of the field includes introduction to the issue <b>of</b> functional and <b>process</b> company management in the law firm field, and explains how broad concept the law firm may be, and introduces the readers with the critical factors in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>process</b> management.
