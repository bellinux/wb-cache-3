500|$|The {{pitch is}} {{surrounded}} by four all-seater stands – the Medway Stand, the Rainham End, the Gordon Road Stand and the Brian Moore Stand. All are covered {{with the exception of}} the Brian Moore Stand. [...] The Medway Stand, which replaced the old Main Stand and part of the terracing at each end, is the largest and northernmost of the four. It has two tiers with a row of twenty executive boxes between the top and bottom tier. The stand also contains the changing rooms, physiotherapy facilities, club offices and club shop. [...] The Rainham End, located behind the goal at the eastern end of the pitch, opened in 1999 and houses 2,400fans. [...] This stand, like the terrace it replaced, is known for housing the club's most vocal supporters. [...] The Gordon Road Stand, which seats 2,600, was opened in 1997 and is opposite the Medway Stand. [...] Due to <b>planning</b> <b>requirements,</b> the stand had a height restriction placed upon it, making it significantly lower than the other three sides of the ground, and due to the road layout behind it is narrower at one end than the other. [...] A gantry for television cameras is located on the roof of this stand.|$|E

At that time its role was expanded to include emergency management for all disasters and coordination of recovery and response activities statewide.|$|E

5000|$|Determining if a {{facility}} {{is subject to}} the EPCRA emergency <b>planning</b> <b>requirements</b> is straightforward. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published a list of [...] "extremely hazardous substances (EHS)." [...] For each EHS, the list includes the name, the Chemical Abstract Service number of the substance, and a number called a threshold planning quantity (TPQ). The TPQ, expressed in pounds, is the critical number. If {{a facility}} has within its boundaries an amount of an extremely hazardous substance equal to or in excess of its threshold planning quantity, the facility {{is subject to the}} EPCRA emergency <b>planning</b> <b>requirements</b> and must notify both the SERC and the LEPC of this fact. The facility must also appoint an emergency response coordinator who will work with the LEPC on developing and implementing the local emergency plan at the facility.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, Australian {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} (OHS) regulators have increasingly changed the form of OHS standards from the traditional approach of detailed and prescriptive standards to performance and process-based standards, typically requiring duty holders to identify hazards and assess and control risks. The Division of Workplace Health and Safety Queensland has complemented these developments in the building and construction industry with a documentation standard, the workplace health and safety (WHS) work <b>plan</b> <b>requirement.</b> This article outlines the work <b>plan</b> <b>requirement</b> and reports on a study of the early stages of its implementation in Queensland. It concludes that regulatory provisions such as the work <b>plan</b> <b>requirement</b> are an important dimension of modern WHS regulations, but that the successful implementation of such requirements in a regulatory environment which has not yet fully embraced the principles of risk management {{is likely to be a}} slow process...|$|R
