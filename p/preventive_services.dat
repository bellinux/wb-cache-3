5|$|Parents of {{children}} with Asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age. Developmental screening during a routine check-up by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation. The United States <b>Preventive</b> <b>Services</b> Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there are no concerns.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US <b>Preventive</b> <b>Services</b> Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening {{people who are at}} high risk for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States <b>Preventive</b> <b>Services</b> Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E

5|$|The United States <b>Preventive</b> <b>Services</b> Task Force (USPSTF) {{recommends}} yearly screening using low-dose {{computed tomography}} {{in those who}} have a total smoking history of 30 pack-years and are between 55 and 80 years old until a person has not been smoking for more than 15 years. Screening should not be done in those with other health problems that would make treatment of lung cancer if found not an option. The English National Health Service was in 2014 re-examining the evidence for screening.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States <b>Preventive</b> <b>Services</b> Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
5|$|President Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female {{contraception}} {{was added to}} a list of <b>preventive</b> <b>services</b> covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.|$|E

5|$|The Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare is {{responsible}} for planning, implementation and monitoring of all facilities related to health and <b>preventive</b> <b>services.</b> –11, the city had 50 government hospitals, 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds, fewer than half the required 25,000. For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 17.6 hospital beds, 9 specialist doctors, 14 nurses and 6 physicians. The city also has about 4,000 individual clinics and 500 medical diagnostic centres. Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of care at and long waiting times in government facilities, despite the high proportion of the city's residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family Health Survey in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States <b>Preventive</b> <b>Services</b> Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks.

During times of war, the service prevented the export of precious metals and other commodities to the enemies of the United Kingdom and its allies. In 1963, {{with the passage of the}} <b>Preventive</b> <b>Service</b> Ordinance, the service gained the legal status to make regulations on its discipline, functions, powers and terms of service.

40|$|Background. Preventive care is {{important}} for reducing morbidity and mortality among the elderly, but racial/ethnic disparities exist in use of <b>preventive</b> care <b>services.</b> We aimed to develop {{a better understanding of}} <b>preventive</b> care <b>service</b> utilization among Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. Methods. We used data collected from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago study, a population-based survey of 3, 159 community-dwelling Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. <b>Preventive</b> care <b>services</b> assessed include use of flu, pneumonia, and hepatitis B vaccines as well as colon, breast, cervical and prostate cancer screening. We also examined sociodemographic, health and quality of life correlates for <b>preventive</b> care <b>service</b> use. Results. We found that although Chinese older adults had lower utilization rates for the pneumonia vaccine and can-cer screening, their utilization of the flu shot was consistent with national utilization rates. No sociodemographic, self-reported health, or quality of life characteristics were associated with all nine of the <b>preventive</b> care <b>services.</b> Conclusion. Use of <b>preventive</b> care <b>services</b> except flu vaccination was low among Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. However, future longitudinal studies may be necessary to further elucidate <b>preventive</b> care <b>service</b> utiliza-tion patterns among Chinese older adults...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyEmerging adults exhibit {{characteristics}} dissimilar {{to other}} culturally constructed age {{groups such as}} adolescents and older adults. Access to healthcare amongst emerging adults has improved, {{as a result of}} the Affordable Care Act (ACA), yet the translation of this access to <b>preventive</b> health <b>services</b> use has only seen modest changes in the U. S. and in Kansas. Post ACA, <b>preventive</b> health <b>service</b> (PHS) use such as routine health checkups are still only slightly higher than 50 % for this population (Han, Yabroff, and Robbins, 2014). Understanding how to increase emergent adults <b>preventive</b> health <b>service</b> use, has implications for the early detection and prevention of chronic diseases, the leading cause of death in the United States. This project used a grounded theory approach to see if a substantive theory emerged relative to factors that influence <b>preventive</b> health <b>service</b> use among emerging adults. Twenty one emerging adults were interviewed. Results identified eight themes centered within the constructs of causal conditions, context, strategies and consequence that influence emergent adult decision framing around <b>preventive</b> health <b>service</b> use. Results were validated through the process of member checking and testing the theory with persons outside of the sample population. The findings indicate that when coupled with the demands associated with the transition to adulthood, emerging adults frame <b>preventive</b> health <b>service</b> use as a loss with minimal return on investment. This results in non-use of such services. In order to increase use among this population, health care providers need to employ minimally invasive ways to offer <b>preventive</b> health <b>services</b> and greater incentives need to be attached to <b>preventive</b> health <b>service</b> use...|$|R
