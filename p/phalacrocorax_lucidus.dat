50|$|The white-breasted {{cormorant}} (<b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus)</b> is {{a member}} of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. Its taxonomic status has been under discussion for some decades and several questions still have not been definitively settled. <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus</b> sometimes is treated as a subspecies of the great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo lucidus, but some authorities (e.g. Sibley & Monroe, 1990, Sinclair, Hockey and Tarboton, 2002) retain its original treatment as an allospecies in the P. carbo superspecific group, in which case it is referred to as <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus.</b> A black-necked form originally classified as Phalacrocorax patricki or Phalacrocorax carbo patricki is now regarded as synonymous with <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The white-breasted {{cormorant}} (<b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus)</b> is {{much like}} the widespread great cormorant and if not a regional variant of the same species, is at least very closely related. It is distinguished from other forms of the great cormorant by its white breast and {{by the fact that}} subpopulations are freshwater birds. <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus</b> is {{not to be confused with}} the smaller and very different endemic South Australian black-faced cormorant, which also is sometimes called the white-breasted cormorant.|$|E
5000|$|The 80 - 100 cm long white-breasted {{cormorant}} P. c. lucidus {{found in}} sub-Saharan Africa, has a white neck and breast. It is often {{treated as a}} full species, <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus</b> (e.g. , [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Some birds {{more common}} to Turkana are the little stint, the wood sandpiper, {{and the common}} sandpiper. The African skimmer (Rhyncops flavirostris) nests in the banks of Central Island. The white-breasted {{cormorant}} (<b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus)</b> ranges over the lake, as do many other waterbirds. The greater flamingo wades in its shallows. Heuglin's bustard (Neotis heuglinii) {{is found in the}} east of the lake region.|$|E
50|$|Numerous birds including, storks, small wading birds, waterfowl, eagles {{and even}} small swift-flying birds may be snatched. As a whole, birds are quite {{secondary}} prey, rarely comprising more than 10-15% of crocodileâ€™s diets although are taken fairly evenly across all crocodile size ranges excluding juveniles {{of less than}} 1 m. Birds most often taken are African darters (Anhinga rufa) and reed (Microcarbo africanus) and white-breasted cormorants (<b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>lucidus),</b> followed by various waterfowl, including most breeding geese and ducks in Africa. Slow-swimming pelicans are also frequently vulnerable to crocodiles. Nile crocodile apparently frequently station themselves underneath breeding colonies of darter and cormorants and presumably snatch up fledgling birds as they drop to the water before they can competently escape the saurian, as has been recorded with several other crocodilians.|$|E
