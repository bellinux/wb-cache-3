50|$|The {{initiative}} {{seeks to}} affect the political process by petition, seeking the signatures of enough residents of the area {{on all sides of}} the conflict to drive the leaders of the various sides to concluding a peace agreement. The People's Voice website reported on 26 January 2004, 156,000 Israelis and 100,000 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>having</b> signed the initiative. In late 2007 the website went off-line. The Hebrew part went back on-line in 2008, and on 11 October 2008 reported 251,000 Israelis and 160,000 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>having</b> signed.|$|R
25|$|Ahmed Dabesh in Lebanese daily Al Akhbar {{wrote that}} Voll didn't {{mention that the}} Zionist entity {{was born out of}} {{aggression}} against the Palestinians and the rape of their land, attacked the Zionist Archaeology policy, and stated that the <b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> roots dating back until at least the stone age, 4000 BCE.|$|E
25|$|The Kach movement, {{with which}} Goldstein was affiliated, was outlawed as a {{terrorist}} organization. The cabinet decided to confiscate the weapons of some they regarded as right-wing extremists {{and put them in}} administrative detention. The Israeli government also took extreme measures against Palestinians following the massacre, banning them from certain streets in Hebron, such as Al-Shuhada Street, where many <b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> homes and businesses, and opening them to the exclusive access of Jewish Israelis and foreign tourists.|$|E
25|$|While many Palestinians {{living in}} rural {{communities}} {{have no access to}} running water, Israeli settlers who export their products have irrigated farms, lush gardens and swimming pools. The 450,000 settlers use as much or even more water than all 2.3 million Palestinians together. Many <b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> to buy water from Israel, of often dubious quality, delivered with tanker trucks at very high prices. Water tankers are forced to take long detours to avoid Israeli military checkpoints and roads which are out of bounds to Palestinians, resulting in steep increases in the price of water.|$|E
50|$|Israel {{had said}} it would {{withdraw}} from the Strip and end the operation as soon as Shalit was released. The <b>Palestinians</b> <b>had</b> {{said that they were}} willing to return Shalit in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The <b>Palestinians</b> and others <b>have</b> also said the assault was aimed at toppling the democratically elected Hamas-led government and at destabilizing the Palestinian National Authority, citing the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as a power station and the captures of government and parliament members. Some 300 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>had</b> been targeted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit.|$|R

25|$|Al-Husseini died in Beirut, on 4 July 1974. He had {{wished to}} be buried on the Haram ash-Sharif in Jerusalem. However, Israel had {{captured}} East Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War. The Supreme Muslim Council asked the Israeli government permission to bury him there but permission was refused. Three days later, al-Husseini was buried in Beirut. Within two years, the Christian Lebanese Phalange sacked his villa, and stole his files and archives. His granddaughter married Ali Hassan Salameh, the founder of PLO's Black September, who was later killed by Mossad for {{his involvement in the}} Munich massacre. According to Zvi Elpeleg, almost all trace of his memory thereafter vanished from Palestinian awareness, and <b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> raised no monument to his memory, or written books commemorating his deeds.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the first}} Arab-Israeli war, a {{significant}} number of Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes inside what is now Israel. These refugees numbered approximately 711,000 to 725,000 at the time. Today, they and their descendants number about four million, comprising about half the Palestinian people. Since that time, the <b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> demanded full implementation of the right of return, meaning that each refugee would be granted the option of returning to his or her home, with property restored, and receive compensation. Israelis asserted that allowing a right of return to Israel proper, rather than to the newly created Palestinian state, would mean an influx of Palestinians that would fundamentally alter the demographics of Israel, jeopardizing Israel's Jewish character and its existence as a whole.|$|E
25|$|<b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> {{sought to}} retroactively judge Israeli {{actions in the}} 1940s under new norms {{developing}} {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries. But international law does not work like that. Though it is no doubt deeply unsatisfying to Palestinians and their many supporters, the correct legal {{answer to the question of}} whether the 1947–49 refugees have a right of return under international law goes something like this: even if (or assuming that) the Israelis did intentionally expel every Palestinian refugee, it was not illegal when it occurred, though it almost certainly would be if done today under the same circumstances; and the law at the time did not require repatriation of the refugees to Israel, though it most likely would if the expulsion were to occur today.|$|E
50|$|On July 31, the UN {{issued a}} report {{indicating}} that at that time 52 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>had</b> been killed {{and that it was}} possible that as many as half of them were civilians.|$|R
5000|$|While the Economy of the <b>Palestinian</b> territories <b>has</b> shown {{signs of}} growth, the International Committee of the Red Cross {{reported}} that <b>Palestinian</b> olive farming <b>has</b> suffered. According to the ICRC, 10,000 olive trees were cut down or burned by settlers in 2007-2010. Foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the report ignored official PA data {{showing that the}} economic situation of <b>Palestinians</b> <b>had</b> improved substantially, citing Mahmoud Abbas's comment to The Washington Post in May 2009, where he said [...] "in the West Bank, {{we have a good}} reality, the people are living a normal life." ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> held diverse {{views and}} {{perceptions}} of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is {{an awareness of the}} differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause. 'New Historian' Israeli academic Ilan Pappe says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel (rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home refugees to a Palestinian state. Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as Hamas still is. However Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by Arafat and the PLO initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution. The Oslo Accords demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the state of Israel’s right to exist in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives. Yet, the demand for the right of return by the Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort.|$|E

2500|$|According to the United Nations, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 {{displaced}} 750,000 Palestinians.
