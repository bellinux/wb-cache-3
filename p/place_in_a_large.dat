While 's Jérémy Roy easily won the race with a solo breakaway, Gautier rode to sixth place by finishing {{near the front of}} the peloton two and a half minutes behind. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, one of the early-season Belgian races, Chavanel also turned in a sixth <b>place,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> field sprint. That same day, Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, coming third in a selective 12-rider sprint {{at the front of the}} race. Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn, coming across the line 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway.|$|E
500|$|As in {{previous}} Metroid games, Metroid Prime takes <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> open-ended {{world in which}} regions are connected by elevators. Each region has a set of rooms separated by doors that can be opened with a shot from the correct beam. The gameplay involves solving puzzles to reveal secrets, platform jumping, and shooting foes {{with the help of}} a [...] "lock-on" [...] mechanism that allows circle strafing while staying aimed at the enemy. Metroid Prime is the first game in the Metroid series to use a first-person view instead of side-scrolling, except in Morph Ball mode, when Samus' suit transforms into an armored ball and the game uses a third-person camera.|$|E

500|$|In 1980, {{large numbers}} of people from far afield attended, trees were damaged and burnt and there was illegal camping and lurid press reports of drugs and nudity. It was not until 1983 that the festival recommenced. when it was a one-day event; in 1984 a de facto two-day event was created by staging it {{back-to-back}} with a one-day WOMAD event. The festival took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> sloped clearing surrounded on three sides by New Barn Wood and Clarken Coombe. The main stage was placed {{at the bottom of the}} slope and the second stage in a natural amphitheatre near the entrance to the clearing. There were many other performance spaces, varying from year to year, including a dance tent, marquees for world music, acoustic acts and performing arts, and the [...] "Blackout" [...] tent for experimental music and video, as well as a children's area and funfair rides. [...] Camping on the festival site was not allowed.|$|E
500|$|The video takes <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> cathedral-like room, {{with large}} winding {{staircases}} on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen {{through a large}} carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone {{is seen in the}} middle of the room, where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey staring out into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is [...] "obvious" [...] that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went [...] "hand in hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the 6th Flotilla formed the basis of the Dover Patrol. Zulu captured the German sailing ship Perhns on 5 August 1914, and collided with sister ship [...] in both August and September that year. On 24 April 1916, Zulu took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> scale operation off the Belgian coast to lay mines and nets, in an attempt to limit use of the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge to German U-boats. Zulu and [...] laid lines of dan-buoys to mark to positions for the minefields and nets to be laid. In total, 1,565 mines were laid by the minelayers Princess Margaret, Orvietto, Paris and Biarritz. The minefield probably caused the loss of one U-Boat, , although {{at the time it was}} thought that four or five German submarines had been sunk. The destroyer [...] was badly damaged by shellfire from German coast-defence batteries, while one drifter, Clover Bank, was sunk by a mine.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} depictions to survive is a miniature in an important Byzantine illuminated manuscript of 979–984, the Menologion of Basil II in the Vatican Library. This has a scene which shows Mary and Joseph holding the baby Jesus outside a building, probably the Temple of Jerusalem, as a priest comes towards them with a small knife. This {{is typical of the}} early depictions, which avoid showing the operation itself. At the period of Jesus's birth, the actual Jewish practice was for the operation to be performed at home, usually by the father, and Joseph is shown using the knife in an enamelled plaque from the Klosterneuburg Altar (1181) by Nicolas of Verdun, where it is next to plaques showing the very rare scenes (in Christian art) of the circumcisions of Isaac and Samson. [...] Like most later depictions these are shown taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building, probably representing the Temple, though in fact the ceremony was never performed there. Medieval pilgrims to the Holy Land were told Jesus had been circumcised in the church at Bethlehem.|$|E

60|$|Two {{days later}} Stephen took his <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> boat, {{with a long}} cabin on deck, {{carrying}} a mast and great sail. He parted with the Indians with deep regret, and watched them as, after looking after the boat until it had gone far down, they turned and went along the shore to a little craft on which they had arranged for a passage, and which was to start half an hour after he sailed. Then Stephen turned round {{to look at his}} fellow-passengers. One end of the deck was reserved for the whites. Here was a priest who had been up at Barra on a visit, two traders who had disposed of their merchandise and were returning to Para, an old Portuguese official, his wife, and two daughters, who had, he learnt, been staying for a month with a married daughter at Barra; besides these, there were three or four petty traders, who had come up from villages on the bank to replenish their stock of goods.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} temperature, {{a column of}} dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air {{containing}} any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25°C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for cyclonic and anticyclonic weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).|$|R
6000|$|... [290] [The {{most vivid}} {{and the best}} {{authenticated}} account of the Duchess of Richmond's ball, which took place June 15, {{the eve of the}} Battle of Quatrebras, in the duke's house in the Rue de la Blanchisserie, {{is to be found in}} Lady de Ros's (Lady Georgiana Lennox) Personal Recollections of the Great Duke of Wellington, which appeared first in Murray's Magazine, January and February, 1889, and were republished as A Sketch of the Life of Georgiana, Lady de Ros, by her daughter, the Hon. Mrs. J. R. Swinton (John Murray, 1893). [...] "My mother's now famous ball," [...] writes Lady de Ros (A Sketch, etc., pp. 122, 123), [...] "took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> room on the ground-floor on the left of the entrance, connected with the rest of the house by an ante-room. It had been used by the coachbuilder, from whom the house was hired, to put carriages in, but it was papered before we came there; and I recollect the paper--a trellis pattern with roses.... When the duke arrived, rather late, at the ball, I was dancing, but at once went up to him to ask about the rumours. 'Yes, they are true; we are off to-morrow.' This terrible news was circulated directly, and while some of the officers hurried away, others remained at the ball, and actually had not time to change their clothes, but fought in evening costume."] ...|$|E
6000|$|Samuel Greg {{was one of}} {{thirteen}} children, and he in his turn became the father {{of thirteen}}. W. R. Greg {{was the youngest of}} them. The brightness and sweetness of his disposition procured for him even more than the ordinary endearment of such a <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> family. After the usual amount of schooling, first at home under the auspices of an elder sister, then at Leeds, and finally at Dr. Carpenter's at Bristol, in the winter of 1826-1827 he went to the University of Edinburgh, and remained there {{until the end of the}} session of 1828. He was a diligent student, but we may suspect, from the turn of his pursuits on leaving the university, that his mind worked most readily out of the academic groove. After the manner of most young men with an aptitude for literature, he competed for a prize poem in John Wilson's class, but he did not win. When he was in low spirits--a mood so much more common in early manhood than we usually remember afterwards--he drove them away by energetic bursts of work. On one occasion, he says, 'When I was so bad that I thought I should have gone distracted, I shut myself up, and for three days studied all the most abstruse works that I could find on the origin of government and society, such as Godwin, Goguet, Rousseau, et cætera, from seven in the morning till twelve at night, which quite set me up again.' 'Natural history,' at another time he tells his sister, 'is my principal pursuit at present, and from half-past six in the morning to twelve at night I am incessantly at work, with the exception of about two hours for exercise, and two more for meals.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The Pilgrim was {{followed}} by a searching treatise on The Fear of God. The value of this book led to its republication by the Tract Society, and 4000 copies have been circulated. It is a neat and acceptable volume, but why altered? and a psalm omitted.[301] Bunyan says, 'Your great ranting, swaggering, roysters'; this is modernized into 'Your ranting boasters.'[302] Then followed, the Come and Welcome to Jesus Christ. This was frequently reprinted, and hundreds of thousands have been circulated to benefit the world. His popularity increased with his years; efforts were made, but in vain, to steal him from his beloved charge at Bedford. 'He hath refused a more plentiful income to keep his station,' is the language of his surviving friend, Charles Doe. It is not surprising that he was thus tempted to leave his poor country church, for we are told by the same biographer, that 'When Mr. Bunyan preached in London, if there were but one day's notice given, there would be more people come together to hear him preach, than the meeting-house could hold. I have seen to hear him preach, by my computation, about 1200 at a morning lecture, by seven o'clock, on a working day, in the dark winter time. I also computed about 3000 that came to hear him one Lord's-day, at London, at a town's end meeting-house, so that half were fain to go back again for want of room, and then himself was fain at a back door to be pulled almost over people to get up stairs to his pulpit.' This took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> meeting-house, erected in Zoar Street, either on the site or near the Globe Theatre, Southwark.[303] On this spot, the prince of dramatists amused and corrupted crowded houses; while in the immediate vicinity were the stews and bear garden, frequented by libertines of the lowest caste. One Sunday, in 1582, many were killed or miserably wounded while attending the brutal sport of bear-baiting. Here, in the heart of Satan's empire, the prince of allegorists attracted multitudes, to be enlightened by his natural eloquence, and to be benefited by the fruits of his prolific and vivid imagination, at all times curbed and directed by the holy oracles. It was a spacious building, covering about 2000 feet of ground (50 by 40), with three galleries, quite capable of holding the number computed by Mr. Doe. We have, from correct drawings, furnished our subscribers with the plan and elevation of this ancient meeting-house. Having preached with peculiar warmth and enlargement, one of his friends took him by the hand, and could not help observing what a sweet sermon he had delivered; 'Ay,' said he, 'you need not remind me of that, for the devil told me of it before I was out of the pulpit!'[304] Amongst his hearers were to be found the learned and the illiterate. It was well known that Dr. John Owen, when he had the opportunity, embraced it with pleasure, and sat {{at the feet of the}} unlearned, but eloquent tinker. Charles II, hearing of it, asked the learned D.D., 'How a man of his great erudition could sit to hear a tinker preach?' to which the doctor replied, 'May it please your Majesty, if I could possess the tinker's abilities, I would gladly give in exchange all my learning.' ...|$|E
