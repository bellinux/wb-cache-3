25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston slides into the intermediate <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The HYACINTH {{suite of}} {{equipment}} {{has been developed}} to investigate the pressure sensitive behaviour of sedimentary formations up to 250 bar (25 MPa). It does this by collecting pressure-preserved samples from boreholes that can be retrieved, sub-sampled and analysed in controlled conditions in the laboratory. This paper reviews {{the development of the}} system, how it originated from the need to better understand the nature and distribution of gas hydrates beneath the sea bed, and its achievements to date. While gas hydrates continue to be the major scientific and commercial impetus for using, and further developing, this pressure-sampling technology, other important scientific driving forces, including the growing interest in the deep biosphere beneath the sea floor, are playing an important role. We review the downhole tools, the transfer system and the suite of differ-ent <b>pressure</b> <b>chambers</b> that are required tomake a complete working system. Non-destructive logging of cores contained in <b>pressure</b> <b>chambers,</b> using existing gamma- and X-ray tech-niques, is discussed, as are future logging techniques that will have sensors embedded within the <b>pressure</b> <b>chambers.</b> Subsamples can now be taken at full pressure and transferred into specialized chambers where intrusive measurements and experiments can be performe...|$|R
25|$|Since all {{wind noise}} is {{generated}} {{at the first}} surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. Thus larger shields are always much more efficient than smaller ones. With full basket windshields there is an additional <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke, which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield/microphone combination {{to act as a}} high-pass acoustic filter.|$|E

25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to adiabatic expansion. Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or piston spring, preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within a minute or two, and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> around a spring that keeps the valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some regulators are provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second stage valve seat on some regulators.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the two engines in the second stage was traced to the rupturing of a fuel line that fed the engine igniters. The igniter was {{essentially}} a miniature rocket motor mounted in {{the wall of the}} J-2 engine's <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> It was fed by small-diameter flexible lines carrying liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. [...] During the S-II second stage burn, the hydrogen line feeding the engine number two igniter broke due to vibration. As a result, the igniter fed pure liquid oxygen into the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> Normally the J-2 engine burns a hydrogen-rich mixture to keep temperature down. The liquid oxygen flow caused a much higher temperature locally and eventually the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> failed. The sudden drop in pressure was detected and caused a shutdown command to be issued. Unfortunately, the command signals for engine three were partially cross-wired with engine two, so that the shutdown of engine two caused a liquid oxygen valve for engine three to close, resulting in a shutdown of that engine as well.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{propellant}} is ignited, {{the higher}} pressure gases are bled out through vents (or ports) at reduced pressure {{to a much}} larger low <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> to push the projectile forward.

40|$|Achieving a plasma sprayed {{cast iron}} coating {{containing}} graphite requires stringent control on spray parameters that synergistically influence the coating properties {{and thus the}} performance. The microstructure of cast iron splats greatly depends on spray parameters such as substrate temperature, <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure,</b> and spray distance. This paper presents the effect of <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> on the splat microstructure, including oxides and graphite. At low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures,</b> most splats exhibit a disk shape with high flattening ratios, whereas star-shaped splats extensively appear at high <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures.</b> Spraying at high <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> causes the formation of pores and thick oxide zones at the splat/substrate interface, mainly due to the atmospheric gases, which are responsible for a decrease in splat adhesion. Spraying in Ar atmosphere reduces the splat oxidation due to {{a decrease in the}} oxygen partial pressure. Small deformed substrate ridges are observed adjacent to the periphery of splats sprayed at low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> whereas no ridges are detected at high <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures.</b> Ridge formation generates a kind of mechanical bond, which increases the adhesive strength. Since the molten droplets impinge with high velocity and thus high flattening ratio at low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures,</b> the solidification rate becomes faster, and graphite formation is resultantly hindered...|$|R
2500|$|The {{sequential}} twin turbocharged system, introduced on {{this series}} in 1992, {{was a very}} complex piece of engineering, developed {{with the aid of}} Hitachi and previously used on the exclusive to Japan Cosmo series (JC Cosmo=90–95). The system was composed of two turbochargers, one to provide boost at low RPM. The second unit was on standby until the upper half of the rpm range during full throttle acceleration. The first turbocharger provided [...] of boost from 1800rpm, and the second turbocharger was activated at 4000rpm to maintain [...] until redline. The changeover process occurred at 4500 rpm, with a momentary dip in pressure to , and provided semi-linear acceleration and a wide torque curve the throughout the entire rev range under [...] "normal operation". However, under performance driving the changeover process produced a significant increase in power and forced technical drivers to adjust their driving style to anticipate and mitigate any over-steer during cornering. Many owners modified their turbo control systems into a parallel system by removing the exhaust manifold Turbo Control Valve and the turbo coupling [...] "y-pipe" [...] Charge Control Actuator and valve in order to remove the changeover process and to simplify the control system for reliability. Turbo lag was greatly increased below 4500rpm, but smooth and linear boost could be obtained. The stock turbo control system used 4 control solenoids, 4 actuators, both a vacuum and <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber,</b> and several feet of preformed vacuum/pressure hoses all of which were prone to failure in part to complexity and the inherent high temperatures of the rotary engine.|$|E
50|$|While air based, {{the split}} air vs water <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> has a sliding plunger that {{separates}} the compressed air from the water.
