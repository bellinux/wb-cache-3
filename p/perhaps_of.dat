5|$|An early type of axe {{known as}} a palstave has been {{discovered}} on Crompton Moor, providing evidence of Bronze Age human activity. It is believed that the area was inhabited by Ancient Britons, and that the Brigantes gave the River Beal its name. An ancient track, <b>perhaps</b> <b>of</b> Roman origin, crosses the modern Buckstones Road leading to Castleshaw Roman fort in neighbouring Saddleworth.|$|E
5|$|I am now {{satisfied}} that the documents are authentic; {{that the history of}} their wanderings since 1945 is true; and that the standard accounts of Hitler's writing habits, of his personality, and even, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>of</b> some public events may, in consequence, have to be revised.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>of</b> a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E

5000|$|In Etruscan mythology, Tuchulcha was a chthonic daemon (not to be {{confused}} with the Christian term [...] "demon") with pointed ears (<b>perhaps</b> those <b>of</b> a donkey), and hair made of snakes and a beak (<b>perhaps</b> that <b>of</b> a vulture). Tulchulcha lived in the underworld known as Aita.|$|R
5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though <b>perhaps</b> <b>of</b> a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
5|$|Brock's {{successor}} at Detroit, however, fared much worse. Colonel Henry Procter {{faced an}} attack from a resurrected American Army of the Northwest under future President William Henry Harrison. Harrison {{set out to}} retake Detroit, but a detachment of his army was defeated at Frenchtown on 22 January 1813. Procter, displaying poor judgement, left the prisoners {{in the custody of}} his First Nations allies, who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them. Subsequent American victories allowed Harrison to attempt another invasion of Canada, which led to the Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813. After a successful American charge, Procter's forces turned and fled, leaving Tecumseh and his American Indian troops to fight alone. They fought on, eventually being defeated. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>of</b> more importance to the British, at this battle Tecumseh died, and their alliance with the American Indians effectively ended.|$|E

(Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous <b>perhaps,</b> <b>of</b> all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E

25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{of the outer}} faces of the two great piers was lost when the Arch of Titus was incorporated in medieval defensive walls. The attic of the arch was originally crowned by more statuary, <b>perhaps</b> <b>of</b> a gilded chariot.

25|$|The hymn {{was one of}} the exclamations of {{the fathers}} at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and is common not only to all the Greek Oriental liturgies, but was used also in the Gallican Liturgy (see Saint Germain of Paris, d. 576), which shows that the hymn is ancient.

25|$|In war...he usually saw one path to victory, {{and that}} was fixing the enemy army in place, {{maneuvering}} near or even around it to give himself a favorable position for the attack, and then smashing it with an overwhelming blow from an unexpected direction.
