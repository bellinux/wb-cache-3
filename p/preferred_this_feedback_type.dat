40|$|Older {{adults are}} {{impaired}} in reinforcement learning (RL) when feedback is partially ambiguous (e. g., Eppinger and Kray, 2011). In {{this study we}} examined whether older adults benefit from salient feedback information during learning. We used an electrophysiological approach and investigated 15 younger and 15 older adults with a RL task {{in which they had}} to learn stimulus-response associations under two learning conditions. In the positive learning conditions, participants could gain 50 Cents for a correct response but did not gain or lose money (* 00 Cent) for an incorrect response. In negative learning conditions, they could lose 50 Cents for an incorrect response but did not gain or lose money (* 00 Cent) for a correct response. As the identical outcome 00 Cent is either better or worse than the alternative outcome depending on the learning condition, <b>this</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> is ambiguous. To examine the influence of feedback salience we compared this condition with a condition in which positive and negative outcomes were color-coded and thereby clearly separable. The behavioral results indicated that younger adults reached higher accuracy levels under salient feedback conditions. Moreover, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the feedback-related negativity (FRN) for losses were larger if the good-bad dimension of feedback was salient. Hence, in younger adults salient feedback facilitates the rapid evaluation of outcomes on a good-bad dimension and by this supports learning. In contrast, for older adults we obtained neither behavioral nor electrophysiological effects of feedback salience. The older adults’ performance monitoring system therefore appears less flexible in integrating additional information in this evaluation process...|$|R

40|$|When {{teaching}} English as {{a foreign}} language (EFL), teachers use feedback {{in order to help}} students to improve their English skills. They can use both oral and written feedback to encourage students to make progress. Oral and written feedback {{play a significant role in}} second language acquisition, and this study could raise teachers' awareness of the different feedback strategies that can be employed in EFL classrooms. This could benefit their teaching performance and students’ learning. This study aims to examine the different types of oral and written feedback used in the EFL classroom, as well as teachers’ own perceptions of feedback. The approach used to conduct this study was both quantitative and qualitative. Three types of data material were collected in a secondary school (grades 7 - 9) for the analysis: three secondary school teachers were interviewed; their English lessons were observed; and their feedback on student essays was collected. The material collected was used in the analysis, which indicated that the teachers used different <b>types</b> of <b>feedback.</b> The most frequent oral <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> used were recast, elicitation, and praise. However, the teachers employed different strategies regarding to how they provide <b>this</b> <b>feedback.</b> Two of the teachers provided feedback in the traditional way by using corrective <b>types</b> of <b>feedback</b> frequently, while one teacher chose not to correct students too often and instead encouraged them by giving them praise. The evaluation of different <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> performed in <b>this</b> study suggests that recast as an implicit <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> provided orally could be more effective in a communicative classroom setting, as it does not interrupt the communicative flow.

Currently, gaps in training exist between the professional courses a submarine officer attends over a career to learn and practice these skills.

Unfortunately, a unified approach, in this regard has yet to emerge, leading to confusion at the practical level. Second language teachers find it difficult to access definitive research regarding proven strategies for providing successful corrective feedback in their classrooms. Furthermore, little or no research has focused on the secondary foreign language acquisition classroom. Most studies have been conducted in either language immersion programs or in English as a Second Language classrooms. Hence, there is a substantial need for research regarding the practical application of feedback in secondary foreign language teaching. ^ This study, which consisted of comprehensive observations of four secondary school foreign language classrooms, attempted to address the aforementioned lack of research. It focused on the impact that corrective feedback strategies had on student learning, seeking answers to the following questions. What are the most common corrective <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> that secondary foreign language teachers use in their classrooms and which of these types most frequently led to successful or non-successful immediate uptake?

There were 32 dyads in Grade 7, 16 dyads in Grade 8, 24 dyads in Grade 10, and 32 dyads in Grade 11. Three participants had a documented special need.

Corrective <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> were similar to those studied in traditional classroom research (i. e., explicit corrections, recasts, negotiation of form). However, descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses revealed conversational techniques that are specific to text-based online discourses providing insight into interactional characteristics among interactants within a discourse environment that differs both from speech and written texts. Consequently, an additional corrective <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> emerged from the data, coded as feedback request. The most frequent corrective <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> provided was explicit corrections. Frequency data revealed that corrective feedback tended to decrease as the grade level increased.

The current study investigated whether two indicators of feedback processing – feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P 3 b – differ for feedback stimuli with explicit (facial expressions) or assigned valence information (symbols). In addition, we assessed whether presenting feedback in either a trial-by-trial or a block-wise fashion affected these ERPs. MethodsEEG was recorded in three experiments while participants performed a time estimation task and received two different <b>types</b> of performance <b>feedback.</b> ResultsOnly P 3 b amplitudes varied consistently in response to <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> for both presentation types. Moreover, the blocked <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> presentation yielded more distinct FRN peaks, higher effect sizes, and a significant relation between FRN amplitudes and behavioral task performance measures. ConclusionBoth stimulus type and presentation mode may provoke systematic changes in feedback-related ERPs. The current findings point at important potential confounds that need to be controlled for when designing FRN or P 3 b studies. SignificanceStudies investigating P 3 b amplitudes using mixed types of stimuli have to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, we suggest implementing a blocked presentation format when presenting different <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> within the same experiment...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} an {{increasing}} number of SLA studies showing that interactional feedback plays a significant role in improving classroom learners' use of the target language. Whereas the provision of feedback has proven more effective than no feedback, there are still many variables that mediate the effectiveness of interactional <b>feedback.</b> <b>This</b> article synthesizes a set of classroom studies about interactional feedback taking into account four mediating variables: (a) <b>feedback</b> <b>types,</b> (b) instructional setting, (c) learners' age, and (d) linguistic targets. The synthesis leads to the conclusion that prescriptions to use only “implicit negative feedback {{at the expense of other}} more overt <b>types</b> of interactional <b>feedback</b> are not supported by classroom research...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, much {{research}} has been pursued {{in the field of}} Classroom Response Systems (CRSs), for example: (Bruff 2009; Draper, Cargill, & Cutts, 2002; Kay & LeSage, 2009), which can be defined as a subset of IC platforms. Despite the fact that the CRSs are mostly not connected to the teacher’s slides, they provide wide possibilities to gather learners’ feedback. Over the years two main <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> have been established: learners can post messages to the audience and multiple choice questions answered by learners. Whereas both of these types are widely implemented into learning platforms, only a few platforms, for example: (Vetterick, Schwennigcke, Langfeld, Cap, & Sucharowski, 2014), preserve the feedback, gathered by these <b>feedback</b> <b>types,</b> for later use. Multiscript has the ability to collect IC feedback while presenting it later on in its OMS functionality.|$|R
