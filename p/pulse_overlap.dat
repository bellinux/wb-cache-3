This approach has been extended to analyse a two-pass Nd:YVO 4 amplifier (diode pumped 2 mm long 1 % doped crystal) operated with nanosecond pulses delivered at rates up to 20 kHz and taking account of the Gaussian beam profile. An estimate of ? = 1 × 10 ? 15 cm 3 s? 1 for the up-conversion macro-parameter was found to provide a consistent value for the length-averaged gain coefficient and the effective gain lifetime of the amplifier for the pump conditions used...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} laser {{scribing}} experiments of CIGS thin films deposited on Mo-coated stainless steel sheets, using laser pulses with a wavelength of 1550 nm and a pulse duration of 6 ns, {{are presented in}} this study. It is shown that a removal of the CIGS from the Mo film is possible without edge melting of the CIGS or damaging of the Mo. The critical parameter for inducing the delamination lift-off process of the CIGS from the Mo was identified to be the scribing speed of the laser. In dependence on the laser parameters two different material removal processes were found. For a low <b>pulse</b> <b>overlap</b> the laser pulse penetrates the CIGS film and is absorbed in the interface between the CIGS and the Mo causing a lift-off process of the CIGS from the Mo back contact. For a high <b>pulse</b> <b>overlap</b> an ablation process starting from the top side of the CIGS film was found. The composition and morphology of the sample material after the laser patterning were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and micro-Raman spectroscopy...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{correction}} factor {{to be added}} in ablation algorithms when a Gaussian beam is used in photorefractive laser surgery. This factor, which quantifies the effect of <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping,</b> depends on beam radius and spot size. We also deduce the expected post-surgical corneal radius and asphericity when considering this factor. Data on 141 eyes operated on LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) with a Gaussian profile show that the discrepancy between experimental and expected data on corneal power is significantly lower when using the correction factor. For an effective improvement of post-surgical visual quality, this factor should be applied in ablation algorithms that do not consider the effects of <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> with a Gaussian beam...|$|R

40|$|Stereotyped {{intervals}} between successive sound pulses {{characterize the}} acoustic signals of anurans and other organisms and provide critical information to receivers. One class of midbrain neuron responds selectively when pulses are repeated at slow rates (long intervals). To examine the mechanisms that underlie long-interval selectivity, we made whole cell recordings, in vivo, from neurons in the anuran inferior colliculus (anuran IC). In most cases, long-pass interval selectivity appeared to arise from interplay between excitation and inhibition; in ∼ 25 % of these cases, the delayed inhibition to a <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapped</b> with the excitation {{to the following}} pulse at fast pulse repetition rates (PRRs), resulting in a phasic “onset” response. In the remaining cases, inhibition appeared to precede excitation. These neurons {{did not respond to}} fast PRRs apparently because delayed excitation to a <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapped</b> with the inhibition to the following pulse. These results suggest that the relative timing of inhibition and excitation govern differences in the response properties of these two cell types. Loading cells with cesium increased their responses to fast AM rates, supporting a role for inhibition in long-interval selectivity. Three cells showed little or no evidence of inhibition and exhibited strong depression of excitation. These findings are discussed in the context of current models for long-pass interval selectivity...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{limit the}} range of insect substrate-borne {{vibratory}} communication by their architecture and mechanical properties that change transmitted signal time, amplitude and frequency characteristics. Stinkbugs gain higher signal-to-noise ratio and increase communication distance by emitting narrowband low frequency vibratory signals that are tuned with transmission properties of plants. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate hitherto overlooked consequences of duetting with mutually overlapped narrowband vibratory signals. The overlapped vibrations of the model stinkbug species Eushistus heros, produced naturally or induced artificially on different plants, have been analysed.
