In 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act [...] A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) authorized $ 727 million for JARC for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, changed how these funds were to be awarded after fiscal year 2005, and required FTA to evaluate the program by August 2008. GAO examined (1) SAFETEA-LU's changes to JARC, (2) FTA's progress in implementing these changes, (3) states' and localities' efforts to respond and challenges they have encountered, and (4) FTA's proposed strategy for evaluation and oversight. GAO's work included analyzing program guidance as well as interviewing officials from FTA, industry groups, and more than 30 state and local agencies. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{the health}} {{sciences}} have been observing {{the negative impact}} of mass unemployment on health for some time now, health reporting remains fragmentary. Methods: The 2005 microcensus was conducted as an official random sample survey. A total of 380, 000 households, comprising 820, 000 individuals, took part. Providing health information was optional, with a response ratio of about 85 %. The Scientific Use File contains a 70 % subsample of the data set. Results: As of the survey date, average annual illness rates for 2005 were 6. 5 % among unemployed and 26. 6 % among inactive <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> to <b>work</b> (not available). If unemployed and inactive <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> to <b>work</b> were pooled into the single group of "job seekers", their average annual illness rate was 8. 8 %. This was significantly higher than for employed individuals, whose rate was 4. 4 %. However, the age-standardised odds ratios decreased from 2. 2 to 1. 8 for female job seekers and from 2. 2 to 1. 6 for male job seekers after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, family type, household structure, education, vocational training, socioeconomic variables, disabilities, smoking status, and other factors. The children of job seekers who are the principal income earners were more than proportionally ill at the survey date, too. In multivariate model calculations, among persons who had been unemployed a year before, an illness lasting more than 12 months had the strongest impact on chances for present employment. Chances for reintegration were likewise substantially lower for persons with a disability. Conclusion: The microcensus analyses confirm the multifarious interactions between health and occupational status. Unemployment constitutes a present challenge for public health...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} intention {{had been}} that from 26 July 2010, all new entrants to roles working with vulnerable groups and those switching jobs to a new provider within these sectors {{would be able to}} register with the VBS and be assessed by the ISA. Employers {{would have been able to}} check registration status online to subscribe to be notified if an employee's registration status changes. Both the ability and requirement to register were withdrawn in 2011 following the Singleton and Munro Reviews. The lists are still maintained and it remains an offence to employ a person in regulated activity who has been barred by the ISA or for that <b>person</b> to <b>seek</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R

40|$|Unemployment is {{measured}} {{as the number}} of <b>persons</b> actively <b>seeking</b> <b>work.</b> Clearly, there is no counterpart to this concept in standard representative agent neoclassical growth models. If we want to understand the behavior of the labor market, explain why unemployment fluctuates and how it is correlated with other key macroeconomic aggregates, and evaluate the efficacy of policies affecting the labor market, we need another set of models. These models need heterogeneity, as we want to study equilibria where agents engage in different activities, i. e. job search, employment, and possibly leisure (not in the labor force). Further, there must be frictions which imply that it takes time for an agent to transit between unemployment and employment. Search models have these characteristics. Some early approaches to search and unemployment are in McCall (1970) and Phelps et. al. (1970). These are models of “one-sided ” search, which are partial equilibrium in nature. Unemployed workers face a distribution of wage offers which is assumed to be fixed. Later, Mortensen and Pissarides developed two-sided search models (for a summary see Pissarides 1990) in which workers and firms match in general equilibrium, and wages are endogenous. 1. 1 A One-Sided Search Model Suppose a continuum of agents with unit mass, each having preferences given b...|$|R

40|$|The {{labor market}} is a {{relationship}} between the demand (<b>persons</b> who <b>seek</b> <b>work)</b> and supply (job vacancies). The labor market is very complex, to study it we have to know better the characteristics of its variables, ie demand and supply. The Good compatibility between demand and supply is the golden key to well-functioning of labor market. Using the data obtained from questionnaires issued to study the labor market, many shortages are revealed in some sectors, especially in some professions, in terms of labor power, Identification of the skills and training needs of companies is the essence of consultation, orientation to career and training services. The survey through questionnaires is used as a means of research. The Information obtained from the research on needed skills ought to {{become an integral part of}} the Information System on Labor Market (ISLM). The Information on Labor Market that was usually collected through employment services, education and vocational training departments and national training agencies, facilitates the analysis on the efficiency and effectiveness of the training system and estimation of training demand, and enables the employment services and training providers to make possible the adjustment of both, demand and supply. as well. Concerning Albania, it is important to develop effective institutions and policies on labor market in order to reduce the inefficiencies and to create more job vacancies. In this aspect, we need to understand better what is happening with the economy. The results of the study suggest the existence of strong national divisions and regional labor market in terms of age and gender, which are so strong that even if you have in mind the caution that is dictated by the given samlpe it is felt that further investigation will be justified...|$|R
