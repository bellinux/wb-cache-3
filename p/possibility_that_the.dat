5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From the spectra, radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data {{ruled out the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> detected radial velocity {{was caused by the}} blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star, supporting the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body orbiting WASP-44 was indeed a planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{investigated}} the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transit signal detected by Kepler was actually {{due to a}} third star in the system that eclipsed its sister stars. However a bisector analysis of the spectra of KOI-98's star ruled out that hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{concerns}} over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including allegations that China violated its pledge to allow open media access, various alleged human rights violations, its continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and in neighbouring areas, proposed boycotts, warnings of the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups, disruption from pro-Tibetan protesters, and religious persecutions.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E
5|$|Following its collapse, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} about whether Great Southern had disclosed to the market issues with the rate of return {{it was going to}} achieve on some of its timber investments. During parliamentary committee inquiries, these allegations were extended to the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> auditors had been misled. It was also noted that, at the time that difficulties were emerging for Great Southern, its CEO sold some of his shares {{at the top of the}} companies' fortunes for $32.6 million.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore Stone is a {{fragment}} of a large sandstone slab which originally stood {{at the mouth of}} the Singapore River. The large slab, which is believed to date back to at least the 13th century and possibly as early as the 10th or 11th century, bore an undeciphered inscription. Recent theories suggest that the inscription is either in Old Javanese or in Sanskrit, which suggested a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> island was an extension of the Majapahit civilisation in the past.|$|E
5|$|The film {{generated}} more controversy {{through the}} 30-second rape scene, with threats made against the child actors, who originated from Afghanistan. Zakria Ebrahimi, the 12-year-old actor who portrayed Amir, {{had to be}} removed from school after his Hazara classmates threatened to kill him, and Paramount Pictures was eventually forced to relocate three of the children to the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan's Ministry of Culture banned the film from distribution in cinemas or DVD stores, citing the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> movie's ethnically charged rape scene could incite racial violence within Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E

5|$|The <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian islands became older as one {{moved to}} the {{northwest}} was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived. During their voyages, seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion, soil formation, and vegetation, allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest (Niihau and Kauai) were older than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, {{as well as}} the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{unstable}} {{situation could}} spill over outside Albania, triggering a wider conflict.

The provisional government formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed {{to the sides of}} the main airway.|$|E
5|$|When {{fin whale}} sounds were first {{recorded}} by US biologists, {{they did not}} realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular sounds were being made by whales.

5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence.

Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
