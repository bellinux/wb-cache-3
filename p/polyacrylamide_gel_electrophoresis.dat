5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E

25|$|For proteins, SDS-PAGE {{is usually}} the first choice as an assay of purity due to its {{reliability}} and ease. The presence of SDS and the denaturing step make proteins separate, approximately based on size, but aberrant migration of some proteins may occur. Different proteins may also stain differently, which interferes with quantification by staining. PAGE may {{also be used as}} a preparative technique for the purification of proteins. For example, quantitative preparative native continuous <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (QPNC-PAGE) is a method for separating native metalloproteins in complex biological matrices.|$|E
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of the functioning of proteins in a cell, the knowledge of their cooperation is essential. Most often proteins act together in complexes to be fully functional. The analysis of this sub organelle organisation of the cell requires techniques conserving the native state of the protein complexes. In native <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (native PAGE), proteins remain in their native state and are separated in the electric field following their mass and the mass of their complexes respectively. To obtain a separation by size and not by net charge, as in IEF, an additional charge is transferred to the proteins by the use of Coomassie Brilliant Blue or lithium dodecyl sulfate. After completion of the first dimension the complexes are destroyed by applying the denaturing SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, where the proteins of which the complexes are composed of are separated by their mass.|$|E
500|$|... (1) Most often, 5'-DMT {{group is}} removed {{at the end}} of the {{oligonucleotide}} chain assembly. The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or methylamine or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction mixture containing the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting silyl groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the crude product is desalted using ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> or anion-exchange HPLC followed by desalting.|$|E

Nearly identical patterns of amylase isozyme bands on a <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> disc <b>electrophoresis</b> in combination with isoelectric focusing indicate the intrinsic role of gibberellic acid in the starch breakdown in germinating rice seeds.

2500|$|In {{order for}} neuroproteomics to {{function}} correctly, proteins must be separated {{in terms of}} the proteome from which they came. [...] For example, one set might be under normal conditions, while another might be under diseased conditions. [...] Proteins are commonly separated using two-dimensional <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (2D PAGE). [...] For this technique, proteins are run across an immobile gel with a pH gradient until they stop at the point where their net charge is neutral. [...] After separating by charge in one direction, sodium dodecyl sulfate is run in the other direction to separate the proteins by size. [...] A two-dimensional map is created using this technique {{that can be used to}} match additional proteins later.|$|E
2500|$|By far {{the most}} common type of gel {{electrophoresis}} employs polyacrylamide gels and buffers loaded with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). [...] SDS-PAGE (SDS <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis)</b> maintains polypeptides in a denatured state once they have been treated with strong reducing agents to remove secondary and tertiary structure (e.g. disulfide bonds [...] to sulfhydryl groups [...] ) and thus allows separation of proteins by their molecular mass. [...] Sampled proteins become covered in the negatively charged SDS and move to the positively charged electrode through the acrylamide mesh of the gel. Smaller proteins migrate faster through this mesh, and the proteins are thus separated according to size (usually measured in kilodaltons, kDa). The concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel - the greater the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins. [...] The lower the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins. Proteins travel only in one dimension along the gel for most blots.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{separate}} techniques, such as 2D PAGE, are limitd in {{that they}} cannot handle very high or low molecular weight protein species. [...] Alternative methods {{have been developed to}} deal with such cases. [...] These include liquid chromatography mass spectrometry along with sodium dodecyl sulfate <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry run in multiple dimensions. [...] Compared to simple 2D page, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry can handle a larger range of protein species size, but it is limited in the amount of protein sample it handle at once. [...] Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is also limited in its lack of a reference map from which to work with. [...] Complex algorithms are usually used to analyze the fringe results that occur after a procedure is run. [...] The unknown portions of the protein species are usually not analyzed in favor of familiar proteomes, however. [...] This fact reveals a fault with current technology; new techniques are needed to increase both the specificity and scope of proteome mapping.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues {{played a key role}} in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects. In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the Plus and Minus technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis)</b> and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement, but was still very laborious. [...] Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174, completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. The refinement of the Plus and Minus method resulted in the chain-termination, or Sanger method (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the Maxam-Gilbert method (also known as the chemical method) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} forms of gel electrophoresis, {{molecules}} may be run in their native state, preserving the molecules' higher-order structure. This method is called Native-PAGE. Alternatively, a chemical denaturant may be added to remove this structure and turn the molecule into an unstructured molecule whose mobility depends only on its length and mass-to-charge ratio. This procedure is called SDS-PAGE. Sodium dodecyl sulfate <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (SDS-PAGE) is a method of separating molecules based on the difference of their molecular weight. At the pH at which gel electrophoresis is carried out the SDS molecules are negatively charged and bind to proteins in a set ratio, approximately one molecule of SDS for every 2 amino acids. [...] In this way, the detergent provides all proteins with a uniform charge-to-mass ratio, independently of their original charge. By binding to the proteins the detergent destroys their secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary structure denaturing them and turning them into negatively charged linear poly peptide chains. When subjected to an electric field in PAGE, the negatively charged poly peptide chains travel toward the anode with different mobility. Their mobility, or the distance traveled by molecules, is inversely proportional to the logarithm of their molecular weight. By comparing the relative ratio of the distance traveled by each protein {{to the length of}} the gel (Rf) one can make conclusions about the relative molecular weight of the proteins, where the length of the gel is determined by the distance traveled by a small molecule like a tracking dye.|$|E
