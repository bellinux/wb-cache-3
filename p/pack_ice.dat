5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with <b>pack</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} was {{the first}} to describe the Ross seal, which it found in the <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> to which the species is confined.|$|E
50|$|Temperature Therapies is the {{application}} of either heat (thermal therapy) or cold (cryotherapy). Techniques may include heat <b>packs,</b> cold <b>packs,</b> <b>ice</b> baths, whirlpools, heat lamps, and paraffin wax baths.|$|R
50|$|An ice hummock is a boss or rounded knoll of ice {{rising above}} the general level of an ice-field. Hummocky ice is caused by slow and unequal {{pressure}} in {{the main body of}} the <b>packed</b> <b>ice,</b> and by unequal structure and temperature at a later period.|$|R
40|$|Ice growth {{computation}} for the Duluth-Superior {{harbor and}} the adjacent Lake Superior waters, using the heat budget balance, agrees {{well with the}} measured ice values for the 1972 - 73 winter season. ERTS data {{is used for the}} determination of ice albedo and the resulting ice decay rate on Lake Superior. During the period of <b>ice</b> <b>packing</b> near Duluth, the calculated ice decay rates, combined with the ERTS data on the extent and the condition of the ice field indicate maximum <b>ice</b> <b>packing</b> between March 20 - 27, when the <b>packed</b> <b>ice</b> field, exhibiting albedo values above 70 % reached an average 60 cm thickness. The results offer a method for description of <b>ice</b> <b>packing</b> which could be used for ice forecasting on Lake Superior if more frequent ERTS images were available...|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E
5|$|After being spotted, the German {{ships in}} Førde Fjord sailed further up the fjord and {{prepared}} for an Allied attack. Z33 and several of her escorts anchored close to the steep southern slopes of the fjord {{near the village of}} Bjørkedal. Meanwhile, other ships moored near the northern shore after breaking up <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> with gunfire. This anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on the shore of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|In October 1915 <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> in the Weddell Sea {{had sunk}} Endurance, leaving Shackleton {{and his companions}} adrift on a {{precarious}} ice surface. Throughout the duration of their survival, the group drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they had encamped broke up. They then made their way in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island, where Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue would be to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E
50|$|Whole body {{cryotherapy}} (WBC) is {{an alternative}} to cold water immersion or <b>ice</b> <b>packs.</b> While further studies to determine {{the efficacy of the}} treatment are recommended a review of the available data does not show that this treatment has a greater impact than simple <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> therapy or <b>ice</b> bath.|$|R
50|$|The seal hunters at the Gulf of Bothnia had {{developed}} a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals' breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the <b>packed</b> <b>ice</b> in general and was made specially long, 3-4 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is called skredstång in Swedish.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{effectively}} extending the storage-life of fresh haddock with Salmide® a stabilized form of redox-buffered sodium chlorite in ice was developed. Results from aerobic bacterial counts, trimethylamine (TMA) and odor analyses showed that fresh haddock fillets <b>packed</b> in <b>ice</b> containing 200 ppm sodium chlorite {{can be stored}} for about 18 days at 4 °C. This storage-life was nearly {{twice as long as}} that for fillets <b>packed</b> in <b>ice</b> alone...|$|R
5|$|In summer 1923 Lethbridge {{was part}} of a second {{expedition}} led by Wordie, designed to explore the eastern coast of Greenland to conduct geological and archaeological investigations and repeat Edward Sabine's pendulum gravity experiments. Sailing from Newcastle, they stopped first at Bergen and then Jan Meyen before getting stuck in <b>pack</b> <b>ice.</b> With food reserves running low, the crew resorted to killing and eating grey seals and polar bears, before they eventually aborted the mission and returned home.|$|E
5|$|The Australasian Antarctic Expedition, {{commanded}} by Douglas Mawson, explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914. The expedition's main base {{was established in}} January 1912 at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, Adélie Land. This was much farther west than originally intended; dense <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> had prevented the expedition ship SY Aurora from landing closer to Cape Adare, the original eastern limit. Only after the Aurora—heading west—had rounded the ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier was a landing made.|$|E
5|$|The {{drift of}} the Antarctic {{exploration}} vessel SY Aurora was an ordeal which lasted 312days, during the Ross Sea chapter of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. It {{began when the}} ship broke loose from its anchorage in McMurdo Sound in May 1915, during a gale. Caught in heavy <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and unable to manoeuvre, Aurora, with eighteen men aboard, was carried into the open waters of the Ross Sea and Southern Ocean, leaving ten men stranded ashore with meagre provisions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} test at one-g of a functional laboratory model (non-flight) <b>Ice</b> <b>Pack</b> Heat Sink Subsystem to be used eventually for astronaut cooling during manned space missions. In normal use, excess heat in the liquid cooling garment (LCG) coolant is transferred to a reusable/regenerable <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> heat sink. For emergency operation, or for extension of extravehicular activity mission time after all the ice has melted, water from the <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> is boiled to vacuum, thereby continuing to remove heat from the LCG coolant. This subsystem incorporates a quick connect/disconnect thermal interface between the <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> heat sink and the subsystem heat exchanger...|$|R
40|$|Every year, {{as many as}} {{one million}} {{avalanches}} fall throughout the world. One moment, the mountainside is calm; the next, tons of <b>packed</b> <b>ice</b> and snow come thundering down, burying everything in the way. Through fascinating facts and spectacular photography, author Stephen Kramer and photographer Patrick Cone explain the causes and effects of this awe-inspiring natural phenomenon. Young readers will also learn about rescue operations and safety rules for those who venture into avalanche country...|$|R
5|$|When Carpathia {{arrived at}} Pier54 in New York {{on the evening}} of 18April after a {{difficult}} voyage through <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> fog, thunderstorms and rough seas, some 40,000people were standing on the wharves, alerted to the disaster by a stream of radio messages from Carpathia and other ships. It was only after Carpathia docked– three days after Titanics sinking– that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|When the ice {{finally brought}} the camp {{to the edge}} of the <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> Shackleton decided that the three boats, the James Caird, Stancomb Wills, and Dudley Docker, should make {{initially}} for Elephant Island. McNish had prepared the boats as best he could for a long journey in the open ocean, building up their sides to give them a higher clearance from the water.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the three were {{grounded}} on July 14, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which {{had been brought to}} map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and drudgery of the trek. Strindberg took about 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15lb) camera {{over the course of the}} three months they spent on the <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> one of the most famous being his picture of Andrée and Frænkel contemplating the fallen Eagle (see image above).|$|E
40|$|There is {{moderate}} {{evidence that}} heat wrap therapy reduces pain and disability {{for patients with}} back pain that lasts for less than three months. The relief has only been shown to occur {{for a short time}} and the effect is relatively small. The addition of exercise to heat wrap therapy appears to provide additional benefit. There is still not enough evidence about the effect of the application of cold for low-back pain of any duration, or for heat for back pain that lasts longer than three months. Heat treatments include hot water bottles, soft heated packs filled with grain, poultices, hot towels, hot baths, saunas, steam, heat wraps, heat pads, electric heat pads and infra-red heat lamps. Cold treatments include ice, cold towels, cold gel <b>packs,</b> <b>ice</b> <b>packs</b> and <b>ice</b> massage...|$|R

50|$|Targeted {{temperature}} {{management is}} thought to prevent brain injury by several methods including decreasing the brain's oxygen demand, reducing the production of neurotransmitters like glutamate, as well as reducing free radicals that might damage the brain. The lowering of body temperature may be accomplished by many means {{including the use of}} cooling blankets, cooling helmets, cooling catheters, <b>ice</b> <b>packs</b> and <b>ice</b> water lavage.|$|R
5|$|Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often {{referred}} to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the Endurance, was destroyed when it became trapped in <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> in the Weddell Sea. He modified the small boat, James Caird, that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to fetch help {{for the rest of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1914, Shackleton's {{expedition}} ship Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea, on {{the first}} stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77° 49' S, where a shore party was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.|$|E

There the mile-wide stream divided and subdivided again,--which was well for water, but not so well for <b>packed</b> <b>ice.</b> The islands drove their wedged heads into the frozen flood and tossed the cakes high into the air. But cake pressed upon cake and shelved out of the water, out and up, sliding and grinding and climbing, and still more cakes from behind, till hillocks and mountains of ice upreared and crashed among the trees.|$|R

5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S. At this point, {{the ship was}} held fast in the <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> and the prospect loomed of becoming trapped for the winter. It was {{during this period of}} inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, trawls, and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the oceanography and marine life of the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them {{to the edge of the}} <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after {{inspection}} by HRH the Duke of York (the future King George V), {{who presented}} a Union Flag. Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions {{the ship was}} carrying Siberian sledge dogs, {{the first to be}} taken on an Antarctic expedition. After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the Antarctic Circle on 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether local {{application}} of <b>ice</b> <b>packs</b> had positive effects on recovery from eccentric contraction-induced skeletal muscle injury and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Three male and 8 female healthy university students served as subjects. The subjects performed 20 eccentric contractions of elbow flexor muscles on 2 occasions, one with application of <b>ice</b> <b>packs</b> on the muscles immediately after eccentric actions (experimental trial) and the other without <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> modality (control trial). Maximal isometric strength, relaxed upper arm circumference, flexed elbow angle and perceived muscle soreness were measured before, immediately after eccentric actions, after 30 min-long <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> application, and 1 day after and 2 days after eccentric actions. Plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity was determined before, 1 day after and 2 days after eccentric actions. Repeated measure ANOVA showed significant cold treatment effect and treatment-time interaction were found for girth of upper arm. Girth of upper arm was significantly lower in the experimental trial than in the control trial. Moreover, <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> treatment decreased the girth of upper arm to control values immediately after treatment. No treatment-time interaction existed for maximum isometric strength, perceived muscle soreness, relaxed elbow angle and CPK activity. It is concluded that cold treatment with <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> modality has very little effects, if any, on the eccentric contraction-induced muscle injury and DOMS...|$|R
