5|$|One of {{the first}} known {{experiments}} {{on the relationship between}} combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd centuryBCE Greek writer on mechanics, <b>Philo</b> of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, <b>Philo</b> observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. <b>Philo</b> incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Philo</b> of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him {{to think he was}} a god. <b>Philo</b> of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Philo's</b> {{dates of}} birth and death are unknown but can be judged by <b>Philo's</b> {{description}} of himself as [...] "old" [...] when {{he was part of}} the delegation to Gaius Caligula in AD 38. Jewish history professor Daniel R. Schwartz estimates his birth year as sometime between 20 and 10 BC. <b>Philo's</b> reference to an event under the reign of Emperor Claudius indicates that he died sometime after AD 41.|$|R
5|$|Mace takes Lenny to her brother's {{house and}} watches Iris's disc. They {{discover}} that her death {{is tied to}} a cover-up {{of the murder of}} rapper Jeriko One by Steckler and Engleman, who disapprove of his politically-charged music. Lenny, Mace, and Max also learn that Tick has been rendered brain-dead from forcefully being exposed to highly amplified SQUID signals. Lenny concludes that the assault on Tick was committed by the same person who killed Iris and fears Faith will be next. Back at the nightclub, Lenny and Mace confront Faith, who tells them that <b>Philo</b> hired Iris to spy on Jeriko. As midnight approaches, Lenny and Mace sneak into a private party at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel that <b>Philo</b> is hosting for the city's wealthy elite. Lenny also gives Iris's disc to Mace so that she can deliver it to deputy police commissioner Palmer Strickland.|$|E

5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher <b>Philo</b> merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E

5|$|Like the Septuagint, the Greek {{translation}} of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek. Some Jews writing in Greek during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial period—notably the philosopher <b>Philo</b> and the historian Josephus—included gentiles among their intended audience. The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are other examples of Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds another SQUID disc and Philo's {{body on the}} floor, whose {{brain has}} been damaged {{in the same manner}} as Tick's. After watching the disc, Lenny discovers that Max and Faith have become lovers and that they forced <b>Philo</b> to run an amplified recording of them having sex. Max and Faith then enter the room, explaining that they set <b>Philo</b> up because he wanted to have Faith killed for what she knew about Jeriko's death, and that he now intends to frame Lenny for Philo's murder. After a hand-to-hand fight, Lenny throws Max off the balcony to his death. Meanwhile, on the street, Mace is pursued by Steckler and Engelman, but she manages to subdue them with the help of Strickland, who saw the proof behind Jeriko's death. Lenny then finds Mace and the two share a passionate kiss as the crowd celebrates the turn of the new century around them.|$|E
5|$|American <b>Philo</b> McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E

5|$|At one time, {{there were}} {{detailed}} contemporaneous histories on Caligula, {{but they are}} now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and <b>Philo,</b> were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus {{was a friend of}} Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation. Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.|$|E

5|$|Caligula did {{not trust}} the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had {{connections}} with Egyptian separatists. In AD 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus. According to <b>Philo,</b> the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as {{the king of the}} Jews. Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish synagogues. As a result, riots broke out in the city. Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.|$|E

5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they {{went back and forth}} from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of <b>Philo</b> of Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Philo</b> of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger {{describe}} Caligula as {{an insane}} emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and indulged {{in too much}} spending and sex. He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it, killing for mere amusement, deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation, and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship. Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the audience into the arena during the intermission to be eaten by the wild beasts {{because there were no}} prisoners to be used and he was bored.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Caligula's reign is {{extremely}} problematic as only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived — {{the works of}} <b>Philo</b> and Seneca. Philo's works, On the Embassy to Gaius and Flaccus, give some details on Caligula's early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in AD 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius Julius Alexander was {{probably}} born {{early in the}} reign of the Emperor Tiberius (1437). His father was Alexander, an Alexandrian Jew who held the office of Alabarch; the exact meaning of this term is debated, but it may have denoted a senior customs official. The older Alexander enjoyed Roman citizenship, a rare privilege among the Jews of Alexandria, and therefore passed it to his sons. He also had business connections both with Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great, and with Antonia, mother of the emperor Claudius. Another prominent member of Tiberius Alexander's family was his uncle, the philosopher <b>Philo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by <b>Philo</b> Judaeus.|$|E
