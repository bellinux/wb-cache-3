5|$|At {{the time}} Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who {{maintained}} Frankish influence in Northumbria {{and is known}} to have supported Offa's enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is almost certainly the same <b>person</b> <b>as</b> Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.|$|E
5|$|Charles Oman {{proposed}} that Beornred, who in 757 emerged {{for a short}} time as ruler of Mercia before being driven out by Offa, could be the same <b>person</b> <b>as</b> Beonna. An alternative theory suggests that Beonna and Beornred may perhaps have been kinsmen from the same dynasty with ambitions to rule in both Mercia and East Anglia. No known member of the Wuffingas dynasty had a name commencing with B, but several Mercian rulers, including Beornred, used the letter.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same <b>person</b> <b>as</b> Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, {{it has been argued that}} Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E

5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days. Offa {{is known}} to have died in 796, on either 26 July or 29 July, so Ecgfrith's date of death is either 14 December or 17 December of the same year. Coenwulf succeeded Ecgfrith as king. Coenwulf's father's name was Cuthberht, who may have been the same <b>person</b> <b>as</b> an ealdorman of that name who {{witnessed}} charters during the reign of Offa. Coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during Offa's reign. According to the genealogy of Mercian kings preserved in the Anglian collection Coenwulf was descended from a brother of Penda named Cenwealh, of whom there is no other record. It is possible that this refers to Cenwealh of Wessex, who was married to (and later repudiated) a sister of Penda.|$|E
5|$|After an interregnum {{prompted}} by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from Gaul to become {{ruler of the}} East Angles. It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a commander was later remembered. During his reign, part of the kingdom was governed by Ecgric his 'kinsman', a relationship described by the Latin term cognatus. This may mean that Ecgric was a son of Rædwald. However, the historian Steven Plunkett is amongst those that consider Ecgric {{to be the same}} <b>person</b> <b>as</b> Æthelric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the Anglian collection) as a son of Eni, Rædwald's brother. Whoever the pagan Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt throughout his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|B. Nagi Reddy of Vijaya Vauhini Studios helped B. Vittalacharya in the {{production}} of Mane Thumbida Hennu (1958), the latter's directorial debut in Kannada cinema. As an act of gratitude, Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy. Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich woman whose brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she chooses a mentally challenged <b>person</b> <b>as</b> her step-daughter's life partner. Nagi Reddy chose to remake the film in Telugu and discussed it with D. V. Narasa Raju; {{it was the first time}} Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film. After the script was ready, Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy. Pullaiah was not appreciative of Narasa Raju's treatment of the script and Nagi Reddy met his partner Aluri Chakrapani to develop the script further.|$|E
5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free <b>person.</b> <b>As</b> an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first <b>person</b> <b>as</b> he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
