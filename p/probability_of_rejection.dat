Situations arise that necessitate {{the use of this}} test when the data is partially correlated. There exists a need to examine how the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is affected by using correlated data. This study evaluated, by means of computer simulations, the effect on inference using the t test under condition violating the assumption of independence. Varying combinations of sample sizes, proportions of correlated data and magnitudes of the correlation coefficient were simulated. The evaluation criterion used was the proportion of simulated t values which exceeded the proportion of theoretical t values to be expected. The analysis revealed trends for the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> of the null hypothesis decreased in all simulated t distributions with positive correlation coefficients. When the magnitude of the positive correlation coefficient or the proportion of correlated data was increased, the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> was decreased. The opposite result occurred with negatively correlated data; as the absolute values of negative correlation coefficients or the proportion of correlated data was increased, the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> of the null hypothesis was increased.

While positive and negative reciprocity are observed in investment and ultimatum games, respectively, prior laboratory studies often neglect the effect of time delays that are common in real-world interactions. This research investigates the effect of time delays on reciprocity in the investment and ultimatum games. We manipulate the time delay after second movers have been informed about the first movers’ decisions. We find that a delay is correlated with fewer rejections in the ultimatum game, but we find no effect of delays in the investment game. A follow-up study explores some of the processes that occur during time delay in the ultimatum game. We find delays correlated to increased reported feelings of satisfaction and decreased reported feelings of disappointment.

40|$|An {{integral}} part of the MIL-STD- 105 D scheme for sampling inspection by attributes is the transfer from normal inspection to reduced or tightened inspection when the historical record of inspected lots suggests unusually good or bad quality. The switching rules in MIL-STD- 105 D have been criticized, especially by Japanese manufacturers, as being too severe when what is defined as acceptable quality material is submitted. This paper examines the long range fraction of lots rejected for several MIL-STD- 105 D sampling plans by using the MIL-STD- 105 D switching rules, using a modification suggested by the Japanese Standards Association, and by using a second modification developed by the authors. The Japanese Standards Association switching rules are more complex than those in MIL-STD- 105 D. It is demonstrated that they lead to improved long-range properties for Normal-Tightened-Reduced schemes, but to poorer properties for Normal-Tightened schemes. A simplified set of switching rules is suggested, wherein the “limit numbers” in MIL-STD- 105 D are eliminated. In comparison to MIL-STD- 105 D, the simpler rules lead to a lower <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> for good lots and a comparable <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> for bad lots...|$|E
40|$|A {{decision}} problem is considered {{in which the}} outcome of a random variable X is to be identified from {{the outcome of a}} variable Y. Due to noise, Y is subject to random variations and is itself a random variable. The probability distribution of Y is determined by the outcome of X and that of a random variable Z which is independent of X. The variable Z takes its values from the set če:italic>zk : k = 1, 2 ⩽ce:italic>, and the outcome of Y is said to be observed in the noise state k when Z = zk. In general, it is assumed that the a priori probabilities of all possible outcomes of X are known, but the a priori probabilities of noise states 1 and 2 are unknown. In response to an outcome of Y, the observer can either attempt to identify the outcome of X or else he can reject, i. e., refuse to attempt identification. Hence, to any decision function that the observer might use, there corresponds a probability of error and a <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> for each noise state. Decision functions are introduced which minimize the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> in state 1 among all decision functions for which the probability of error in state 2 does not exceed a prescribed limit β. Among all such decision functions, it is shown how to construct those which are best {{in the sense that they}} provide the least probability of error in state 2. A special class of problems is considered in which these best decision functions provide probabilities of error in state 1 not exceeding the least probability of error that can be obtained in that state without the aid of rejection. In addition, it is shown that in some cases they also minimize the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> in state 2 among all decision functions for which the probability of error in the same state does not exceed β. Some possible applications in the areas of pattern recognition and communications have been stated...|$|E

40|$|Sirolimus (rapamycin, RAPAMUNE, RAPA) is an {{immunosuppressive}} agent {{used for the}} prophylaxis <b>of</b> renal allograft <b>rejection</b> and exhibits an immunosuppressive mechanism that is distinct from that for cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss the exposure-response relationships and drug interactiosn of sirolimus. The various factors affecting sirolimus whole blood exposure included first-pass extraction, formulation, food, demographics, liver disease, assay method, and interacting drugs. Clinically significant effects caused by food, pediatric age, hepatic impairment, and interacting drugs require recommendations for the safe and efficacious use of sirolimus in renal allograft patients. An exposure-response model based on multivariate logistic regression was developed using the interstudy data from 1832 renal allograft patients. The analysis revealed an increased <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> acute <b>rejection</b> for sirolimus troughs < 5 ng/mL, cyclosporine troughs < 150 ng/mL, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches ≥ 4, and females. The outcomes suggested that individualization of sirolimus doses immediately after transplantation, based on HLA mismatch and sex, would likely decrease the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> acute <b>rejections</b> in renal allograft recipients who receive concomitant sirolimus, cyclosporine (full-dose), and corticosteroid therapy. Sirolimus is a substrate for both Cytochrome P 450 3 A (CYP 3 A) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and undergoes extensive first-pass extraction. Drugs that are known to inhibit or induce these proteins may potentially affect sirolimus whole blood exposure. In healthy volunteers, cyclosporine, diltiazem, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and verapamil significantly increased sirolimus whole blood exposure, and rifampin significantly decreased sirolimus exposure. However, sirolimus whole blood exposure was not affected by acyclovir, atorvastatin, digoxin, ethinyl estradiol/norgestrel, glyburide, nifedipine, or tacrolimus. Among the 15 drugs studied, sirolimus significantly increased the exposures of only erythromycin and S-(−) verapamil...|$|R

The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> divergence in <b>rejection</b> is defined as that associated with regional selection of a line given that is discarded by the site where selection is being conducted.
