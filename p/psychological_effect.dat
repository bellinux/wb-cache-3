5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval cannon, the pot-de-fer, had bulbous, vase-like shape, and {{was used}} more for <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> than for causing physical damage. The later culverin was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, {{and was used}} as an anti-personnel weapon. During the 15th century, cannon advanced significantly, so that bombards were effective siege engines. Towards the end of the period, the cannon gradually replaced siege enginesamong other forms of aging weaponryon the battlefield.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the influence of form of information and technology used to deliver the information on the <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> of a single user of technology. First, information is divided into substance and form. Then the interaction of form of information and the technology carrying information is investigated. Personalization as the adaptation of the form of information is discussed as the basis of producing <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> {{at the level of the}} individual user of technology. Some key factors influencing <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> in technology, substance of information and form of information are identified. The integration of these key factors into entities which produce certain <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> is discussed as the production of significant form. To support the conception of significant form some empirical evidence related to key factors influencing <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> and the multimodality of perceptual processing are presented. Finally, the design rules for individualized <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> are presented as creating potentially new types o...|$|R

The HRS has seen wide acceptance throughout the international research community as a sensitive and specific instrument for measuring <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> {{of a wide variety}} of psychoactive substances, with over 45 articles documenting its use as of mid-2015. A follow-up DMT study demonstrated lack of tolerance to the <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> of repeated closely spaced doses of DMT, making DMT unique among classical psychedelics.|$|R
50|$|The <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> of {{occupational}} needlestick injuries can include health anxiety, anxiety about disclosure or transmission to a sexual partner, trauma-related emotions, and depression. These effects can cause self-destructive behavior or functional impairment in relationships and daily life. This is not mitigated by knowledge about disease transmission or PEP. Though some affected people have worsened anxiety during repeated testing, anxiety and other <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> typically abate after testing is complete. A minority of people affected by needlestick injuries may have lasting <b>psychological</b> <b>effects,</b> including post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|R
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1942, the Perth and Houston {{attempted}} {{to move through}} the Sunda Strait to Tjilatjap however they found their path blocked by the main Japanese invasion fleet from western Java. The Allied ships were engaged by at least three cruisers and several destroyers and in a ferocious night action, known as the Battle of Sunda Strait, both Perth and Houston were torpedoed and sunk. Casualties aboard Perth included 350 crew and 3 civilians killed, while 324 survived the sinking and were taken prisoner by the Japanese (106 of whom later died in captivity). The loss of Perth so soon after the sinking of her sister Sydney, had a major <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> on the Australian people. Japanese losses included a minesweeper and a troop transport sunk by friendly fire, whilst three other transports were damaged and had to be beached.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Turgut Reis shelled Bulgarian troops around Tekirdağ. On 17 November, she {{supported}} the Ottoman III Corps by bombarding the attacking Bulgarian forces. The ship was aided by artillery observers ashore. The battleship's gunnery was largely ineffective, though {{it provided a}} morale boost for the besieged Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca. By 17:00, the Bulgarian infantry had largely been forced back to their starting positions, {{in part due to}} the <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> of the battleships' bombardment. On 22 November, Turgut Reis sortied from the Bosporus to cover the withdrawal of Hamidiye, which had been torpedoed by a Bulgarian torpedo boat earlier that morning.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} force led by Castillo Armas {{attempted to make}} forays towards the towns of Zacapa and Puerto Barrios; however, these were beaten back by the Guatemalan army. The propaganda broadcast by the CIA had far more effect; it succeeded in leading a Guatemalan pilot to defect, which led to Árbenz grounding the entire air force, fearing its defection. The CIA also used its planes, flown by American pilots, to bomb Guatemalan towns for <b>psychological</b> <b>effect.</b> When the old planes used by the invasion force {{were found to be}} inadequate, the CIA persuaded Eisenhower to authorize the use of two additional planes. Guatemala made an appeal to the United Nations, but the US vetoed an investigation into the incident by the Security Council, stating that it was an internal matter in Guatemala. On 25 June, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Frightened by this, Árbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers. The army refused to do this, instead demanding that Árbenz either resign or come to terms with Castillo Armas.|$|E
5|$|These {{issues were}} would shape {{what would be}} known as Operation Claret. The best-trained British light {{infantry}} roamed the jungle, attacking Indonesian bases and patrols at will and trying to {{give the appearance of}} being everywhere at once as a <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> upon the enemy. Initially launched only over short distances, seaborne raids into peninsular Malaysia caused the range to be extended throughout 1964 and 1965. Walker continued the Claret raids to great effect until the end of his tenure, as he was replaced by Major General George Lea as commander of British forces in Borneo. Lea, however, had the bad fortune of being ordered to take command just as the conflict began to reach its climax in the spring of 1965. Sukarno, desperate for a decisive victory and apprehensive of the effect that the fruitless conflict was having upon his country, was beginning to order stronger attacks to win a decisive military victory and drive the British from the border lines.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{training}} sessions in Tokyo, Talbot organised time trials for the Australians, which {{were held in}} front of opposition swimmers {{in an attempt to}} intimidate them. O'Brien posted a time of 2min 33s, which Talbot felt had a negative <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> on O'Brien's opponents. When competition started, O'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the first heat by 2.0s. He posted a time of 2min 31.4s, reducing the previous Olympic mark by 5.8s, an indication of how much the world record had fallen in the preceding four years. However, in the next heat, Egon Henninger of Germany immediately lowered the mark, {{and by the end of}} the heats, O'Brien was the fourth fastest qualifier for the semifinals, with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting faster times. O'Brien lowered Henninger's Olympic record by winning the second semifinal in a time of 2min 28.7s, after Jastremski had won the first semifinal in a time that was 3.4s slower than O'Brien. This made O'Brien the fastest qualifier for the final, with a time that was 1.0s faster than the next qualifier Prokopenko, who came second to him in the second semifinal. O'Brien planned to swim the race at an even pace and record even splits for the first and second half of the race. He was mindful of not chasing Jastremski, who was known for an aggressive opening style, which resulted in a faster first half.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the action}} in Ruhengeri, the RPF began {{to carry out a}} classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war. The FAR massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains. However, the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all out assault. Paul Kagame's troops attacked the FAR forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> of the RPF's resurgence was not lost. Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place. This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war. The RPF made some territorial gains, including capturing the border town of Gatuna. This was significant, as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of Mombasa via the Northern Corridor, forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier Central Corridor. By late 1991, the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory close to Mulindi, in Byumba province. Many Hutu civilians residing in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of internally displaced persons in the country.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the <b>psychological</b> <b>effect</b> of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D) [...] University of Washington, 2003 <b>Psychological</b> side <b>effects</b> {{may affect}} patients' {{willingness}} to continue or return to SSRI treatment, {{and may be}} one reason for client dissatisfaction with medication. The goal {{of this study was to}} document the existence of a range of <b>psychological</b> side <b>effects</b> associated with SSRIs taken for depression and to determine their relationship to patients' decisions to stop treatment, and attitudes toward taking SSRIs again. Methods. We conducted 161 semi-structured telephone interviews of adults who had completed a course of treatment for depression with one of the SSRIs. We elicited information about drug effects on symptoms, physical side <b>effects,</b> unwanted <b>psychological</b> <b>effects,</b> reasons for quitting and willingness to return to the same treatment in case of future depression. We identified 29 categories of unwanted <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> and analyzed data in terms of Responders and Non-Responders, the former split into Renewers and Non-Renewers. Results. Contrary to expectations, Non-Renewers and Non-Responders did not differ in the number of SEs experienced, and Non-Responders experienced significantly more unwanted <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> than either Renewers or Non-Renewers, t (121) = 2. 818, p <. 01. Twenty-seven percent of the sample cited <b>psychological</b> side <b>effects</b> and 27 % cited physical side effects as primary reason for quitting SSRI treatment. Non-Responders cited <b>psychological</b> side <b>effects</b> rather than non-response as their primary reason for quitting, and Non-Renewers cited physical more than <b>psychological</b> side <b>effects.</b> Conclusion. <b>Psychological</b> side <b>effects</b> might well be included in measures and discussions of side effects, even though they present no known physical danger to the patient. Discussion. Unwanted <b>psychological</b> <b>effects</b> reported by our participants included problems with empathy, sociability, irritability, and creativity. These are interpreted as supporting a contextualist or developmental view of psychopathology. A thoroughly contextualized approach to treatment is therefore recommended...|$|R
