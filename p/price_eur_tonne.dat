40|$|A novel {{energy and}} cost {{effective}} transport chain for stranded natural gas utilized for power production with CO 2 capture and storage is developed. It includes an offshore section, a combined gas carrier, and an integrated receiving terminal. In the offshore process, natural gas (NG) is liquefied to LNG by {{liquid carbon dioxide}} (LCO 2) and liquid inert nitrogen (LIN), which are used as cold carriers. The offshore process is self-supported with power, hot and cold utilities and can operate with little rotating equipment and without flammable refrigerants. In the onshore process, the cryogenic exergy in LNG is used to cool and liquefy the cold carriers, which reduces the power requirement to 319 Â kWh/tonne LNG. Pinch and exergy analyses are used to determine thermodynamically optimized offshore and onshore processes with exergy efficiencies of 87 % and 71 %, respectively. There are very low emissions from the processes. The estimated specific costs for the offshore and onshore process are 8. 0 and 14. 6 <b>EUR</b> per <b>tonne</b> LNG, respectively, excluding energy costs. With an electricity <b>price</b> of 100 <b>EUR</b> per MWh, the specific cost {{of energy in the}} onshore process is 31. 9 <b>EUR</b> per <b>tonne</b> LNG.

40|$|High costs often {{prevent the}} market {{diffusion}} of novel and efficient energy technologies. Monitoring cost and price decline for these technologies is thus important {{in order to}} establish effective energy policy. Here, we present experience curves and cost-benefit analyses for condensing gas boilers produced and sold in the Netherlands between 1981 and 2006. For the most dominant boiler type on the Dutch market, i. e., condensing gas combi boilers, we identify learning rates of 14 ± 1 % for the average price and 16 ± 8 % for the additional price relative to non-condensing devices. Economies of scale, competitive sourcing of boiler components, and improvements in boiler assembly are among the main drivers behind the observed price decline. The net present value of condensing gas combi boilers shows an overall increasing trend. Purchasing in 2006 a gas boiler of this type instead of a non-condensing device generates a net present value of 970 EUR (Euro) and realizes CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emission savings at negative costs of − 120 <b>EUR</b> per <b>tonne</b> CO 2. We attribute two-thirds of the improvements in the cost-benefit performance of condensing gas combi boilers to technological learning and one-third to a combination of external effects and governmental policies...|$|R

The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale <b>price</b> of <b>EUR</b> 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|R

Until 1966, a kilogram of chocolate could be bought for USD 3.30 (approximately EUR 2.50) as opposed to the <b>price</b> of <b>EUR</b> 25.00 per kilogram of chocolate in 2014. In 1983, Leonidas made the most filled chocolates of the Belgian chocolate producers and did not export past London. The fresh butter and cream used in Leonidas chocolate makes them expire faster and more difficult to export. When preservatives were added to the product, the freshest dairy cream was no longer usable. Still, Leonidas chocolate must be eaten within 49 days in average, which is six weeks minus transportation depending if it is cream based, contains alcohol or is foil wrapped or ganache (ganache lasts longer than 60 days). Despite its growth as a company, Leonidas is well-respected and still Belgian. The goods are made in an old plant not far from Brussels and flown at low temp to far stores in locations like Chicago and New York City. The old Crown-Baele factory at 41-43 Graindor Boulevard in Anderlecht remains the company headquarters. In 1993, the Rue au Beurre shop was opened. It is the largest Leonidas shop in the world with a staff of 20. In 2012, Leonidas has 350 shops in Belgium and nearly 1,250 stores in around 50 countries including 340 in France.
