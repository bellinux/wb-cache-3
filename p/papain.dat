5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and <b>papain.</b> The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. <b>papain).</b> This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{geometries}} been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and <b>papain</b> superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The enzymes trypsin and {{chymotrypsin}} {{were first}} purified in the 1930s. A serine {{in each of}} trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing {{the orientation of the}} catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated <b>papain</b> and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads. The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as <b>papain)</b> triads were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s. Of particular contention during the 1990s and early 2000s was the contribution of low-barrier hydrogen bonding to catalysis; however, current thinking is that ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, <b>papain</b> uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E
25|$|The Ge2 epitope is {{antigenic}} only on glycophorin D {{and is a}} cryptic antigen in glycophorin C. It {{is located}} within exon 2 and is sensitive to trypsin and <b>papain</b> but resistant to chymotrypsin and pronase. The Ge3 epitope is encoded by exon 3. It is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin, <b>papain</b> and pronase. It is thought to lie in the between amino acids 42-50 in glycophorin C (residues 21-49 in glycophorin D). Ge4 is located within the first 21 amino acids of glycophorin C. It is sensitive to trypsin, <b>papain,</b> pronase and neuraminidase.|$|E
25|$|Systemic enzyme therapy (consisting of {{combinations}} of proteolytic enzymes such as bromelain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and <b>papain)</b> {{has been investigated}} in Europe to evaluate the efficacy in breast, colorectal, and plasmacytoma cancer patients.|$|E
25|$|Along with <b>papain,</b> {{bromelain}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular proteases to use for meat tenderizing. Bromelain is sold in a powdered form, which is combined with a marinade, or directly sprinkled on the uncooked meat.|$|E
25|$|Glycophorin B {{carries the}} blood group antigens N, Ss and U. Both glycophorin A and B bind the Vicia graminea anti-N lectin. S and s antigens are not {{affected}} by treatment with trypsin or sialidase but are destroyed or much depressed by treatment with <b>papain,</b> pronase or alpha-chymotrypsin.|$|E
25|$|Proteases are {{involved}} in digesting long protein chains into shorter fragments by splitting the peptide bonds that link amino acid residues. Some detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain (exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A); others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein (endopeptidases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, <b>papain,</b> elastase).|$|E
25|$|Meat {{from less}} tender cuts or older cattle can be {{mechanically}} tenderized by forcing small, sharp blades through the cuts {{to disrupt the}} proteins. Also, solutions of exogenous proteolytic enzymes (<b>papain,</b> bromelin or ficin) can be injected to augment the endogenous enzymes. Similarly, solutions of salt and sodium phosphates can be injected to soften and swell the myofibrillar proteins. This improves juiciness and tenderness. Salt can improve the flavor, but phosphate can contribute a soapy flavor.|$|E
25|$|Immunoglobulin G (IgG) {{antibodies}} {{are large}} heterodimeric molecules, approximately 150 kDa and {{are composed of}} two kinds of polypeptide chain, called the heavy (~50kDa) and the light chain (~25kDa). The two types of light chains are kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). By cleavage with enzyme <b>papain,</b> the Fab (fragment-antigen binding) part can {{be separated from the}} Fc (fragment constant) part of the molecule. The Fab fragments contain the variable domains, which consist of three antibody hypervariable amino acid domains responsible for the antibody specificity embedded into constant regions. The four known IgG subclasses are involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} calpain {{originates}} in 1964, when calcium-dependent proteolytic activities {{caused by a}} “calcium-activated neutral protease” (CANP) were detected in brain, lens of the eye and other tissues. In the late 1960s the enzymes were isolated and characterised independently in both rat brain and skeletal muscle. These activities were caused by an intracellular cysteine protease not associated with the lysosome and having an optimum activity at neutral pH, which clearly distinguished it from the cathepsin family of proteases. The calcium-dependent activity, intracellular localization, along with the limited, specific proteolysis on its substrates, highlighted calpain’s role as a regulatory, rather than a digestive protease. When the sequence of this enzyme became known, it was given the name “calpain”, to recognize it as a hybrid of two well-known proteins at the time, the calcium-regulated signalling protein, calmodulin, and the cysteine protease of papaya, <b>papain.</b> Shortly thereafter, the activity {{was found to be}} attributable to two main isoforms, dubbed μ("mu")-calpain and m-calpain (a.k.a. calpain I and II), that differed primarily in their calcium requirements in vitro. Their names reflect {{the fact that they are}} activated by micro- and nearly millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ within the cell, respectively.|$|E

50|$|<b>Papain</b> {{can be used}} to dissociate {{cells in}} the first step of cell culture preparations. A ten-minute {{treatment}} of small tissue pieces (less than 1 mm cubed) will allow <b>papain</b> to begin cleaving the extracellular matrix molecules holding the cells together. After ten minutes, the tissue should be treated with a protease inhibitor solution to stop the protease action. Left untreated, <b>papain</b> activity will lead to complete lysis of the cells. The tissue must then be triturated (passed quickly up and down through a Pasteur pipette) to break up the pieces of tissue into a single cell suspension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Papain</b> {{is usually}} {{produced}} as a crude, dried material by collecting the latex from {{the fruit of}} the papaya tree.
