25|$|On 8 April 1940, {{after the}} British had {{announced}} that they had laid three naval mine fields along the Norwegian coast to force German shipping out of neutral Norwegian waters, Laake and the general staff contacted minister Ljungberg and suggested mobilizing the Norwegian Army. The most wide-ranging of the suggestions involved mobilizing significant forces in southern and western Norway. Defence Minister Birger Ljungberg then advised the government to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to the next day. The same day that the British mine fields had been laid, a German ship carrying troops and war matériel had been sunk by the Polish submarine Orzeł off the southern Norwegian port of Lillesand. The British mine fields, however, overshadowed this news.|$|E
25|$|Events {{conspired to}} {{frustrate}} the plan, however. First of all, Attorney General Roger B. Taney sought to convince Jackson that McLane’s plan {{was really a}} new packaging of the old Federalist program and in contradiction with Jackson’s own past positions. At the time Jackson was somewhat flexible on the issue, and McLane wanted to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> until after the presidential election of 1832. But Henry Clay decided that renewal of the bank charter was an issue he could use to defeat Jackson and convinced bank president Biddle to press for an immediate re-charter. By itself, this crystallized Jackson’s opposition to re-chartering, which he vetoed when passed by the Congress. This caused him to view his eventual victory {{in the presidential election}} as a popular endorsement of his bank policy.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 a {{shipyard}} awarded Italian Avio a USD 10 {{million deal}} to provide CODAG propulsion system. In 2008 the hull was at 80% completion when financial crisis broke up. In 2009 the defence budget {{was cut by}} 5 billion PLN. This led to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to order the combat systems worth PLN 824 million that was negotiated with Thales in 2008. The ships planned armament included RIM-162 ESSM and RIM-116 RAM surface-to-air missiles, RBS-15 Mk 3 anti-ship missiles and MU90 Impact torpedoes. On 16 September 2009 the hull already with engines, turbines, generators, line shafts and air-conditioners completed technical launching for the first time. At {{the same time the}} Ministry Of Defence decided to suspend corvette financing. In April 2011 the court declared Naval Shipyard's bankruptcy. On 24 February 2012 Gawron program was cancelled. At that time the hull was largely completed at the cost of 402 million PLN (~US$130m), but equipping it with combat systems would have cost an additional 1 billion PLN (~US$320m). On 23 September 2013 an annex to 2001 construction contract was signed to complete the sole unit as patrol vessel. Due to design changes the program code name was changed to Projekt 621M. ORP Ślązak modular design and systems allows to upgrade it to the corvette configuration in the future.|$|E

40|$|Common {{control systems}} for mobile robots {{include the use}} of some {{deterministic}} control law coupled with some pose estimation method, such as the extended Kalman filter, by considering the certainty equivalence principle. Recent approaches consider the use of partially observable Markov decision process strategies together with Bayesian estimators. These methods are well suited to handle the uncertainty in pose estimation but demand significant processing power. In order to reduce the required processing power and still allow for multimodal or non-Gaussian uncertain distributions, we propose a scheme based on a particle filter and a corresponding cloud of control signals. The approach avoids the use of the certainty equivalence principle by <b>postponing</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> on <b>the</b> optimal estimate to the control stage. As the mapping between the pose space and the control action space is nonlinear and the best estimation of robot pose is uncertain, <b>postponing</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to <b>the</b> control space makes it possible to select a better control action in the presence of multimodal and non-Gaussian uncertainty models.

This compromise meant that no decision could be taken until a unanimously accepted agreement was reached.
