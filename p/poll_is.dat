5|$|Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster <b>Poll</b> <b>is</b> {{an annual}} survey of roller coasters {{from around the}} world. It {{is widely regarded as}} the best and most accurate of any roller coaster poll available due to its ranking algorithm which prevents the poll from becoming a popularity contest. In the poll, Thunder Run entered at position 30 in 1994, maintaining an average of 54 for the 17 years that followed. The ride's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the table below.|$|E

50|$|Social <b>polling</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} {{open access}} polling, which {{combines}} social media and opinion polling. In contrast to tradition <b>polling</b> the <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> formulated by the respondents themselves. Social <b>polling</b> <b>is</b> an example of nonprobability sampling that uses self-selection rather than a statistical sampling scheme.|$|R
50|$|The AP <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> 1.Oklahoma 2.Alabama 3.Ohio State 4.USC 5.Michigan and the UPI <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> 1.Alabama 2.Ohio State 3.USC 4.Michigan 5.Auburn.|$|R
5|$|Unlike most sports, college football's {{governing}} body, the NCAA, {{does not}} bestow a National Championship title. That title is bestowed {{by one or}} more of four different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason: the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll. Two additional polls are released midway through the season; the Harris Interactive <b>Poll</b> <b>is</b> released after the fourth week of the season and the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Standings is released after the seventh week. The Harris Poll and Coaches Poll are factors in the BCS Standings.|$|E
5|$|All officers, clerks, interpreters, {{candidates}} and candidates' agents at polling stations must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations. Before the <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> closed, {{they must not}} communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the electoral register. They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during the counting of votes as to which candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper. Furthermore, no person is allowed {{to try to find}} out from within a polling station who a voter intends to vote for or has voted for, or to communicate with a voter after he has been given a ballot paper but before he has placed it in a ballot box.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2011, {{the final}} Bowl Championship Series standings were {{unveiled}} with LSU ranked first, followed by Alabama, {{to set up}} a rematch between the two teams in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the weeks that led up to the game, the notion of a split national championship became a major storyline. This was the case as the AP <b>Poll</b> <b>is</b> not tied to the Bowl Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS National Championship Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus national championship and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E

5|$|The College of Arms {{is also an}} {{authorised}} {{location for}} enrolling a change of name. In common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular formality to change one's name. However, {{it is possible to}} execute a deed poll, more specifically a deed of change of name, as a demonstration of intention to adopt and henceforth use a new name, and deeds poll may be enrolled either in the High Court or in the College. On being enrolled the deed is customarily 'gazetted', that is published in the London Gazette. The deed <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> not entered on the registers, but is still published, if the name change only affects one's given name.|$|E
25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> not already known. In other words, the outcome of the <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> relatively unpredictable, and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, the RPI {{has held}} a straw poll in Iowa in each year {{preceding}} a presidential election, except {{when there is}} a Republican incumbent. This straw <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> separate from the Republican caucuses. The straw poll includes a dinner, multiple speeches by candidates, and a variety of booths set up by various candidates and causes, in addition to an actual straw poll of participants' presidential preferences.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> held to {{find out}} which song would be Ivi's next single. The <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> between Gelaei and To Mistiko Mou Na Vreis. The <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> held in August 2010. It was {{announced}} on 30 August 2010 that the winner was To Mistiko Mou Na Vreis. The filming started in September 2010. The video was released on 15 November 2010.|$|R
50|$|<b>Polling</b> <b>was</b> held on 1 December in 199 {{assembly}} seats out of 200 seats. Churu constituency <b>polling</b> <b>was</b> postponed to December 13 due {{to death}} of BSP candidate Jagdish Meghwal.|$|R
50|$|The <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> held on 16 January 1967. <b>Polling</b> <b>was</b> largely {{peaceful}} {{with reports}} of a few incidents. Supporters from both sides tried their best to ensure that people voted.|$|R
25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} by the following example. Assume that an opinion <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> conducted by calling random telephone numbers. Unemployed {{people are more likely}} to be home and answer the phone than employed people are. Therefore, unemployed respondents are likely to be over-represented in the sample. The probability distribution of employed versus unemployed respondents in a sample of n respondents can be described as a noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
25|$|Sydney's The Daily Telegraph {{published}} a poll that revealed 83% of respondents thought Ponting {{was not a}} good ambassador for the game. A poll on The Sydney Morning Heralds website revealed that 60% of the public agreed with Roebuck's call for Ponting to stand down. However, neither <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> necessarily reflective of opinion in Australia with anyone in the world can vote as often as they please, and the sample is not random. However, a poll on the Wide World of Sports website revealed 41,000 of the 50,000 respondents did not want Ponting removed.|$|E
25|$|In caucus states, {{most state}} parties use a two pronged process. A straw poll, often called a presidential {{preference}} <b>poll,</b> <b>is</b> conducted of the attendees at the caucus. The results are {{released to the}} media and published on the state party website. Delegates are then elected to the county conventions. It is at the county conventions that delegates are elected to state conventions, and from the state convention to the national convention. At each level, delegates may be bound or unbound to a candidate. If unbound, delegates are not obligated to follow the results of the presidential preference poll. Thus, all estimates of delegates from caucus states are dependent on state party by-laws.|$|E
5000|$|The final AP <b>Poll</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in late November, {{at the end}} of the 1967 regular season. This would be the last time that the final <b>poll</b> <b>was</b> conducted before bowl season.|$|R
50|$|<b>Poll</b> <b>was</b> already {{inhabited}} {{during the}} New Stone Age; etymologically the name originates in a meaning like Swamp. The first documentary mentioning of <b>Poll</b> <b>was</b> on 1. April 1003 by monks from nearby Deutz Abbey, which {{was part of}} the Electorate of Cologne. The village <b>Poll</b> <b>was</b> suburbanized in 1889 and became a quarter of Cologne. Since 1975 it is part of city district Porz.|$|R

25|$|Poll {{results are}} listed in the table below in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first, and using the date the survey's {{fieldwork}} was done, as opposed to the date of publication. If such date is unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. In the instance that there is a tie, then no figure is shaded. The lead column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. When a specific poll does not show a data figure for a party, the party's cell corresponding to that <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> shown empty.|$|E

25|$|Mackerras also {{strongly}} {{championed the}} music of Janáček outside Czechoslovakia, where Mackerras himself judged his work with Janáček as his single most important legacy to music. In 1951, he conducted the British premiere of Káťa Kabanová. He was also a noted authority on Mozart's operas and those of Sir Arthur Sullivan. His ballet with John Cranko, Pineapple <b>Poll,</b> <b>is</b> an arrangement of Sullivan music with a story based on one of W. S. Gilbert's Bab Ballads. The piece premiered in 1951, soon after the expiration of copyright on Sullivan's music, {{and continues to be}} a popular light music favourite in English speaking countries. Mackerras later arranged music by Giuseppe Verdi for the ballet The Lady and the Fool. He also arranged a suite from John Ireland's score for the 1946 film The Overlanders, after Ireland's death in 1962.|$|E

50|$|National Licensing <b>polls</b> <b>were</b> held in {{conjunction}} with every general election from 1911 to 1984, except for 1931 and 1951. In 1919 two <b>polls</b> <b>were</b> held, on 10 April 1919 and 17 December 1919.|$|R
25|$|Opinion <b>polls</b> <b>were</b> held {{by various}} news {{agencies}} and organizations in Taiwan {{during the election}} campaign. Before the election, the last of such <b>polls</b> <b>was</b> published on March 11, 2008 because, according to ROC law, opinion <b>polls</b> could not <b>be</b> published within ten days of the election. However, <b>polls</b> can still <b>be</b> taken during the ten days.|$|R
25|$|The AP {{is known}} for its polls on {{numerous}} college sports in the United States. The AP polls ranking the top 25 NCAA Division I (Football Bowl Subdivision and Football Championship Subdivision) college football and NCAA DivisionI men's and women's college basketball teams are the most well known. The AP composes the polls by collecting and compiling the top-25 votes of numerous designated sports journalists. The AP poll of college football was particularly notable for many years because it helped determine the ranking of teams {{at the end of the}} regular season for the collegiate Bowl Championship Series until the AP, citing conflict of interest, asked for the poll to be removed from the bowl series. Beginning in the 2005 season, the Harris Interactive College Football Poll took the AP's place in the bowl series formula. The AP <b>poll</b> <b>is</b> the longest serving national poll in college football having begun in 1936. But with the creation of the BCS in 2006 and the College Football Playoffs in 2014, the AP no longer plays a part in selection of a National Champion.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, TCU was {{the only}} non–AQ conference team to get a BCS bowl berth. Boise State was {{ranked in the top}} five for most of the season, but a late-season {{overtime}} loss to Nevada knocked the Broncos out of serious contention for a BCS bowl bid, despite their continuing eligibility. TCU would defeat Wisconsin 21–19 in the 2011 Rose Bowl, once again calling into question the claim of AQ conference superiority. There was a movement to lobby those voting in the AP poll, which is not bound to vote for the BCS Championship winner as the Coaches <b>Poll</b> <b>is,</b> to vote TCU first and split the National Championship. While TCU got a few first place votes, this effort did not change the outcome of the AP poll, and TCU ended up in the No. 2 spot in all of the final major polls. As Utah had already done, TCU soon joined a conference with an automatic BCS tie, namely the Big 12 Conference (home of several other former members of the Southwest Conference, which TCU competed in for over 70 years) beginning with the 2012 season.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of push <b>polls</b> <b>is</b> {{that they are}} an effective way of maligning an opponent ("pushing" [...] voters towards a predetermined point of view) while avoiding direct responsibility for the distorted or false information suggested (but not directly alleged) in the push <b>poll.</b> They <b>are</b> risky for this same reason: if credible evidence emerges that the <b>polls</b> <b>were</b> directly ordered by a campaign or candidate, it could do serious damage to that campaign. Push <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> also relatively expensive, having a far higher cost per voter than radio or television commercials. Consequently, push <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> most used in elections with fewer voters, such as party primaries, or in close elections where a relatively small change in votes {{can make the difference}} between victory or defeat.|$|R
50|$|Exit <b>polls</b> <b>are</b> {{also used}} to collect {{demographic}} data about voters {{and to find out}} why they voted as they did. Since actual votes <b>are</b> cast anonymously, <b>polling</b> <b>is</b> the only way of collecting this information.|$|R
