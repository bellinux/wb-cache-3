40|$|Abstract-The use of web {{search engines}} are very {{frequent}} and common worldwide {{over the internet}} by end users for different purposes. A web search engine takes the query request from the end user and executes that query on relational database used to store the information on behalf of that web search engine.

Thus automatic annotation based method is needed to improve the accuracy as well as scalability of web search engines. This paper takes the review of such systems.

40|$|Wikis are {{a popular}} {{collaboration}} technology. They support the collaborative editing of web pages through a simple mark-up language. Mobile devices are becoming ubiquitous, powerful and affordable. Thus it is advantageous {{for people to}} get the benefits of wikis in a mobile setting. However, mobile computing leads to its own challenges such as limited screen size, bandwidth, memory and battery life; they also have intermittent connectivity due to the mobility and the coverage of network. I investigate how wikis can be made mobile; that is how wiki forms of collaborative editing can be achieved through mobile devices such as PDAs and smart phones. A prototype mobile wiki has been created using. NET, which addresses these issues and enables simple collaborative working whilst on and offline through smart mobile devices. A cut down wiki runs on the mobile device. This communicates with a main central wiki to cache pages for off line use. When sitting in a powered cradle eager, downloading and synchronization of <b>pages</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported.</b> During mobile operation, <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> cached lazily on demand to minimize power use and to save the limited and expensive bandwidth.

40|$|There are {{currently}} four task attributes defined in SAM- 3 : a) SIMPLE; b) ORDERED; c) HEAD OF QUEUE; and d) ACA. Problems: 1. There {{is no way}} for an application client to tell which task attributes <b>are</b> <b>supported.</b> Some logical units may prefer not to support ORDERED, for example. This proposal lets software read a VPD page to determine which task attributes <b>are</b> <b>supported</b> and which <b>are</b> not <b>supported.</b> It also clarifies what happens if an unsupported task attribute is requested. 2. In SBP- 3, unlike most other protocols, there is no task attribute sent with each command. A logical unit is configured to treat all commands as SIMPLE or all commands as ORDERED.

This paper presents an automatic annotation technique for web search results. The proposed approach first aligns the data units on a result page into different groups such that the data in the same group have the same semantic. Then, each group is annotated from different aspects and aggregates the different annotations to predict a final annotation label for it. The annotation wrapper generated for the search site is automatically constructed and can be used to annotate new result pages from the same web database.

40|$|Abstract — Mobile IP is a {{solution}} for mobility on the global Internet. However, the basic Mobile IP does not support paging. The main benefit of providing <b>paging</b> services <b>is</b> to save the battery power consumption at mobile terminals. Next generation Internet <b>is</b> expected to <b>support</b> multimedia communications. For real-time data traffic, Quality of Service (QoS) provision must be guaranteed. The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) <b>was</b> proposed to <b>support</b> the signaling of end-to-end IP QoS. When both IP <b>paging</b> and RSVP <b>are</b> <b>supported</b> in the network, the signaling delay for connection setup {{is the sum of}} the paging delay and the time for RSVP path setup. This paper introduces a new scheme for fast connection setup of real-time communication. The connection is set up with the help of Mobile IP location registration and paging. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme reduces the overall signaling delay and the total number of signaling messages. I...|$|R

40|$|Wikipedia entity <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> a {{valuable}} {{source of information}} for direct consumption and for knowledge-base construction, update and maintenance. Facts in these entity <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> typically <b>supported</b> by references. Recent studies show {{that as much as}} 20 % of the references are from online news sources. However, many entity <b>pages</b> <b>are</b> incomplete even if relevant information is already available in existing news articles. Even for the already present references, there is often a delay between the news article publication time and the reference time. In this work, we therefore look at Wikipedia through the lens of news and propose a novel news-article suggestion task to improve news coverage in Wikipedia, and reduce the lag of newsworthy references. Our work finds direct application, as a precursor, to Wikipedia page generation and knowledge-base acceleration tasks that rely on relevant and high quality input sources. We propose a two-stage supervised approach for suggesting news articles to entity pages for a given state of Wikipedia. First, we suggest news articles to Wikipedia entities (article-entity placement) relying on a rich set of features which take into account the salience and relative authority of entities, and the novelty of news articles to entity pages. Second, we determine the exact section in the entity page for the input article (article-section placement) guided by class-based section templates. We perform an extensive evaluation of our approach based on ground-truth data that is extracted from external references in Wikipedia. We achieve a high precision value of up to 93 % in the article-entity suggestion stage and upto 84 % for the article-section placement. Finally, we compare our approach against competitive baselines and show significant improvements...|$|R
