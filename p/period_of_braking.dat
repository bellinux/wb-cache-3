40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} braking is {{important}} in automotive performance, which impacts the safety of traffic. Several parameters of braking can be determined on stationary test stands, however, more accurate data {{that can be used}} in a more simple way in practise are gained by doing tests on the road. Based on EU legal documents on determining parameters of braking, a research methodology has been elaborated and approbated for determining parameters of braking for automobiles in road tests. To determine the parameters of braking, scientific radar Stalker ATS transferring data to a computer were used. Road tests were done for automobiles of various age groups and constructions, determining the period, distance, and deceleration rate of braking. According to the research data, the parameters of braking of the used automobiles comply with the standard for parameters of braking set by the EU. The effectiveness of parameters of braking does not mostly depend on the age of automobiles, but on the technical condition of the brake system. Key words: distance of braking, deceleration of braking, <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> speed regime...|$|E

50|$|Drum brakes {{are best}} suited for slower, {{moderate}} use, rather than longer <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> hard downhill <b>braking</b> while carrying a load. Under such heavy braking, drum brakes are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout. A common model <b>of</b> drum <b>brake</b> is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the drum brake from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{spectrum}} and a photometric {{analysis of the}} newly discovered, high-amplitude, solartype, eclipsing binary HO Piscium. A spectroscopic identification, a period study, q-search, and a simultaneous UBVR cI c light-curve solution are presented. The spectra and our photometric solution indicate that HO Psc is a W-typeWUMa shallow-contact (fill-out ~ 8 %) binary system. The primary component has a G 6 V spectral type with an apparently precontact spectral type of M 2 V for the secondary component. The small fill-out indicates that the system has not yet achieved thermal contact and thus has recently come into physical contact. This may mean that this solar-type binary system has not attained its ~ 0 : 4 mass ratio via a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> magnetic <b>braking,</b> as would normally be assumed.

40|$|Tread <b>braking</b> <b>of</b> railway wheels {{results in}} the kinetic energy of the train being {{dissipated}} into the wheel and blocks {{in the form of}} heat. This heat is further conducted into adjacent structures, notably the cold rail, and also transferred into the surroundings by convection and radiation. Heat partitioning between wheel and block is, for short time periods, controlled by local thermal interactions at the contact point and by the conductive properties of the bodies. However, for a metro train that performs longer <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> intermittent <b>braking</b> (or for drag braking) convective and radiation cooling properties of the components come into play. In the present study, results from brake rig tests and from in-field testing of a metro train are presented and used to calibrate a simulation model. It is found that the cooling level of the wheels of the metro train is substantially lower than for the wheels of a freight wagon. Moreover, it is found that the first axle on the metro train is exposed to higher cooling levels than the remaining axles. In a numerical example, temperatures <b>of</b> tread <b>braked</b> wheels are calculated using the new findings for a metro train, and the results obtained are compared with wheel temperatures as calculated assuming freight wagon conditions...|$|R

The proposed strategy effectively employs the Rao-Blackwellized particle-filtering framework using a kinematic model. Key vari- ables in active safety systems, such as longitudinal velocity, roll angle, and wheel slip for all four wheels are estimated. Results from a demanding field test shows {{the efficacy of the}} approach; the wheel slip and velocity can be estimated with an absolute accuracy of 0. 018 and 0. 25 m/s, respectively, measured as time- averaged root-mean-square errors, in <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> simultaneous aggressive <b>braking</b> and cornering. The corresponding differences between best- and worst-case performance are 0. 005 and 0. 1 m/s.

30|$|Thermal or thermo-mechanical loading {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of wheel surface damage in Australian heavy haul operations. In addition, multi-wear wheels appear to be {{particularly}} sensitive to thermo-mechanical damage during their first service life. Such damage can incur heavy machining penalties or even premature scrapping of wheels. The combination of high contact stresses as well as substantial thermal loading (such as during prolonged <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> tread <b>braking)</b> can lead to severe plastic deformation, thermal fatigue and microstructural deterioration. For some high-strength wheel grades, the increased sensitivity to thermo-mechanical damage observed during the first service period may be attributed to the presence of a near-surface region in which the microstructure is more sensitive to these loading conditions than the underlying material. The standards applicable to wheels used in Australian heavy haul operations are based on the Association of American Railroads (AAR) specification M- 107 /M- 208, which does not include any requirements for microstructure. The implementation of acceptance criteria for the microstructure, in particular that in the near-surface region of the wheel, may be necessary when new wheels are purchased. The stability of wheel microstructures during thermo-mechanical loading and the effects of alloying elements commonly used in wheel manufacturing are reviewed. A brief guide to improving thermal/mechanical stability of the microstructure is also provided.|$|R
