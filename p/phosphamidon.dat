40|$|Background/Aims: Organophosphate {{poisoning}} {{has a high}} mortality rate. Recently, {{differences among}} organophosphorus insecticides in human self-poisoning were reported. This study investigated the prognostic risk factors and the mortality of different organophosphates following acute organophosphate poisoning. Methods: This retrospective study included 68 patients with acute organophosphate poisoning. We investigated patient survival according to initial parameters, including the initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, serum cholinesterase level, and hemoperfusion and evaluated the mortality according to organophosphate types. Results: Thirteen of the 68 patients died. The agents responsible for mortality were different. The APACHE II score {{was a significant predictor}} of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1. 194; p< 0. 01; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 089 to 1. 309) and respiratory failure (OR, 1. 273; p< 0. 01; 95 % CI, 1. 122 to 1. 444).

Successful separation of hydrophobic OPPs (methidathion, diazinon, quinalphos, chlorpyrifos and profenofos) was achieved by NM-MEKCSDS that comprised a separation buffer of 10 mM phosphate-borate (pH 9. 3), 10 mM SDS and 10 % v/v 1 : 1 mixture of methanol-acetonitrile, where sample was prepared in similar buffer matrix and was injected by electrokinetic mode. Using online sample pre-concentration technique called sweeping (sweeping-NM-MEKC-SDS), sensitivity enhancement factors either in terms of peak areas (SEFarea) or in terms of peak heights (SEFheight) were found to be more than 10 for each pesticide. In reverse migration MEKC (RM-MEKC-SDS) with highly acidic separation buffer, only three OPPs viz. methidathion, quinalphos and either diazinon, profenofos or chlorpyrifos were resolved, as possible optimization scheme were unable to resolve the co-elution of diazinon, profenofos and chlorpyrifos. LODs in sub-ppm ranges were found attainable in sweeping-NM-MEKC-SDS. Hydrophilic OPPs (<b>phosphamidon,</b> dicrotophos and monocrotophos) were successfully separated in both basic and acidic phosphate buffer. A 100 -fold improvement in detector response was achieved by stacking in reverse migrating micelles (SRMM) that corroborated the LODs in subppm level...|$|E
40|$|Carboxylesterases are hydrolases which {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis {{of various}} types of esters. Carboxylesterase from the seeds of Jatropha curcas has been purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate fractionation, CM-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G- 100 chromatography and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The homogeneity of the purified enzyme was confirmed by PAGE, iso-electrofocusing and SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was determined by both gelpermeation chromatography on Sephadex G- 150 and SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight determined by Sephadex G- 150 chromatography and SDS-PAGE both in the presence and absence of 2 -mercaptoethanol was 31 kDa. The isoelectric point of the purified enzyme {{was found to be}} 8. 9. JCSE-I (J. curcas seed esterase-I) was classified as carboxylesterase on the basis of substrate and inhibitor specificity. The Km of JCSE-I with 1 -naphthyl acetate, 1 -naphthyl propionate, 1 -naphthyl butyrate and 2 -naphthyl acetate as substrates were found to be 0. 0, 794, 0. 0, 658, 0. 0, 567 and 0. 1 mM, respectively. The enzyme exhibited an optimum temperature of 45 Â°C and an optimum pH of 6. 5. The enzyme was stable up to 15 min at 65 Â°C. The enzyme was resistant towards carbamates (carbaryl and eserine sulfate) and sulphydryl inhibitors (p- chloromercuricbenzoate, PCMB) and inhibited by organophosphates (dichlorvos, parathion and <b>phosphamidon).</b> Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} tomato crops over a two year period to evaluate the efficacy of six insecticides, viz., triazophos, <b>phosphamidon,</b> dimethoate, buprofezin and Aflix (endosulfan + dimethoate) each at 0. 05 % and Repelin (plant insecticide) at 1 % concentration along With a cultural treatment by covering the plants with Agril (a polyester material) for the control of whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. The insecticides were applied eight times at weekly interval immediately after transplantation. The whitefly eggs,  nymphal population counts and the per cent incidence of tomato leaf curl virus (TLCV) were recorded every week for eight weeks in all the treatments including untreated control. The incidence of whitefly was more severe {{in the second year}} (i. e, 1992 - 93) as compared to the previous season. Among the various treatments, the Agril cover, a newly introduced cultural practice, recorded the least incidence of whitefly and of TLCV. The average of counts of eggs were 0. 0 and 5. 47 and of nymphs 0. 54 and 0. 58 per 10 leaflets and TLCV were 4. 32 % and 4. 76 % in Agril cover treatment during the first and second year, respectively. Among the insecticides tested only Aflix recorded less incidence of the pest, being 3. 46 and 30. 4 eggs per 10 leaflets and 0. 94 and 5. 34 nymphs per 10 leaflets during the two years of study, respectively. The other treatments were less effective in reducing pest and disease incidence. The crop under Agril-cover recorded the maximum yield of 34. 57 and 26. 15 t/ha of tomatoes as compared to 16. 48 and 10. 82 t/ha in control during the first and second year, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Two carboxylesterases (ME-III and ME-IV) {{have been}} {{purified}} to apparent homogeneity from {{the seeds of}} Mucuna pruriens employing ammonium sulfate fractionation, cation exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose, gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G- 100 and preparative PAGE. The homogeneity of the purified preparations was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), gel-electrofocussing and SDS-PAGE. The molecular weights determined by gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G- 200 were 20. 89 kDa (ME-III) and 31. 62 kDa (ME-IV). The molecular weights determined by SDS-PAGE both in the presence and absence of 2 -mercaptoethanol were 21 kDa (ME-III) and 30. 2 kDa (ME-IV) respectively, suggesting a monomeric structure for both the enzymes. The enzymes {{were found to have}} Stokes radius of 2. 4 nm (ME-III) and 2. 7 nm (ME-IV). The isoelectric pH values of the enzymes, ME-III and ME-IV, were 6. 8 and 7. 4, respectively. ME-III and ME-IV were classified as carboxylesterases employing PAGE in conjunction with substrate and inhibitor specificity. The K m of ME-III and ME-IV with 1 -naphthyl acetate as substrate was 0. 1 and 0. 166 mM while with 1 -naphthyl propionate as substrate the K m was 0. 052 and 0. 0454 mM, respectively. As the carbon chain length of the acyl group increased, the affinity of the substrate to the enzyme increased indicating hydrophobic nature of the acyl group binding site. The enzymes exhibited an optimum temperature of 45 Â°C (ME-III) and 37 Â°C (ME-IV), an optimum pH of 7. 0 (ME-III) and 7. 5 (ME-IV) and both the enzymes (ME-III and ME-IV) were stable up to 120 min at 35 Â°C. Both the enzymes were inhibited by organophosphates (dichlorvos and <b>phosphamidon),</b> but resistant towards carbamates (carbaryl and eserine sulfate) and sulphydryl inhibitors (p-chloromercuricbenzoate, PCMB).
