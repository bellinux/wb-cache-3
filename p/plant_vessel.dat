Severe fire and explosion incidents have occurred in oxidation and concentration processes due to the thermal instability of CHP. In this study, we used DSC and ARC thermal analysis techniques to measure the runaway thermokinetic data. Data such as adiabatic time to maximum rate (TMRad), adiabatic temperature rise (ΔTad), self-heating rate (dT/dt), thermal inertia (φ), etc., are used for runaway hazard evaluation. The thermal decomposition of CHP in cumene {{was found to be}} dependent on the CHP concentration which was characterized by the Accelerating Rate Calorimeter (ARC) test, isothermal and dynamic Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) tests. The reaction order of 35 wt% CHP decomposition was determined to be 0. 5. The Arrhenius parameters were measured to be Ea (kJ mol- 1) = 120. 6 ± 3. 0 and lnA (min- 1 M 1 / 2) = 30. 2 ± 1. 3. By using the thermokinetic data, <b>plant</b> <b>vessel</b> conditions, and the Semenov model, one can evaluate the criteria of critical vessel conditions, such as temperature of no return (TNR) and critical heat transfer parameter, (US/V) cr.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers in a cylindrical pilot <b>plant</b> <b>vessel</b> with four standard radial baffles at the wall under a turbulent regime of flow. The pumping capacity was calculated from the radial profile of the axial flow, under the assumption of axial symmetry of the discharge flow. The mean velocity was measured using laser Doppler anemometry in a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm, provided with a standard dished bottom. Three and six blade pitched blade impellers (the pitch angle varied within the interval a Îá 24 °; 45 °ń) of impeller/vessel diameter ratio D/T = 0. 36, as well as a three blade pitched blade impeller with folded blades of the same diameter, were tested. The calculated results were compared with the results of experiments mentioned in the literature, above all in cylindrical vessels with a flat bottom. Both arrangements of the agitated system were described by the impeller energetic efficiency, i. e, a criterion including in dimensionless form both the impeller energy consumption (impeller power input) and the impeller pumping effect (impeller pumping capacity). It follows from the results obtained with various geometrical configurations that the energetic efficiency of pitched blade impellers is significantly lower for configurations suitable for mixing solid-liquid suspensions (low impeller off bottom clearances) than for blending miscible liquids in mixing (higher impeller off bottom clearances) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of the genome sequence of the bacterial plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of citrus variegated chlorosis, is accelerating important investigations concerning its pathogenicity. <b>Plant</b> <b>vessel</b> occlusion is critical for symptom development. The objective {{of the present study}} was to search for information that would help to explain the adhesion of X. fastidiosa cells to the xylem. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that adhesion may occur without the fastidium gum, an exopolysaccharide produced by X. fastidiosa, and X-ray microanalysis demonstrated the presence of elemental sulfur both in cells grown in vitro and in cells found inside plant vessels, indicating that the sulfur signal is generated by the pathogen surface. Calcium and magnesium peaks were detected in association with sulfur in occluded vessels. We propose an explanation for the adhesion and aggregation process. Thiol groups, maintained by the enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, could be active on the surface of the bacteria and appear to promote cell-cell aggregation by forming disulfide bonds with thiol groups on the surface of adjacent cells. The enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase has been shown to be an auxiliary component in the adhesiveness of some human pathogens. The negative charge conferred by the ionized thiol group could of itself constitute a mechanism of adhesion by allowing the formation of divalent cation bridges between the negatively charged bacteria and predominantly negatively charged xylem walls...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers (two, three, four, five and six blade pitched blade impellers with pitch angles α = 35 ° and 45 °) coaxially located in a cylindrical pilot <b>plant</b> <b>vessel</b> with cylindrical draught tube provided with a standard dished bottom. The draught tube was equipped with four equally spaced radial baffles above the impeller pumping liquid upwards towards the liquid surface. In all investigated cases the liquid aspect ratio H/T = 1. 2 - 1. 5, the draught tube / vessel diameter ratios DT /T = 0. 2 and 0. 4 and the impeller / draught tube diameter ratio D/DT = 0. 875. The pumping capacity of the impeller was calculated from the radial profile of the axial component of the mean velocity in the draught tube below the impeller at such an axial distance from the impeller that the rotor does not affect the vorticity of the flow. The mean velocity was measured using a laser Doppler anemometer with forward scatter mode in a transparent draught tube and a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm. Two series of experiments were performed, both of them under a turbulent regime of flow of the agitated liquid. First, the optimum height of the dished bottom was sought, and then the dependences of the dimensionless flow rate criterion and the impeller power number on the number of impeller blades were determined for both pitch angles tested under conditions of optimum ratio HT /DT. It follows from the results of the experiments that the optimum ratio HT /DT = 0. 25 when the cross sectional areas of the horizontal flow around the bottom and the vertical inflow to the draught tube are the same. For all the tested pitched blade impellers the impeller power number when α = 45 ° exceeds the value of this quantity when pitch angle α  =   35 °, while the flow rate number when α = 35 ° exceeds this quantity when α = 45 °. On the other hand, the absolute values of the impeller power number when the draught tube was introduced correspond fairly well to the dimensionless impeller power input measured in a system without a draught tube. However, the absolute values of the flow rate number found in the former system are significantly lower than the dimensionless impeller pumping capacity determined in the latter system. The hydraulic efficiency of pitched blade impellers N 3 Qp/Po for the investigated geometry of the agitated systems does not depend on the number of impeller blades, but it is significantly lower than the quantity determined in an agitated system with a dished bottom but without the draught tube. </p...|$|E

40|$|Increased use {{of natural}} gas (methane) in the {{domestic}} energy market will force the development of large non-producing gas reserves now considered to be low quality. Large reserves of low quality natural gas (LQNG) contaminated with hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S), carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) and nitrogen (N) are available but not suitable for treatment using current conventional gas treating methods due to economic and environmental constraints. A group of three technologies have been integrated to allow for processing of these LQNG reserves; the Controlled Freeze Zone (CFZ) process for hydrocarbon / acid gas separation; the Triple Point Crystallizer (TPC) process for H{sub 2 }S / C 0 {sub 2 } separation and the CNG Claus process for recovery of elemental sulfur from H{sub 2 }S. The combined CFZ/TPC/CNG Claus group of processes is one program aimed at developing an alternative gas treating technology which is both economically and environmentally suitable for developing these low quality natural gas reserves. The CFZ/TPC/CNG Claus process is capable of treating low quality natural gas containing > 10 % C 0 {sub 2 } and measurable levels of H{sub 2 }S and N{sub 2 } to pipeline specifications. The integrated CFZ / CNG Claus Process or the stand-alone CNG Claus Process {{has a number of}} attractive features for treating LQNG. The processes are capable of treating raw gas with a variety of trace contaminant components. The processes can also accommodate large changes in raw gas composition and flow rates. The combined processes are capable of achieving virtually undetectable levels of H{sub 2 }S and significantly less than 2 % CO in the product methane. The separation processes operate at pressure and deliver a high pressure (ca. 100 psia) acid gas (H{sub 2 }S) stream for processing in the CNG Claus unit. This allows for substantial reductions in <b>plant</b> <b>vessel</b> size as compared to conventional Claus / Tail gas treating technologies. A close integration of the components of the CNG Claus process also allow for use of the methane/H{sub 2 }S separation unit as a Claus tail gas treating unit by recycling the CNG Claus tail gas stream. This allows for virtually 100 percent sulfur recovery efficiency (virtually zero SO{sub 2 } emissions) by recycling the sulfur laden tail gas to extinction. The use of the tail gas recycle scheme also deemphasizes the conventional requirement in Claus units to have high unit conversion efficiency and thereby make the operation much less affected by process upsets and feed gas composition changes. The development of these technologies has been ongoing for many years and both the CFZ and the TPC processes have been demonstrated at large pilot plant scales. On the other hand, prior to this project, the CNG Claus process had not been proven at any scale. Therefore, the primary objective of this portion of the program was to design, build and operate a pilot scale CNG Claus unit and demonstrate the required fundamental reaction chemistry and also demonstrate the viability of a reasonably sized working unit...|$|E
