5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes. Secret discussions also prevent the <b>public</b> <b>from</b> being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen in the course of implementing new laws, especially those which may affect the rights of minorities.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1834, Lafayette died on 6 rue d'Anjou-Saint-Honoré in Paris (now 8 rue d'Anjou in the 8th {{arrondissement}} of Paris) {{at the age}} of 76.

5|$|Secret Mountain Fort Awesome is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by Peter Browngardt that debuted in 2011 on Cartoon Network.

5|$|The USS Slater (DE-766), {{which is}} the only {{destroyer}} escort still afloat in the United States, sits at Steamboat Square near the foot of Madison Avenue.

5|$|The house {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the Moreton family for almost 450 years, until ownership was transferred to the National Trust in 1938. Little Moreton Hall and its sandstone bridge across the moat are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and the ground on which Little Moreton Hall stands is protected as a Scheduled Monument. The house has been fully restored and is open to the <b>public</b> <b>from</b> April to December each year.|$|E
5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was {{ensure that the}} files would {{be placed in the}} CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within. The move prevents the <b>public</b> <b>from</b> accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E
5|$|Château Gaillard was {{captured}} in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands {{several times in the}} Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Château Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to be a threat to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey is open to the <b>public</b> <b>from</b> March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year.|$|E

5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring {{of which was the}} primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general <b>public</b> <b>from</b> late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Former Financial Times {{journalist}} Duff McDonald, said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often {{prevents the}} <b>public</b> <b>from</b> becoming {{informed about the}} firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released {{as part of a}} lawsuit against Allstate, which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt {{ordered the}} statue to be {{transferred}} to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal. The statue was closed to the <b>public</b> <b>from</b> May until December 1938.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, when Bakili Muluzi became president, he {{addressed}} the nation's need for a coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2000, Muluzi introduced another five-year policy known as the National Strategic Framework, but, like Banda's five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan, this plan was largely ineffective. In 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission. Unlike Banda, who prevented the <b>public</b> <b>from</b> accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available {{on the radio and}} television, in newspapers, and on billboards. However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide famine in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, the National Arts Council (NAC) stopped funding unscripted {{performance}} art following a controversial performance by Josef Ng that {{was regarded as}} obscene by {{many members of the}} <b>public.</b> <b>From</b> that time, Tang and other {{performance art}}ists mostly practised their art abroad, although some performances were presented in Singapore as dance or theatre. For his originality and influence in performance art in Southeast Asia, among other things, Tang won the Arts and Culture Prize in 1999 at the 10th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes. The NAC eventually reversed its no-funding rule on performance art in September 2003. Tang was one of four artists who represented Singapore at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Tang's work is part of the collection of the Singapore Art Museum, Queensland Art Gallery and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general <b>public</b> <b>from</b> him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E
