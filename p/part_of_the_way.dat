5|$|Anshei Israel Synagogue is a {{historic}} synagogue located in Lisbon, Connecticut, United States. The Orthodox congregation was founded with 15 families and constructed the synagogue in 1936. It was built by George Allen & Sons. The interior is a single room that is lined with five benches before an altar which held the sacred ark. The congregation's membership dwindled throughout the 1940s and 1950s, limiting the services to holidays before finally closing in the early 1980s. Rules in the congregation were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World, as there was no curtain to separate the sexes and distant members were allowed to drive <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to its services. The Town of Lisbon took ownership of the property in the 1980s. The synagogue is currently maintained by the Lisbon Historical Society.

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1142 Robert {{returned}} to Normandy to assist Geoffrey with operations against some of Stephen's remaining followers there, before returning in the autumn. Matilda came under increased pressure from Stephen's forces and was surrounded at Oxford.

Oxford Castle was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen decided to settle down for a long siege. Just before Christmas, Matilda sneaked out of the castle {{with a handful of}} knights (probably via a postern gate), crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape past the royal army to safety at Wallingford, leaving the castle garrison free to surrender the next day.|$|E

40|$|Paul’s {{contribution}} to Christian theology cannot be underestimated. Many would consider Paul, and not Jesus, <b>the</b> real founder <b>of</b> Christianity as a religion. That also implies that Paul {{is responsible for}} Christianity’s split from Judaism. In the past thirty years, however, {{a new way of}} understanding Paul within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> his Jewish identity has emerged. Within this ‘New Perspective’, Paul is no longer seen as causing the split from Judaism, which is seen to have only occurred at a much later date, in what is referred to as ‘the <b>Parting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ways’. <b>The</b> <b>Parting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> is currently <b>the</b> regnant heuristic model to explain the separation between Judaism and Christianity. The turning-point is usually the Bar Kochba revolt, in 135 CE, after which Jews and Christians supposedly went their separate ways as though diverging at a ‘Y junction’. This article explores the methodological problems with both <b>the</b> <b>Parting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> model and <b>the</b> New Perspective on Paul. Both operate out of present-day ecumenical concerns to see Israel and the Church as compatible with one another {{yet at the same time}} separate and distinct. Methodologically, however, this theological concern is problematic for conducting historical and sociological studies. Where <b>the</b> <b>Parting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> is concerned, <b>the</b> problem arises that Jews and Christians of Antiquity did not see themselves as already having ‘parted’. With regard to Paul, his own ambiguous relationship towards Judaism, Israel and the Law, means that Pauline scholars need to find creative ways to affirm that Paul espoused both continuity and discontinuity towards his Jewish roots. However, even though Paul and <b>the</b> <b>Parting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> between Judaism and Christianity are now separated by at least a few decades (if not centuries), one can still infer that Pauline scholars continue to wrestle indirectly with Paul’s role in that parting and thus implicitly with the notion that he was <b>the</b> founder <b>of</b> Christianity. status: publishe...|$|R

The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before {{he took out his}} revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E

5|$|The threat Tirpitz had an {{important}} influence on British naval strategy during the Second World War. She was commissioned in February 1941 and completed her crew training late that year. At {{about the same time}} the German high command decided to station the battleship in Norway; this deployment was intended to deter a feared Allied invasion of Norway and threaten the convoys which regularly sailed through the Arctic Sea to the Soviet Union. These convoys carried large quantities of war material from ports in the UK and Iceland, and were frequently attacked by the German air and naval units stationed in Norway. Tirpitz arrived in Norway in January 1942 and operated from anchorages located in fjords. While she was operational the Allies had to keep a powerful force of warships with the British Home Fleet to guard against the possibility of a sortie against the Arctic convoys, and capital ships accompanied most convoys <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1142 Stephen fell ill, and by Easter rumours had begun to circulate that he had died. Possibly this illness {{was the result of}} his imprisonment the previous year, but he finally recovered and travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully convince Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including Cirencester, Bampton and Wareham. In September, he spotted an opportunity to seize the Empress Matilda herself in Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the river Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping the Empress in the castle. Oxford Castle, however, was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen had to settle down for a long siege, albeit secure in the knowledge that Matilda was now surrounded. Just before Christmas, the Empress left the castle unobserved, crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape to Wallingford. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards, but Stephen had lost an opportunity to capture his principal opponent.|$|E
