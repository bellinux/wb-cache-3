5|$|A second instrument, Doppler Orbit and Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite, or DORIS, {{is used to}} {{calculate}} <b>precisely</b> the spacecraft's orbit. An array of retroreflectors are also carried aboard the spacecraft, and allow measurements to be made from the ground to verify the orbital data provided by DORIS.|$|E
5|$|As may be {{observed}} in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant is the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant, as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation are known more <b>precisely.</b>|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VIII also {{introduced}} interactive elements to complement Limit Break animations. These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break range from randomly selected magic spells to <b>precisely</b> timed button inputs. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the resulting attack's potency.|$|E
5|$|Hence, the Pyramid Texts of {{the pyramid}} of Unas {{incorporate}} instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, suggesting that they were <b>precisely</b> those performed and recited during {{the cult of the}} king in his mortuary temple.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Vandersteen finally {{moved back}} from Brussels, {{where he had}} lived at {{different}} locations since World War II, towards Antwerp, and more <b>precisely</b> Kalmthout, a rural village {{to the north of}} Antwerp. There, next to his villa, he created the location for his main Studio.|$|E
5|$|In geodesy, {{the exact}} shape that Earth's oceans would adopt {{in the absence}} of land and {{perturbations}} such as tides and winds is called the geoid. More <b>precisely,</b> the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} {{is used in}} {{sewage treatment}} and drinking water production. In this application, FeCl3 in slightly basic water reacts with the hydroxide ion to form a floc of iron(III) hydroxide, or more <b>precisely</b> formulated as FeO(OH)−, that can remove suspended materials.|$|E
5|$|Mounseer Nongtongpaw {{represents}} {{the beginning of}} Mary Shelley's collaborative writing career, although {{it is no longer}} possible to reconstruct her actual contributions. Her sketch was given to the author of the published work as a way to inspire him. What <b>precisely</b> he drew from that text is, however, unknown.|$|E
5|$|Needles made of yttrium-90, {{which can}} cut more <b>precisely</b> than scalpels, {{have been used}} to sever pain-transmitting nerves in the spinal cord, and yttrium-90 is also used to carry out {{radionuclide}} synovectomy in the treatment of inflamed joints, especially knees, in sufferers of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|The art of measuring, as <b>precisely</b> as possible, {{probabilities of}} things, {{with the goal}} {{that we would be}} able always to choose or follow in our {{judgments}} and actions that course, which will have been determined to be better, more satisfactory, safer or more advantageous.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} these {{disasters}} aren't <b>precisely</b> known, but the Rabaul caldera, Lake Ilopango and Krakatoa volcanoes or {{a collision with}} a swarm of meteors are all suspected. Scientists have spent decades on the mystery.|$|E
5|$|The chapter {{describes}} how genes are switched {{on and off}} in a <b>precisely</b> choreographed time sequence and 3-dimensional pattern in the developing embryo, and how the logic can be modified by evolution to create different animal bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{clips from}} The Underwater Menace, episode 2 were later found to <b>precisely</b> match the edits {{to the print}} {{discovered}} in late 2011, suggesting that the recovered episode was exactly the same print that had been censored decades before.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographics}} of Lhasa prefecture-level city {{are difficult to}} define <b>precisely</b> due {{to the way in}} which administrative boundaries have been drawn, and the way in which statistics are collected.|$|E
5|$|The full Senate voted {{three times}} {{on whether to}} accept the report, and each time the voting was <b>precisely</b> divided along party lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} used optical interferometry to accomplish these and other scientific goals. This technique collects light with multiple mirrors (in SIM's case, two) which is combined to make an interference pattern which can be very <b>precisely</b> measured.|$|E
5|$|The {{two other}} drive control platforms, vector control and direct torque control (DTC), adjust the motor voltage magnitude, angle from reference, and {{frequency}} {{so as to}} <b>precisely</b> control the motor's magnetic flux and mechanical torque.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} devices that combine the {{features}} of interstitial and intracavitary breast brachytherapy (e.g. SAVI). These devices use multiple catheters but are inserted through a single-entry point in the breast. Studies suggest {{the use of multiple}} catheters enables physicians to target the radiation more <b>precisely.</b>|$|E
5|$|There were notable pitch {{problems}} with the songs in this version, <b>precisely</b> one octave lower than the original recordings. This was fixed in subsequent releases.|$|E
5|$|This is <b>precisely</b> the abelianized {{statement}} of the Seifert–van Kampen theorem. Compare {{with the fact that}} H1(X) is the abelianization of the fundamental group π1(X) when X is path-connected.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} dated 731 AD {{reveals that}} <b>precisely</b> forty bolts of silk were paid {{to a certain}} Mi Lushan, a slave dealing Sogdian, by a Chinese man named Tang Rong (唐榮) of Chang'an, {{for the purchase of}} an eleven-year-old girl. A person from Xizhou, a Tokharistani (i.e. Bactrian), and three Sogdians verified the sale of the girl.|$|E
5|$|Approximately every 2.5 or 2.6 years, {{the object}} {{comes back to}} the point in the solar system where the 1990 {{encounter}} occurred, and the earth {{comes back to the}} same point every year. The period is not known <b>precisely</b> enough to predict when the next encounter between the two will occur.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the radiocarbon-indicated date of the eruption, there is {{evidence}} for a significant climatic event in the Northern Hemisphere like failure of crops in China (see below) and evidence from tree rings, cited above: bristlecone pines of California; bog oaks of Ireland, England, and Germany; and other trees in Sweden. The tree rings <b>precisely</b> date the event to 1628BCE.|$|E
5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had not <b>precisely</b> specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could not be sure how far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence <b>precisely</b> where he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it should be done in small stages to frequently rate the chronometers. Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Galápagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|By 1973 the {{magnetic}} moment was known within {{a factor of}} two, whereas the tilt was correctly estimated at about 10°. The modulation of Jupiter's DAM by Io (the so-called Io-DAM) was discovered in 1964, and allowed Jupiter's rotation period to be <b>precisely</b> determined. The definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetic field occurred in December 1973, when the Pioneer 10 spacecraft flew near the planet.|$|E
5|$|D'Abetot's widow Adeliza granted her dower {{lands in}} the county of Worcestershire to Beauchamp, which was {{confirmed}} by King Henry sometime between 1123 and 1129, although the document cannot be dated more <b>precisely</b> than that. In 1130, at Michaelmas, Henry allowed Beauchamp to not pay geld on his lands in Berkshire, and he is mentioned in the 1130 Pipe Roll as still living.|$|E
5|$|For an {{electron}} to transition between two different states, e.g. grounded state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching {{the difference in}} the potential energy of those levels, according to Niels Bohr model, what can be <b>precisely</b> calculated by the Schrödinger equation.|$|E
5|$|For guitars {{with six}} strings, every major-third tuning repeats its three open-notes in two octaves, so {{providing}} many options for fingering chords. By repeating open-string notes and by having uniform intervals between strings, major-thirds tuning simplifies learning by beginners. These features also facilitate advanced guitarists' improvisation, <b>precisely</b> {{the aim of}} jazz guitarist RalphPatt when he began popularizing major-thirds tuning between 1963 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|From the {{opposite}} end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished and <b>precisely</b> ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of their range. Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing metallurgy, over large areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|In November 1989, IBM {{scientists}} {{demonstrated a}} technology capable of manipulating individual atoms. The program, called IBM in atoms, used a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel to spell out the three letter company initialism. It {{was the first time}} atoms had been <b>precisely</b> positioned on a flat surface.|$|E
5|$|Opus sectile is {{a related}} {{technique}} in which flat stone, usually coloured marble, is cut <b>precisely</b> into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed. This more difficult technique was highly prized, and became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century, an abundant example {{of which is}} the Basilica of Junius Bassus.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{soon after}} or soon before, Thomas {{inspected}} charters of Paisley Abbey {{on behalf of}} Laurence de Ergadia, Bishop of Argyll. Here he is called Thomas Nicholay ("Thomas, son of Nicholas"). The reports confirm {{that he was the}} Glasgow subdean but the date of the inspection can be fixed no more <b>precisely</b> than some time between 1286 and 1295.|$|E
5|$|Price {{elasticity}} of demand (PED or Ed) {{is a measure}} used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of a good or service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus. More <b>precisely,</b> it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus).|$|E
5|$|Several of the anecdotes he amassed were {{published}} in magazines and, just before his death, work began on collating {{the first of four}} compendiums of the tales; three {{were published}} a few years after his death. He was fluent in several languages, including Scottish Gaelic, and transcribed the legends <b>precisely</b> as dictated by the narrators.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 event had a {{very similar}} format to the {{previous}} year's race. It consisted of six stages, of which five were flat stages and one was an individual time trial. The individual time trial, {{on the third day}} of racing, used <b>precisely</b> the same course as the corresponding stage in 2014.|$|E
