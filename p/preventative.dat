5|$|There is no {{specific}} treatment for most thrombophilias, but recurrent episodes of thrombosis {{may be an}} indication for long-term <b>preventative</b> anticoagulation. The first major form of thrombophilia, antithrombin deficiency, was identified in 1965, while the most common abnormalities (including factor V Leiden) were described in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Air {{travel is}} {{discouraged}} {{for up to}} seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur. Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a <b>preventative</b> procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed. Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Sir Edward Ford OBE, FRACP, FRCP (15 April 1902â€“ 27 August 1986) was an Australian soldier, {{academic}} and physician. He {{played an important}} role in the anti-malaria campaign in the South West Pacific Area during the Second World War, and in <b>preventative</b> medicine in Australia after the war, but is best known for his Bibliography of Australian Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Exotic {{species of}} fauna {{such as the}} zebra and quagga mussels and the New Zealand mud snail are {{invasive}} species that can greatly impact fish species. Though the mussel species are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail {{has been found in}} the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a <b>preventative</b> program to try to keep these species from entering forest waterways.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{especially}} aggressive rams {{were sometimes}} blindfolded or hobbled. Today, those who keep rams typically prefer softer <b>preventative</b> measures, such as moving within a clear line to an exit, never turning their {{back on a}} ram, and possibly dousing with water or a diluted solution of bleach or vinegar to dissuade charges.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is ongoing}} {{on the use}} of metformin, a {{diabetes}} medication, in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery. Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation. Preliminary research has shown that preoperative metformin administration can reduce expression of tumor markers. Long-term use of metformin has not been shown to have a <b>preventative</b> effect against developing cancer, but may improve overall survival.|$|E
5|$|Since David {{wrote about}} Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary {{researchers}} {{showed in the}} 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less coronary heart disease than the peoples of northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed. Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more northern European, with more convenience foods and with less of a <b>preventative</b> effect on cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|The 563d Maintenance Squadron maintains, services, and {{inspects}} eight HH-60G Pave Hawk and six HC-130J Hercules aircraft. It also plans, schedules, {{and directs}} both scheduled and unscheduled <b>preventative</b> maintenance to maintain mission ready status. The squadron performs all launch and recovery operations. It rapidly generates, mobilizes, deploys, and employs forces to provide combat and peacetime search and rescue.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of <b>preventative</b> drugs is often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of <b>preventative</b> drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Caribbean Sea, {{about a dozen}} {{cruise ships}} altered their routes to avoid Hurricane Dean. Honduras was put on a state of <b>preventative</b> alert for 48hours, {{particularly}} the departments {{to the north of}} the country; the Bay Islands were on a state of red alert. There were places ready to accommodate 10,000people for 15days if necessary.|$|E
5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive <b>preventative</b> nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|A <b>preventative</b> {{procedure}} (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a <b>preventative</b> measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another <b>preventative</b> measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} {{arriving}} in North America from Moscow {{with his father and}} brother on September 6, 1991, (his mother Tatiana arrived two months later), Bure married an American fashion model, later revealed to be Jayme Bohn, in a civil ceremony. The marriage was allegedly set up by Bure's agents as a <b>preventative</b> measure against deportation in the event he and the Canucks could not come to terms with a contract. Bure derived no immigration benefit from the marriage, which was dissolved the following year. Bohn became a costume designer in the film and television industry.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the start}} of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then {{threatened}} by the Tunisian Revolution. He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there. Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented <b>preventative</b> measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors and releasing several Islamist prisoners. They proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30%.|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a <b>preventative</b> measure.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20â€“88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most <b>preventative</b> methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the Maruca.|$|E
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other <b>preventative</b> efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endâ€“stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E
5|$|Responsibilities and {{functions}} related to security includes patrolling, continual emergency availability, highway patrolling, sea patrolling, coordination of {{search and rescue}} activities, embassy security and as a body guard service {{for members of the}} government, the royal family and other in need. The crime fighting responsibility is split between <b>preventative</b> measures, such as information, observation and controls, and consequential measures, such as investigation and prosecution. The police further have duties related to civilian court cases, such as writ of execution, evaluation of natural damage, assisting the courts after bankruptcies and functioning as a notary public.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard is {{a police}} {{district}} of the Norwegian Police Service, {{with the governor}} having the responsibilities of both sheriff and chief of police. This includes security; law and order enforcement, including traffic controls; case investigation; and <b>preventative</b> systems. The governor is responsible for search and rescue and {{is head of the}} local rescue station and subordinate of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway in BodÃ¸. The institution is also responsible for issuing of driver's licences, vehicle registration, passports and firearms licenses. The governor and his deputy represent the public prosecutors.|$|E
5|$|The site {{features}} machines {{designed to}} bring women orgasms. Sarah Schaschek noted in Screening the Dark Side of Love {{that the majority of}} the film production crew members were female. Across its websites, Kink.com formed a values statement and set of guidelines for directors and performers, taking <b>preventative</b> measures against victimization. The site production staff developed a practice of interviewing performers both before and after the film sessions. Models appearing on Fucking Machines film shoots are instructed to be authentic and experience pleasure from the machines without acting.|$|E
5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and <b>preventative</b> measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate <b>preventative</b> and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with <b>preventative</b> treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000â€“600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000â€“100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented <b>preventative</b> techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable <b>preventative</b> measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category Câ€“ games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011â€“12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took <b>preventative</b> measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and <b>Preventative</b> Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for <b>preventative</b> reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1917, Downes became Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS) of the Desert Mounted Corps, {{while still}} {{retaining}} {{the post of}} ADMS AIF Egypt. He was therefore answerable to three superiorsâ€”to Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{the commander of the}} Desert Mounted Corps and AIF Egypt; to Major General Neville Howse, the DMS AIF in London; and to the new British DMS EEF, Major General William Travers Swan. As the EEF advanced into Palestine, the major medical problem remained transportation. During the operations in the Es Salt area, Downes experimented with the delivery of drugs and medical supplies by air. In the Jordan valley in 1918, however, Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous <b>preventative</b> and prophylactic efforts were required in order to bring it under control.|$|E
5|$|On November15, {{a massive}} {{evacuation}} of residents began to remove survivors from unsafe conditions. Two flights to California {{took place on}} the first day of evacuation, carrying a total of 154people. Thousands of residents were also brought to Wake Island for shelter. Military Air Transport Service planes from the United States mainland, Japan, the Philippines, and Hawaii were called in for the operation. On November16, residents were warned of a possible typhoid epidemic and urged to get inoculations for the disease. Over a three-day span, roughly 30,000people were given <b>preventative</b> shots for the disease. In contrast to their previous ban on alien workers, the Government of Guam requested 1,500carpenters, masons, and other building workers from the Philippines. By November21, the Navy Supply Depot planned to have enough supplies for the entire populous shipped until replenishment arrived. In order to shelter homeless, the United States Navy set up tent villages across the island. Military kitchens were also established to provide food. Due to continued rains in the wake of the typhoon, many were unable to get a full meal for Thanksgiving.|$|E
5|$|On Providencia Island, {{two teams}} of aid personnel, {{consisting}} {{of a total of}} 800 people, from National Intervention Teams were mobilized in response to Beta. The Colombian Red Cross Society and the National Disaster Response and Preparedness System (SNPAD) provided assistance to 600 families with non-food relief, pre-hospital care, first aid, temporary shelter and psychosocial support, and carried out a <b>preventative</b> health campaign on the island. On October29, Diego Palacio, the Minister of Social Protection, flew to Providencia to assess the damage caused by Beta. A frigate was also deployed to the island, carrying two tons of relief items along with 130 search and rescue workers. Reconstruction on the island took place shortly after the storm dissipated and 60percent of the structures were repaired by January20, 2006. The completion date for repairs was set at the third week of February.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike <b>preventative</b> vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFÎ± receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{schizophrenia}} is difficult {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia. While {{there is some evidence}} that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years. Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another <b>preventative</b> measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} <b>preventative</b> method to ear problems.|$|E
