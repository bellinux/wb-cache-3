In addition, phosphate-deficient leaves contained smaller quantities of total soluble proteins and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) per unit area, although the relative proportions of these components remained unchanged. The specific activity of Rubisco (estimated in the crude extracts of leaves) was significantly reduced by <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> in sunflower but not in maize. Thus, {{there was a strong}} dependence of carboxylation efficiency and CO 2 -saturated photosynthetic rate on Rubisco activity only in sunflower. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> decreased the 3 -phosphoglycerate and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP) contents of the leaf in both species. The ratio of 3 -phosphoglycerate to RuBP decreased in sunflower but increased in maize with <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The calculated concentrations of RuBP and RuBP-binding sites in the chloroplast stroma decreased markedly with <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The ratio of the stromal concentration of RuBP to that of RuBP-binding sites decreased in sunflower but was not affected in maize with <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency.</b> We suggest that a decrease in this ratio made the RuBP-binding sites more vulnerable to blockage or inactivation by tight-binding metabolites/inhibitors, causing a decrease in the initial specific activity of Rubisco in the crude extract from phosphate-deficient sunflower leaves. However, the decrease in Rubisco specific activity was much less than the decrease in the RuBP content in the leaf and its concentration in the stroma. A large ratio of RuBP to RuBP-binding sites may have maintained the Rubisco-specific activity in phosphate-deficient maize leaves.

50|$|Osteophagy is the {{practice}} in which animals, usually herbivores, consume bones. Most vegetation around the world lacks sufficient amounts of phosphate. Phosphorus is an essential mineral for all animals, as it {{plays a major role}} in the formation of the skeletal system, and is necessary for many biological processes including: energy metabolism, protein synthesis, cell signaling, and lactation. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>deficiencies</b> can cause physiological side effects, especially pertaining to the reproductive system, as well as side effects of delayed growth and failure to regenerate new bone. The importance of having sufficient amounts of phosphorus further resides in the physiological importance of maintaining a proper phosphorus to calcium ratio. Having a Ca:P ratio of 2:1 is important for the absorption of these minerals, as deviations from this optimal ratio can inhibit their absorption. Dietary calcium and phosphorus ratio, along with vitamin D, regulates bone mineralization and turnover by affecting calcium and phosphorus transport and absorption in the intestine.|$|R

40|$|<b>Phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> is an {{important}} constraint to agricultural productivity. Attempts are underway to characterize the physiological and molecular responses to <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The hope is that this information {{will contribute to the}} breeding of phosphate efficient crops. As part of this effort, this thesis presents the extensive analysis of the role of phytic acid and iron in the root archiecture modifications of A. thaliana during <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency,</b> and the characterization of two mutants involved in A. thaliana 2 ̆ 7 s maintenance of phosphate homeostasis. Phytic acid is an abundant but poorly available organic form of phosphate in soils. When it was added as as source of phosphate to the medium used in this study A. thaliana grew well. Extensive analysis revealed that this was not because the plants were breaking down phytic acid, but because phytic acid was chelating all the iron. These results and those from additional studies lead {{to the conclusion that the}} primary root growth inhibition of A. thaliana during <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> is likely in response to an increase in iron avaibility. A screen for mutants with altered growth on medium containing phytic acid led to the identification of the JW 32 mutant. JW 32 has a defect in its root development that decreases its ability to acquire phosphate from the growth medium. The region containing the mutated gene in JW 32 has now been narrowed to a region of chromosome 3 containing 192 predicted genes.

40|$|Phosphate (Pi) is {{essential}} for healthy bone growth as well as normal fracture repair. Studies have shown that when animals are phosphate deficient normal fracture healing is interrupted. Although <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{has been shown to}} impair fracture healing, it is unknown how different genetic factors interact with <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> to disrupt healing. Furthermore, it is unknown if upon replenishing phosphate in the diet healing will be re-initiated or if the deficiencies will persist irreversibly to prolong the healing of the bones. To assess how genetic factors interact with <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency,</b> fractures were generated in three genetically distinct strains of mice that had previously been shown to have different patterns of endochondral bone formation. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> was initiated two days prior to fracture and was then maintained for a 15 day period covering the normal duration of endochondral bone development. To assess if replenishing phosphate could rescue genetic expression of deficient healing, normal phosphate was re-introduced into the diet after 15 days of deficiency and bone healing was allowed to continue until 35 days post fracture. Messenger RNA expression for marker genes for cartilage and bone formation was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis over this time course of healing. Structural properties, callus mineralization and cartilage contents were assessed by micro-computed tomography and contrast agent enhanced micro- computed tomography (CECT). Torsional mechanical testing was used to measure bone strength. To assess if replenishing phosphate could rescue mineralization and biomechanical properties of deficient healing, normal phosphate was re-introduced after 15 days of deficiency and bone healing was allowed to continue until 21 days post fracture. The biological assessment of fracture healing showed that all three genetic strains had impaired expression of both cartilage and bone associated genes during the period of <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Once phosphate was returned to the diet, however, the osteogenesis genes showed a burst of late expression in all three strains. Interestingly, torsional testing of the bones showed that phosphate deficient/replenished groups were all stronger but also more brittle than the bones of control mice. Micro-computed tomography demonstrated that bone mineral density was slightly higher in the phosphate deficient mice but the bone mineral density standard deviation in the calluses were also higher indicating that the mineralization within the healing calluses was unevenly distributed in the phosphate deficient/replenished group. Lastly, contrast agent enhanced computed tomography data showed that the overall callus tissue mineral density was lower in phosphate deficient/replenished calluses due to the greater cartilage in the phosphate deficient/replenished calluses. These results suggest that the increase strength in the phosphate deficient/replenished calluses is due to the burst of expression in osteogenesis genes that led to the rapid mineralization of the fracture gap in order to compensate for fracture instability due to the phosphate restriction. They also show that a gross metabolic alteration supersedes all other aspects of genetic variably in endochondral development. Finally, they show that even though fracture healing may be greatly delayed by <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency,</b> replacement of phosphate after deficiency leads to rapid regain in function.

Wheat plants were grown in phosphate-deficient and phosphate-sufficient conditions, respectively, and lipid compositions in the leaves of 9 -day-old and 16 -day-old plants were analyzed. We found that <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> induced a dramatic change at the lipid levels in photosynthetic membranes of wheat leaves and the extent of changes in lipid composition depended on the leaf ages. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> induced a gradual decrease in PG and MGDG and a concomitant increase in DGDG and SQDG from the first leaf to the second and the third leaf on 16 -day-old plants. In addition, as compared to leaves grown under phosphate sufficient solution, PG content in the first leaf of 16 -day-old plants was significantly lower than that of 9 -day-old leaf with 2. 5 mol % versus 5. 5 mol % when these plants were grown under phosphate deficient condition. From these results, it is suggested that the alternation in lipid composition in wheat leaves induced by <b>phosphate</b> <b>deficiency</b> is related to both lipid biosynthesis and PG degradation. PG decrease in younger leaves is mainly due to insufficient phosphate supply for PG biosynthesis, while PG degradation mainly resulted in the PG decrease in older leaves.
