40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} {{reliability and}} validity of real-time fluorescent PCR for early detection of bacterial invasion of the amniotic cavity. METHODS: Amniotic fluid samples from 40 patients undergoing mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees C and were cultured on media specific for group B streptococcus (GBS) <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> Concurrently, samples were analyzed with real-time fluorescent PCR (Roche LightCycler) using DNA primers and probes designed to detect the CAMP factor encoding cfb gene and uidA gene of GBS <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli,</b> respectively. For positive control and to simulate amniotic fluid colonization, 104 cfu/ml of GBS <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were inoculated on sterile amniotic fluid and incubated for 6 h. Bacterial genomic DNA for the two organisms was extracted and purified via the two-step precipitation method using a commercial kit. The real-time PCR assays were also tested against 25 non-GBS and non-E. coli bacterial species. The lower limit of detection for each pathogen was established using serial dilution of bacterial genomic DNA. RESULTS: All patient samples were negative for evidence of GBS <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> with both culture and real-time PCR methods. Amniotic fluid samples inoculated with GBS <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were positive with real-time PCR whereas the 25 bacterial species other than GBS or <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> tested negative with the assay. Average total sample processing time including the pre-enrichment step was 7 h 40 min. The average cost for DNA extraction and PCR testing was 8. 50 dollars per test.

40|$|Petrifilm EC and HS were {{compared}} to the MPN method to determine their efficacy to enumerate total coliforms <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in 145 samples of water (76 water in natura, 69 drinking water). For water in natura, Petrifilm HS and EC showed good correlation with MPN method. In chlorinated water (< 20 col/ 100 mL and negatives) the agreement was low. For <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> enumeration, Petrifilm EC showed a good correlation with MPN method. The results indicated that Petrifilm EC and HS are accurate to enumerate coliforms <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> in water when the expected counts are higher than 20 / 100 mL...|$|R
40|$|Misuse of {{biocides}} {{has encouraged}} {{the emergence of}} resistance and cross-resistance in certain strains. This study investigated resistance of triclosan-adapted Escherichia <b>coli</b> K- 12 <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 55 to antimicrobial agents and compared these to <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 157 :H 7. Cross-resistance in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> K- 12 <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 55 was observed however {{to a lesser extent}} than in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 157 :H 7. Triclosan-adapted <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> K- 12 demonstrated cross-resistance to chloramphenicol, whereas triclosan-adapted <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 55 exhibited resistance to trimethoprim. In comparison, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> O 157 :H 7 was resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim, benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine suggesting strain specific rather than general resistance mechanisms. © 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|Background: Water {{quality testing}} is {{dictated}} by microbial agents {{found at the}} time of sampling in reference to their acceptable risk levels. Human activities might contaminate valuable water resources and add to the microbial load present in water bodies. Therefore, the effects of human activities on the microbial quality of rivers collected from twelve catchments in the Vhembe District in South Africa were investigated, with samples analyzed for total coliform (TC) <b>and</b> Eschericha <b>coli</b> (<b>E.</b> <b>coli)</b> contents. Methods: Physical parameters and various human activities were recorded for each sampling site. The Quanti-Tray® method was adopted for the assessment of TC <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> contents in the rivers over a two-year period. A multiplex polymerase chain (PCR) method was used to characterize the strains of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> found. Results: The microbial quality of the rivers was poor with both TC <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> contents found to be over acceptable limits set by the South African Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). No significant difference (p > 0. 05) was detected between TC <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> risks in dry and wet seasons. All six pathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains were identified <b>and</b> Enteroaggregative <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (EAEC), atypical Enteropathogenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (a-EPEC) <b>and</b> Enterotoxigenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (ETEC) were the most prevalent <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains detected (respectively, 87 %, 86 % and 83 %). Conclusions: The study indicated that contamination in the majority of sampling sites, due to human activities such as car wash, animal grazing and farming, poses health risks to communities using the rivers for various domestic chores. It is therefore recommended that more education by the respective departments is done to avert pollution of rivers and prevent health risks to the communities in the Vhembe District...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the metY locus which {{specifies}} tRNA(2 fMet) in Escherichia coli K- 12 specifies tRNA(1 fMet) in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> B. This conclusion is based on results of Southern blot analysis of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> B <b>and</b> K- 12 DNAs and on polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, and sequencing of an approximately 200 -bp region of DNA corresponding to the metY loci of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> B <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> K- 12. We also {{show that the}} metY locus of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> B is transcriptionally active. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains transformed with the multicopy plasmid vector pUC 19 carrying the metY locus of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> B overproduce tRNA(1 fMet) in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> B <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> K- 12 in contrast to strains transformed with pUC 19 carrying the corresponding locus from <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> K- 12, which overproduce tRNA(2 fMet) ...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistant}} bacteria {{reach the}} environment directly with faeces, and indirectly with sewage discharged from {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs). The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the level of removal of bacteria during wastewater treatment. Samples of untreated and treated sewage were collected from 13 WWTPs with different capacity, modification of treatment and type of inflowing wastewater. Microbiological characterization of the samples included determination of the total number of bacteria resistant (ARB) to β-lactams and tetracyclines as well as the number of Escherichia coli resistant to the same drugs. The counts of ARB <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> were determined on TSA and mFc media with/without antibiotic supplementation, respectively. The highest percent of reduction in number of ARB (at least 99. 9 %) <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (above 99. 3 %) was obtained for WWTPs with A 2 O system. The lowest percentage reduction of ARB <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> was observed for WWTPs operating with SBR system. The lowest number of microorganisms resistant to analyzed antibiotics was observed for ARB <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> resistant to cefotaxime and doxycycline. The results indicate a large variation in the removal of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in WWTPs depending on modifications of treatment system and type of inflowing wastewater...|$|R
40|$|Two potent {{antibacterial}} agents {{designed to}} undergo enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation were evaluated for their mechanisms of action. The compounds, NB 2001 and NB 2030, contain a cephalosporin with a thienyl (NB 2001) or a tetrazole (NB 2030) ring at the C- 7 position and {{are linked to}} the antibacterial triclosan at the C- 3 position. The compounds exploit β-lactamases to release triclosan through hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring. Like cephalothin, NB 2001 and NB 2030 were hydrolyzed by class A β-lactamases (Escherichia coli TEM- 1 and, to a lesser degree, Staphylococcus aureus PC 1) and class C β-lactamases (Enterobacter cloacae P 99 <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> AmpC) with comparable catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km). They also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli,</b> but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. Accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> consistent with the toxophore rather than the β-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. In biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (FabI), with 50 % inhibitory concentrations being markedly reduced relative to that of free triclosan. The transport of NB 2001, NB 2030, and triclosan was rapid, with significant accumulation of triclosan in both S. aureus <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> Taken together, the results suggest that NB 2001 and NB 2030 act primarily as triclosan prodrugs in S. aureus <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli...</b>|$|R
