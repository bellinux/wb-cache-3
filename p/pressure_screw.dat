Coupled effect between gas pressure in ballast tank and discharging performance of screw compressor is considered in the presenting model as gas leakage during compressing process is taken into account. Deballasting duration for one certain submarine model is calculated using the developed model, and the result agrees well with that obtained by using Chinese state code for submarine low pressure system design. For different cross section tank models as circular section model, parabolic section model and trapezoidal section model, dynamic performance of screw compressor deballasting system is studied using the validated model.

After traveling around the world helping facilities turn these exchangers from chronic leakers (from internal tubesheet and external diaphragm and B style shell leaks) {{to one of the}} most reliable heat exchangers in the plant, it is very clear to me that manufacturers, engineers and mechanics struggle to correctly understand the interactions between gaskets, internal pressure, the two circles of external push bolts that are part of A style exchangers and all the internal parts. Some manufactuers have given up on trying to make these connections operate leak free, and prefer to weld in the tubesheets and diaphragms. This significantly adds to the cost and time needed to open and close these exchangers, as special equipment is needed to machine out the parts and weld them back together again. There are a handful of equipment manufacturers that build these exchangers, and while there are differences from one manufacturer to the next, once the basic design is understood, the reader should be able understand that they are all basically the same when it comes to the few critical steps that must be followed when opening and closing these exchangers. In order to obtain reliable leak free performance, all the basic sealing tools must be employed, including: 1. A spreadsheet that will easily analyze the critical variables; 2. Correct gasket selection; 3. Correct assembly procedures that focus on important steps including proper spacing of internal parts and obtaining consistent thread friction; 4. And finally hot torqueing the exchangers after startup.

40|$|The latest legal {{requirements}} call to an increasing degree of purification for plastics, for both virgin and recycled material. Abidance {{by the law}} demands new processing technologies for purifying plastics. The extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide could be an approach. Supercritical carbon dioxide {{is characterized by a}} high diffusion coefficient, a low viscosity and a high density. These properties are determining the outstanding solubility in scCO 2 even for higher molecular substances. Furthermore CO 2 is non flammable, ecologically safe, inexpensive and non toxic. One disadvantage of CO 2 is its low polarity and thus its low solubility for polar substances. The polarity of the extracting agent can be influenced specifically by dosing additional cosolvents like methanol in scCO 2. Carbon dioxide also is a gas which causes the greenhouse effect and should therefore be recycled. The usage of scCO 2 as an extracting agent in a twin screw extruder offers high potential for decreasing the amount of contaminations in the polymer melt. The extraction process is examined in the present paper for cleaning polymer melts. Main objective of the extraction is to remove foreign substances as monomers, solvent residues, processing aids and contaminations, which are diffusing into the interior material by using the plastics. These contaminations are dispersed or dissolved in the polymer. The applicability of a twin screw extruder for purifying polymer melt is analysed for both virgin material (two types of polyamide 12) to remove monomers and specifically contaminated high density polyethylene. To implement the extraction process on a twin screw extruder the compounding process has to be modified regarding this process technology, {{in order to keep the}} CO 2 in its overcritical state at high pressures > 75 bar. This is an additional requirement for common twin screw extruders. Pressure tightness was achieved by using a copper sealing in combination with a sealing paste. For dimensioning the extruder for extraction purposes, the processing unit should feature few linkage points. Besides the pressure tightness of the extruder the screw configuration has to be determined and optimised. A reflow zone following the zone for the CO 2 -outlet is proved to provide the possibility for the carbon dioxide, which is swept away with the polymer, to flow against the polymer flow back to the CO 2 outlet. After elaborating a sufficient process for taking samples, dependences of different processing parameters the extraction effect were researched. In general the highest extraction effect can be realised by increasing <b>pressure,</b> <b>screw</b> speed, processing temperature and the CO 2 -flow. Contrary to this an increased temperature level results in charred melt and a high CO 2 flow has a negative effect on the economy of the extraction process. The integration of a degassing unit and a counter flow process were also investigated. To do so an extruder cascade is inevitable due to safety reasons. Furthermore the extruder cascade facilitates stable processing conditions and simplified process control. Regarding the counter flow processing, the used screw configuration is inappropriate. Due to this improvement of the screw design is inevitable. Industry is reluctant using supercritical fluids despite of the considerable advantages. Reasons for the scepticism can be found in the high investment cost al well as using hegh pressure processing technology. However the increasing relevance of {{legal requirements}} and the progressive development will promote this technology...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Plastic Film and Sheeting and the definitive published version is available at [URL] SAGE Publications. The process dynamics of single-screw extrusion on mixtures of polypropylene (PP) and recycled PP were studied using a statistical, design of experiments (DoE) approach. For a conventional screw design, the barrel temperature, screw speed and two vastly different melt viscosity polypropylene mixtures were selected as the independent factors, whilst melt <b>pressure,</b> mass output, <b>screw</b> torque and temperature rise at the die due to shear heating were the dependent responses. A central composite design (CCD) {{in the framework of}} response surface methodology (RSM) was constructed, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to determine the significance of the response surface models. The resulting statistical and response surface predictions have demonstrated that the low viscosity component concentration in the blend is a dominating factor on melt <b>pressure</b> and <b>screw</b> torque, apart from the expected effect of screw speed on output. Viscous heating is affected only by screw speed and recycled polypropylene concentration. Furthermore, the predictions have identified a wider process operating window with increased low-viscosity component concentration.

A Taguchi design of experiments has been implemented to highlight the influence and optimise processing conditions such as injection flow rate, holding pressure, back <b>pressure</b> and <b>screw</b> speed. The addition of 2 wt% of carbon nanotubes into PP significantly reduces the shrinkage and warpage of injection-moulded parts as compared to the neat PP.

The sensitivity of the injection-mouldings dimensional properties to processing parameters remains roughly the same in case of neat PP and PP/MWNT nanocomposites when shrinkage is considered.
