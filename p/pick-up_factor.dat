40|$|Very long (several tens of meters) wire dipoles {{have been}} used to observe low-frequency (≤ MHz) AC {{electric}} field onboard spacecraft. Accurate measurements of the field require the accurate evaluation of the <b>pick-up</b> <b>factor</b> and effective length of a wire dipole immersed in space plasmas. In-situ observations with GEOTAIL and AKEBONO demonstrate that the <b>pick-up</b> <b>factor</b> depends on ambient plasma density and temperature, while the effective length is almost a half of the dipole’s tip-to-tip length at ELF/VLF frequencies. A model rheometry experiment shows that the effective length approaches to the tip-to-tip length for lower frequencies...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} an {{essential}} assumption in the Vafa and Witten’s theorem on P and CT realization in vector-like theories, {{the existence of}} a free energy density in Euclidean space in the presence of any external hermitian symmetry breaking source, does not apply if the symmetry is spontaneously broken. The assumption that the free energy density is well defined requires the previous assumption that the symmetry is realized in the vacuum. Even if Vafa and Witten’s conjecture is plausible, actually a theorem is still lacking. 1 A few years ago Vafa and Witten gave an argument against spontaneous breaking of parity in vector-like parity-conserving theories as QCD [1]. The main point in their proof was the crucial observation that any arbitrary hermitian local order parameter X constructed from Bose fields should be proportional to an odd power of the four indices antisymmetric tensor ǫ µνρη and therefore would <b>pick-up</b> a <b>factor</b> of i under Wick rotation.

40|$|Trend {{productivity}} growth {{is a crucial}} determinant of future living standards as well as fiscal balances. In this article, Benoit Robidoux and Bing-Sun Wong from Finance Canada examine {{the issue of whether}} trend {{productivity growth}} has increased in Canada and conclude that in fact it has. If correct, this is indeed a very positive development for Canadians. They point out that business sector output per hour growth in Canada accelerated 0. 9 percentage points from 1. 1 per cent per year in the 1988 - 1996 period to 2. 0 per cent in 1996 - 2001, virtually the same acceleration as in the United States. The authors find that Canada experienced a greater <b>pick-up</b> in total <b>factor</b> productivity growth than the United States. Increased production and use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) accounted for more of the U. S. productivity growth acceleration.

40|$|An {{essential}} assumption in the Vafa and Witten’s theorem on P and CT realization in vector-like theories {{concerns the}} existence of a free energy density in Euclidean space in the presence of any external hermitian symmetry breaking source. We show how this requires the previous assumption that the symmetry is realized in the vacuum. Even if Vafa and Witten’s conjecture is plausible, actually a theorem is still lacking. A few years ago Vafa and Witten gave an argument against spontaneous breaking of parity in vector-like parity-conserving theories as QCD [1]. The main point in their proof was the crucial observation that any arbitrary hermitian local order parameter X constructed from Bose fields should be proportional to an odd power of the four indices antisymmetric tensor ǫ µνρη and therefore would <b>pick-up</b> a <b>factor</b> of i under Wick rotation. The addition of an external symmetry breaking field λX to the Lagrangian in Minkowski space becomes then a pure phase factor in the pathintegral definition of the partition function in Euclidean space. But a pure phase factor in the integrand of a partition function with positive definite integration measure can only increase the vacuum energy density and their conclusion was that, in such a situation, the mean value of the order parameter should vanish in the limit of vanishing symmetry breaking field. A weak point in this simple and nice argument is the assumption that the vacuum energy density (equivalently, the free energy density) is well defined when the symmetry breaking external field λ is not zero. We want to show here how Vafa and Witten’s argument breaks down if parity is spontaneously broken [2]. In other words, the assumption that the vacuum energy density is well defined at nonvanishing λ requires the previous assumption that parity is not spontaneously broken. To demonstrate it we will consider the probability distribution function (p. d. f.) of any or-der parameter for parity in vector-like parityconserving theories. The analysis of the p. d. f. of the order parameter in the symmetric model has been extensively and successful used to investigate spin systems [3], spin glasses [4] and quantum field theories with fermionic degrees of freedo...|$|R
