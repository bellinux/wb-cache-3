40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{is marked}} by impairments in social-emotional situations, executive functioning, and behavioral regulation. These symptoms {{may be related to}} deficits in <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring,</b> i. e., the ability to observe and evaluate one's own behavior and performance which is necessary for the regulation of future behavior. The present literature review investigated electroencephalic correlates of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> in ASD. Event-related potentials (ERPs) considered in this review included internal <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> components (error-related negativity, error positivity), external <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> components (feedback-related negativity, feedback-P 3), and observational <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> components (observer error-related negativity, observer feedback-related negativity). The majority of studies point to reduced internal <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> in ASD. External <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> in reward-processing paradigms, where rewards are independent of performance, seems to be intact in ASD. So far, no studies have investigated the observer error-related negativity in ASD. Available data on the observer feedback-related negativity are inconclusive, since only two studies with differential study results investigated this construct in ASD. In general, results suggest that individuals with ASD have problems with internal <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and with learning from external, abstract feedback. In contrast, the processing of external, concrete feedback seems to be largely intact in ASD...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{an account of}} the likely consequences that <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems have on public service accountability. The research draws upon an in-depth empirical study on Citizens Service Centres, one of the biggest projects of the Greek e-government strategy. Specifically, we outline the rationale for introducing <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> technology in Citizens Service Centres, the use the central government ministry made of the system {{and the ways in which}} Citizens Service Centre staff responded to such <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Drawing upon studies on e-government and the critical literature on <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, we argue that <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> technology is a limited tool for ensuring accountability. This is due to the effects of the <b>monitoring</b> and <b>performance</b> standards, which increase staff's concerns and are likely to encourage irresponsible and unaccountable practices.

Most of the research on the <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> has concentrated on simple monitoring mechanisms related to fault monitoring. This paper considers <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> of complex data fusion system of geo-coded multisensor in distributed network environment. The objective is to find an effective method for designing and implementing an advanced <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> system in order to increase operation reliability and quality of the data fusion system. A functional model for implementing the <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> system is discussed for solving the problem.

The paper reveals lack of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation skills, poor supervision, poor conditions of service and a poor work ethic {{as some of the}} factors contributing to ineffective use of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation tools in the service. Leadership commitment and support, benchmarking reforms, training and education, developed administrative and governance structures as well as well-defined public policy and program formulation and implementation processes are some of the success factors to enhanced performance management and evaluation systems in Botswana.

40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Public and Development Management)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Governance, 2014. Theoretical models link {{organizational}} {{learning and}} <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Organizations with strong <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems and structures {{which are used}} in organizational learning are able to achieve improved performance, adaptability, and sustainability. This is of particular importance to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which are in a resource competitive, and donor-driven environment. However, few published cases have presented practical examples {{of the use of}} <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> for organizational learning. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess how <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> was used by staff for organizational learning at Building Local Capacity for Delivery of HIV Services in Southern Africa (BLC), a Management Sciences for Health (MSH) project in South Africa. A case study approach was selected. The methodology included open-ended interviews with seven staff members in the project, and document and data review. The documents reviewed included the project monitoring and evaluation framework, MSH-South Africa strategic plan, MSH-South Africa learning plan, and the results of an organization learning assessment conducted in 2012. Themes and sub-themes were identified and used to conduct directed content analysis using Atlas Ti Software. The key findings of the study were:  <b>Performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and organization learning is valued by Management Sciences for Health. It is included explicitly as part of country strategic road maps, and projects are supported to develop <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> plans and organizational learning plans.  The MSH-BLC project has strong systems and structures for <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and novel plans for organizational learning. However, these are donor-focused and Staff felt they have limited scope to influence and review them.  The Staff felt that there is multiple <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> practices but few of them use these for learning purposes. A learning plan was developed to J. Govender – MM PDM Research Report 2014 4 improve this, and there is an ongoing restructuring process to enhance information sharing across the project.  Staff felt that they have limited opportunities and the culture does not permit them to critique <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> information, make mistakes, or allow for space to review and think about performance information.  Staff had varied levels of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and learning capacity. In conclusion, the current project culture and utilisation of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> presents opportunities for learning, but are not used optimally. Recommendations made are to adapt the <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> plan, strengthen implementation of current systems through leadership, and establish measures to encourage review and reflection on performance information. Additional research is recommended in the areas of: evaluative thinking and its use in organizational sustainability; determinants of organizational learning in NGO sector; assessing whether learning translates to individual and organizational success; and a review on the success rate of organizations that have <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and organizational learning systems...|$|R
