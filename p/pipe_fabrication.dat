40|$|Engineering design {{must take}} care of local peaks within stress field, {{in order to provide}} {{relevant}} forecast of material behavior. Within pipeline girth welds, pipe misalignment is an ordinary cause of significant stress concentrations. The matching of pipe ends depends of the quality of alignment procedure but it is also much influenced by <b>pipe</b> <b>fabrication</b> tolerances. In general, misalignment is estimated considering the maximal and minimal values of each pipe size according to <b>pipe</b> <b>fabrication</b> tolerances. But, in practice, the probability to get a such case is very low. This paper describes how to improve the calculation of stress concentration factor (SCF) through a statistical analysis of pipe dimensions.

40|$|Twin wire {{submerged}} {{arc welding}} (SAW) is widely used in the joining of oil or gas pipe lines because of its high productivity. However, when it is applied to join the high strength steel pipe, the heat affected zone (HAZ), especially the coarse grain zone, becomes very brittle. To investigate the strength and toughness of HAZ, thermal cycles in HAZ due to twin wire SAW must be studied. In present studies, theoretical equations of twin wire welding thermal cycles for thick plate, thin plate are developed by authors and the critical thicknesses for both thick plate and thin plate are determined. The welding thermal cycles for intermediate thickness are predicted by linear interpolation using results of both thick plate and thin plate. Through the theoretical equations, thermal cycles of twin wire SAW with actual welding conditions used in <b>pipe</b> line <b>fabrication</b> were predicted and verified by both FEM and experiment. Good agreement among theoretical results, FEM and experimental results was achieved.

Ductile damage criterion for X 100 steel was built to simulate the material damage and fracture during the shear processing. By the simulation, the plastic deformation, the damage initiation and evolution, the fracture of steel plate can be obtained, which are coincided to production practise.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to {{establish}} an approach to generate carefully controlled data that can conclusively establish heat pipe operating life with material-fluid combinations capable of extended operation. To accomplish this goal acceleration is required to compress 10 years of operational life into 3 years of laboratory testing {{through a combination of}} increased temperature and mass fluence. Specific test series have been identi 3 ed, based on American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specifications, to investigate long term corrosion rates. The refractory metal selected for demonstration purposes is a Molybdenum- 44. 5 %Rhenium alloy formed by powder metallurgy. The heat pipe makes use of an annular crescent wick design formed by hot isostatic pressing of Molybdenum-Rhenium wire mesh. The heat pipes are filled using vacuum distillation and purity sampling is considered. Testing of these units is round-the-clock with 6 -month destructive and non-destructive inspection intervals to identify the onset and level of corrosion. Non-contact techniques are employed for providing power to the evaporator (radio frequency induction heating at I to 5 kW per unit) and calorimetry at the condenser (static gas gap coupled water cooled calorimeter). The planned operating temperature range would extend from 1123 to 1323 K.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{can play}} a key role in the SCC performance of susceptible materials in PWR primary water applications. Residual stresses are stresses stored within the metal that develop during deformation and persist in the absence of external forces or temperature gradients.

This paper presents 400 C steam SCC test results demonstrating that residual stresses in as-fabricated Alloy 600 pipe fittings are sufficient to induce SCC.

40|$|Measuring body {{temperature}} is considerably important to physiological studies {{as well as}} clinical investigations. In recent years, numerous observations have been reported and various methods of measurement have been employed. The present paper introduces a novel wearable sensor in intelligent clothing for human {{body temperature}} measurement. The objective is the integration of optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) -based sensors into functional textiles to extend the capabilities of wearable solutions for body temperature monitoring. In addition, the temperature sensitivity is 150 pm/°C, which is almost 15 times {{higher than that of}} a bare FBG. This study combines large and small <b>pipes</b> during <b>fabrication</b> to implant FBG sensors into the fabric. The law of energy conservation of the human body is considered in determining heat transfer between the body and its clothing. The mathematical model of heat transmission between the body and clothed FBG sensors is studied, and the steady-state thermal analysis is presented. The simulation results show the capability of the material to correct the actual body temperature. Based on the skin temperature obtained by the weighted average method, this paper presents the five points weighted coefficients model using both sides of the chest, armpits, and the upper back for the intelligent clothing. The weighted coefficients of 0. 0826 for the left chest, 0. 3706 for the left armpit, 0. 3706 for the right armpit, 0. 0936 for the upper back, and 0. 0826 for the right chest were obtained using Cramer 2 ̆ 7 s Rule. Using the weighting coefficient, the deviation of the experimental result was ± 0. 18 °C, which favors the use for clinical armpit temperature monitoring.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental {{analysis of a}} copper mini heat pipe (MHP), fabricated from a sandwich formed between cylindrical wires and flat plates, which are welded by means of diffusion process. The edges formed between the wires and the plates provide the working fluid capillary pressure necessary to overcome all the pressure losses. Two different experimental set ups were developed: one for test in grav-ity (laboratory) and other for microgravity conditions (International Space Station—ISS). The main difference between them lies in the condenser section. In the laboratory, cool-ing water {{was used to remove}} heat from the mini heat pipe, while at the ISS, fins and air fan were employed. In gravity, three different working fluids were tested: water, acetone, and methanol, while, for the experiments at the ISS, just water was used. A model was developed to predict the maximum heat transfer capacity of the device. In comparison to the literature models, the main difference of the present model is the variation of contact angle to adjust the mathematical model. Therefore, the main contributions of the present work are development of wire plate mini heat <b>pipe</b> <b>fabrication</b> methodology using diffu-sion welding, improvement of the analytical model used to predict the maximum heat transfer capacity of the device, determination of the present technology optimum design parameters, and test data obtained under microgravity conditions.

40|$|Effective {{positioning}} {{and tracking}} of critical construction resources {{is crucial to}} fulfilling project objectives in terms of time, cost, and safety. Received signal strength (RSS) based localization methods increasingly become a popular choice in construction applications, especially for indoor scenarios, potentially automating field data acquisition and construction process control. However, the fluctuating nature of collected RSS data due to multipath propagation effects, along with the unavailability of radio signals at certain site locations, hampers effective application of such localization techniques in challenging and dynamic indoor applications. This research evaluates the feasibilities of two RSS-based location tracking techniques, namely, the ranging-based method and the profiling-based method. To verify the positioning accuracy of the two methods, a wireless sensor network system was prototyped for conducting positioning experiments in an indoor carpark, which mimics an enclosed construction site. Experimental results reveal that the ranging-based method performed poorly in the test setting, while on the other hand, the positioning error achieved with the profiling-based method was less than 2. 14 m with 95 % likelihood. Further, to evaluate the achievable accuracy of this method in a real-world indoor environment, we coupled the profiling-based method with commonly used noise filtering algorithms and conducted field testing in a <b>pipe</b> <b>fabrication</b> shop. With 95 % likelihood, consistent positioning accuracy of 1 - 2 m away from the actual position of a tracked tag was obtained in the fabrication shop, which is deemed sufficient for materials and labor hours tracking in support of productivity analysis. In conclusion, the RSS profiling-based method {{is found to be}} an effective method for deployment in real-world indoor settings of construction-related applications...|$|E
40|$|Within {{industrial}} construction, piping can constitute up to 50 % of {{the cost}} of a typical project. It has been shown that across the activities involved in <b>pipe</b> <b>fabrication,</b> pipe fitting has the highest impact on the critical path. The pipe fitter is responsible for interpreting the isometric drawing and then performing the tack welds on piping components so that the assembly complies with the design. Three main problems in doing this task are identified as: (1) reading and interpreting the isometric drawing is challenging and error prone for spatially complicated assemblies, (2) in assemblies with tight allowable tolerance, a number of iterations will take place to fit the pipes with compliance to the design. These iterations (rework) will remain unrecorded in the production process, and (3) no continuous measurement tool exists to let the fitter check his/her work in progress against the design information and acceptance specifications. Addressing these problems could substantially improve pipe fitters’ productivity. The objective of this research is to develop a software package integrating a threefold solution to simplify complex tasks involved in pipe fabrication: (1) making design information easier to understand, {{with the use of a}} tablet, 3 D imaging device and an application software, (2) providing visual feedback on the correctness of fabrication between the design intent and the as-built state, and (3) providing frequent feedback on fabrication using a step-by-step assembly and control framework. The step-by-step framework will reduce the number of required iterations for the pipe fitter. A number of challenges were encountered in order to provide a framework to make real time, visual and frequent feedback. For frequent and visual feedback, a real time 3 D data acquisition tool with an acceptable level of accuracy should be adopted. This is due to the speed of fabrication in an industrial facility. The second challenge is to find the object of interest in real time, once a point cloud is acquired, and finally, once the object is found, to optimally remove points that are considered as clutter to improve the visual feedback for the pipe fitters. To address the requirement for a reliable and real time acquisition tool, Chapter 3 explores the capabilities and limitations of low cost range cameras. A commercially available 3 D imaging tool was utilized to measure its performance for real time point cloud acquisition. The device was used to inspect two pipe spools altered in size. The acquired point clouds were super-imposed on the BIM (Building Information Model) model of the pipe spools to measure the accuracy of the device. Chapter 4 adapts and examines a real time and automatic object finding algorithm to measure its performance with respect to construction challenges. Then, a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm was employed to classify points as being clutter or corresponding to the object of interest. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of the threshold value “K” in the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and optimizing its value for an improved visual feedback. As a result of the work described in this thesis, along with the work of two other master students and a co-op student, a software package was designed and developed. The software package takes advantage of the investigated real time point cloud acquisition device. While the object finding algorithm proved to be effective, a 3 -point matching algorithm was used, as it was more intuitive for the users and took less time. The KNN algorithm was utilized to remove clutter points to provide more accurate visual feedback more accurate to the workers...|$|E

Currently, steel articles are immersed in molten zinc at 860 {degrees}F, thereby forming a {open_quotes}frozen{close_quotes} metal (interfacial zinc iron intermetallic layer) on the surface. Drawbacks to the current technology include the expense of heating parts at such a high temperature and the generation of by-products such as zinc alloys, zinc oxides, and smoke. Furthermore, new federal regulations have significantly reduced acceptable lead levels in coatings, because lead from galvanized, coated steel will dissolve in water.
