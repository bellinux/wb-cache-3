5|$|After {{conducting}} a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal {{letter to the}} government of Serbia. The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide {{was used}} in the {{original}} type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type flashlight cells.

50|$|Many pouch {{laminators}} {{require the}} use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the laminator. This helps <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> hot glue, some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up the rollers. <b>The</b> carrier <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> rollers from getting sticky, which helps to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> lamination pouch from wrapping around the rollers inside the laminator.|$|R

50|$|MSCs {{can promote}} neuroprotection in the CNS of {{patients}} with MS which may <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> progression of the disease to chronic disability. MSCs contribute to neuroprotection through several different mechanisms. These mechanisms include inhibiting apoptosis which will <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> death of healthy cells and prevent gliosis which will <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> formation of a glial scar. They can also stimulate local progenitor cells to produce replacement cells that can assist in rebuilding the myelin sheath.|$|R

5|$|The {{continent}} didn't {{split into}} two because the Grenville province (a microcontinent) was converging with the proto-North American continent to the east.

50|$|This erosion <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> {{accretion}} {{of these}} outer layers around the protostar at {{the centre of}} the core; and this, in turn, <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> protostar from becoming a fully fledged star.

5|$|Though {{predominantly}} {{found in}} prokaryotes, a potential RNA thermometer {{has been found}} in mammals including humans. The candidate thermosensor heat shock RNA-1 (HSR1) activates heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and induces protective proteins when cell temperature exceeds 37°C (body temperature), thus <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> cells from overheating.|$|E

40|$|Absia'act [...] A/ms: To {{study the}} {{antibacterial}} and antifungal effects of soft contact lens disinfection solutions. Methods: Eight contact lens disinfection solutions containing hydrogen peroxide or biguanides or polyquad compounds were evaluated {{with respect to}} their ability to disinfect a saline solution experimentally contaminated with different bacteria and with a fungus. We used cultures in blood Agar, MueUer-Hinton agar and Saboureaud's agar to identify the bacterial and fungal growth following 14 h of exposure to the disinfection solutions. Results: Hydrogen peroxide, D YMED ~ and polyhexamide solutions <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> growth of the four bacteria studied. The solution containing biguanide <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> growth ofEscherichia coli and Staphyloccocus epidermidis. The solution with polyquad solution only <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and none of <b>the</b> disinfection solutions <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> growth of Candida albicans. The control solution, which was saline, did not <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> growth of either bacteria or fungi. Conclusions: Disinfection solutions containing hydrogen peroxide, or DYMED ® or polyhexamide can disinfect hese four bacteria but none of them <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> growth of Candida albicans. KEY WORDS: antibacterial nd antifungal effects, soft contact lens solutions, disinfection capacity, ocular infection...|$|R

5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E

Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies more {{time to prepare for}} the Japanese counteroffensive and <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, and other supplies.|$|E
