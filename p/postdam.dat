40|$|Abstract: This {{case study}} {{presents}} a risk analysis reassessment for the oldest dam in the Tennessee River basin—the Wilson Dam—based on <b>postdam</b> flow data. The hydrologic risk of old Wilson Dam was computed from historical flow data (spanning pre and <b>postdam</b> periods) and reservoir volume at the dam site. Additional flow data not previously {{used in the}} design phase of the dam helped to update more robustly the probability of flood occurrence that exceeded a particular return period during {{the life of a}} dam. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution was fitted to historical peak flow (at the dam site) and annual maximum reservoir volume using the L-moment method. This reassessment approach has wide application in reservoir water and safety management for ageing dams. The study underscores the need for a review of risk analysis for ageing dams that have extensive <b>postdam</b> flow data, particularly in the United States. Furthermore, this case study also demonstrates the unique value of the L-moment method in incorporating <b>postdam</b> flow data for more robust risk analysis...|$|E

40|$|Cottonwood forest {{regeneration}} has sharply declined along the Missouri River {{and other western}} U. S. rivers due primarily to flow regulation by dams. Novel river habitats, including delta formations where tributaries empty into reservoirs, {{are one of the}} few places along the Missouri River where there is successful cottonwood regeneration. The delta formed at the confluence of the White River and Fort Randall Reservoir in South Dakota represents such a novel habitat. Time-series analysis of riverine cross-sections indicated that there has been a trend of channel and floodplain aggradation within the <b>postdam</b> delta, facilitating expansion of delta surfaces into and above the reservoir pool. Likewise, time-series analysis of aerial photography showed that forest area increased by 69 percent in the <b>postdam</b> era. Field inventories determined that a heterogeneous mixture of cottonwood forests exists within the White River delta region, and that the composition and structure of these forests differs from those along natural river reaches. Although there has been an overall trend of increasing forest area, turnover of forest patches is common, especially for patches at the lowest elevations vulnerable to prolonged reservoir inundation. Flooding of the expanding delta has increased over the last two decades and is likely to become more typical in the future due to climate change and ageing of the reservoir system, including formation of larger deltas and reduced reservoir storage capacity. Knowledge of the existing vegetation patterns and morphology of the White River delta can reveal how reservoir pools could be managed to favor the expansion and survival of delta forests over the long-term...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Analyses of flow, sediment-transport, bed-topographic, and sedimentologic {{data suggest}} that before the closure of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyons was {{annually}} supply-limited with respect to fine sediment (i. e., sand and finer material). Furthermore, these analyses suggest that the predam river in Glen Canyon was not supply-limited {{to the same degree}} and that the degree of annual supply limitation increased near the head of Marble Canyon. The predam Colorado River in Grand Canyon displays evidence of four effects of supply limitation: (1) seasonal hysteresis in sediment concentration, (2) seasonal hysteresis in sediment grain size coupled to the seasonal hysteresis in sediment concentration, (3) production of inversely graded flood deposits, and (4) development or modification of a lag between the time of a flood peak and the time of either maximum or minimum (depending on reach geometry) bed elevation. Analyses of sediment budgets provide additional support for the interpretation that the predam river was annually supply-limited with respect to fine sediment, but it was not supply-limited with respect to fine sediment during all seasons. In the average predam year, sand would accumulate and be stored in Marble Canyon and upper Grand Canyon for 9 months of the year (from July through March) when flows were dominantly below 200 – 300 m 3 /s; this stored sand was then eroded during April through June when flows were typically higher. After closure of Glen Canyon Dam, because of the large magnitudes of the uncertainties in the sediment budget, no season of substantial sand accumulation is evident. Because most flows in the <b>postdam</b> river exceed 200 – 300 m 3 /s, substantial sand accumulation in the <b>postdam</b> river is unlikely. 1...|$|E

Cables insulated with homo-polymer XLPE and co-polymer of XLPE with micron-sized ethylene-butyl-acrylate (EBA) islands were studied by both frequency-domain and time-domain dielectric spectroscopy techniques after accelerated thermal ageing under 135 °C for 60 days. In the frequency domain, a frequency response analyzer (FRA) {{was used to measure}} the frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 1 Hz at temperatures from 20 °C to 80 °C. In the time domain, a special charging/discharging current measurement system was developed to measure the frequencies from 10 - 1 Hz to 102 Hz. These techniques were chosen to cope with the extremely low dielectric losses of the model cables.

One established predictor for reading times is word familiarity where highly familiar words show decreased reading times (Kennedy & Pynte, 2005). Gernsbacher (1984) had subjects rate words for their subjective, “experiential familiarity”. Here, familiarity is captured by the cumulated frequency of all words sharing word n’s length and initial trigram. However, familiarity is confounded with lexical frequency: Highly frequent words tend to be also highly familiar. Does familiarity contribute anything beyond word frequency?

Our eye-tracking corpus consists of gaze data from 80 participants on over 16, 000 words.

40|$|Abstract. The Lower Mekong River has {{witnessed}} extremely low water levels {{over the past}} few years. There is speculation that the changes are a consequence of the construction and operation of the Chinese cascade dams in {{the upper part of the}} Mekong main stream, the Lancang River. Dam construction on upper streams can produce a series of induced effects downstream, particularly in terms of water, sediment, channel and ecological changes. Analyses of discharge and sediment flux at various gauging stations on the Lower Mekong River have indicated a disruption in water discharge, water fluctuations and sediment transport downstream of the first Chinese dam among the 8 cascades (i. e. the Manwan Dam), after its reservoir was infilled in 1992. Dry season flows showed a declining trend, and water level fluctuations in the dry season increased considerably in the <b>postdam</b> (1993 – 2000) period. Monthly suspended sediment concentration (SSC) has also decreased significantly in several gauging stations in the post-dam period. The estimation of sediment flux is challenging since the measurements of SSC were sporadic. Our estimation based on the available data indicated that the areas along the upper-middle and lowermost reaches of the Mekong River have experienced a decline in sediment flux, possibly due to sedimentation in the Manwan Dam. However, the decrease is only statistically significant at the nearest gauging station below the Dam (i. e. Chiang Saen). Areas located in the mid-length of the river show less sensitivity to the operation of the Manwan Dam, as sediment fluxes have remained stable or even increased in the post-dam period...|$|E

The workshop attracted 31 scientists from 12 countries, representing a wide range of disciplines covering ecophysiology, soils, forest ecology, growth and yield, silviculture, remote sensing, forest policy, and forest economics. Several presentations investigated possible impacts of climate change on forest growth and development. A second major topic was the carbon budget and the possible contribution of forestry to carbon dioxide mitigation. The third important focus was the application of economic models to estimate socio-economic consequences of changes in forest productivity and the linkage of ecological and economic models. Non-timber forest benefits were addressed in one regional impact assessment and in two national integrated assessments from the U. S. and Germany.

40|$|Comunicación presentada en la Tree Rings and Archaeology, Climatology and Ecology. Dendrosymposium, celebrada en <b>Postdam</b> y Eberswalde (Alemania) del 9 al 12 de mayo de 2012. Tree {{growth of}} Pinus canariensis forests on Tenerife, Canary Islands, has been {{suggested}} as being mainly controlled by physiological limitations due to drought-induced stress (Jonsson et al. 2002), {{in agreement with the}} general pattern for subtropical mountains (Morales et al. 2004). Aspect of mountain slopes harshly influences local water input and controls vegetation distribution (Fernández-Palacios & de Nicolás 1995). Trade winds maintain humid weather conditions on windward slopes, while leeward slopes remain much more arid (Aboal et al. 2000). In this study, we assessed the effects of local climate and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the radial growth of P. canariensis along its elevation range on both windward and leeward slopes in Tenerife. Wood cores were taken from six stands on windward, and six on leeward in even-aged afforestations between 1000 and 2000 m a. s. l. Total tree-ring widths were used to explore common patterns of growth behaviour, using principal component analysis in the common period 1967 ¿ 2006. Tree-ring growth responses to climate were evaluated by correlation analysis. We used monthly gridded time series of mean (T) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures, precipitation (P), sea level pressure (SLP), vapour pressure (VP), and the NAO index. Great differences in climate-driven growth patterns and their responses to local and large-scale climate variation were noted between slopes, with greater responsiveness to winter Tmax and VP on windward, but to annual P, autumn-winter SLP and NAO on leeward. This is probably due to the contrasting physiological effects of water inputs and radiation on both slopes caused by fog drip (Burgess & Dawson 2004). By contrast, altitudinal gradients showed to be irrelevant on tree growth, with the only exception of the lowest stand on windward. We conclude that physiological limitations due to slope aspect, but not to increasing elevation, are mostly driving P. canariensis growth. References Aboal JR, Jiménez MS, Morales D, Gil P, 2000.

[...] et al. Roads and railways {{may have}} a relevant impact on wildlife due to habitat alteration, population fragmentation/isolation or roadkills. Furthermore, increasing road casualties with large ungulates in some countries such as Spain is a growing social problem {{that needs to be}} solved. De-fragmentation techniques which help to mitigate this problem have been well developed and applied across the world, but may imply considerable technical problems or induce increased cost of public works. Thus, identification of transport infrastructure tracts where these de-fragmenting measures should be applied is a major challenge when it comes to investing the limited economical resources. With this aim, we developed a framework based on a conservation index, habitat distribution and fragmentation, and key species mapping to produce cartography assigning an index of relevance for defragmentation for every 1 km tract of the entire national road and railway network. We collected the distribution of all vertebrate species within Spain according to distribution atlases. This information is available at a resolution scale of 10 km x 10 km UTM cells. We calculated a conservation index based on rarity and vulnerability of vertebrate species for each ecoregion of the country, i. e., Mediterranean, Eurosiberian, Balearic Islands and Canary Islands. We then modelled this response variable with a multiple lineal regression and with environmental variables related to topography, climate, spatial location and human activity. As environmental variables were available at a resolution scale of 1 km x 1 km, it was possible to downscale the model to this finer resolution using a raster calculator in a Geographic Information System. In this way, we obtained important conservation areas for vertebrates in Spain at that resolution. We also included in the analysis the information about High Natural Value areas recently produced by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment, the protected area network (including Natura 2000), the presence of target species (those endangered and highly vulnerable to road kills, as well as ungulates causing road casualties), and the presence of rivers and wetlands. Assigning different scores to each of the information layers analysed we obtained a conservation index in each 1 km x 1 km UTM cell. The information about hotspots of road casualties and ecological corridors was also considered in some regions where the information was available. We calculated also a habitat fragmentation index (Effective Mesh Size) and an infrastructure affection index for each of the squares, considering the kind of infrastructure (high speed railway, regular railway, motorway or road) and the overall surface occupying each square. We overlapped the three indexes to identify those sections showing major conflicts between transport infrastructures and conservation of the Spanish Natural Heritage. Finally, we provided proposals to apply defragmentation measures to reduce the impact at the most conflictive points.

40|$|Climate {{changes and}} global warming are {{generally}} associated with the enhanced greenhouse effect, but aerosols can induce a cooling effect and thus regionally mask this warming effect. Unfortunately, the strong variability both in space and in time of the aerosols and thus the difficulty to characterize their global basic properties induce large uncertainties in the predictions of the numerical models. Those uncertainties are {{as high as the}} absolute level of the enhanced greenhouse forcing. To solve this problem it is necessary to improve the set of well-calibrated instruments (both in situ and remote sensing) with the ability to measure the changes in stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols amounts and their radiative properties, changes in atmospheric water vapor and temperature distributions, and changes in clouds cover and cloud radiative properties. The quantity used to assess the importance of one compound (greenhouse gases, aerosols) to the variation of the radiative budget of the Earth is the radiative forcing. One of those forcings is the direct aerosol radiative forcing and it depends on the optical depths and the upscatter fraction of the aerosols. Those two parameters depend on the chemical composition and size distribution of the aerosols. Thus the key parameters of this radiative forcing are the chemical composition through its refractive index and the size distribution of the aerosols. This thesis deals with the design and the implementation of one multi-wavelength lidar system at the Jungfraujoch Alpine Research Station (Alt. 3580 m asl). This lidar system is a combination of one standard backscatter lidar and one Raman lidar. Its design have been supported by a ray tracing analysis of the receiver part. The laser transmitter is based on a tripled Nd:YAG laser and the backscattered light is collected by one Newtonian telescope for the tropospheric measurements and by one Cassegrain telescope for the future stratospheric measurements. The received wavelengths for each telescope include three elastically scattered wavelengths (355, 532 and 1064 nm), two spontaneous Raman signals from nitrogen (387 and 607 nm) and one spontaneous Raman signal from the water vapor (408 nm). The optical signals received by each of the telescopes are separated spectrally by two filter polychromators. They are build up around a set of beamsplitters and custom design thin band pass filters with high out-of-band rejection. On the visible channel, the adds of a Wollaston prism separates the parallel polarized backscattered signal (532 (p) nm) of the perpendicular polarized one (532 (c) nm). Photomultiplier tubes perform the detection of the signals for the UV and visible wavelengths and by Si-avalanche photodiodes for the near-infrared signal. The acquisition of the signals is performed by seven transient recorders in analog and in photon counting modes. Within the frame of the EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network), hardware and software intercomparisons have been done. The software intercomparison has been divided into the validation of the elastic algorithm and the Raman algorithm. Those intercomparisons of the inversions of the lidar signals have been performed using synthetic data for a number of situations of different complexity. The hardware intercomparison have been achieved with the mobile micro-lidar of the Observatoire Cantonal de Neuchâtel. The present lidar system provides independent aerosol extinction and backscatter profiles, depolarization ratio and water vapor mixing ratio up to the tropopause. Their uncertainties could be smaller than 20 % and thus make possible the retrieval of the microphysical aerosol parameters like the volume concentration distribution and the mean and integral parameters of the particle size distribution, (effective radius, total surface-area concentration, total volume concentration and number concentration of particles). This retrieval is performed by one algorithm of the Institute of Mathematic of the University of <b>Postdam</b> based on the hybrid regularization method. The first results of the retrieval of the volume concentration distribution with three backscatter (355, 532 and 1064 nm) and one extinction (355 nm) profiles has demonstrated promising results. Future upgrades of the system will add ozone concentration and temperature profile up to the stratopause...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne {{year after}} COP 21 in Paris that reached {{to a global}} {{agreement}} on climate action, it is timely {{to come back to}} the scientific expertise that is part of the debates about climate change. The almost symbiotic relationship between scientific expertise and political discussions in this field is well‐documented (e. g. Shackley and Wynne, 1996; Agrawala, 1999; Miller, 2004; Edwards, 2010). This scientific expertise is not limited to climate science, but it is rarely considered in all its diversity, with physical and natural science drawing most of the attention. While the history and the role of climate scenarios/models and the development of expertise on climate change have been extensively analysed (e. g. Edwards, 1996, 2010; Guillemot, 2007; van der Sluijs et al., 1998), the development of socio‐ and techno-economic assessments in this fieldhas not received the same attention. However, these seem to play a crucial role in the elaboration of climate policy, insofar as they contribute to the understanding of the interactions between climate and societies. The rise of climate change on the public agenda since the late 1980 s has prompted the need for quantitative assessments of the costs and impacts of mitigation strategies, in particular in view of the IPCC reports. To meet this demand, an increasing number of scenarios have been produced by Energy‐Economy‐Environment (E 3) models. These gather different types of models – including the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) – which help to reduce the complexity and heterogeneity of relevant processes, inform and to an extent frame international climate negotiations, by producing a large array of numerical projections and scenarios. This paper focuses on Integrated Assessment models (IAMs). It follows the co-evolution of the IAMs institutions and research community, and of their agenda of modelling efforts. We do so by focusing on the preparation of the 5 th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR 5). IAMs are stylized numerical approaches which aim at representing complex socio-physical interactions among energy, agriculture, the economic system … as systems. Based on a set of input assumptions, they produce quantified scenarios (e. g. energy system transitions, land use transitions, economic effects of mitigation, emissions trajectories …) that helps us exploring potential climate policy strategies. They are a heterogeneous category that has gradually emerged from a set of distinct intellectual traditions (Weyant et al., 1996; Crassous, 2009). IAMs can thus be built on rather different assumptions: they can follow distinct logics and represent the same processes with different levels of details. IAMs and the scenarios they produce have grown central to the work of IPCC and seem to play an increasingly important part in climate negotiations and policies. Their influence has become particularly striking in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report through the work and contribution of “Working Group III” – entitled ‘mitigation of climate change’. During the process of preparing the AR 5, Working Group III was chaired by one of the main actors of the current IAM research community. IAMs outcome and perspective were used as a guiding and structuring principle. IAM scenarios were expected to serve as bridging devices between the three IPCC working groups (which involve different scientific disciplines), albeit interviews suggest that the extent to which they succeeded in this respect remains unclear. IAMs influence has built up conjointly with the structuring of IAM research as a distinct field of expertise and that of IAMs researchers network through a series of European Projects and regular meetings. All of this contributed to the consolidation of IAM as a category of models with common – or at least comparable – characteristics. How did ‘IAM’ emerge as a relatively unified – though diverse – category and research field? How and where did the IAM community organise as such, and what is it made of? How have integrated assessment modellers organised the heterogeneity of their models so as to establish them as credible and reliable sources of policy-relevant expertise? How do they manage uncertainties, considering both the scope and complexity of the systems they study, and the many conceptual repertoires they draw from (physics, economics, systems dynamics, environmental sciences…) ?In order to answer such questions, we conducted a first series of interviews with modellers and key players in the IAMs community. These were undertaken on different occasions such as: the conference Our Common Future Under Climate Change (OCFCC) (Paris, July 2015), the venue to France of the head of the Energy Modelling Forum (October 2016), two visits to major research institutes in this field (PIK and PBL/University of Utrecht). These interviews have been completed by observations during two conference sessions focused on IAMs: a side event entitled « New frontiers of integrated assessment of climate change and policies » during the OCFCC Conference, and the 8 th meeting of the Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium (IAMC) (<b>Postdam,</b> November 2015). Attending and observing these sessions gave us an overview of the debates among modellers, the diversity of their approaches, the key challenges that are discussed in the community, the potential tensions within the community, and the way in which this research field is structuring itself. Last, we analysed the main inter-comparison modelling programs that were developed between the publications of the 4 th and 5 th IPCC reports and the material that was produced on these occasions (reports, articles…). In gathering and studying this empirical material, we tried to combine two approaches: a sociological perspective on the communities, networks, practices and discourses relevant to IAMs, and an historical perspective on the emergence and evolution of IAM research in terms of content, objectives and communities. In our contribution, we will emphasize the role of the research programs that have been conducted in specific forums – such as: the Energy Modeling Forum coordinated by Stanford University, the EU FP 7 projects…- looking at the way in which they contributed in setting the agenda of the modelling research community and in steering the production of scenarios. We will also analyse the mutual relationship between these program, their outcomes and the contribution of WG III to the IPCC process and outcome, in particular within the 5 th Assessment report. Model inter-comparison is a crucial part of these programs which have multiplied since the early 2000 ’s. It consists in comparing the outputs of a range of models under similar hypotheses, usually focusing on one specific modelling and/or policy issue (e. g. technological innovation, land-use changes, etc.). Though it draws from similar practices in climate change research, the reliance on model inter-comparisons appears as a defining feature of IAM research, and it has played a role in the cohesion of IAM as a category of expertise relevant to climate policy. For instance, since the 4 th IPCC report published in 2007, the feasibility of low carbon trajectories consistent with the 2 °C target that was institutionalized in 2009 at the Copenhagen conference has been a key question. It was the subject of the main modelling exercises conducted by the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) headed by Stanford University and European research programs, mostly funded by the Commission. From 1991 onwards, the EMF organized a series of workshops dedicated to climate issues. In view of the IPCC 5 th Assessment Report, EM 22, 24, 27 and 28 provided a global inter-comparison modeling exercise around the 2 °C objective target, at different scales (world, US and EU level). Each of these sessions gathered researchers with an expertise of the question under consideration and followed the same protocol: a first stage was dedicated to the elaboration of a set of common scenarios based on harmonized assumptions that were then assessed by models. Since 2007, another large part of the scenarios produced for the IPCC 5 th Assessment Report has come from similar inter-comparison modeling projects funded by the 7 th European Framework Program. This highlights EU’s growing political and scientific interest in climate policies over this period. The main findings of these research programs were synthetized in consolidated reports. They were published in international peer‐reviewed journals in the energy and climate fields. The results from these projects represent a significant part of the scenario database included in the IPCC 5 th Assessment Report, which included over 1000 scenarios. The Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC), another and newer forum for discussing IAM research, also is a key arena for comparing IAMs and organizing priorities for future research. It was created in 2007 and was instrumental in the preparation of the contribution of Working Group III to the IPCC 5 th Assessment Report. Besides providing resources and a setting for regular meetings of IAM researchers, IAMC puts a lot of efforts into the mapping and systematization of IAM models and scenarios, thereby contributing to their unification as a category of models. Last but not least, we will also investigate how, by fostering common problem definitions and methodological approaches within the research programs or the creation of the IAMC, these inter-comparison modeling have contributed to delineate an IAM community. Our paper will wonder to what extent the IAM community can be described as an epistemic community (Haas, 1992) which participates, through the production of socio-economic scenarios, to the framing of the assessment of climate policies in IPCC Working Group III. It will also reflect on current evolutions, in particular those related to the Paris agreement on climate change and to the emergence of potential competing approaches and forums focused on national assessment and practical solutions in its wake (e. g Deep Decarbonization Pathway Project). In doing so, it will shed light on the epistemic, institutional and social dynamics involved in the production, framing and diffusion of a very specific type of expertise about the future...|$|E
