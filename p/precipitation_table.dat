40|$|The {{composition}} of precipitation and element loads originating from rainwater were examined monthly between 2005 and 2008 at two experimental stations (Őrbottyán in the Danube–Tisza Interfluve region and Nagyhörcsök in the Mezőföld region of Hungary) of the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Twenty-five characteristics were analysed: pH, EC, NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, and concentrations {{of the main}} macro- and microelements. The observation represents the dry and wet deposition together. Measurements were carried out by ICP-OES device, {{with the exception of}} carbonate, chloride, ammonia and nitrate. The main results can be summarized as follows: – Generally, the lower amounts of monthly precipitation resulted in higher EC, pH; NH 4 -N, Ca, Na and K concentrations. The highest element yields, however, were typical of the wet months. Acidic precipitation (below pH 5) was rich in nitric acid forming NO 3 -N, but poor in NH 4 -N at the Őrbottyán Experimental Station. Emission of the nearby cement works in February and March 2006 caused an order of magnitude higher increase in Ca, Mg, Na and Sr elements as compared to other months, and there was a considerable rise in the NH 4 -N, S, Zn, As, Cr and Pb concentrations of the <b>precipitation</b> (<b>Table</b> 5, 1 st half of the year). The pH reached 7. 0 at this site. – Depositions were small at the Nagyhörcsök Experimental Station in winter. During the warmer months (May, June and July) the NH 4 -N concentration was 10 – 20 times higher than the NO 3 -N concentration. The neighbouring fertile and humus rich soils, fertilization, as well as the nearby animal husbandry farm make notable NH 3 emission. In this period the concentration of NH 4 -N and the alkalizing cations Ca and K raised the precipitation’s pH, and the pH increased from January to June. – Aerial deposition varied greatly at both sites, representing the following values in kg·ha- 1 ·year- 1 unit: NO 3 -N 5 – 20; NH 4 -N 10 – 31; total N 30 – 48; Ca 6 – 60; K 6 – 16; S 2 – 21; Na 4 – 13; Mg 2 – 16; P 2 – 6. The deposition of Zn, Mn, Fe, Cu and B elements at these sites were similar to previous Hungarian and Austrian data. Pb, Ni, Cd and Co depositions, however, were an order of magnitude lower, which demonstrates the positive result of the successful control of heavy metal pollution in Europe since 1990. – Aerial deposition has considerable agronomical and environmental significance.

The studied sites are two open ombrotrophic peatlands located in the James Bay Lowlands in Northeastern Canada. For both sites, two simulations were realised: one based on a precipitation reconstruction from pollen data, used as input in the model, and a second using a water table depth reconstruction derived from testate amoebae to apply a water table forcing on the model. Simulated variations in carbon accumulation rates (CAR) and vegetation composition were analysed against the palaeoecological datasets. Results in CAR in both sites and hydrological settings showed periods of net carbon loss, which coincided with fluctuations in observed CAR, though they cannot be traced in palaeoecological datasets.

30|$|Of {{the several}} types of shallow cloud, we focused on trade wind cumulus because their {{variability}} in the results of LES models was larger than that {{of other types of}} shallow clouds. For example, the variability of surface precipitation in an intercomparison of trade wind cumulus (van Zanten et al. 2011) was larger than that in an intercomparison of stratocumulus (Ackerman et al. 2009). van Zanten et al. (2011) proposed {{that one of the reasons}} for the diversity in the microphysical properties of trade wind cumuli was the different cloud microphysical models. They interpreted that a simple (one-moment bulk) microphysical scheme produced large amounts of <b>precipitation</b> (i.e., <b>Table</b> 3 of van Zanten et al.

By contrast, the liquid water was located in the higher layer, and the precipitation flux was small in most of the two-moment schemes (i.e., Figure 6 a of van Zanten et al. (2011)). In this study, we confirmed the validity of their interpretation through a simulation using our new fully compressible LES model and determined the main processes contributing to the diversity in the results of LES model intercomparison studies.|$|R

The burns {{were part of}} a restoration program designed to incrementally reintroduce fire as an ecosystem process in the historically low to mixed severity fire regimes that dominate the landscapes (Taylor 2000). Thus, these were first-entry burns conducted under cool conditions with the intent of reducing surface fuel loads while limiting overstory mortality of old growth (in preparation for subsequent burning). The Energy Release Component, an index related to potential energy or heat release in a flaming fire front (Bradshaw et al. 1983), ranged from 15 th to 50 th percentile on the days the aspen sites burned (Table 1). Fire behavior consisted predominantly of creeping, low intensity (flame length < 30 cm) surface fires through surface fuels (torching was rare and limited to individual trees). Stand level fire severity mapped from satellite imagery (one year post-fire) was classified as “unchanged/low” for pixels in each grove, indicating little or no conifer overstory mortality at 30 m mapping resolution (Eidenshink et al. 2007). Surface fuel consumption varied greatly at finer spatial scales depending on the presence and amounts of coarse woody debris, which supported higher flame lengths and longer residence times.|$|R

It is most noticeable in central and central-south em regions of the administrative province where crops are below the national average. Simultaneously the province is poor in surface waters with agricultural storage reservoirs being absent.

Methods involving prior isolation of calcium as its oxalate (4, 9) or chloranilate (10) are time-consuming. Direct chelometric titration of calcium in diluted serum (2, 5 - 8), while rapid, does not give accurate results in inexperienced hands because of difficulty in detecting end-point reactions.

40|$|Soil saturation, {{and thus}} water table depth, is {{important}} to salt marsh vegetation as it drives zonation, pro-ductivity, and survival. In organogenic, microtidal marshes tidal fl ooding is the main driver of water table. What driver(s) account for water table variability in minerogenic, macrotidal salt marshes? We examined sub-surface hydrology of four Bay of Fundy marshes. These marshes are fl ooded briefl y several times a month by semi-diurnal tides with a 6 – 12 metre range. Over the course of neap tides, water tables were fairly stable (maximum 20 -cm fl uctuation occurred in marsh interiors). We observed a 10 cm or less change in water table in tidal channel edges directly fl ooded by tidal water. Yet, pronounced seasonal differences were observed. In May when there was prolonged, record <b>precipitation,</b> water <b>table</b> was near the surface. In summer, when there was little precipitation and maximum evapotranspiration, the water tables were generally> 40 cm below the surface. Thus, soil char-acteristics and precipitation must be more important drivers of water table in Fundy marshes. With a high bulk density (mean 0. 96 g/cc) and low infi ltration rates (mean 2. 8 cm/hr) it would take 22 hours for the unsaturated (vadose) zone to saturate. We conclude that Fundy marshes will be more ecologically resistant to rising sea level associated with greenhouse warming, as changes in tidal heights and fl ooding will have minimal impact on water tables, thus vegetation will be relatively stable. Since many Fundy marshes were drained for agricultural use, restoration of these resistant marshes could offset losses expected in more vulnerable, microtidal marshes...|$|R

Early warm season 10 -member ensemble output from the NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed Spring Experiments was used, with 29 cases serving as a training set to create the POP tables and 20 cases used as a test set. The {{new approaches}} use QPF–POP relationships based on two properties termed precipitation amount characteristic (PAC) and ensemble member agreement. Exploratory results are presented for 20 -km grid spacing and selectively for 4 -km grid spacing. In the first approach, POPs were based on a binned PAC and the number of ensemble members with 6 -h precipitation accumulations greater than given thresholds. In a second approach, a neighborhood method was used to find the number of points in a given neighborhood area around each of the domain grid points with precipitation amounts greater than a given threshold, while also considering the binned PAC representative of the neighborhood. A third approach synthesized the previous methods and led to an increase in skill relative to the individual methods, and a fourth approach using a combination of methods produced forecasts with even greater skill. All of the forecasts from the four approaches were improved statistically significantly compared to the calibrated traditional method’s forecasts at 20 -km grid spacing. The second approach on its own showed skill comparable to that obtained by a traditional calibrated 10 -member ensemble, so adopting this approach alone could potentially save computer resources that could then be used for model refinements, only sacrificing the increased skill that could have been obtained by using the fourth approach...|$|R

This study used drainage, <b>precipitation,</b> water <b>table,</b> and soil moisture data from a monitoring site located in east central Indiana to investigate the event hydrology of 22 drainage events in free and managed subsurface drainage systems. Relationships between event drainage volume, drain flow hydrograph metrics, column soil moisture, water <b>table</b> depth, and <b>precipitation</b> characteristics were explored to determine the effect of precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions on drainage volumes, reduction in drainage volumes, peak outflows, the time to peak, and the mechanisms by which runoff is generated in managed and free draining subsurface drainage systems. Drainage water management reduced event drainage volume and peak flows by 22 % ± 12 % and 29 % ± 16 % respectively, and increased the time to peak of drainage by 98 % ± 52 %. Higher total precipitation and precipitation time spread promote more infiltration throughout the course of the event and thus greater drainage volumes in managed and free draining systems, while the average precipitation intensity did not correlate with drainage volumes in both systems. Peak flows in free draining quadrants were positively affected by higher precipitation totals and the average precipitation intensity that can increase the infiltration rate. In managed quadrants, the antecedent soil moisture appeared to play a more important role in affecting peak flows than precipitation characteristics. The time to peak in the free draining quadrants decreased with higher average precipitation intensity and increased with higher precipitation time spread. As the average precipitation intensity increased the runoff potential increased on both managed and free draining quadrants. Saturation excess ponding or possibly overland flow occurred in events that have a low average precipitation intensity, and a high precipitation time spread. Field observations indicate that saturation excess overland flow is more pronounced in managed quadrants because the water tables level rise higher than the water table of their free draining counterpart. ...|$|R

Karezes exploit unconfined groundwater in alluvial fans recharged largely by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush, the central mountain {{range of the}} country. Since the multi-year drought that began in 1998, many karezes have stopped flowing.

A typical kariz in Afghanistan is 1 – 2  km long with a cross-section of 1 – 2  m 2 and gradient of 1  m km− 1. MODFLOW simulations show that water delivery from a kariz can be modeled by imposing a high ratio of kariz hydraulic conductivity to aquifer hydraulic conductivity on the cells representing the kariz. The model is sensitive to hydraulic conductivity, kariz gradient, and length of the kariz in contact with the water <b>table.</b> <b>Precipitation</b> data are scarce in Afghanistan, but regional data show a long-term trend of decreased snow cover, and therefore strong likelihood of decreased aquifer recharge. Population in Afghanistan has increased {{at a rate of about}} 2.2  % over the past several decades. An assessment of a six-district region within Kandahar Province where karezes are the most likely source of water indicates that water demand could have caused water tables to decline by 0.8 – 5.6  m, more than enough to cause karezes to stop flowing. These results suggest that kariz water production is not sustainable under current climate- and population-growth trends.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Many {{researchers}} {{studied and}} emphasized on determining {{the importance of}} climatic factors that affect crop yield. As the most source of moisture in rainfed cultivation, precipitation {{is the most important}} climate factor. Spatial and temporal change of this factor effects crop yield. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is useful to characterize the condition of the moisture supply before and during the growing season of crops. Studies have shown that in some areas there is little correlation between spring wheat yield and SPI, while in other areas there is significant relationship between wheat yield and SPI. This difference indicates SPI as an indicator of moisture supply, depend on the study area. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the most effective period of precipitation during growing season for rainfed barley using variables obtained from moisture supply and precipitation periods in Tabriz. The most effective period of precipitation can be used for the management of rainfed cultivation. Materials and Methods: Daily temperature and precipitation data of Tabriz station were collected from Iran Meteorological Organization for the years 1955 to 2013. In addition, barley yields data were collected for the years 1977 to 2013. In this study, the occurrence of phenological stages (germination, tillering, anthesis, ripening and harvesting) were estimated using growing degree days (GDD). The SPI value for 28 -week time scale of the first week after planting (SPI 28) was considered as an indicator of the moisture supply during growing season. SPI 28 values less than zero and greater than zero representing different classes of drought and humidity respectively. For correlation analysis, 128 weekly variables were defined at different time scales of daily <b>precipitation</b> data (<b>Table</b> 2). The relationship between the crop yield and precipitation variables were analyzed by linear correlation. Results and Discussion: The correlation coefficient (r) between precipitation and annual rainfed barley yield were presented in Table 2. The highest correlation between yield and precipitation occurred during the 10 -week period between 25 February and 6 May, which was mostly observed at the end of April to mid-May that was coincide with the beginning of anthesis. So it can be concluded that the anthesis stage was the most critical stage to water stress in barley.

Data on sap flow, measured by heat pulse, or compensation technique, were compared between two contrasting sites (referred to as sites A and B), characterised by clear differences in the salinity levels of the water table. Site A, located near the karstic Uccellina hills was characterised by more favourable hydrologic conditions as it was likely receiving lateral rainfall drainage from the hills. Water electrical conductivity (EC) values at the upper {{surface of the water}} table of this site were lower than 12 dS/m. By contrast, the more typical site B, located further away from the hills, did not benefit from lateral water movement in the soil and showed values of EC of about 17 – 20 dS/m, half the value of seawater. This amounted to a difference in soil osmotic potential of about 0. 4 – 0. 5 MPa across sites. Despite this difference in salinity, measurements of needle water potential during September 2000 did not differ across sites (average of about − 1. 5 and − 2. 4 for pre-dawn and midday water potentials, respectively). In contrast to water potentials, the dynamics of sap flow clearly differed across sites.

40|$|Peatlands store {{large amounts}} of organic carbon, but the carbon stock is {{sensitive}} to changes in <b>precipitation</b> or water <b>table</b> manipulations. Restoration of drained peatlands by drain blocking and flooding is a common measure to conserve and augment the carbon stock of peatland soils. Here, we report to what extent flooding affected the contribution of heterotrophic and rhizosphere respiration to soil CO 2 efflux in a grass-dominated mountain fen in Germany. Soil CO 2 efflux was measured in three un-manipulated control plots and three flooded plots in two consecutive years. Flooding was achieved by permanent irrigation during the growing seasons. Radiocarbon signatures of CO 2 from different sources including soil CO 2 efflux, incubated peat cores and live grass roots were repeatedly analyzed for partitioning of soil CO 2 efflux. Additionally, heterotrophic respiration and its radiocarbon signature were determined by eliminating rhizosphere respiration in trenched subplots (only control). In the control plots, rhizosphere respiration determined by 14 C signatures contributed between 47 and 61 % during the growing season, but was small (4 ± 8 %) immediately before budding. Trenching revealed a smaller rhizosphere contribution of 33 ± 8 % (2009) and 22 ± 9 % (2010) during growing seasons. Flooding reduced annual soil CO 2 efflux of the fen by 42 % in 2009 and by 30 % in 2010. The reduction was smaller in 2010 mainly through naturally elevated water level in the control plots. A one-week interruption of irrigation caused a strong short-lived increase in soil CO 2 efflux, demonstrating {{the sensitivity of the}} fen to water table drawdown near the peat surface. The reduction in soil CO 2 efflux in the flooded plots diminished the relative proportion of rhizosphere respiration from 56 to 46 %, suggesting that rhizosphere respiration was slightly more sensitive to flooding than heterotrophic respiration...|$|R

The objectives were to measure concentration attenuation and mass reduction of potential pollutants in the wastewater as the result of overland flow, and to examine the influences of experimental variables on the effectiveness of the overland flow wastewater treatment process. Controlled variables included application rate and frequency, and grass species. Seasonal differences in temperature, precipitation, and related physical, chemical and biological conditions were uncontrolled variables. Wastewater and soil horizons were sampled and analyzed at selected plot intervals, and plot runoff volume, air temperature, <b>precipitation,</b> and water <b>table</b> data were recorded. Applied wastewater amounts ranged from 2. 0 to 10. 8 inches (5, 1 to 27. 4 cm) per week. Attenuation occurred for oxygen-demanding materials, ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus, total solids, turbidity, salinity, conductivity and fecal coliform bacteria during both cool-wet and warm-dry climatic periods. The concentration of most measured parameters changed linearly with distance of overland flow. Dilution by emerging groundwater (composed partially of wastewater subsequent to plot surface and subsurface treatment) was a major cause for concentration attenuation. Averaged mass reductions of COD, PO₄, and inorganic nitrogen were 47, 40,and 38 percent, respectively, during high application rates, and 72, 78 and 75 percent, respectively, during low application rates. Extractable soil phosphorus, potassium and ammonium concentrations increased greatly during the 13 -month investigative period whereas extractable calcium, magnesium and sodium concentrations increased slightly.

This disables classical validation methodology which consists in comparison with aggregated Eddy correlation data. This study propose a simultaneous analysis of energy and water budget at hourly and daily scale to improve estimation of turbulent fluxes at scintillometer scale over a very heterogeneous area. Within {{the framework of the}} "AMMA-CATCH" program, a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) has been installed in a small catchment (12 km 2), located in the north Benin, a region exposed to soudano-sahelian climate. The site is instrumented with several ground stations to monitor the vadose zone, water <b>table,</b> <b>precipitations</b> and river discharge. Two case studies will be presented. The first one covers the end of the dry season. During this period two isolated rainfalls occurred which give a unique opportunity to study energy and water budgets simultaneously. The second one deals with the rainy season and offers to characterize evapotranspiration when vegetation suffers no water shortage. First, a methodology is proposed to aggregate surface parameters z 0 and d, which are used to compute sensible heat flux from LAS data. Sensible heat fluxes from LAS and EC data are then compared. This shows a relatively good agreement where the scattering is mainly attributed to footprint variability. A relevant hourly residual latent heat flux is then obtained through the energy balance equation with careful attention brought to the aggregated net radiation and ground heat fluxes. The residual of the energy budget equation is then compared to soil water losses from vadose zone and water table in order to evaluate whether this estimation is consistent with the water budget of the ground. For the dry season period, the dynamic of ground water losses and evapotranspiration are well correlated. During the wet season we find a constant evaporative fraction which is relevant when vegetation runs into good transpiration conditions. Finally, this study shows how combined energy and water budget analysis can help to better understand water transfers at watershed scale...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and methane (CH 4), {{the two most}} {{important}} greenhouse gases (GHG), are able to trap a large amount of long-wave radiation, leading to surface warming. Terrestrial ecosystems {{play an important role in}} determining the amount of these gases into the atmosphere. The northern high latitudes are particularly sensitive to climate warming and crucial to the budget of these carbon-based GHGs because the region is rich in soil organic carbon while it has experienced more dramatic environmental changes compared to low latitudes. It has been an important research focus to identify the source/sink and controlling mechanisms of both CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes between high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. In this dissertation, I apply modeling approaches to quantify ecosystem carbon budgets and analyze how these two GHGs respond to contemporary and future climate change. ^ I first use an artificial neural network approach to quantify CH 4 emissions from wetland ecosystems in the northern high latitudes based on field observations of CH 4 fluxes (Chapter 2). The estimated wetland CH 4 emissions show a large spatial variability over the northern high latitudes, as well as significant inter-annual and seasonal variations in the past two decades. Among six explanatory variables (air temperature, <b>precipitation,</b> water <b>table</b> depth, soil organic carbon, soil porosity and pH), water table depth (WTD) stands out as the most important control of wetland CH 4 flux density (emissions per unit wetland area). To improve future assessment of wetland CH 4 dynamics, research priorities should be directed to better characterizing hydrological processes of wetlands, including temporal dynamics of WTD and spatial dynamics of wetland extent. ^ To assess the effects of spatial heterogeneity of WTD on large-scale land-atmospheric CH 4 fluxes, I apply a coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry model to compare regional CH 4 fluxes simulated at two various spatial resolutions (Chapter 3). The effects of sub-grid spatial variability of WTD on CH 4 emissions are examined with a TOPMODEL-based parameterization scheme. The comparison indicates that both the magnitude and temporal variability of CH 4 emissions are different at two various spatial resolutions, and CH 4 fluxes are better simulated at a finer spatial resolution. This study suggests that previous macro-scale biogeochemical models using a grid-cell-mean WTD scheme might have underestimated the regional CH 4 emissions, and the spatial scale-dependent effects of WTD should be considered in future quantification of regional CH 4 emissions. ^ To evaluate regional carbon budgets of both CH 4 and CO 2 and their respective impacts on climate radiative forcing, I further develop a coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry model framework to simultaneously simulate both CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes at daily time step, by explicitly considering the spatial heterogeneity of WTD and the effects of permafrost thawing (Chapter 4). The pan-Arctic is estimated to be a sink of CO 2 and a source of CH 4 under contemporary climate conditions, and the magnitudes of both CO 2 uptakes and CH 4 emissions are projected to increase over this century under a no-policy climate change scenario (assuming no explicit climate policy). This study indicates that permafrost thawing with climate warming significantly affects soil carbon decomposition, and the CH 4 emissions continuously play an important role in affecting regional radiative forcing in the pan-Arctic. ...|$|R
40|$|High soil phopshorus {{contents}} {{in agricultural}} soils in the Netherlands cause excessive losses of P to surface waters. The reductions in P application {{rates in the}} present manure policy are not sufficient to reach surface water quality standards resulting from the European Water Framework Directive in all catchments by 2015. Accordingly, additional measures {{have to be considered}} to further reduce P loading to surface water. For a cost effective implementation of these measures an instrument to identify critical source areas for phosphorus leaching is indispensable. In the Netherlands phosphorus leaching at a national scale is simulated with a comprehensive mechanistic simulation model (STONE, Wolf et al., 2005) focusing on changes in P leaching with time. The identification of critical source areas requires simulations at a high spatial resolution. STONE is less suitable for this purpose, because of the large number of input parameters required by this complex model. For this reason, a simple model (PLEASE: Phosphorus LEAching from Soils to the Environment; Schoumans et al., in prep.) has been developed based on the same mechanistic process description for inorganic P as the complex model STONE and a simplified description of the lateral flow of water from soil to surface waters. With this model P leaching to surface waters can be calculated using readily available information of field characteristics like depth of the groundwater <b>table,</b> <b>precipitation</b> surplus and P status and phosphorus adsorption capacity of the soil. To evaluate the performance of the model, it was applied to the Netherlands using the same input as the national model. Parameterised in this way, PLEASE is a metamodel of STONE. The model was also tested on two small catchments: a catchment with sandy soils and high P accumulation and a clay catchment with a moderate P accumulation. The application at the national scale showed that the overall order of magnitude of the calculated leaching fluxes was quite comparable with results of the complex model. However, for individual fields, differences between the two models are sometimes considerable due to differences in the distribution of the lateral water fluxes with depth. The application at the catchment scale showed a good agreement between measured and simulated year average discharge of water and phosphorus. The simulated maps of P leaching for the two catchments appeared to be plausible with highest P leaching fluxes in intensively used agricultural fields in wet areas close to brooks and rivers.

40|$|Chapter 1 The Ebro basin is {{situated}} in north-eastern Spain and forms a geographic unit bounded by high mountains. The Bardenas area lies in the Ebro basin and forms part of the Bardenas Alto - Aragón irrigation scheme, {{which was designed to}} make use of the surface water resources from the Pyrenees. Chapter 2 The Ebro basin is a tertiary sedimentation basin in which the Ebro river and its main tributaries have incised alluvial valleys. The tertiary sediments consist mainly of mudstone, locally with interbedded gypsum layers, and very fine siltstone. Both sedimentary rocks are fine textured and, because they were deposited in a brackish lacustrine environment, contain harmful soluble salts. The main landscape-forming processes were erosion, transport, and deposition under semi-arid climatic conditions. The highest parts of the landscape consist of old tertiary formations which form the uplands of a dissected plain. At a lower level mesas occur, which consist of coarse alluvium covering the underlying tertiary sediments. Most of the eroded sediments were removed from the area but local sedimentation also occurred. Owing to the semi-arid conditions, both sediments and salts were deposited. The highest salt concentrations are found in the lowest parts of the alluvial formations, especially where the alluvium was derived from the eroded mudstone and siltstone. Between the residual uplands and the low-lying alluvial formations, piedmont and colluvial slopes occur. Within the Bardenas area ten major physiographic units were defined, each of them subdivided into minor components and indicated on the soil map. The Ebro basin is the driest part of northern Spain. The climate is semi-arid and becomes drier from the borders to the centre of the depression. The seasonal variation in temperature is great. Potential evapotranspiration exceeds total precipitation, which is extremely variable and is not concentrated in distinct rainy seasons. Wind velocity is high and both cold and warm dry winds are common. Evaporation thus occurs even in winter when temperatures are low. A great part of the area is cultivated, so that natural vegetation is restricted to residual and eroded soils not used for agriculture and to salt-affected soils where halophytes grow. Irrigated farming is influenced by soil conditions. Salt-free soils are under full irrigation, the main crops being maize, lucerne, sugar beet, and some horticultural crops. The cropping pattern on the saline soils depends on the degree of salinity. Barley and sugar beet are grown on moderately saline soils and lucerne on succesfully leached soils. On the higher lands, not under the command of the irrigation scheme, barley is grown. Chapter 3 The study area comprises two drainage basins. The northern part drains to the Aragón river, the southern part to the Riguel river, which is a tributary of the Arba river. Drainage and salinity of the groundwater depend on the situation of each geomorphological unit and its relation to adjacent units. The groundwater in the fluvio-colluvial formations of the northern basin is shallow and highly saline. An ephemeral perched water table is found in the mesas, where the groundwater is non-saline. No shallow water table was found in other physiographic units. The irrigation water is of good quality as its EC is at the lower end of the C 2 -range. The SAR is also in the lowest range S 1 and the RSC is zero, so there is no danger of alkalinization. Chapter 4 The physiographic approach was used to prepare the soil map. Each mapping unit is a broad association of soils having similar salinity hazards and possibilities of reclamation. Five main soil associations were distinguished:a) The residual soils of the siltstone outcrops, which have only a thin surface horizon overlying the hard siltstone. b) The soils of the mesas, which consist of a reddish loamy surface horizon overlying semi-consolidated coarse alluvium rich in calcium- carbonate but free of other salts. This in turn overlies the impervious mudstone. Texture and depth of the soil profile vary. Where moderately deep soils occur. a prosperous irrigated agriculture flourishes. c) The soils of the piedmont and colluvial slopes were developed from a mixture of fine colluvium. and material from the underlying tertiary sediments. They are generally deep and fine textured and have an intrinsic, though variable, salinity, increasing with depth. Because of the low permeability and the salinity of the subsoil, the most suitable irrigation method is sprinkling. d) The non-saline soils of the alluvial valleys of the main rivers. Soil conditions vary greatly, but the older terrace soils are usually shallower and less suitable for irrigation than the youngest deeper (alluvial) soils. In general, prosperous irrigated agriculture exists on these soils. e) The saline alluvial and fluvio-colluvial soils of valleys and fans, whose parent material was derived from denudation of the tertiary sediments. Soil conditions and the degree of salinity vary in each mapping unit, and consequently the possibilities of reclamation vary as well. Chapter 5 The source of the salts is the intrinsic salinity of the parent materials and the secondary salinization in water-receiving areas that lack natural drainage. Under irrigation the mobilization and redistribution of salts continues and salinity increases. The saline soils of the area are mainly affected by sodium chloride, a component dominant in all samples. In addition, calcium and magnesium sulphates are found in the northern basin, while in the southern part, calcium and magnesium chlorides predominate over the sulphates. The SAR increases with the rise of EC. Soil alkalinity can therefore be regarded as a reflection of soil salinity since highly saline soils are sodic as well. Non-saline alkali soils were not found and pH-values greater than 8. 5 do not occur. The results of crop tolerance field tests correspond well with the generally accepted levels for salt tolerance. The continued use of the slightly saline soils can be ensured by maintaining the present drainage system of open ditches and interceptor drains, and by keeping the soils under full irrigation. The normal percolation losses associated with basin irrigation will be sufficient to leach the salts from the rootzone. Sprinkler irrigation is suitable for the soils of the slopes, since no levelling is needed and the small water applications reduce the seepage of saline water. The only drainage system required is an interceptor drain between the slope and the adjacent valley. Chapter 6 The saline alluvial soils require reclamation. For this purpose, they must be provided with a drainage system, followed by initial leaching to reduce their salt content. Because there was no local experience with such drainage and desalinization processes, it was decided to conduct an experimental reclamation. Two experimental fields were subsequently selected. The Alera field represents the poorly drained soils of the fluvio-colluvial formations of the northern basin. These are silty-clay soils whose porosity and permeability decrease with depth. Below a depth of 1. 5 m the soil becomes almost impermeable. Salinity increases with depth, reaching values of between 20 and 35 mmhos/cm in the almost impermeable layer. Soil salinity in the surface layer varies. The Valareña field represents the saline soils of alluvial valleys and fans in the southern drainage basin. These are silty clay loam soils showing a marked stratification. At a depth of 2. 5 m, coarse alluvium saturated with very saline groundwater occurs overlying impervious mudstone. Because of stratification, the hydraulic conductivity is highly anisotropic. Soil salinity is more uniformly distributed than in the Alera soils. The reclamation process consisted of the following phases:a) Theoretical design of the drainage system based on hydrological soil properties measured by conventional field methods and on assumed drainage criteria. b) Implementation of the drainage system in the experimental fields. c) Collection of field data, followed by determination of the actual hydrological soil properties and of the drainage criteria. d) Design of the definitive drainage system which will form the basis of recommendations for the reclamation of saline soils with similar conditions. Chapter 7 After a detailed hydropedological survey, a drain spacing of 20 m at a depth of 1. 5 m was calculated for both the Alera and the Valareña drainage systems. Both fields were subsoiled to a depth of 50 cm to improve their low infiltration rates. Piezometers were installed to monitor the water <b>table.</b> <b>Precipitation</b> was measured, as were the amounts of irrigation and drainage water. Soil samples were taken at fixed sites to determine the salinity during the leaching process. Chapter 8 At the Valareña field, water flowed directly into the drain trench through the upper layer of soil, in which the stratification had been disrupted by levelling and subsoiling. Below this layer, there was no percolation of water and therefore no desalinization. These soils cannot be leached merely by the provision of a drainage system but also require deep subsoiling. At the Alera field, unsteady groundwater flow prevailed. At the end of tail recession, flow conditions approached those of steady flow. The discharge/hydraulic head relation had a parabolic shape showing that flow was restricted to the soil above drain level because the drains had been placed just above the impervious layer. The Boussinesq theory was very suitable to study the drainage of the Alera field. At the end of tail recession, if the term for flow below drain level was disregarded, the Hooghoudt equation could be applied. Drainable pore space was determined from the fall of the water table and the amount of drainage water during periods of low evapotranspiration. An average value of 4 per cent was found. The hydraulic conductivity was|$|R
