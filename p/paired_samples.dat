40|$|Motivation: Recent {{technology}} platforms in proteomics and genomics produce count {{data for}} quantitative analysis. Previous works on statistical significance analysis for count data have mainly {{focused on the}} independent sample setting, which does not cover the case where pairs of measurements are taken from individual patients before and after treatment. This experimental setting requires <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> testing such as the paired t-test often used for continuous measurements. A state-of-the-art method uses a negative binomial distribution in a generalized linear model framework for <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> testing. A <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> design assumes that the relative change within each pair is constant across biological samples. This model {{can be used as}} an approximation to the true model in cases of heterogeneity of response in complex biological systems. We aim to specify the variation in response explicitly in combination with the inherent technical variation. Results: We formulate the problem of <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> test for count data in a framework of statistical combination of multiple contingency tables. In particular, we specify explicitly a random distribution for the effect with an inverted beta model. The technical variation can be modeled by either a standard Poisson distribution or an exponentiated Poisson distribution, depending on the reproducibility of the acquisition workflow. The new statistical test is evaluated on both proteomics and genomics datasets, showing a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art method in general, and in several cases where the two methods differ, the proposed test returns more reasonable p-values...|$|R

5000|$|Notions {{of central}} {{tendency}} are often applicable at the item level - that is responses often show a quasi-normal distribution. The validity of such measures {{depends on the}} underlying interval nature of the scale. If interval nature is assumed for a comparison of two groups, parametric analyses such as the independent samples t-test and the <b>paired</b> <b>samples</b> t-test are not inappropriate. If non-parametric tests are to be performed the Pratt (1959) [...] modification to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is recommended over the standard Wilcoxon signed-rank test.|$|E
5000|$|Zika virus can be {{identified}} by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in acutely ill patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. When evaluating <b>paired</b> <b>samples,</b> Zika virus was detected more frequently in saliva than serum. [...] Urine samples can be collected and tested up to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, as the virus has been seen to survive longer in the urine than either saliva or serum. The longest period of detectable virus has been 11 days and Zika virus {{does not appear to}} establish latency.|$|E
50|$|The {{estimation}} of SMCV relies on how samples are obtained in a study. When {{the groups are}} correlated, it is usually difficult to estimate the covariance among groups. In such a case, a good strategy is to obtain matched or <b>paired</b> <b>samples</b> (or subjects) and to conduct contrast analysis based on the matched samples. A simple example of matched contrast analysis is the analysis of paired difference of drug effects after and before taking a drug in the same patients. By contrast, another strategy is to not match or pair the samples and to conduct contrast analysis based on the unmatched or unpaired samples. A simple example of unmatched contrast analysis is the comparison of efficacy between a new drug taken by some patients and a standard drug taken by other patients. Methods of estimation for SMCV and c+-probability in matched contrast analysis may differ from those used in unmatched contrast analysis.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Loss of {{heterozygosity}} (LOH) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important mechanisms in the tumor evolution. LOH can be detected from the genotypes of the tumor samples with or without <b>paired</b> normal <b>samples.</b> In <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> cases, LOH detection for informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is straightforward if there is no genotyping error. But genotyping errors are always unavoidable, and there are about 70 % non-informative SNPs whose LOH status can only be inferred from the neighboring informative SNPs...|$|R

Using simulation, deviations from robustness of the <b>paired</b> <b>samples</b> t-test is demonstrated, and is contrasted with Yuen’s <b>paired</b> <b>samples</b> t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test...|$|E

Here we catalogue the microbial communities in human gut mucosae at different stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. We analyse the gut mucosal microbiome of 47 <b>paired</b> <b>samples</b> of adenoma and adenoma-adjacent mucosae, 52 <b>paired</b> <b>samples</b> of carcinoma and carcinoma-adjacent mucosae and 61 healthy controls. Probabilistic partitioning of relative abundance profiles reveals that a metacommunity predominated by members of the oral microbiome is primarily associated with CRC. Analysis of <b>paired</b> <b>samples</b> shows differences in community configurations between lesions and the adjacent mucosae. Correlations of bacterial taxa indicate early signs of dysbiosis in adenoma, and co-exclusive relationships are subsequently more common in cancer. We validate these alterations in CRC-associated microbiome by comparison with two previously published data sets. Our results suggest that a taxonomicall...|$|E

40|$|The {{sign and}} the signed-rank tests for {{univariate}} data {{are perhaps the}} most popular nonparametric competitors of the t test for <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> problems. These tests have been extended in various ways for multivariate data in finite dimensional spaces. These extensions include tests based on spatial signs and signed ranks, which have been studied extensively by Hannu Oja and his coauthors. They showed that these tests are asymptotically more powerful than Hotelling's $T^{ 2 }$ test under several heavy tailed distributions. In this paper, we consider <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> tests for data in infinite dimensional spaces based on notions of spatial sign and spatial signed rank in such spaces. We derive their asymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis and under sequences of shrinking location shift alternatives. We compare these tests with some mean based tests for infinite dimensional <b>paired</b> <b>sample</b> data. We show that for shrinking location shift alternatives, the proposed tests are asymptotically more powerful than the mean based tests for some heavy tailed distributions and even for some Gaussian distributions in infinite dimensional spaces. We also investigate the performance of different tests using some simulated data. Comment: 21 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
