2500|$|The film {{switches}} to [...] "2 Metaphor". At the Nyon lakefront Davidson {{is sitting on}} a bench looking through a book of Nicolas de Staël reproductions when Marie and her boyfriend arrive to say goodbye before they go to the United States. Ivitch arrives, dressed like Davidson in matching trench coat and hat. While the two discuss the tyranny of images, the German speaking man arrives and the scene plays out as before: he accosts Ivitch, fires his gun, and leaves. As before, a man approaches the shaken woman. This time it is the man that is offscreen and the woman who is onscreen (Ivitch behind metal bars – an image frequently used in promotion of the film). The man, Marcus, <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the bars and declares, [...] "I am at your service." ...|$|E
2500|$|J.T., {{wounded and}} lying beside his dying brother, stays behind to {{detonate}} explosives {{to eliminate the}} remaining zombies while the others flee. The survivors make plans to escape by stealing helicopters but must fight past the remaining zombies. Abby dies, along with hope for a cure, when a ballistic projectile blows his head up. The survivors use the blade tips of their helicopter to kill the rest. However, while saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. In the epilogue, Cherry, now sporting a minigun leg, leads the group and many more survivors to the Caribbean beach at Tulum, where they start a peaceful new society during a world-wide zombie outbreak. It is also revealed that Cherry has given birth to El Wray's daughter (alluded to earlier during El Wray's final scene when he <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her stomach and restates his motto [...] "I never miss").|$|E
6000|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Winces slightly.] Really? [Goes {{over and}} <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> GERALD'S shoulder.] You have missed {{not having a}} father, I suppose, Gerald? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a backing-bell rope, 'is {{to sound}} the fire-alarm; this,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a go-ahead bell, 'is to call the texas-tender; this one,' {{indicating}} the whistle-lever, 'is to call the captain'--and so he went on, touching one object after another, and reeling off his tranquil spool of lies.|$|R
60|$|Allerton's {{face lit}} up with amusement. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Dick's shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Parsons at last {{got up and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Jamie's shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN {{walks up}} and down the room with a troubled expression. Then comes over to his wife, and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her shoulder.] ...|$|E
60|$|Quite. [There is a pause. ARTHUR {{gets up and}} <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her shoulder.] I don't think there's {{anything}} more to say. If you will forgive me I will {{get back to the}} office.|$|E
6000|$|SERGIUS. Invaluable man! Come along! (Towering over Bluntschli, he <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulder}} and takes him to the steps, Petkoff following. As Bluntschli puts {{his foot on the}} first step, Raina comes out of the house.) ...|$|E
60|$|Elsie stooped {{and kissed}} his cheek and he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> hers.|$|R
60|$|Jackson {{brought his}} chair-legs down again, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the planchette.|$|R
60|$|Mr Clinton turned {{towards her}} and again <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "’Speak kind to ’im, sir,’ ses the fireman. ’I’ll {{have a try}} if you don’t mind.’ He {{cleared his}} throat first, an’ then {{he walks over to}} Joe and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulder}} an’ ses very soft an’ pitiful like: ...|$|E
60|$|CURTIS--You bet she has. [He {{goes over}} and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his wife's {{shoulder}} affectionately.] Martha's {{more efficient than}} a whole staff of assistants and secretaries. She knows more about what I'm doing than I do half the time. [He turns toward his study.] Well, I guess I'll go in and work some.|$|E
6000|$|... [He {{drops the}} box, and rushes on {{her with a}} snarl. She slips [...] back past the bed. He follows; a chair is overturned. The [...] door is opened; Snow comes in, a detective in plain clothes and [...] bowler hat, with clipped moustaches. JONES drops his arms, [...] MRS. JONES stands by the window gasping; SNOW, {{advancing}} [...] swiftly to the table, <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the silver box.] ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> hers, within <b>his</b> arm, {{and gave}} it a squeeze.|$|R
60|$|Andrew <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Dick's {{shoulders}} {{and held him}} off at arm's length.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{responded to}} this dialectical inquiry affirmatively by <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> revolver.|$|R
6000|$|CZAR. What did you say, boy? tyranny! tyranny! Am I a tyrant? I'm not. I {{love the}} people. I'm their father. I'm called so in every {{official}} proclamation. Have a care, boy; have a care. You don't {{seem to be}} cured yet of your foolish tongue. (Goes over to PRINCE PAUL, and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder.) Prince Paul, tell me were there many people there this morning to see the Nihilists hung? ...|$|E
60|$|FRANK [quite softened, {{and looking}} at Praed with romantic admiration] Of course. I forgot. Ever so thanks for {{reminding}} me. Perfect gentleman, Praddy. Always were. My ideal through life. [He rises to go, but pauses a moment between the two older men, and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Praed's shoulder]. Ah, if you had only been my father instead of this unworthy old man! [He puts his other hand on his father's shoulder].|$|E
6000|$|... '"Amen!" [...] says Lundie. Then? Oh, then we sorter {{walked back}} two an' two to Flora's Temple an' lit matches to see we hadn't left {{anything}} behind. Walen, he had confiscated the note-books before they left. There {{was the first}} man's pistol which we'd forgot to return him, lyin' on the stone bench. Mankeltow <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> it--he never touched the trigger--an', bein' an automatic, of course the blame thing jarred off--spiteful as a rattler! ...|$|E
60|$|Whitney {{waited until}} he came up, and then <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|Wilson {{would have}} replied angrily, but Captain Doolan <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Then he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her, and {{immediately}} she {{straightened up and}} praised God.|$|R
6000|$|So Mr. Tulkinghorn, {{putting on}} his spectacles, sits down and writes the undertaking, which he slowly reads and {{explains}} to Bagnet, who has all this time been {{staring at the ceiling}} and who <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his bald head again, under this new verbal shower-bath, and seems exceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express his sentiments. The trooper then takes from his breast-pocket a folded paper, which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer's elbow. [...] "'Tis only a letter of instructions, sir. The last I ever had from him." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{inhabitants}} of this camp are particularly vicious, and stoned two parties of our pilgrims {{a day or}} two ago who brought about the difficulty by showing their revolvers when they did not intend to use them--a thing which is deemed bad judgment in the Far West, and ought certainly to be so considered any where. In the new Territories, when a man <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a weapon, he knows that he must use it; he must use it instantly or expect to be shot down where he stands. Those pilgrims had been reading Grimes.|$|E
60|$|MORELL (without moving, and gravely, perceiving {{now that}} there is {{something}} serious the matter). I'm not going to leave it, my dear boy: I thought YOU were. (Eugene, baffled by his firm tone, turns his back on him, writhing with anger. Morell goes to him and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder strongly and kindly, disregarding his attempt to shake it off) Come: sit down quietly; and tell me what it is. And remember; we are friends, and need not fear that either of us will be anything but patient and kind to the other, whatever we may have to say.|$|E
60|$|He {{laughed and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my {{shoulder}} as he bade me good night.|$|R
60|$|The doctor came behind her, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{the back}} of her chair.|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} young Jolyon {{got up and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father's shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|Caesar, {{seeing that}} Rufio's temper threatens {{to get the}} worse of him, <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulder}} and brings him down the hall out of harm's way, Britannus accompanying them and posting himself on Caesar's right hand. This movement brings the three in a little group to the place occupied by Achillas, who moves haughtily away and joins Theodotus on the other side. Lucius Septimius goes out through the soldiers in the loggia. Pothinus, Theodotus and Achillas follow him with the courtiers, very mistrustful of the soldiers, who close up in their rear and go out after them, keeping them moving without much ceremony. The King is left in his chair, piteous, obstinate, with twitching face and fingers. During these movements Rufio maintains an energetic grumbling, as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At college, {{without any}} {{particular}} show, {{he was always}} in debt and difficulties. Take warning by him, dear youth! By him and by me, if you like. See me--me, F. Bayham, descended from the ancient kings that long the Tuscan sceptre swayed, dodge down a street {{to get out of}} sight of a boot-shop, and my colossal frame tremble if a chap <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my shoulder, as you did, Pendennis, the other day in the Strand, when I thought a straw might have knocked me down! I have had my errors, Clive. I know 'em. I'll take another pint of beer, if you please. Betsy, has Mrs. Nokes any cold meat in the bar? and an accustomed pickle? Ha! Give her my compliments, and say F. B. is hungry. I resume my tale. Faults F. B. has, and knows it. Humbug he may have been sometimes; but I'm not such a complete humbug as Honeyman." ...|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (turning to Craven and {{preparing}} {{to read the}} letter). Now for Julia. (The Colonel turns away to hide his face from Charteris, anticipating a shock, and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a chair to steady himself.) [...] "My dearest boy. Nothing will make me believe that this odious woman can take my place in your heart. I send some of the letters you wrote me when we first met; and I ask you to read them. They will recall what you felt when you wrote them. You cannot have changed so much as to be indifferent to me: whoever may have struck your fancy for the moment, your heart is still mine"--and so on: you know the sort of thing--"Ever and always your loving Julia." [...] (The Colonel sinks on the chair and covers {{his face with his}} hand.) You don't suppose she's serious, do you: that's the sort of thing she writes me three times a day. (To Cuthbertson) Grace is in earnest though, confound it. (He holds out Grace's letter.) A blue card as usual! This time I shall not trust the waste paper basket. (He goes to the fire, and throws the letters into it.) ...|$|E
60|$|Mavering <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> friend's broad shoulder, {{and gave}} him a playful push.|$|R
60|$|He {{wondered}} why she said nothing. Did she understand? He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her arm.|$|R
60|$|And {{with quite}} {{unconscious}} dignity he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> breast, {{and looked at}} her.|$|R
