5|$|A {{review of}} {{evidence}} in 2005 suggested that PrP may have a normal function in maintenance of long-term memory. As well, a 2004 study found that mice lacking genes for normal cellular PrP protein show altered hippocampal long-term <b>potentiation.</b>|$|E
5|$|ApoER2 plays a {{critical}} role as a receptor in the reelin signalling pathway, which is important for brain development and postnatal function of the brain. This pathway specifically affects cortical migration and long-term <b>potentiation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} <b>potentiation</b> (LTP) is {{a persistent}} strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle of}} the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term <b>potentiation,</b> which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone {{is often}} {{consumed}} with alcohol. A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of mephedrone. It found that at low (non stimulant) doses alcohol significantly enhanced the psychostimulant effects of mephedrone. This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as haloperidol, but not ketanserin, was able to block the <b>potentiation</b> by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of mephedrone were enhanced by a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term <b>potentiation</b> (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{theories}} of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not {{equipped with the}} neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings of learning in animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, {{at about the same}} time as the discovery of long-term <b>potentiation.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the {{long-term}} <b>potentiation</b> of synapses in cell culture seems {{to provide an}} elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning {{at the level of}} the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from in vitro studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the <b>potentiation</b> will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E
5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term <b>potentiation,</b> and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{involved}} in long-term <b>potentiation</b> e.g. calmodulin 1 and CAM kinase II alpha.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{depression}} (LTD) {{and long-term}} <b>potentiation</b> (LTP) are {{two forms of}} long-term plasticity, lasting minutes or more, that occur at excitatory synapses. NMDA-dependent LTD and LTP have been extensively researched, and are found to require the binding of glutamate, and glycine or D-serine for activation of NMDA receptors.|$|E
25|$|Plaa's primary area of {{research}} was hepatotoxicity, in which his successes where achieved primarily by the investigation of mechanistic toxicology. His primary contributions were {{in the areas of}} cholestasis and toxic <b>potentiation,</b> in particular <b>potentiation</b> by haloalkanes. Although the use of the isolated perfused liver was already well-known, having been first used in the early 19th century, Plaa was the first to use it for the study of hepatotoxicity. A long-time career goal for him was to elaborate methods to determine human hepatotoxicity (and particularly cholestasis-inducing abilities in drugs) from animal tests; although this endeavour was never a success, it led to a much improved understanding of the mechanisms of cholestasis. According to Plaa, much of his mechanisms- and protocols-oriented research was an effect of his original formation in criminalistics.|$|E
25|$|When {{used as a}} rehabilitative intervention, {{particularly}} for respiration and walking, intermittent hypoxia typically works by using long-term facilitation (LTF). LTF, which is synonymous to long-term <b>potentiation,</b> occurs when there are long-term increases in synaptic strength due to synaptic plasticity. In the case of intermittent hypoxia, these increases in synaptic strength result in increased motor output.|$|E
25|$|The gas is {{produced}} from cysteine by the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase. It {{acts as a}} relaxant of smooth muscle and as a vasodilator and is also active in the brain, where it increases {{the response of the}} NMDA receptor and facilitates long term <b>potentiation,</b> which is involved in the formation of memory.|$|E
25|$|Coma can be cyclic, {{with the}} {{individual}} alternating from a comatose state to a hyper-alert state of consciousness, which occurred in a 4-year-old boy who suffered an overdose of clonazepam. The combination of clonazepam and certain barbiturates, e.g. amobarbital, at prescribed doses {{has resulted in a}} synergistic <b>potentiation</b> of the effects of each drug, leading to serious respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{mutations}} in CACNA1H, two {{mutations in}} the gene encoding a GABAA receptor γ subunit are {{also associated with}} a CAE like phenotype that also overlaps with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus type-3. The first of these, R43Q, abolishes benzodiazepine <b>potentiation</b> of GABA induced currents. The second associated mutation, C588T has not been further characterized.|$|E
25|$|Taurine {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier {{and has been}} implicated in {{a wide array of}} {{physiological}} phenomena including inhibitory neurotransmission, long-term <b>potentiation</b> in the striatum/hippocampus, membrane stabilization, feedback inhibition of neutrophil/macrophage respiratory burst, adipose tissue regulation and possible prevention of obesity, calcium homeostasis, recovery from osmotic shock, protection against glutamate excitotoxicity and prevention of epileptic seizures.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{synaptic}} enhancement {{results from}} an increased probability of synaptic terminals releasing transmitters {{in response to}} pre-synaptic action potentials. Synapses will strengthen {{for a short time}} because of an increase in the amount of packaged transmitter released in response to each action potential. Depending on the time scales over which it acts synaptic enhancement is classified as neural facilitation, synaptic augmentation or post-tetanic <b>potentiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{model has}} seen {{acceptance}} in evolutionary biology. In 2015 paleontologist Douglas Erwin suggested a modification to a four-step model to better reflect a possible distinction between evolutionary novelty and evolutionary innovation, and {{to highlight the}} importance of environmental conditions: <b>potentiation,</b> generation of novel phenotypes (actualization), adaptive refinement, and exploitation (conversion of a novelty to an innovation as it becomes important for the ecological establishment of possessing organisms).|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{facilitation}} {{has been}} demonstrated to serve as both working memory and mapping input for readout, short-term depression for removing auto-correlation. Long-term <b>potentiation</b> is used for spatial memory storage while long-term depression for both encoding space features, selective weakening of synapses and clearing old memory traces respectively. Forward spike-timing-dependent plasticity is used for long range temporal correlation, temporal coding and spatiotemporal coding. The reversed spike-timing-dependent plasticity acts as sensory filtering.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of NMDA receptors {{varies according to}} the subregion of the hippocampus. NMDA receptors are required in the CA3 of the hippocampus when spatial information needs to be reorganized, while NMDA receptors in the CA1 are required in the acquisition and retrieval of memory after a delay, {{as well as in}} the formation of CA1 place fields. Blockade of the NMDA receptors prevents induction of long-term <b>potentiation</b> and impairs spatial learning.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Crupi, Pradhan and Tozer {{described}} a {{proof of concept}} design to create neural synaptic memory circuits using organic ion-based memristors. The synapse circuit demonstrated long-term <b>potentiation</b> for learning as well as inactivity based forgetting. Using a grid of circuits, a pattern of light was stored and later recalled. This mimics {{the behavior of the}} V1 neurons in the primary visual cortex that act as spatiotemporal filters that process visual signals such as edges and moving lines.|$|E
25|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} the most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease and {{is the most}} common form of dementia in the elderly. The disorder is characterized by progressive loss of memory and various cognitive functions. It is hypothesized that the deposition of amyloid-β peptide (40-42 amino acid residues) in the brain is integral in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulation is purported to block hippocampal long-term <b>potentiation.</b> It is also possible that a receptor for amyloid-β oligomers could be a prion protein.|$|E
25|$|U0126 is a MAPK inhibitor, it {{disrupts}} {{the synthesis of}} the proteins required to reconsolidate memory. Research has shown that administration of this drug in rats is correlated with a reduction in synaptic <b>potentiation</b> in the lateral amygdala. This means that the neurons in this area which are selective for a certain fear memory fire less easily {{in response to the}} memory when affected by the drug as compared to the ease with which they fire without the drug present.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its activity as a steroid hormone, progesterone is a neurosteroid. Specifically, it is an antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor, a negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and, via its active metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Through <b>potentiation</b> of the GABAA receptor, progesterone can produce sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, euphoric, cognitive-, memory-, and motor-impairing, anticonvulsant, and even anesthetic effects via formation of sufficiently high concentrations of its neurosteroid metabolites.|$|E
25|$|The Thy-1 {{knockout}} (KO) mice are {{viable and}} appear grossly normal. They display normal social interactions and normal learning in a maze, but fail {{to learn from}} social cues (e.g. learning from other mice which foods are safe to eat as compared to wild-type mice). This failure can be rescued by the transgenic expression of Thy-1 or pharmacologic treatment with a GABA (A) receptor antagonists. This suggests that Thy-1 KO mice have excessive GABAergic inhibition in the dentate gyrus and regional inhibition of long-term <b>potentiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Auxin induces shoot apical dominance; the {{axillary}} buds are inhibited by auxin, as a {{high concentration}} of auxin directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and <b>potentiation</b> of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.|$|E
25|$|Neural oscillations, in {{particular}} theta activity, are extensively linked to memory function. Theta rhythms {{are very strong}} in rodent hippocampi and entorhinal cortex during learning and memory retrieval, and they {{are believed to be}} vital to the induction of long-term <b>potentiation,</b> a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory. Coupling between theta and gamma activity is thought to be vital for memory functions, including episodic memory. Tight coordination of single-neuron spikes with local theta oscillations is linked to successful memory formation in humans, as more stereotyped spiking predicts better memory.|$|E
25|$|Long-lasting {{changes in}} the {{efficacy}} of synaptic connections (long-term <b>potentiation,</b> or LTP) between two neurons can involve the making and breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as activin ß-A, which encodes a subunit of activin A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The activin molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the F-actin cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spines are lengthened and the chance that they make synaptic contacts with the axonal terminals of the presynaptic cell is increased. The end result is long-term maintenance of LTP.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{previous}} mutation, a second group found a second mutation in GABRG2 associated with GEFS+. This mutation, R43Q, {{is located in the}} one of two benzodiazepine binding-sites located in the extracellular N-terminus. Benzodiazepines, such as Diazepam, potentiate GABA induced current. This <b>potentiation</b> is abolished in cells expressing the R43Q mutant subunit instead of the wild-type γ subunit. This mutation does not affect the subunit's ability to coassemble into function receptors as it still confers resistance to GABA current blockade by zinc. As {{with the previous}} mutation, this mutation is expected to result in neuronal hyperexcitability.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} in Shanghai had {{two types of}} hippocampal {{neuronal}} cultures: In one culture, the neuron was grown from a layer of astrocytes and the other culture was not in contact with any astrocytes, but they were instead fed a glial conditioned medium (GCM), which inhibits {{the rapid growth of}} cultured astrocytes in the brains of rats in most cases. In their results they were able to see that astrocytes had a direct role in Long-term <b>potentiation</b> with the mixed culture (which is the culture that was grown from a layer of astrocytes) but not in GCM cultures.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{researchers}} Saper and Stickgold {{point out}} that {{an essential part of}} memory and learning consists of nerve cell dendrites' sending of information to the cell body to be organized into new neuronal connections. This process demands that no external information is presented to these dendrites, and it is suggested that this may be why it is during sleep that memories and knowledge are solidified and organized. Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli have focused on the process of forgetting by pruning weaker connections during sleep, to select important memories and enable future memory encoding. They further suggest that synaptic <b>potentiation</b> drives Process S (homeostatic need for sleep).|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} {{typically}} affect the mesolimbic system, or more specifically, the reward pathway {{of the nervous}} system. Amongst the common drugs of abuse, nicotine {{is one of the}} strongest agonists at the nicotinic cholinergic synapse. Nicotine, competing with acetylcholine (ACh), acts through the nonsynaptic, preterminal, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) to initiate a membrane potential change and propagate an intracellular Ca2+ signal, thus encouraging the release of neurotransmitters. The specific and characteristic role of calcium current mediated nAChR activity has a different voltage-dependence than other Ca2+ permeable ion channels, as well as different temporal and spatial distribution and as a result, the nonsynaptic nAChR activity enhances the induction of synaptic <b>potentiation,</b> promoting the learning of substance dependence.|$|E
25|$|A {{neuroscience}} {{research programme}} that studies genes, {{the brain and}} behaviour in an integrated manner. It {{is engaged in a}} large-scale investigation of the function of molecules found at the synapse. This is mainly focused on proteins that interact with the NMDA receptor, a receptor for the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which is required for processes of synaptic plasticity such as long-term <b>potentiation</b> (LTP). Many of the techniques used are high-throughout in nature, and integrating the various data sources, along with guiding the experiments has raised numerous informatics questions. The program is primarily run by Professor Seth Grant at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, but there are many other teams of collaborators across the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Terje Lømo and Tim Bliss first {{described}} the now widely studied phenomenon of long-term <b>potentiation</b> (LTP) in a publication in the Journal of Physiology. The experiment described {{was conducted on}} the synapse between the perforant path and dentate gyrus in the hippocampi of anaesthetised rabbits. They were able to show a burst of tetanic (100Hz) stimulus on perforant path fibres led to a dramatic and long-lasting augmentation in the post-synaptic response of cells onto which these fibres synapse in the dentate gyrus. In the same year, the pair published very similar data recorded from awake rabbits. This discovery was of particular interest due to the proposed role of the hippocampus in certain forms of memory.|$|E
