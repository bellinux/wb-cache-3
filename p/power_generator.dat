5|$|Pumped-storage {{hydroelectricity}} stores {{energy in}} the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one.

5|$|In the 20th century, {{demand for}} {{electricity}} {{led to the}} consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> on 4 July 1904, at the same Larderello dry steam field where geothermal acid extraction began. It successfully lit four light bulbs. Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power plant was built there. It was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until New Zealand built a plant in 1958. In 2012, it produced some 594 megawatts.|$|E
5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E

5|$|Keith Baxter {{said that}} the film's soundtrack was post-dubbed months after filming was completed, and that actors Fernando Rey and Marina Vlady were dubbed by {{different}} actors because of their heavy accents. Baxter also stated that he, Welles and Michael Aldridge recorded voices for several characters in post-production. Mistress Quickly's speech after Falstaff's death, which was disrupted by the audible hum of a <b>power</b> <b>generator,</b> used the original version of the soundtrack because Welles liked Margaret Rutherford's performance enough to keep it. The score was composed by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, {{who had worked with}} Welles on Othello. The score was recorded in an Italian studio, which paid Lavagnino for his work on the film in exchange for the rights to the music, and later released a soundtrack album in Italy and the UK. During the editing, Welles showed a rough cut to the visiting head of the Cannes Film Festival, who immediately wanted to include the film in the festival, and Welles had to finish the editing more quickly than he preferred.|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, the {{hurricane}} brought sustained winds estimated between , with higher gusts. A minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.30inHg) was recorded, though a lower pressure {{may have occurred}} on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time. The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, littering insular streets with debris. As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported. Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss. An emergency backup <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting. Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds. Heavy rainfall associated with {{the hurricane}} flooded long stretches of roadway. Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall. At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action. Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000.|$|E
5|$|At around 2:50p.m., the B-10 rifles on {{the west}} bank managed to open a breach in the barbed wire {{surrounding}} the fort, and also destroyed other significant targets, such as the observation equipment. Meanwhile, combat engineers were breaching further openings using Bangalore torpedoes, under heavy small arms fire and hand grenades. The battalion's main assault force was crossing at the same time. The main assault force then funneled through the breaches and entered the Israeli trenches. The Israeli command in Northern Sinai kept receiving frantic calls for help from the fort's radio operator, and gunfire could also be heard. The Egyptians captured the southern sector of the fort by 3:05p.m.. Five minutes later, the assault force moved against the northern sector of the fort. Within fifteen minutes, the Egyptians were in control of the fort. The <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> inside the fort was destroyed, and all electricity and communication lines leading to the fort were severed. At 3:30p.m., Maj. Gen. Khaled was informed that Lahtzanit had been seized and that Israeli soldiers had been captured. The Israelis reported losing radio contact with the fort at around 4:00p.m.|$|E
30|$|Energy {{storage devices}} and <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> that supply <b>power</b> to {{wearable}} electronics need flexibility and biocompatibility. An all-solid-state supercapacitor (SC) [45, 49, 90, 91] is a suitable energy storage device {{with regard to}} this point. Moreover, SCs have a high power density, a fast charging/discharging speed, and cycle durability [92].

5|$|Ernesto transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as {{it entered}} {{southern}} Virginia, bringing heavy rainfall which peaked at 10.6inches (270mm) in Wakefield. The precipitation caused flash flooding, which closed several roads {{but did not}} cause serious damage. The interaction between Ernesto and a strong ridge over the western Atlantic produced a tight pressure gradient, resulting in strong winds across the state; wind gusts peaked at 87mph (141km/h) at a station {{near the mouth of}} the York River. Strong winds downed numerous trees, including in Gloucester where two people died after a tree hit their home. The winds caused widespread power outages; Dominion Virginia Power reported about 600,000customers as losing power some time during the storm. The storm produced a storm tide of 6.12feet (1.86m) near Virginia Beach; along the Chesapeake Bay, tidal flooding in combination with strong waves damaged boats and piers, and left a few homes flooded. Storm surge flooding also occurred along the Potomac River, with heavy beach erosion, light property damage, and flooded roadways reported in Alexandria. Across the state, the storm damaged or destroyed 609houses, with damage totaling at least $118million (2006USD). Seven people were killed in the state, of which two directly to the storm; three of the deaths were from traffic accidents, and one person died from carbon monoxide poisoning, due to operating a <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> inside after a power outage.|$|E
