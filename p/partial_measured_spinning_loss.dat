A cousin to graphene, two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides entwine interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and topology. The noninteracting electronic states have multiple valleys in the energy dispersion and are topologically nontrivial. We report on the possible superconducting states of hole-doped systems, and analyze to what extent the correlated phase inherits the topological aspects of the parent crystal. We find that local attractive interactions or proximal coupling to $s$-wave superconductors lead to a pairing which is an equal mixture of a spin singlet and the $m = 0 $ spin triplet. Its topology allows quasiparticle excitations of net nonzero Berry curvature via pair-breaking by circularly polarized light. The valley contrasting optical response, where oppositely circularly polarized light couples to different valleys, is present even in the superconducting state, though with smaller magnitude...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study σ-additive set {{functions}} defined on a hereditary subclass of a σ-algebra {{and taken}} {{values in the}} extended real line. Analogs of the Jordan decomposition theorem and the Radon-Nikodym theorem are obtained. Throughout this note, A stands for a σ-algebra of subsets of a set Ω, R denotes the extended real line R ∪ {−∞} ∪ {+∞}. By a measure on A we mean a σ-additive set function µ: A → R with µ(∅) = 0. Note that in fact a measure can take at most one of the values +∞, −∞. Definition. A set function µ: D(µ) → R defined on a nonvoid subclass D(µ) of a σ-algebra A is called a <b>partial</b> <b>measure</b> on A if for every B ∈ D(µ) the restriction µ|A∩B is a measure on the σ-algebra A ∩B = {A ∩B: A ∈ A}. A <b>partial</b> <b>measure</b> is called maximal if it has no proper extension to a <b>partial</b> <b>measure</b> on A. By making use of the Zorn lemma, {{it is easy to}} see that every <b>partial</b> <b>measure</b> can be extended to a maximal one. Example 1. Let µ 1, µ 2 be positive measures on a A. Then the formula (µ 1 −µ 2) (A) = µ 1 (A) −µ 2 (A) defines a <b>partial</b> <b>measure</b> µ 1 − µ 2. (D(µ 1 − µ 2) = {A ∈ A: µ 1 (A) − µ 2 (A) is well-posed}.) Example 2. Let (Ω, A, P) be a probability space, ξ: Ω → R be a random variable. Then the formula µξ(A) = ∫ ξ dP defines a maximal <b>partial</b> A <b>measure</b> µξ on A. (D(µξ) = {A ∈ A: ξ is quasiintegrable over A}.) For a <b>partial</b> <b>measure</b> µ on A, define two classes: F +(µ) = {F ∈ D(µ) : A ∋ A ⊂ F = ⇒ µ(A) ≥ 0 }, F − (µ) = {F ∈ D(µ) : A ∋ A ⊂ F =⇒ µ(A) ≤ 0 }...|$|R

40|$|Spin-resolved photoemission {{is one of}} {{the most}} direct ways of {{measuring}} the magnetization of a ferromagnet. If all valence band electrons contribute, the <b>measured</b> average <b>spin</b> polarization is proportional to the magnetization. This is even the case if electronic excitations are present, and thus is of particular interest for studying the response of the magnetization to a pump laser pulse. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of ultrafast spin-resolved photoemission using free electron laser (FEL) radiation and investigate the effect of space charge on the detected spin polarization. The sample is exposed to the radiation of the FEL FLASH in Hamburg.

In comparing our measured spin-voltage signal with the value predicted by theory, {{we followed the}} analysis of Tran et al, (Phys. Rev.

As they note in a recent erratum (arXiv: 0810. 4770 v 2), the correct expression for the spin resistance area product from the theory for a sample with a spin diffusion length LSD {{much less than the}} contact width or channel thickness (our experimental situation) is given by the product {gamma}^ 2 {rho} LSD, where {gamma} is the tunneling spin polarization, and {rho} is the resistivity of the semiconductor transport channel. With this correction, our <b>measured</b> <b>spin</b> voltages are much larger than those predicted by theory, rather than in good agreement as we stated.
