40|$|Abstract — With {{the milk}} quota {{announced}} to be abolished in the future, the dairy sector {{is going to}} face a significant policy regime shift. This paper sets out to analyze the impact of milk quotas on the dairy farm structure of two important milk <b>producing</b> <b>member</b> states: Germany and the Netherlands. Based on proper behavioral assumptions, non stationary Markov chain models are specified and estimated using a generalized cross entropy procedure, which takes into account both sample and prior information. Moreover four mobility indicators characterizing structural change are developed and calculated. Structural change in the dairy sector {{as measured by the}} mobility measures is faster in West Germany than in the Netherlands. However, in the transition region East Germany structural change outpaces that of the traditional German and Dutch dairy sectors by a factor two or more. The introduction of milk quotas as of April 1, 1984 reduced overall farm mobility for the Netherlands, but increased mobility in West Germany. However, in both cases the milk quotas lead to an increase in upward mobility...|$|E

40|$|Creation {{in tobacco}} {{production}} {{development and the}} total complex of activities related to it {{must be based on}} standards preferred by the EU and modern world achievements in that field. The preferred standards of future development pay increasing attention to the production itself, covering a variety of aspects, such as quantitative limitation qualitative suitability, environment protection, social security, economic effectiveness, healthy growth and development of plants, fulfillment of requirements of non - government organizations and WHO, etc. Qualitative limitation is expressed through decreasing of guarantee thresholds by tobacco varieties in member states of EU. Starting from 1999, 345. 508 tons of leaf tobacco were successively limited to 334, 064 tons in 2004, which is a reduction of 4 %. Guarantee thresholds are also determined by the EU for its new tobacco <b>producing</b> <b>member</b> states. The aim this paper is to emphasize some more important aspects of development policy of tobacco production in EU and in our country, and in the same time to initiate activities and targets for tobacco production in future...|$|E
