When {{the round}} {{end of a}} smaller wire (fig. 123.) was {{advanced}} towards the negative brush, it (becoming positive by induction) exhibited the quiet glow at 8 inches distance, the negative brush continuing. When nearer, the pitch of {{the sound of the}} negative brush rose, indicating quicker intermittences (1431.); still nearer, the positive end threw off ramifications and distinct brushes; at the same time, the negative brush contracted in its lateral directions and collected together, giving a peculiar narrow longish brush, in shape like a hair pencil, the two brushes existing at once, but very different in their form and appearance, and especially in the more rapid recurrence of the negative discharges than of the positive. On using a smaller <b>positive</b> <b>wire</b> for the same experiment, the glow first appeared on it, and then the brush, the negative brush being affected at the same time; and the two at one distance became exceedingly alike in appearance, and the sounds, I thought, were in unison; at all events they were in harmony, so that the intermissions of discharge were either isochronous, or a simple ratio existed between the intervals. With a higher action of the machine, the wires being retained unaltered, the negative surface became dark and silent, and a glow appeared on the positive one. A still higher action changed the latter into a spark. Finer positive wires gave other variations of these effects, the description of which I must not allow myself to go into here.|$|E

The discharge has been modeled in a prolate spheroidal coordinate system with the wire shape taken as a hyperboloid of revolution. Four simultaneous coupled, time-dependent, nonlinear partial differential equations describe the electrical discharge. These are the conservation equations for ion and electron densities, the energy equation for electron temperature, and Poisson’s equation for the self-consistent electric field. By solving this formulation subject to appropriate initial and boundary conditions, charged particle densities and temperature variations have been obtained as the ionization progresses in the discharge. The results show that both the electron temperature and the charged particle densities increase with the progress of ionization. The effect of different wire polarities is also examined. With a <b>positive</b> <b>wire</b> polarity, the increases in electron temperature and charged particle densities are confined to regions of the discharge {{in the vicinity of}} the wire tip.

Now, as the air is being charged both at the positive and negative surfaces, it seems a reasonable conclusion, that the charged portions meet somewhere in the interval, and there discharge to each other, without producing any luminous phenomena. It is possible, however, that the air electrified positively at the glowing end may travel on towards the negative surface, and actually form that atmosphere into which the visible negative brushes dart, in which case dark discharge need not, of necessity, occur.

40|$|Abstract—In double {{patterning}} lithography (DPL), overlay errors between two patterning {{steps of the}} same layer translate into CD variability. Since CD uniformity budget is very tight, meeting requirement of overlay control {{is one of the}} biggest challenges for deploying DPL. In this paper, we electrically evaluate overlay errors for back-end-of-line DPL with the goal of studying relative effects of different overlay sources and interactions of overlay control with design parameters. Exper-imental results show the following: 1) the expected electrical impact of overlay in a path is not significant (< 6 % worst-case RC variation) and should be the basis for determining overlay budget requirement; 2) the worst-case electrical impact of overlay in a single line remains a serious concern (up to 16. 6 % RC and up to 50 mV increase of peak crosstalk noise); 3) translational overlay error has the largest electrical impact compared to other overlay sources; and 4) overlay in y direction (x for horizontal metallization) has negligible electrical impact and, therefore, preferred routing direction should be taken into account for overlay sampling and alignment strategies. Design methods for reducing overlay electrical impact in wires are then identified. Finally, we explore positive/negative process options from an electrical perspective and conclude that positive process is preferred.

5000|$|One such {{source of}} ground noise is the {{isolated}} ground loop. The isolated ground loop {{differs from the}} ground loop in {{that there is no}} secondary connection to power supply ground or other non-signal ground. Instead two signal ground conductors (such as the outer conductor of stereo coaxial audio wire) are common at the amplifier input (by an internal connection in the multi-channel amplifier), they travel some distance whereupon they experience different induction currents and then are made common at some other secondary location (typically a multi-channel signal source device), as in stereo patch cords. The induction currents being different for each of the two outer coaxial conductors set up a current between the two which results in a difference in potential appearing at the negative input terminals at the amplifier, with respect to the positive input terminals. The problem is made worse by the increasing the length of the cables, and their proximity to devices radiating magnetic noise. One solution to this problem incorporates the use of a single ground conductor as a shield (see coax) and the use of multiple other separated internal conductors as <b>positive</b> signal <b>wires</b> inside a single shield conductor, allowing for several separate and distinct positive signals to all arrive at the amplifier input referenced to a single ground shield conductor. This method also insures that all the signal conductors and the single ground shield conductor (like coax) all experience similar induction of unwanted signals.

Methods: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with non-operable CTEPH underwent BPA for lesions in the segmental or sub-segmental vessels. Pre- and post-BPA pulmonary arterial pressures at proximal (Pp) and distal (Pd) to the stenosis were measured by a 0. 014 -in. pressure <b>wire.</b> <b>Positive</b> or negative RPI was evaluated by chest computed tomography in each re-perfused segment separately 4  h after BPA.

Among them, RPI was observed in 49 lesions (44. 5 %). In the RPI-positive lesions, post-BPA Pd and post-BPA Pd/Pp were higher compared with the RPI-negative lesions. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that the post-BPA Pd was independently associated with RPI incidence. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated the best cut-off value of 19. 5  mm Hg for post-BPA Pd to predict RPI. Conclusions: High reperfusion pressure after BPA could be a predictor of RPI. Monitoring local pressure during BPA procedure may have a potential to reduce the incidence of RPI...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} resistance to electrochemical corrosion of wire made of Cr-Ni stainless steel, designed for use in endourological treatment. The influence of strain formed in the process of drawing and methods of wire surface preparation to corrosive resistance in artificial urine solution were analysed. Design/methodology/approach: Wire corrosion tests were carried out in the solution of artificial urine {{with the use of the}} system for electrochemical tests VoltaLab®PGP 201. Resistance to electrochemical corrosion was evaluated on the ground of recorded curves of anodic polarization by means of potentiodynamic method. Mechanical properties of wire were tested by means of static uniaxial tension test. Findings: Potentiodynamic tests carried out in artificial urine enabled to determine how the resistance to pitting corrosion of wire changes, depending on strain formed in the drawing process as well as on the method of wire surface preparation. Deterioration of corrosive properties of wire along with the increase in the formed strain hardening was observed. Research limitations/implications: The obtained test results proved the suitability of the applied research methodology for evaluation of electrochemical corrosion resistance of wire made of stainless steel designed for use in endourology. Practical implications: Test results are of significant utilitarian value because they can determine the relation between pitting corrosion resistance and the volume of strain formed in the wire drawing process, and consequently their mechanical properties.
