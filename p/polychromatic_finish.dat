30|$|While {{the exact}} {{ages of the}} {{finishes}} are unknown, a similar technology was employed to decorate Achaemenid architecture in its principle Iranian cities. The variety of materials excavated by Herzfeld demonstrates the ability of Achaemenid artisans to work with multiple mediums to create a <b>polychromatic</b> <b>finish</b> including that of glazed tiles, earthen plaster tempered with gravel, earthen plaster tempered with organic matter, colored earths, pigmented paints and lime plasters. The layering of these materials can be seen and analyzed in cross-section although surface deterioration is often quite severe. The analysis of the compositional data on the architectural fragments inform their long-term preservation at the FSG {{as well as at}} the sites themselves.|$|E
40|$|Orvieto was a {{place of}} popes {{in the second half of}} the thirteenth century. Urban IV, Gregory X, Martin IV, Nicholas IV and Boniface VIII all held court there. The pope and his {{numerous}} entourage made what was essentially a modest hill top town of artisans and feudal nobility, a magnet for men of wealth and culture. Its Gothic cathedral, which still houses one of the most renowned eucharistic relics in Christendom, was conceived in this cosmopolitan atmosphere. Its façade iconography addressed both intellectuals and less educated members of the Orvietan populace. This thesis begins by examining the geographic and political environment which contributed to the realisation of one of Italy's great Gothic cathedrals. Comparisons between the architectural structure of the Cathedral in Orvieto and Roman basilicas are followed by an examination of its western façade in relation to possible iconographic sources deriving from a broader European context. The unusual technical combination of sculpted reliefs, their possible <b>polychromatic</b> <b>finish</b> and its combination with mosaic and bronze work on the façade is also object of discussion. A comprehensive reading of the medieval cathedral within its socio-political environment is encouraged. It was not a separate entity, but a functioning structure in constant rapport with its surroundings. In this light an analysis is performed of Orvieto's parish churches, convents and monasteries, the orders which administered them and the religious rituals which involved them. The presence of the Papal Court in Orvieto is reflected in the city's memory, primarily in the sophisticated architecture and decoration of its cathedral, but also in the works of art its members left behind them...|$|E
30|$|Analysis of the {{fragments}} was undertaken {{to document the}} materials and methods used to create the <b>polychromatic</b> <b>finishes.</b> Deterioration and friable paint layers made this work challenging. Comparison of Herzfeld’s excavation notes and photographs to the actual fragments shows that deterioration not only took place during burial and excavation, but is ongoing, as larger pieces continue to degrade and pigment particles are lost. Thus, documentation is imperative. Portable X-ray florescence (pXRF) {{was used as a}} non-destructive method to analyze the surface composition. Due to the deterioration of the surfaces and the inability to isolate paint layers, cross-sections were created using small samples of selected fragments, which were used to document the stratigraphies visually and with SEM/EDS.|$|R
40|$|Located near Tucson, Arizona, the Mission San José de Tumacácori is a Spanish-Colonial {{mission and}} the primary {{landmark}} of significance within the Tumacácori National Historical Park. Begun around 1800 and acquired by the National Park Service as a half-completed ruin in 1916, successive campaigns of repair have stabilized but also obscured much of the original surfaces of its once brilliantly painted church façade. There are comparatively very few mission structures {{that have not been}} repainted or replastered. Initial conservation methodologies at Tumacácori were experimental and would eventually give rise to the use of traditional building materials and methods. However in contrast, between the 1940 s and 1970 s, synthetic resins and non-traditional treatments were heavily employed. Tumacácori’s façade can thus be read as a document in itself - by studying the application of these methods in succession, one can gain a perspective of nearly a century’s worth of preservation thinking and insight into the development of architectural conservation in the United States. This particular investigation of the original <b>polychromatic</b> painted surface <b>finishes</b> of Tumacácori’s façade consisted of archival research, historic contextualization, comparative studies, in-situ investigation, and laboratory analysis – encompassing optical microscopy of the surface finish cross-sections and dispersed pigment layer particles, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, microchemical testing, and petrographic analysis of the stucco substrate. Ultimately, the analytical findings of this thesis research will be used as the basis for a pilot conservation treatment to preserve these rare and fragile finishes for the future...|$|R
