Materials and Methods: Two hundred freshly extracted human premolars were divided randomly into two groups based on <b>pre-etching</b> with 37 % orthophosphoric acid: Group 1 (control, n = 50) without <b>pre-etching</b> and Group 2 (experimental, n = 150) with <b>pre-etching.</b> Group 2 was further divided into three sub groups 2 a, 2 b, and 2 c with 50 teeth each and was first pre-etched with 37 % orthophosphoric acid for 10, 30, and 60 s, respectively. Brackets were bonded on the teeth in both the groups using SEP and light cure adhesive. The SBS were determined using universal testing machine.

All test methods were the same as for the previous study SBS measurements were conducted for composite bonds to bovine enamel using a phosphoric acid pre-etch with the PLP adhesive (PLP- 10) and for a conventional enamel-bonding adhesive (EB). Fatigue testing was done with the same test fixtures, load cycling at 2 Hz up to a maximum of 10 (5) cycles at four selected peak load values between 35 and 60 % of the respective bond strengths. Fatigue limits were determined from the data obtained. SEM analysis of resin penetration of the enamel surface was carried out for each adhesive. Results. A significantly greater SBS and SFL were found for EB (SBS: 30. 4 MPa; SFL: 15. 6 MPa) than for PLP- 10 (SBS: 20. 2 MPa; SFL: 9. 9 MPa).

40|$|Texturing {{of silicon}} wafers is an {{important}} process step in fabrication of solar cells {{in order to reduce}} the reflection of incoming light radiation on the solar cell surfaces. The conventional wet chemical etching methods have clear limitations in etching and texturing of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. Chemical etching of mc-Si wafers in alkaline solutions results in a coarse and non uniform surface morphology since the dissolution rate depends on the grain orientation. In contrast to alkaline etching, textures formed by acidic etchants (HF+HNO 3) are uniform. However, acidic etching is difficult to control, the disposal of the waste is expensive and the method is in general environmentally hazardous. The aim of this thesis is to study an environmentally friendly etching method, which is supposed to be an alternative to acidic texturing of both single and multicrystalline B-doped silicon wafers. The method is based on anodic polarization of Si in alkaline solutions. In spite of the fact that silicon is one of the most studied elements due to its applicability in electronic devices, its electrochemistry in alkaline solutions at increased temperatures and at high potentials has been scarcely investigated. In the first part of the thesis monocrystalline (100) and (111) silicon samples were polarized in a strong alkaline solution at different temperatures and potentials in order to study anodic passivation mechanism. In the second part single- and multicrystalline Si-wafers were textured by utilizing electrochemical treatment in hot alkaline solutions. Anodic dissolution and passivation of Si (100) and Si (111) were studied by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarizations in 2 M KOH at temperatures ranging from 23 oC to 70 oC and at potentials from the open circuit potential (OCP) to 14. 5 V (with respect to Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Potentiostatic polarization experiments were performed on as-received (mechanically sawed or polished) and pre-etched (at OCP in the alkaline test solution) samples. The composition and thickness of the reaction products formed on the surfaces were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the surfaces was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The oxide products formed during passivation was analyzed after polarization to the Flade potential at about 1 V. A thin (about 1 nm) homogeneous layer of Sioxyhydroxide (H 2 SiO 3) is formed at this potential. It is formed on both crystal orientations independent of temperature. The hydrated silica layer is gradually transformed into the stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 by polarizing Si (100) above the Flade potential at 23 oC or 30 oC. The phase change is indicated by an oxidation peak at around 4 V during potentiodynamic polarizations. Further, XPS analysis shows that both hydrated and dehydrated silica coexist at this potential. The oxide thickness formed during potentiodynamic polarization to 14. 5 V is 22 nm. Oxygen evolution is observed at about 4 V. At higher potentials the oxygen evolution is inhibited due to growth of thick oxide. The stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 forms and grows with increasing potential and exposure time on Si (111) at all temperatures irrespective of <b>pre-etching.</b> The thicknesses of the oxide are in the range 3 nm to 40 nm depending on the polarization method, potential and exposure time. The formation and growth of SiO 2 on Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures depends on surface <b>pre-etching.</b> Polarization of pre-etched Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures does not form SiO 2 on the surface. The compound present after polarization at all potentials was the thin, 1 nm thick hydrated silica layer. It was formed irrespectively of the polarization method or potential. Thus, <b>pre-etching</b> {{is an important}} parameter in the oxidation mechanism of Si (100). Oxide growth on non-pre-etched Si (100) at the high temperatures was similar to that of Si (111). However, <b>pre-etching</b> of Si (100) for more than 10 min at the high temperatures results in formation of pyramidal hillocks on the surface. During polarization at the high temperatures, the pyramidal hillocks are dissolved and the surface becomes flattened. Hydrated silica layer is the only detected oxidation product at all potentials. In the second part of the thesis a method is developed for electrochemical texturing of as-cut multicrystalline and single crystals, Si (111) and Si (100), in alkaline solutions. The wafers are potentiostatically polarized in 2 M KOH and 4 M KOH at temperatures in the range 30 oC to 70 oC. The applied potentials are varied from 20 V to 50 V (referred to Pt-counter electrode). Before the polarization, the samples are pre-etched in the test solution to remove the deformed zone on the as-cut surfaces. The morphology of the textured surfaces, the composition and thickness of the surface products and the light reflectivity are analyzed by utilizing SEM, XPS and Lambda UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer, respectively. <b>Pre-etching</b> of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers results in anisotropic surface morphology with protrusions and valleys due to etching of different grains at different etch rates in alkaline solutions. During anodic polarization at potentials above 20 V and at temperatures at 40 oC and above, all the grains are uniformly textured. At 25 V and 30 V, micro-pits are formed on the protrusions. With increasing the potential to 40 V and 50 V, concave cavities are formed on the entire surface. Isotropic texturing is achieved. Isotropic texturing on mc-Si wafers is characterized by formation of the concave cavities of 1 to 10 μm. Inside the micropits and cavities, nano-pits are formed. Their lateral size is in the range 100 nm to 200 nm. At 50 V, the nano-pits are etched away and the cavities become shallower due to enhanced dissolution. The lowest average reflectivity, 17 %, is achieved on electrochemically textured surface after polarization at 40 V for 10 min in 4 M KOH at 50 oC, which is 50 % lower than the reflectivity on the pre-etched surface. A model for the isotropic texturing mechanism is proposed based on XPS analysis and electrochemical measurements. It is suggested that the formation of pits and concave cavities is due to local pH variations caused by oxygen evolution reaction, which control formation and dissolution of the surface oxide. Protons formed during oxygen evolution reduce the pH on the surface locally. Hereby, SiO 2 becomes stable and grows on the surface in the low pH area. For prolonged exposure the growth of the oxide passivates the surface and lowers the oxidation rate of Si and water. Due to high alkalinity of the electrolyte, oxide dissolves at weak points thus creating pits. Oxidation of silicon and oxygen evolution occurs at the oxide breakdown sites. Continuous formation and local dissolution of oxide causes the formation of micro-pitted surface. Formation of pits and concave cavities are not affected by changes in the electrolyte concentration and temperature. However, <b>pre-etching</b> is an important factor in obtaining the uniform textures on all the grains of the mc-Si wafers. This is due to the fact that <b>pre-etching</b> influences the formation of SiO 2 on (100) grains at high temperatures. Isotropic textures are not obtained on mc-Si wafers containing significant number of (100) grains when pre-etched for more than 10 min. On Si (111) wafer surfaces, <b>pre-etching</b> results in formation of steps and terraces. The terraces contain true (111) planes are stable and steps contain fast etching planes such as (100) and (110) are more reactive. During polarization, terrace planes are passivated by formation of a stable oxide, and pits are initiated at the step edges. With increasing potential, temperature and exposure time, pitting spreads over the terrace planes. The surface reflectance is decreased with increasing pit coverage. It is demonstrated that the electrochemical texturing method can effectively replace the present isotropic etching by acidic etchants. Both single crystal and multicrystalline materials have successfully been textured. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|E

It deals with the pros and cons of various <b>pre-etched</b> structures as well as which design patterns are easy to fabricate and are less involved in analysing them when it comes to determining the accurate crystallographic directions. We start with a brief discussion on the methods used for aligning the mask edges to the crystallographic directions. Subsequently, the role of different <b>pre-etched</b> patterns in identifying the crystal directions along with the merits of each technique is discussed.|$|R

After removing the mask by immersing the specimens in toluene for the polystyrene mask and in acetone for the photoresist mask, the morphology of the obtained microstructured silicon was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL 6701 [*]F, JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan).|$|R

Nanoparticles were deposited by spin coating method on <b>pre-etched</b> glass and Si substrates. Structural, optical and electrical properties of the samples were studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with EDAX, UV-Vis spectrophotometry and four-point probe.

40|$|Nitride based {{protective}} coatings produced by {{physical vapour deposition}} offer a promising means to extend the oxidation and wear performance of γ-TiAl. Metal ion <b>pre-etching</b> of the substrate surface {{has been shown to}} significantly enhance the adhesion between the coating and substrate. In this study we have applied spectroscopic imaging and advanced STEM analysis to study such interfaces. For a conventional Cr cathodic arc discharge Cr ion implantation of ~ 6 nm into the substrate was observed. For an etch using high power impulse magnetron sputtering the metal ion implantation depth was reduced to ~ 2 - 3 nm. In both cases a corresponding depletion zone of Ti and Al was observed. In addition, nitrogen diffusion into the substrate during coating deposition was also revealed to a similar depth respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{buckling}} {{behavior of}} a thin-film electrolyte of a micro-solid oxide fuel cell is investigated based on experimental measurements, analytical estimations and numerical simulations. An energy minimization procedure is applied {{in combination with the}} Rayleigh–Ritz method to represent the buckling modes, evaluate the buckling amplitude and determine the threshold values for instability transitions in the system. The residual stresses in the film deposited on a silicon substrate are evaluated based on wafer curvature whereby nanoindentations tests are applied to estimate the Young's modulus of the deposited film. The partial release of residual stresses in the film during free etching of the substrate is estimated by a new method combining <b>pre-etching</b> optical measurements with posteriori stress analysis. The energy interpretation of the obtained deflection shape is discussed. Comparisons between simulation results and experimental data show the efficiency of this method to predict various buckling stages of free-standing thin films. A post-buckling design space for thin-film electrolyte fabrication is presented by applying a stress-based failure criterion...|$|E
40|$|Self-adhesive {{composites}} (SACs) are {{claimed to}} bond to tooth substrate without a separate adhesive. Bonding effectiveness data are however still limited. OBJECTIVES: In SubProject 1, the hypothesis was tested that the micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to dentin of two flowable SACs was alike {{that of a}} one-step self-etch adhesive (1 -SEa) combined with a flowable composite (flowC). In SubProject 2, the hypothesis was tested {{that the nature of}} the smear layer did not affect the μTBS of the SACs to dentin/enamel. METHODS: SubProject 1 : The μTBS to bur-cut dentin of two SACs (Fusio Liquid Dentin, Pentron; Vertise Flow, Kerr) was measured and compared to that of four 1 -SEa/flowC combinations (AdheSe One/Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent; Adper Prompt L-Pop/Filtek Supreme XT Flowable, 3 M ESPE; iBond/Venus flow, Heraeus Kulzer; Xeno V/X-flow, Dentsply) and of one 3 -step etch-and-rinse adhesive (3 -E&Ra: OptiBond FL, Kerr) combined with Premise Flowable (Kerr). The effect of <b>pre-etching</b> dentin with phosphoric acid on the μTBS of the SAC Vertise Flow (Kerr) was measured as well. SubProject 2 : The μTBS of the two SACs and one 1 -SEa/flowC combination (Adper Prompt L-Pop/Filtek Supreme XT Flowable, 3 M ESPE) to either bur-cut or SiC-paper ground dentin/enamel was measured. The effect of <b>pre-etching</b> enamel with phosphoric acid on the μTBS of the SAC Vertise Flow (Kerr) was also measured. RESULTS: SubProject 1 : The μTBS to dentin of both SACs was significantly lower than that of the 1 -SEa/flowC and the 3 -E&Ra/flowC combinations, of which the latter performed best. The SAC Fusio Liquid Dentin (Pentron) bonded significantly better to dentin than Vertise Flow (Kerr), except when dentin had additionally been pre-etched with phosphoric acid. SubProject 2 : Surface smear did not interfere with bonding of the SACs to dentin/enamel, while their μTBS remained significantly lower than that of the 1 -SEa/flowC combination. Prior phosphoric-acid etching of dentin/enamel significantly ameliorated the bonding effectiveness of Vertise Flow (Kerr). SIGNIFICANCE: The bonding effectiveness of flowable SACs underscores that of 1 -SEa's and one 'gold-standard' 3 -E&Ra when combined with their proprietary flowable composite. Consequently, routine clinical application of SACs should be carefully considered. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Micromirrors with a {{tilt angle}} of 45 ° {{are widely used}} in optical {{switching}} and interconnect applications which require 90 ° out of plane reflection. Silicon wet bulk micromachining based on surfactant added TMAH is usually employed to fabricate 45 ° slanted walls at the 〈 1 0 0 〉 direction on Si{ 0 0 1 } wafers. These slanted walls are used as 45 ° micromirrors. However, {{the appearance of a}} precise 45 ° { 0 1 1 } wall is subject to the accurate identification of the 〈 1 0 0 〉 direction. In this paper, we present a simple technique based on <b>pre-etched</b> patterns for the identification of 〈 1 0 0 〉 directions on the Si{ 0 0 1 } surface. The proposed <b>pre-etched</b> pattern self-aligns itself at the 〈 1 0 0 〉 direction while becoming misaligned at other directions. The 〈 1 0 0 〉 direction is determined by a simple visual inspection of <b>pre-etched</b> patterns and does not need any kind of measurement. To test the accuracy of the proposed method, we fabricated a 32 [*]mm long rectangular opening with its sides aligned along the 〈 1 0 0 〉 direction, which is determined using the proposed technique. Due to the finite etch rate of the { 1 1 0 } plane, undercutting occurred, which was measured at 12 different locations along the longer edge of the rectangular strip. The mean of these undercutting lengths, measured perpendicular to the mask edge, is found to be 13. 41 μm with a sub-micron standard deviation of 0. 38 μm. This level of uniform undercutting indicates that our method of identifying the 〈 1 0 0 〉 direction is precise and accurate. The developed method will be extremely useful in fabricating arrays of 45 ° micromirrors...|$|R

Polymer filling {{is used to}} improve the transfer quality of CNTs into <b>pre-etched</b> silicon holes. Special hexagonal CNTs are designed to achieve high aspect ratio (10 : 1) CNT vias. TSVs filled with closely packed CNTs show a highly linear dc I - V response. The proposed process works at room temperature, which makes it compatible with existing device fabrication flow...|$|R
30|$|Researchers in {{the past}} have used {{anisotropic}} etching to fabricate patterns to determine the crystallographic direction (e.g., ⟨ 110 ⟩, ⟨ 100 ⟩) with high precision. These patterns are etched {{on the periphery of the}} wafer and therefore the usable wafer space is not affected significantly. These <b>pre-etched</b> patterns act as aids for the subsequent alignment of mask edges. This method of alignment has been accurate in determining the crystallographic directions precisely with an accuracy as high as 0.01 °. This has helped the researchers in fabricating dimensionally accurate micro-structures for different applications. Many designs have previously been proposed which talks about the alignment techniques and its accuracy. Several <b>pre-etched</b> patterns have been proposed till date using various geometries [76, 102 – 110]. Some of them aim at determining the ⟨ 110 ⟩ direction on Si{ 100 } and S{ 110 } wafers [76, 102, 104 – 107]. At the same time, some have been aimed at determining the ⟨ 100 ⟩ direction on both types of wafer [103, 108, 109]. In the subsequent subsections, we discuss various techniques, design geometry and their accuracies in determining the crystallographic directions which have been published in the period of more than two decades. Apart from high accuracy, a good <b>pre-etched</b> pattern should have minimum measurement requirement, should be visually identifiable with simple equipment and should not use much of the usable wafer space. At the same time it should not only determine the crystallographic directions but also aid in alignment of the subsequent mask. We categorise the techniques based on their suitability for wafers of different orientations. Some techniques exploit the shape of etched profiles and thus can be exclusively used for one particular wafer orientation. However, some techniques have been proposed which can be used for different types of wafers. In the subsequent subsections, we discuss the details of the patterns starting with the patterns for determining directions on Si{ 100 } followed by Si{ 110 } wafers.|$|R
