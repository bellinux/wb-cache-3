40|$|Abstract. Storm surges {{generated}} by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita inundated much of coastal Louisiana as revealed by Landsat imagery. A simplified equation for estimating maximum surge height is provided. Estimated heights are {{shown to be}} in reasonable agreement with <b>preliminary</b> <b>water</b> mark measurements. An application of the equation for a different geographical setting is described. At the end of August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near the Louisiana / Mississippi border (Fig. 1). Less than one month later, Hurricane Rita struck near the Louisiana / Texas border (Fig. 2). Both of these storms produced catastrophic damage, and areas of the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts were devastated. According to the National Hurricane Center (Knabb et al., 2005 a and 2005 b), precise measurements of the maximum storm surges associated with these storms were complicated due to incomplete or failed gauge records and, in some areas, the complete destruction of coastal structures which otherwise might have been left with residual high water marks. Nevertheless, extensive surveys were conducted by the Interagency Performance Evaluation Taskforce (IPET) and by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

For this purpose, the Air Mass Corrected Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (AMC-DOAS) approach {{has been applied to}} GOME and SCIAMACHY nadir measure-ments in the spectral region around 700 nm. A possible combination of the GOME and SCIAMACHY data would be the first step to a new long-term water vapour climatology as the combined GOME and SCIAMACHY time series covers already now more than 10 years. A further ex-tension by future SCIAMACHY data and additional measurements from the GOME- 2 instruments on the Metop satellites can be expected.

40|$|The Magilligan sand spit dune {{field is}} {{situated}} on the eastern mouth of Lough Foyle in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It is a large triangular-shaped site some 7 km by 4 km by 1. 5 km wide (about 800 hectares) and maintains areas, particularly in the eastern part, with slacks that regularly flood in winter. The size of the system acts as a buffer to external drivers due to the large volume of groundwater stored, the longer travel distances and lower hydraulic gradients. However, unlike many other coastal dune sites with humid dune slacks in the British Isles the sand is not wholly underlain by silt and clay, as raised beach sand and gravel deposits are {{in contact with the}} sand aquifer in some places.

Extracts produced from softwood bark contain both tannins and non-tannin compounds, which may reduce the effectiveness of tannin used as a wood preservative. The purpose {{of this research is}} to study the environmental impact of hot water extraction, identify the hot spots within the tannin cradle-to-gate life cycle and give suggestions to optimize its environmental profile. Different extraction and postextraction scenarios of tannin production are compared using the life-cycle assessment method. Experiments were designed to study the tannin yield under different extraction scenarios; the post-extraction scenario analysis was based on literature review. The results show that the extract drying process is the primary contributor to the environmental impact of tannin production. Both <b>preliminary</b> cold <b>water</b> extraction and ultrafiltration after extraction are beneficial as they have fewer non-tannin compounds in the final products; however, <b>preliminary</b> cold <b>water</b> extraction had a considerably lower environmental performance.

40|$|Model Evaluation Well ER- 5 - 5 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office {{in support}} of Nevada Environmental Management Operations at the Nevada National Security Site (formerly known as the Nevada Test Site). The well was drilled in July and August 2012 {{as part of a}} model {{evaluation}} well program in the Frenchman Flat area of Nye County, Nevada. The primary purpose of the well was to provide detailed geologic, hydrogeologic, chemical, and radiological data {{that can be used to}} test and build confidence in the applicability of the Frenchman Flat Corrective Action Unit flow and transport models for their intended purpose. In particular, this well was designed to obtain data to evaluate the uncertainty in model forecasts of contaminant migration from the upgradient underground nuclear test MILK SHAKE, conducted in Emplacement Hole U- 5 k in 1968, which were considered to be uncertain due to the unknown extent of a basalt lava-flow aquifer present in this area. Well ER- 5 - 5 is expected to provide information to refine the Phase II Frenchman Flat hydrostratigraphic framework model, if necessary, as well as to support future groundwater flow and transport modeling. The 31. 1 -centimeter (cm) diameter hole was drilled to a total depth of 331. 3 meters (m). The completion string, set at the depth of 317. 2 m, consists of 16. 8 -cm stainless-steel casing hanging from 19. 4 -cm carbon-steel casing. The 16. 8 -cm stainless-steel casing has one slotted interval open to the basalt lava-flow aquifer and limited intervals of the overlying and underlying alluvial aquifer. A piezometer string was also installed in the annulus between the completion string and the borehole wall. The piezometer is composed of 7. 3 -cm stainless-steel tubing suspended from 6. 0 -cm carbon-steel tubing. The piezometer string was landed at 319. 2 m, to monitor the basalt lava-flow aquifer. Data collected during and shortly after hole construction include composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3. 0 m, various geophysical logs, <b>preliminary</b> <b>water</b> quality measurements, and water-level measurements. The well penetrated 331. 3 m of Quaternary–Tertiary alluvium, including an intercalated layer of saturated basalt lava rubble. No well development or hydrologic testing was conducted in this well immediately after completion; however, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>water</b> level was measured in the piezometer string at the depth of 283. 4 m on September 25, 2012. No tritium above the minimum detection limit of the field instruments was detected in this hole. Future well development, sampling, and hydrologic testing planned for this well will provide more accurate hydrologic information for this site. The stratigraphy, general lithology, and water level were as expected, though the expected basalt lava-flow aquifer is basalt rubble and not the dense, fractured lava as modeled. The lack of tritium transport is likely due to the difference in hydraulic properties of the basalt lava-flow rubble encountered in the well, compared to those of the fractured aquifer used in the flow and transport models...|$|R

Water samples collected from the affected area, 10 km parallel to the seaside, were compared with water samples from the control area approximately 4 km from the seaside, which the tsunami waves could not reach. These samples included 18 surface-water samples, 37 well-water samples, and 8 drinking-water samples, which were examined for microbiology and physical-chemical properties. The microbiological examinations focused on enteric bacteria, which were isolated by culture method, while physical-chemical properties comprised on-site testing for pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity and total dissolved solids (TDS) by portable electrochemical meter (Sens Ion 156). The results of the microbiological examinations showed that water samples in the affected areas were more contaminated with enteric bacteria than the control area: 45. 4 % of surface-water samples in the affected area, and 40. 0 % in the control; 19. 0 % of well-water samples in the affected area, and 7. 7 % in the control.
