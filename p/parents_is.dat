5|$|All {{accounts}} {{agree that}} Pain married in 1115 {{and that his}} wife was named Sybil, although the identity of Sybil's <b>parents</b> <b>is</b> unclear. Pain's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry states that he married Sybil Talbot, the niece of Hugh de Lacy. The Complete Peerage states that he married Sybil, the daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was herself probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy. The historian K. S. B. Keats-Rohan states that Pain married Sybil de Lacy, the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, a view shared by fellow historians Judith Green and Paul Dalton. Others such as Bruce Coplestone-Crow and David Crouch agree with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biographys designation of Sybil as Hugh's niece, and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes, the sister of Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
5000|$|Authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} as <b>parents</b> who have high parental warmth, responsiveness, and demandingness, but rate low in negativity and conflict. These <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> assertive but not intrusive or overly restrictive. [...] This method of <b>parenting</b> <b>is</b> {{associated with more}} positive social and academic outcomes. Interestingly, the beneficial outcomes of authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily universal. Among African American adolescents, authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>is</b> not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievement. Children who are raised by authoritative <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> [...] "more likely to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behaved. They {{are less likely to}} report depression and anxiety, and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior like delinquency and drug use." ...|$|R

5|$|Inconsistent {{inheritance}} of myostatin mutations (for example, F94L in Limousins, nt821 in Angus, and Q204X in Charolais) by progeny {{is expected to}} result in possible BLUP prediction errors for EBVs and EPDs equalling or exceeding worst case standard errors of prediction. For example, average rib eye area for Limousins in US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) trials during the 1980s and early 1990s {{is reported to be}} 12.3in2, and the reported possible difference in rib eye area in progeny arising from {{inheritance of}} either two F94L mutations or two normal myostatin genes from heterozygous <b>parents</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 1.8in2 (12.3in2 x 15%). This difference, which is unpredictable without DNA testing, is nearly four times the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy, reported to be 0.46in2 for the rib eye EPD.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good <b>parents</b> <b>is</b> that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E
5|$|Meet the <b>Parents</b> <b>is</b> {{a remake}} of a 1992 film {{of the same name}} {{directed}} by Greg Glienna and produced by Jim Vincent. Glienna—who also played the original film's main protagonist—and Mary Ruth Clarke co-wrote the screenplay. Universal Studios purchased the rights to Glienna's film with the intent of creating a new version. Jim Herzfeld expanded the original script but development was halted for some time. Jay Roach read the expanded script and expressed his desire to direct the film but Universal declined him. At that time, Steven Spielberg was interested in directing the film while Jim Carrey was interested in playing the lead role. The studio only offered the film to Roach once Spielberg and Carrey left the project.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> a {{caregiver}} of the offspring {{in their own}} species.

A female can also become a parent through surrogacy. Some <b>parents</b> may <b>be</b> adoptive <b>parents,</b> who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not actually biologically related to the child.
