The PLL block assists the active filter to function even under distorted voltage or current conditions. The shunt APLC system is implemented with voltage source inverter and is connected at PCC for compensating the reactive power. The shunt APLC system is modeled and investigated under unbalanced nonlinear load conditions using MATLAB simulation. The simulation results reveal that the active <b>power</b> filter line <b>conditioner</b> is effectively compensating the reactive power and improves power factor at point of common coupling. II.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{development}} of theoretical and practical construction principles of uninterruptible power supply system based on the active <b>power</b> line <b>conditioner.</b> In the thesis mathematical models, analytical expressions that allow defining the basic parameters of the active <b>power</b> line <b>conditioner</b> <b>power</b> section and its control laws while operating with battery charge system are developed. The proposed power system based on active <b>power</b> line <b>conditioner</b> has the function of uninterruptible power supply system and reactive power compensator. Using the system calculation method based on mean values of the voltages and currents taking into account the ratio between the load and battery charge energies the reactive elements parameters and input currents and voltages values needed for efficient operation of the system are calculated. Simplified calculation methods of active <b>power</b> line <b>conditioner</b> capacitor voltage and the amplitude of the input current with the use of regulating characteristics and energy balance, can significantly reduce the delay in microprocessor control system while calculating the control actions. Using the battery charging method with asymmetric pulse current provides the extended battery life.

Basic theoretical calculations are verified by computer modeling results. ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????????? ? ???????????? ????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ?? ???? ???????-??????????????? ???????????????. ? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ???????? ????????????? ?????????, ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ????? ???????-??????????????? ???????????????, ? ????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ??? ???????????????? ? ???????? ?????? ????????????. ???????????? ??????? ?????????????? ?? ???? ???????-??????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????? ??? ??????? ????????? ?????????????? ???????, ??? ? ???????????? ?????????? ????????. ????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?? ??????? ????????? ????? ? ??????????, ???????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ????????????, ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ???????? ????? ? ??????????, ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ???????. ????????? ?????, ?????????? ?? ????????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ? ??????? ???????, ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ????????????? ????????, ? ????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????. ??? ???? ?????????? ?? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????, ?????????????, ?????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??? ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ???????????. ????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ???? ???????? ?? ????????? ????????? ????? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ????????? ???? ??? ??????????? ?? ????? 2 %, ??? ????????? ????? ???????? ????????????????? ??????? ??????????. ????????, ??? ??? ????????????? ?????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ????? ? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ?? ???? ???????-??????????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????????, ? ????????? ????????? ???????????. ??? ????????????? ????????????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ? ?????
