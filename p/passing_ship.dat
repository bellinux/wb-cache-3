The Argentine government only established a settlement in Good Success Bay in late 1887, four years after the Iquique went missing.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an article}} in the 24 November 1923 issue of the Auckland Star, in 1919 an {{additional}} report had been published in an unspecified Glasgow newspaper which suggested that the crew had been sighted on shore in 1891, but that the <b>passing</b> <b>ship</b> had been unable to rescue them. This would seem to be taken in part from the 1891 report by the Canadian sealing schooner Maud S. According to the Auckland Star, the Glasgow story also repeated the first story about the ship being discovered in 1913 with a dead crew on board.|$|E

25|$|The Stannard Rock Light keepers {{operated}} the lantern {{and the living}} quarters with flammable illuminants for 60 years; the lighthouse was not electrified until after World War II. It {{was just a few}} years after this that an explosion of gasoline and propane tanks used to fuel the station plant destroyed the buildings on the pier and severely damaged the interior of the tower. The explosion killed one keeper and left three others stranded on the concrete pier {{at the base of the}} tower for three days before a <b>passing</b> <b>ship</b> discovered them and notified the Coast Guard. The men were rescued by the tender Woodrush.|$|E
500|$|The Confederates {{deployed}} {{one additional}} defensive measure, {{which was then}} unique {{in the history of}} warfare: several torpedoes (in modern terminology, a naval minefield) were anchored below the surface in the main shipping channel, rigged to explode when touched by a <b>passing</b> <b>ship.</b> (This measure turned out to be ineffective, due to high water levels and leaks in the torpedoes' metal containers.) ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1867, {{shortly after}} departing Hong Kong for California with 360 Chinese {{passengers}}, Ellen Southards master, Captain Howe, died at sea.

2500|$|The {{island has}} been {{continuously}} settled since 1690, initially being {{a destination for}} hunters. [...] Barnegat Inlet, {{to the north of}} the island, was an important path for freight shipments and whaling from the 17th century through the 20th century. [...] Due to the Inlet's importance and its turbulent waters, a lighthouse tower was constructed in 1835 to guide shippers through the area, but was inadequate to ships, constantly being mistaken for another <b>passing</b> <b>ship</b> because the light was fixed. [...] Erosion problems destroyed the tower in 1857, two years before the current Barnegat Lighthouse was completed in 1859, flashing at each point of the compass every 10 seconds. [...] It was constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the supervision of George Gordon Meade, famous for leading the Union forces to victory four years later during the Civil War at the Battle of Gettysburg. [...] The United States Life-Saving Service built Station #17 in Barnegat Light (then known as Brownsville) around 1872, which continues today as a United States Coast Guard station.|$|E
2500|$|In Cape Town, South Africa, Darwin and FitzRoy visited John Herschel. On 20 February 1836, Herschel {{had written}} to Lyell praising his Principles of Geology as opening a way for bold {{speculation}} on [...] "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others." [...] Herschel thought catastrophic extinction and renewal [...] "an inadequate conception of the Creator", and by analogy with other intermediate causes [...] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be {{found to be a}} natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process". The letter was widely circulated in London, and Darwin remembered the phrase [...] "that mystery of mysteries". Missionaries were being accused of causing racial tension and profiteering, and after the Beagle set to sea on 18 June FitzRoy wrote an open letter to the evangelical South African Christian Recorder on the Moral State of Tahiti incorporating extracts from both his and Darwin's diaries to defend the reputation of missionaries. This was given to a <b>passing</b> <b>ship</b> which took it to Cape Town to become FitzRoy's (and Darwin's) first published work.|$|E

2500|$|... 1531 – Some of the Antanosy {{who shared}} about the {{departure}} of the Portuguese from Anosy indicated to later European explorers they had not met a violent end, some even leaving on their own (see [...] "1613" [...] bullet below). However, others indicated some of the Raondriana had in fact killed these foreigners (Pearson, 1997). The story was a massacre had occurred, led by Zafiraminia princes who attacked the Portuguese during a celebration they were having outside the protection of their fort, killing 70, leaving just the 5 who were on guard duty in the Tranovato alive (along with a Frenchman who'd been shipwrecked and was awaiting rescue). On the other hand, Larson (2007) argues this story appears to have been first told by Jesuit missionaries almost 100 years later, frustrated with the king of Fanjahira (who they blamed for this event), as he was unwilling to give a second son to them to take to Goa, India for a Catholic education. The 6 survivors at Tranovato were picked up by a <b>passing</b> <b>ship</b> (Pearson, 1997). In either case, Portugal's minimal attempt at setting up a colony ended after the Portuguese either left on their own or were mostly killed, the few survivors rescued.|$|E
