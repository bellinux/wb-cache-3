5000|$|High wet modulus rayon (HWM) is a {{modified}} version of viscose that has a greater strength when wet. It also has the ability to be mercerized like cotton. HWM rayons are also known as [...] "polynosic". <b>Polynosic</b> fibers are dimensionally stable and do not shrink or get pulled out of shape when wet like many rayons. They are also wear resistant and strong while maintaining a soft, silky feel. They are sometimes identified by the trade name Modal.|$|E
40|$|Junlon ia a <b>polynosic</b> fibre {{developed}} {{recently and}} <b>polynosic</b> cotton blends were ruite common "by 1980 s. For {{the first time}} in Pugoda Kills polynosic/cotton yorn was produced in 19 C 3. The counts produced wore 45 s and 50 s and the yorn produced use mainly for the local market. The blending ratio was 65 % cotton to 35 % <b>polynosic.</b> With the blended yarn, fabric with the following consti-uction was produced in six looms. Warp count of yorn 45 s Weft Count of yarn 45 s Total no, of warp aids 3712 Picks per inch 64 Reed Count 88 s Reed width 41. 8 inches Reave Plain And were drawn through two heald frames. The objective 01 the project is to study the performance of polynosic/Cotton blended yarn in the process of weaving and determine the optimum size percentage to be used in order to achieve maximum weaving efficiency in the loom shed under normal working conditions...|$|E
40|$|Historical {{development}} of manufacturing technology {{of viscose rayon}} fibers at Stages IV, V and VI, defined in the previous paper (This journal, 20, 1 (2005)), was studied. In particular, since Stage V was the time of social turbulent the study was made in close connection with social background. As supplement to the previous paper, details (causes and cut-off rate) of the operational curtailments with a golden age sandwiched between them in Stage III was surveyed. Conversion of autonomic control system (Stage III) to governmental compulsory control system (Stage IV) was studied {{on the basis of}} acts, royal ordinances, ministerial ordinances and notices. The first～fifth order national plans of reduction of production and the corresponding Asahi 2 ̆ 7 s achievements were examined. Numerous difficulties, such as shortage of resources, energy, and man-power, encountered by Japanese rayon producers in Stage IV (1938 ～ 1945) were investigated. Technological advance (if any) in Stage IV was studied: R & D activity of Asahi men (in comparison with that in Stage III), some key technology developments continued from Stage III, and Toramomen. The route of invention and commercialization of Tramomen at Asahi in Stage IV and at Tachikawa Research Institute in Stage V and evolution of Toramomen were surveyed. New concept of high-wet-modulus rayon (Toramomen, <b>Polynosic</b> rayon) and the worldwide evaluation of Toramomen (<b>polynosic)</b> were disclosed in detail. History of some restoration plans, approved by GHQ, in Stage V (1946 ～ 1951) was surveyed together with Asahi 2 ̆ 7 s restoration work. During Stage VI (1952 ～ 1956) the USA 2 ̆ 7 s technology, directly licensed to Japanese machinery manufactures, was introduced to Japanese viscose rayon producers. Characteristics of the technology at Stage VI were discussed...|$|E
