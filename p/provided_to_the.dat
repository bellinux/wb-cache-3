5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elk.

These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{signing the}} Kano Accord, Libya was incensed that the GUNT {{did not include}} any {{of the leaders of}} the Volcan Army and had not {{recognized}} Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{passenger}} services were <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Central by steam locomotives. The first services to Hurstville were run by steam locomotives of the Q.158 and R.285 classes. When the City Underground opened to St James in 1926, a new electric service {{was provided to}} run there. From {{the time when the}} line to the Royal National Park was electrified, passengers received a steam train service at first, then when this became expensive, it was replaced by a rail motor service. This arrangement continued until the line was electrified to Waterfall, and the Eastern Suburbs Line was opened. In 1979 the Eastern Suburbs Line being the first line to only use S set double-decker rolling stock. The current running operations for {{passenger services}} have remained generally unchanged since 1981 with the integration of the Illawarra line and the Eastern Suburbs Railway. Suburban services utilise Erskineville Junction and proceed to Central and Bondi Junction.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions <b>provided,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent that it was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

5|$|Ingram's refusal allowed Rossy {{to take up}} the bishopric. He was consecrated by 16 July 1380.

A further letter was sent, as follows:To the bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld. Mandate to enquire into the claim advanced by Oswald, claustral prior of Glenluys, O. Cist., Galloway diocese, to be the true bishop of Galloway in virtue of his election by the chapter of Galloway and subsequent provision made by Urban VI.

5|$|Many German radio {{messages}} were encoded using the Enigma machine and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently.

The Enigma code used by Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, Oberbefehlshaber West (Supreme Commander West; OB West), commander of the Western Front, was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able to read them.|$|E

5|$|On 13 June 1905, a {{passenger}} service {{began on the}} short branch to South Acton. A short fifth platform for the single car train of the South Acton branch was <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the eastbound island platform. At first the service ran to Hounslow West and to Uxbridge but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932. The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage; its platform at Acton Town has not been removed and is still visible. The platform is hidden behind advertising hoardings and not obvious to the casual observer. Much of the branch remains including a bridge support {{on the south side}} of Bollo Lane. In the picture, the area behind the hoarding in the background is the location of the former branch platform (Platform 5) which was only ever very short, two carriages at most.|$|E
