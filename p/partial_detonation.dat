500|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the discovery of Hoods wreck. Inspection of the wreck has confirmed that the aft magazines did indeed explode. The stern of the Hood was located, with the rudder still in place, and {{it was found that}} this was set to port {{at the time of the}} explosion. Furthermore, a section of the bow immediately forward of 'A' turret is missing, which has led historian and former Dartmouth lecturer Eric J. Grove and expedition leader David Mearns to believe that [...] "either just before or just after leaving the surface, the bow suffered massive internal damage from an internal explosion", possibly a <b>partial</b> <b>detonation</b> of the forward 15-inch magazines.|$|E
40|$|The Chapman-Jouget and ZND {{models of}} steady {{detonation}} have proved most useful for engineering {{estimation of the}} propagation of near-planar, steady detonation in short-reaction-zone explosives. However, even in well characterized systems, the purposeful initiation of detonation is not described by these models. The highly divergent and microscopic nature of point initiation require discerning experiments, modeling, and theoretical analysis. Recently, safety considerations in complex or damaged systems, possibly containing long-reaction-zone (insensitive) high explosives, have dominated our thinking. These situations are rarely planar or steady, the physical state of the explosive may not be easily characterized, {{and there is a}} wide range of potential stimuli. The high-explosive reaction may range from none, to deflagration, to <b>partial</b> <b>detonation,</b> or to full detonation. Techniques and data applicable to estimating the level of response are needed. The design and prediction of explosive systems have mostly been accomplished using the simpl...|$|E
40|$|A {{pressure}} tube should protect the FR- 2 reactor from {{the consequences of}} a hydrogen-air reaction, which is conceivable in the breakdown of several safety devices of the planned cold neutron source Project FR- 2 / 16. The magnitudes and time pattern of the pressures to be expected were investigated. In the geometry used and the ignition mechanism selected, which is comparable to the strongest ignition process conceivable in the reactor, the reaction proceeds with greater probability than combustion. The combustion is possibly smaller if local limited <b>partial</b> <b>detonations</b> are superimposed. The magnitude of the pressure was determined by the masses of the reaction partners, liquid H 2 and liquid air, and determines their ratio to each other...|$|R
2500|$|The {{steel balls}} were {{intended}} to prevent a nuclear detonation even if the explosives fired accidentally, or in any conceivable accident. The ball bearings {{had to be removed}} {{through the hole in the}} bomb casing during flight preparation, and after the bomb was winched into the aircraft. The ball bearings then had to be re-inserted into the lowered and upturned bomb before transport back to the bomb store. Quite obviously, without the ball bearings installed, these weapons were armed and live, and too dangerous to allow to be flown on exercises. Bomber Command exercises demonstrated that flight preparation followed by a scramble take-off could not be reduced below thirty minutes, and on exercises in bad weather and at night a ninety-minute scramble was the norm. At least one accident, dated 1960, was reported in the press when the plastic bung was removed and 133,000 steel ball bearings exited onto the aircraft hangar floor, leaving the bomb armed and vulnerable. The Royal Air Force were so nervous of the outcome of a fire in storage that permission was sought to store the bombs inverted, so that a loss of the plastic bung could not end with the steel balls on the floor, leaving the HEU unprotected against a subsequent explosion. Even without the <b>partial</b> nuclear <b>detonation</b> feared by the RAF, there was [...] "a risk of catastrophe" ...|$|R
40|$|In FY 96 we {{released}} CHEETAH 1. 40, {{which made}} extensive improvements on {{the stability and}} user friendliness of the code. CHEETAH now has over 175 users in government, academia, and industry. Efforts have also been focused on adding new advanced features to CHEETAH 2. 0, which is scheduled for release in FY 97. We have added a new chemical kinetics capability to CHEETAH. In the past, CHEETAH assumed complete thermodynamic equilibrium and independence of time. The addition of a chemical kinetic framework will allow for modeling of time-dependent phenomena, such as <b>partial</b> combustion and <b>detonation</b> in composite explosives with large reaction zones. We have implemented a Wood-Kirkwood detonation framework in CHEETAH, which allows {{for the treatment of}} nonideal detonations and explosive failure. A second major effort in the project this year has been linking CHEETAH to hydrodynamic codes to yield an improved HE product equation of state. We have linked CHEETAH to 1 - and 2 -D hydrodynamic codes, and have compared the code to experimental data. 15 refs., 13 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
