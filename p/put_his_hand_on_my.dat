60|$|He {{laughed and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} as he bade me good night.|$|E
60|$|Once, indeed, he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. It was an {{investiture}} of the Star of India, blue silk, trumpets, and diamond-studded jewel, all complete. If hereafter, in {{the changes}} and chances of this mortal life, I fall to cureless ruin, I {{will tell the}} superintendent of the workhouse that Mark Twain once <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder; and he shall give me a room to myself and a double allowance of paupers' tobacco.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parker {{rose to his}} feet. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. He was {{the very}} {{prototype}} of the self-respecting, conscientious, prospective father- in-law.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a backing-bell rope, 'is {{to sound}} the fire-alarm; this,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a go-ahead bell, 'is to call the texas-tender; this one,' {{indicating}} the whistle-lever, 'is to call the captain'--and so he went on, touching one object after another, and reeling off his tranquil spool of lies.|$|R
60|$|Allerton's {{face lit}} up with amusement. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Dick's shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Parsons at last {{got up and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Jamie's shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|Our eyes met, but I {{could not}} stand his inquiring glance and looked down. He came to me, and sitting {{on the arm of}} my chair, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} and said affectionately,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Plain it {{was that}} my friend felt uncomfortable; he shifted {{from one foot to}} another, and a cloud darkened his brow. But his blue eyes burned with a warm light as he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|I was abashed by his [...] "bourdes," [...] {{and could}} say nought, for, being still very weak, the tears {{came into my}} eyes. Then he drew near me, limping, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, but very gently, saying-- ...|$|E
60|$|Elsie stooped {{and kissed}} his cheek and he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> hers.|$|R
60|$|Jackson {{brought his}} chair-legs down again, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the planchette.|$|R
60|$|Mr Clinton turned {{towards her}} and again <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Eleven years later, {{month for}} month, I stood on Tower Hill {{on the steps}} of the St. Katherine's Dockhouse, a master in the British Merchant Service. But the man who <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} at the top of the Furca Pass was no longer living.|$|E
60|$|I {{got to my}} feet. I beheld Miller Gorse sitting impassive, {{with his}} {{encompassing}} stare, the strongest man of them all. A change of firmaments would not move him. But Dickinson had risen and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. It {{was the first time}} I had ever seen him white.|$|E
60|$|In due time, I {{know not}} how, the talk swung round again to lightness, for the Colonel loved a good story, {{and the priest}} had many which he told with wit in his quaint French accent. As he was rising to take his leave, Pere Gibault <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|E
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> hers, within <b>his</b> arm, {{and gave}} it a squeeze.|$|R
60|$|Andrew <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Dick's {{shoulders}} {{and held him}} off at arm's length.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{responded to}} this dialectical inquiry affirmatively by <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> revolver.|$|R
60|$|When {{we reached}} {{the place where we}} had left our apparatus, I swung the rope over the wall, and, hooking the grapnel firmly on the inside, {{prepared}} to go down, for, as before, I wished to be under Rectus, if he should slip. But Maiden's Heart <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "He met us, {{and told}} us to be steady--but there was little need for that! Every man there was as cool and {{collected}} {{as if it had}} been no more than the cook's stove--and we should have scorned to be otherwise! He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder and said, 'Keep by me,' and I did." ...|$|E
60|$|I walked {{behind him}} for full five minutes; then {{without looking back}} he stopped. The shadows of distant peaks were {{lengthening}} over the Furca Pass. When I {{came up to him}} he turned to me and {{in full view of the}} Finster-Aarhorn, with his band of giant brothers rearing their monstrous heads against a brilliant sky, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder affectionately.|$|E
60|$|Whitney {{waited until}} he came up, and then <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|Wilson {{would have}} replied angrily, but Captain Doolan <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Then he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her, and {{immediately}} she {{straightened up and}} praised God.|$|R
6000|$|Crowder now <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} {{as if to}} restrain me. [...] "Safety!" [...] said he. [...] "You needn't trouble yourself about safety. You are just as safe where you are as you could possibly be {{in one of those}} boats. If they are not picked up soon,--and they may float about for days,--their sufferings and discomforts will be very great. There is a shameful want of accommodation in the way of boats." ...|$|E
6000|$|Montgomery came round {{behind me}} and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. [...] "Look here, Prendick," [...] he said, [...] "I had no {{business}} to let you drift out into this silly island of ours. But it's not so bad as you feel, man. Your nerves are worked to rags. Let me give you something {{that will make you}} sleep. That--will keep on for hours yet. You must simply get to sleep, or I won't answer for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|By and by I {{subsided}} into an indignant silence, and so sat {{until the}} end, hot and flushed, and execrating {{him in my}} heart for an ignorant savage. But he was calm. His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook. When the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother: ...|$|E
60|$|The doctor came behind her, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{the back}} of her chair.|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} young Jolyon {{got up and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Mavering <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> friend's broad shoulder, {{and gave}} him a playful push.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But you can! You're all right. I {{saw that}} from the first. Don't go back on me now or I shall go to pieces like the Drummond Castle. I beg your pardon, old man; but, you see, you do know the dog. I'll prove it. What's that dog doing? Come on! You know.' A tremor shook him, and he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee, and whispered with great meaning: 'I'll letter or halve it with you. There! You begin.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{indeed there}} was no more {{question}} of my mysterious vocation between us. There was to be no more question of it at all, nowhere or with any one. We began the descent of the Furca Pass conversing merrily. Eleven years later, month for month, I stood on Tower Hill {{on the steps of the}} St. Katherine's Dockhouse, a master in the British Merchant Service. But the man who <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder at the top of the Furca Pass was no longer living.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two {{years have}} gone since the bells pealed {{for the birth}} of a new nation--your nation, Davy, and mine--the nation that is to be the refuge of the oppressed of this earth--the nation which is to be made of all peoples, out of all time. And this land for which you and I shall fight to-night will belong to it, and the lands beyond," [...] he pointed to the west, [...] "until the sun sets on the sea again." [...] He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head. [...] "You will {{remember}} this when I am dead and gone," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|He {{wondered}} why she said nothing. Did she understand? He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her arm.|$|R
60|$|And {{with quite}} {{unconscious}} dignity he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> breast, {{and looked at}} her.|$|R
60|$|Young Jolyon <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father's shoulder, and, as neither spoke, {{the episode}} closed.|$|R
