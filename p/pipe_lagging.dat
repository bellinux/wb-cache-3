50|$|Wood lagging is {{a method}} of banding wooden slats around {{pipelines}} to protect against impact, abrasion, and corrosion. Wooden lagging acts as a sheath, protecting the pipeline from damage, and is especially useful in rocky terrain; steep inclines; around rivers or swampy areas; and other rough terrain. Boiler lagging is akin to <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging,</b> but is used to protect steam boilers.|$|E
5000|$|Acre Mill was an {{asbestos}} {{factory in}} the hilltop settlement of Old Town, owned by Cape Insulation Ltd. It was opened in 1939 {{to meet the demand}} for gas mask filters made from blue asbestos during the Second World War, and diversified into the production of other asbestos products, including rope, <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> and textile, after the war. In 1970, the company closed the mill and moved to Westmorland. The mill {{was the subject of a}} 1971 World in Action investigation entitled [...] "The Dust at Acre Mill" [...] which revealed how the factory broke the law regarding asbestos-dust control between 1940-1970. By 1979, 12% of a total of 2,200 former employees had asbestos-related disease. The mill was demolished in 1979. Cape Insulation also operated a second factory at Hangingroyd Mill.|$|E
40|$|The {{glove bag}} control {{techniques}} used {{to contain the}} emission of asbestos (1332214) fibers during the removal of asbestos containing <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> were evaluated. The data were obtained during week long surveys in each of four public school buildings. Reports detailing the specific conditions and operations observed were generated for each <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> removal site. Exposure measurements determined from personal samples indicated short term exposures as high as 9. 0 fibers/cubic centimeter (f/cc) and time weighted average exposures of 0. 3 f/cc occurring during asbestos removal operations. Airborne asbestos contamination was determined in the work area before and after removal. Aggressive and nonaggressive sampling techniques were used for collecting area samples both before removal and after removal and subsequent cleaning. The results of the analyses indicated that glove bags as used at these four schools did not completely contain the asbestos being removed. In {{three of the four}} facilities workers were exposed to airborne asbestos concentrations above the OSHA permissible exposure limit (2 f/cc {{at the time of this}} study). The authors conclude that the use of glove bags results in unpredictable exposure levels that may present an exposure hazard to workers and contamination of the work site. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Bruce A.

50|$|The LSMs {{were built}} for {{short-term}} use landing supplies in the Pacific during World War II. As such the facilities {{for the crew}} were extremely basic. All accommodation spaces were below deck with poor ventilation with several sections of three tiered bunks in cramped and crowded conditions giving no room to roll over. Above the bunks were <b>pipes</b> <b>lagged</b> with asbestos, which would rain down on the sleeper during heavy seas, covering him in white dust. Toilet facilities were an open tray with a row of seats and no privacy. The Forrard Mess was the eating, meeting and relaxing place in each LSM. The flat-bottomed ships did not travel well in rough seas. When committed to the Vietnam War, the LSMs were already old ships in need of constant maintenance. On the Clive Steeles final voyage to Vietnam in 1970 one of the bow doors fell off whilst in transit. The LSM ships {{had to return to}} Sydney for repairs before taking up station in Vietnam.|$|R

40|$|Lagging formed of jackets of porous {{materials}} such as glasswool and of impervious {{materials such as}} metal sheets are widely used to attenuate the sound radiated from pipes. A procedure is described for calculating the insertion lossess produced by such lagging. The procedure yields the insertion lossess corresponding {{to each of the}} low order mode types of the pipe. These are breathing, bending and ovalling mode types. Impedance and pressure transfer formulae for the various jacket types are given in terms of the fundamental properties of the jackets. The porous jacket, for example, is defined by its inner and outer diameters and the flow resitivity of the porous material. These formulae enable the frequency dependent insertion loss produced by an arbitrary <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> to be determined. A comparison of the insertion lossess predicted by this procedure with published results is given...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [44]- 45) This study set out {{to quantify}} differences in concentrations of airborne asbestos {{as a function of}} wetting methods {{associated with the use of}} the mechanical chipper. In addition, it sought to evaluate two analytical methods, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and phase-contrast microscopy (PCM), used to identify airborne concentration of asbestos. Friable asbestos (<b>pipe</b> <b>lagging)</b> and non-friable asbestos (floor tile) air samples were also collected and compared. Air samples were collected and analyzed by PCM in accordance with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Manual of Analytical Methods. NIOSH 7400 and by TEM in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's AHERA protocol. It was concluded that one should consider not using PCM to make decisions in determining proper respiratory protection levels, final "clean" air levels, and levels outside containment during the abatement process. TEM should be utilized during the abatement of all non-friable asbestos materials. Heavy wetting of the floor and allowing water to stand for several minutes (10 or more) are recommended wherever feasible during floor tile abatement using a mechanical chipper. Feasibility, however, infers that one does not create a spillage problem to a lower level. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} cooling system, {{which enables}} components to be cooled below the ambient temperature, but which obviates {{the requirement for}} antifreeze and <b>lagged</b> <b>pipes,</b> is to place a thermoelectric device (commonly {{referred to as a}} 'Peltier junction' or 'pelt' after Jean Peltier, who documented the effect) between the heat-generating component and the water block. Because the only sub-ambient temperature zone now is at the interface with the heat-generating component itself, insulation is required only in that localized area. The disadvantage of such a system is a higher power dissipation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mathematical foundations {{for a simple}} theory for investigating the phenomenon of ignition of flammable fluids in lagging material that are used for insulation of hot pipework, for transport of heat transfer fluids, or other similar situations. Experiments with porous material impregnated with a flammable fluid have simulated the self-heating known to occur when combustible liquids leak from a hot <b>pipe</b> into <b>lagging</b> surrounding the <b>pipe</b> or are split from another source on to the lagging. A theory to explain these findings is presented which shows {{that there is a}} watershed temperature beyond which substantial self-heating will take place. Although the theory does not take account of diffusion, it simulates the main physics of the phenomenonâ€”that is, combustible fluid, which normally in the open air would evaporate and not be a hazard, can, within a porous medium, remain dispersed within the porous structure long enough for the exothermic oxidation to develop into ignition. 1...|$|R
40|$|DOE sites {{contain a}} broad {{spectrum}} of asbestos materials (cloth, <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging,</b> sprayed insulation and other substances) which are contaminated with a combination of hazardous and radioactive wastes due to its use during the development of the US nuclear weapons complex. These wastes consist of cutting oils, lubricants, solvents, PCBs, heavy metals and radioactive contaminants. The radioactive contaminants are the activation, decay, and fission products of DOE operations. To allow disposal, the asbestos must be converted chemically, followed by removing and separating the hazardous and radioactive materials to prevent the formation of mixed wastes and to allow for both sanitary disposal and effective decontamination. Currently, no technology exists that can meet these sanitary and other objectives. An attempt was made to apply techniques that have already proved successful in the mining, oil, and metals processing industries {{to the development of a}} multi-stage process to remove and separate hazardous chemical radioactive materials from asbestos. This process uses three methods: ABCOV chemicals which converts the asbestos to a sanitary waste; dielectric heating to volatilize the organic materials; and electrochemical processing for the removal of heavy metals, RCRA wastes and radionuclides. This process will result in the destruction of over 99 % of the asbestos; limit radioactive metal contamination to 0. 2 Bq alpha per gram and 1 Bq beta and gamma per gram; reduce hazardous organics to levels compatible with current EPA policy for RCRA delisting; and achieve TCLP limits for all solidified waste...|$|E
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of small leaks from the primary system of a Nuclear Pressurised Water Reactor. Leak rates of 12 g/s are invariably difficult to detect and locate. The typical leak indicators in a nuclear reactor control room are a drop in pressure and level from the pressuriser, and the air sampler detecting particulate matter. However, {{in both cases the}} leak is normally quite substantial by the time any parameters or values are obviously outside the normal operating conditions. Therefore, a small leak could go undetected for a significant amount of time. As part of the reactor safety studies, {{it is important to have}} more information about small leaks. Due to the lack of small leak data, the solution was to construct a high pressure water rig producing temperatures and pressures close to those experienced in the primary circuit, these being 200 ÂºC and 100 bar respectively. Pressure is maintained by a vane water pump and heating is achieved by passing a high current through a small diameter, thin walled pipe. To reproduce different size cracks, various size carburettor jets are used. The water on exiting this crack, flashes to steam and immediately meets metallic <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging,</b> which is typical of most primary systems. With the typical crack scenario recreated it is now important to add sensors that will detect conditions associated with a small leak. These sensors are either mounted on or around the lagging material. The parameters that are monitored include vibrations, acoustics, thermal variations, moisture change, air flow and pressure adjustment leaving a predetermined outlet. The sensor outputs are pre-processed and the nonlinear data are applied to an artificial neural network, whereas the other data are applied to a digital logic system. The results showed that with 13 different leak rates, separated by only 1. 4 g/s the ANN was able to correctly differentiate and identify different leak sizes with a certainty of over 97 %. The results from all the analysis are further presented graphically through an Operator Advisory System. This informs the operator of the predicted leak size and location. All of the available sensor data relevant to the leak can be viewed and location of the leak is presented by a three dimensional model of the reactor system.

Key contents such as analysis of data time interval, solving of mean value, establishment of regression model, and model online prediction were introduced and the established prediction model was used in the quality prediction and iteration control of reducing pipe. It is shown through experiment and simulation that the prediction and iteration control method based on EOS-ELM-RPLS model can effectively improve the quality of steel reducing pipe, and, moreover, its maintenance cost was low and it has good characteristics of real time, reliability, and high accuracy...|$|R
5000|$|Copper piping, {{commonly}} used to carry natural gas and water, reacts with concrete over a long period, slowly degrading until the pipe fails. This can lead to what is {{commonly referred to as}} slab leaks. These occur when pipes begin to leak from within the slab. Signs of a slab leak range from unexplained dampened carpet spots, to drops in water pressure and wet discoloration on exterior foundation walls. [...] Copper <b>pipes</b> must be <b>lagged</b> (that is, insulated) or run through a conduit or plumbed into the building above the slab. Electrical conduits through the slab need to be water-tight, as they extend below ground level and can potentially expose the wiring to groundwater.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} damage {{detection}} {{based on the}} propagation of guided wave in bimetal composite pipes, which can identify damage locations in both axial and circumferential directions. The feasibility of the method is showed by numerical simulations using FEM code ANSYS. Mode analysis is {{used to evaluate the}} guided wave mode and its structure, which can provide the basis of the mode selection in measurements scheme. The guided wave propagation in a damaged pipe is computed by transient analysis. 16 nodes around the pipe wall, as probes, are used to record the guided wave signal. When Pseudo Margenauâ€”Hill distribution (PMHD) for each signal is carried out, three types of modes could be found, which are led mode, excited mode and lag mode in sequences. Based on the results, the arrival time of the excited mode could be used to locate damage in axial direction, and the energy distribution around the <b>pipe</b> of <b>lag</b> mode is consistent with the damage in circumferential direction. The simulation illustrated the possibility of detecting damage location in both axial and circumferential directions based on longitudinal ultrasonic guided waves only...|$|R
40|$|Pipe laggings {{are used}} {{as a means of}} {{inhibiting}} the transmission of sound radiated from pipes. They are usually formed of porous jackets such as fibreglass or rockwool blankets and impervious jackets such as cladding sheets. Sometimes air spaces are used to separate these jackets from the pipe and each other. Papers in the readily available literature relating to the acoustic performance of pipe laggings are generally concerned with presenting experimental results such as frequency dependent insertion losses. The authors have developed a model to calculate the insertion losses produced by such laggings when the <b>lagged</b> <b>pipes</b> are vibrating in their low order structural modes. The results of the model indicate that negative insertion lossess are not unexpected with conventional pipe laggings, particularly at low frequencies...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} storage-runoff dynamics, transient groundwater responses {{were examined in}} one of the steep watersheds in British Columbiaâ€™s coastal mountains. Streamflow and piezometric data were collected for 1 year to determine the spatial and temporal relations between transient groundwater levels and discharge. Correlations between piezometer responses and lag-time analysis were used to identify and {{better understand}} runoff generation mechanisms in this watershed. Results showed a large spatial and temporal variation in transient water table dynamics and indicated that two distinct zones existed: a lower hillslope zone and an upslope zone. Each zone was characterized by very different water table responses. The upper hillslope was disconnected from the stream for the majority of time, suggesting that during most events, it does not directly contribute to streamflow. Piezometers in the lower hillslope zone showed hydrologically limited responses, suggesting rapid subsurface flow, likely through the many macropores and soil <b>pipes.</b> The <b>lag</b> time between peak streamflow and peak groundwater level decreased with increasing antecedent moisture conditions and was more variable for piezometers further away from the stream than for piezometers close to the stream. The study results indicate that a single storage-runoff model is not appropriate for this steep watershed and that a two- or three-compartment model would be more suitable...|$|R
40|$|Pipelines of noisy air or {{steam flow}} systems are often lagged {{on the outside}} with an acoustically absorptive, highly porous {{material}} {{which in turn is}} covered with a thin impervious (metallic) jacket. Prediction of transverse insertion loss (reduction in break-out noise) due to this composite lagging is the subject of the present paper. A transfer matrix for the porous absorptive layer is derived for cylindrical waves in the radial direction. Making use of an impedance model, radial velocities of the bare pipe and the outer jacket for the <b>lagged</b> <b>pipe</b> are calculated. These are then combined with respective radiation impedances to calculate insertion loss due to the composite lagging as well as the bare (unconstrained) lagging. Predicted values of insertion loss are compared with the measured values from literature. Finally results of parametric studies are presented...|$|R
50|$|The Do 217 was a shoulder-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. Its two-spar wing {{was built}} in three sections: the centre section, incorporating part of the fuselage, and two outer wing sections with very little taper on the leading and trailing edges, leading out {{to a pair of}} broad, semi-circular wing tips. The stress bearing skin was riveted to spars and ribs. Owing to its future use as a dive-bomber, stressed skin construction was employed with the use of Z-section frames and stringers. Slotted ailerons were fitted to the outer wing sections. The inner split flaps were electrically operated and had a maximum flap angle of 55Â°. The ailerons were linked to the flap system to permit partial operation as flaperons, meaning if the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped down.The design of the rear and front spar attachments revealed the flanges of the spar were flushed with the wing surface making the most efficient structure. The outer wing leading edges were double-skinned. In the wing space, a hot air feed was fitted, using heat pumped through <b>lagged</b> <b>pipes</b> from the engines to warm up and de-ice the wings. The ducts were located just forward of the front spar flanges and in between the main spars where they could escape into the wing. The hot air could escape through the apertures at the aileron hinges. A diversion pipe was also installed in the engine nacelle, which could shut down the hot air flow to the ducts and divert the air out through bottom end of the nacelle if de-icing was not required.The fuel and oil tanks were located in the wing and centre section. The two outer fuel tanks were located next to the outer side of the engine nacelle. The outermost fuel tank contained a 160 L fuel capacity, while the tank closest to the engine could accommodate 44 imp gal of oil. Both were sandwiched in between the main and rear main spar. Between the fuselage and inner side of the engine nacelle, the 795 L main tanks were located. In the centre section a 1050 L fuel tank was installed forward of the bomb bay.|$|R
