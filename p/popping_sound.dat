25|$|Bombardier beetles are ground beetles (Carabidae) in {{the tribes}} Brachinini, Paussini, Ozaenini, or Metriini—more than 500 species altogether—which are most notable {{for the defense}} {{mechanism}} that gives them their name: when disturbed, they eject a hot noxious chemical spray {{from the tip of}} their abdomen with a <b>popping</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
25|$|Donald Cameron, 51, was {{the captain}} and Claude Ouimet, 34, served as first officer. Both were {{experienced}} pilots – Cameron had accrued approximately 13,000 flight hours and Ouimet had 5,650 hours. While flying over Louisville, Kentucky, an in-flight fire started in or around the rear lavatory of the aircraft. The pilots heard a <b>popping</b> <b>sound</b> around 18:51 EDT (22:51 UTC), during dinner service, and discovered that the lavatory's circuit breakers had tripped. It was not uncommon, however, for a plane's lavatory circuits to pop occasionally, precipitated by the volume of passengers using the toilet after eating, so Cameron waited around eight minutes to give the tripped circuits time to cool down before attempting to reactivate them at 18:59.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a <b>popping</b> <b>sound,</b> to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|E

2500|$|This {{reaction}} is very [...] exothermic, and the released energy raises {{the temperature of}} the mixture to near 100°C, vaporizing about a fifth of it. The resultant pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close, thus protecting the beetle's internal organs. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid is expelled violently through an outlet valve, with a loud <b>popping</b> <b>sound.</b> The beetles' glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator. The main component of the beetle spray is 1,4-Benzoquinone, which is particularly irritating to the eyes and the respiratory system.|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of combining {{the contents of}} partly used glass bottles of ketchup is known as [...] "marrying the ketchup". Although discouraged by Heinz, the practice continues in some restaurants that use the glass bottle. Since it is impractical to use the entire contents of a bottle, and since diners may prefer to have a bottle of ketchup that appears full, restaurants are left with multiple partly-empty bottles {{at the end of}} each day. Restaurant staff, sometimes with the aid of purpose-built devices, combine the contents of several bottles into a single bottle, creating the appearance of a full bottle of ketchup. A new bottle of ketchup will open with a <b>popping</b> <b>sound,</b> while [...] "married" [...] ketchup will not.|$|E
2500|$|Preventing {{stolen bases}} by {{throwing}} to second base or third base to allow an infielder to tag a baserunner attempting {{to reach the}} base. A catcher who {{is very good at}} preventing stolen bases is said to have a low stolen-base percentage; a poor one has many bases stolen while he catches. (A pitcher who is slow to deliver is often more at fault for stolen bases than the catcher is.) Ideally, a catcher {{should be able to get}} the ball from his glove to that of the player covering second base in under two seconds. This is referred to as a catcher's [...] "pop time", the time elapsing between the <b>popping</b> <b>sound</b> of the pitch striking the catcher's mitt and the similar pop when the ball arrives at the glove of the fielder covering second base.|$|E
2500|$|The Sansa Shaker is a {{screenless}} {{digital audio}} player {{and comes in}} colors of blue, red, white, and pink with an SD card slot. One 512MB or 1GB card is included, and cards up to 4GB (non-SDHC) can be used. The tubular design {{is intended to be}} kid-friendly, and the player resembles a saltshaker, as it will randomly skip one, two or three songs when shaken. The Shaker plays up to 10 hours of continuous audio with a AAA battery, and has twin headphone jacks and a built-in speaker. The upper controller band adjusts volume and the lower controller band skips to next/previous song or fast forwards/rewinds the current song when held. Unlike other players, the only supported audio file format is MP3. When the memory card is removed during playback, the player emits an [...] "uh-oh" [...] sound. When the player's memory card is put back in, it emits a <b>popping</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Because the {{accident}} {{occurred in the}} United States, it was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Though the fuselage was nearly destroyed by {{the intensity of the}} fire, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were still in good condition and produced vital data for the NTSB investigation. On the CVR, NTSB investigators heard eight sounds of electrical arcing—likely inaudible to the crew—beginning at 18:48 CDT. Three minutes later, at 18:51, the popping sounds that Cameron and Ouimet later identified as the left toilet circuit breaker tripping are audible on the CVR. [...] Cameron attempted to reset the circuits twice in the next 60 seconds, but the CVR records the breakers immediately popping again after each reset attempt. Cameron attempted once more to reset the breakers at 18:59. The CVR records arcing sounds followed by the <b>popping</b> <b>sound</b> of the breakers continuing to trip again after each reset over the next 60 seconds. At 19:02, the CVR records flight attendant Judi Davidson entering the cockpit to deliver the first report of a possible fire in the lavatory. Though a number of wires in the lavatory section were later found with insulation stripped away, NTSB investigators were unable to determine whether this insulation damage was the cause of the fire or was caused by the fire.|$|E
2500|$|Typical for {{the ancient}} beetle {{suborder}} Adephaga {{to which they}} belong, they have paired pygidial glands in the lower back of the abdomen. These are well developed in ground beetles, and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators. In some, commonly known as bombardier beetles, these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion, producing a loud <b>popping</b> <b>sound</b> and a cloud of hot and acrid gas which can injure small mammals, such as shrews, and is liable to kill invertebrate predators outright. To humans, getting [...] "bombed" [...] by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has evolved independently twice as it seems – in the flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) which {{are among the most}} ancient ground beetles, and in the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae) which are part of a more [...] "modern" [...] lineage. The Anthiini, though, can mechanically squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in Afrikaans, they are known as [...] ("eye-pissers"). In {{one of the very few}} known cases of a vertebrate mimicking an arthropod, juvenile Heliobolus lugubris lizards are colored similar to the aposematic oogpister beetles, and move in a way that makes them look surprisingly similar to the insects at a casual glance.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is known}} to be able to conjure Gubraithian fire (magical {{everlasting}} fire). He has claimed to be able to become invisible without using an invisibility cloak, which is a powerful Disillusionment Charm. Dumbledore is also skilled in Occlumency and Legilimency. Dumbledore is an expert at Transfiguration too, having taught the subject before becoming headmaster. He frequently creates complex objects like sofa chairs out of thin air (or from less comfortable chairs). Dumbledore is also proficient at Charms and Potions; according to the obituary written by Elphias Doge, his papers were published in journals such as Achievements in Charming and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore is famous for defeating Grindelwald, who is second on a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time only to Voldemort himself, in a [...] "spectacular duel of legend", succeeding in doing so despite the fact that Grindelwald possessed the Elder Wand, which supposedly guarantees invincibility in duels due to its power. His skill at duelling is further shown when he calmly engages Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, overpowering him and eventually forcing him to possess Harry to be spared from total defeat. (It is known in retrospect that Dumbledore possessed the Elder Wand when duelling Voldemort, having taken it from Grindelwald.) Unlike most wizards who make a distinct <b>popping</b> <b>sound</b> when they apparate Dumbledore notably is able to apparate silently; the only other wizard shown to possess this skill is Voldemort. Dumbledore {{is known to}} be able to understand Mermish and Gobbledegook (Goblin language) and Parseltongue.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{majority}} of scallops are free-living and can swim with brief bursts of speed to escape predators (mostly starfish) by rapidly opening and closing their valves. [...] Indeed, everything about their characteristic shell shape – its symmetry, narrowness, smooth and/ or grooved surface, small flexible hinge, powerful adductor muscle, and continuous and uniformly curved edge – facilitates such activity. They often do this in spurts of several seconds before closing the shell entirely and sinking back {{to the bottom of}} their environment. Scallops are able to move through the water column either forward/ ventrally (termed swimming) by sucking water in through the space between their valves, an area called the gape, and ejecting it through small holes near the hinge line called exhalant apertures, or backward/ dorsally (termed jumping) by ejecting the water out the same way it came in (i.e., ventrally). [...] A jumping scallop will usually land on the sea floor between each contraction of its valves, whereas a swimming scallop will stay in the water column for most or all of its contractions and will travel a much greater distance (though seldom at a height of more than one meter off the sea bed and seldom for a distance of greater than five meters). [...] Both jumping and swimming movements are very energy-intensive and most scallops cannot perform more than four or five in a row before becoming completely exhausted and requiring several hours of rest. Should a swimming scallop land on its left side, it is capable of flipping itself over to its right side via a similar shell-clapping movement called the righting reflex. So-called singing scallops are rumored to make an audible, soft <b>popping</b> <b>sound</b> as they flap their shells underwater (though whether or not this happens is open to some debate). [...] Other scallops can extend their foot from between their valves, and by contracting the muscles in their foot, they can burrow into sand.|$|E
