40|$|The {{three basic}} types of nuclear power-plants (solid, liquid, and gas core) are {{compared}} on {{the bases of}} performance potential {{and the status of}} current technology. The solid-core systems are expected to have impulses in the range of 850 seconds, any thrust level (as long as it is greater than 10, 000 pounds (44, 480 newtons)), and thrust-to-engine-weight ratios of 2 to 20 pounds per pound (19. 7 to 197 newtons per kilogram). There is negligible or no fuel loss from the solid-core system. The solid-core system, of course, has had the most work done on it. Large-scale tests have been performed on a breadboard engine that has produced specific impulses greater than 700 seconds at thrust levels of about 50, 000 pounds (222, 000 newtons). The liquid-core reactor would be interesting in the specific impulse range of 1200 to 1500 seconds. Again, any thrust level can be obtained depending on how big or small the reactor is made. The thrust-to-engine weight ratio for these systems would be in the range of 1 to 10. The discouraging feature of the liquid-core system is the high fuel-loss ratio anticipated. Values of 0. 01 to <b>0.</b> 1 <b>pound</b> (<b>0.</b> 00454 to 0. 0454 kilograms) or uranium loss per <b>pound</b> (<b>0.</b> <b>454</b> kilograms) of hydrogen are expected, if impulses in the range of 1200 to 1500 seconds are desired. The gas-core reactor shows specific impulses in the range of 1500 to 2500 seconds. The thrust levels should be at least as high as the weight so that the thrust-to-weight ratio does not go below 1. Because the engine weight is not expected to be under 100, 000 pounds (444, 800 newtons), thrust levels higher than 100, 000 pounds (448, 000 newtons) are of interest. The thrust-to-engine weights, in that case, would run from 1 to 20 pounds per pound (9. 8 to 19. 7 kilograms). Gas-core reactors tend to be very large, and can have high thrust-to-weight ratios. As {{in the case of the}} liquid-core system, the fuel loss that will be attendant with gas cores as envisioned today will be rather high. The loss rates will be 0. 01 to <b>0.</b> 1 <b>pound</b> of uranium (<b>0.</b> 00454 to 0. 0454 kilograms) for each <b>pound</b> (<b>0.</b> <b>454</b> kilograms) of hydrogen...|$|R
40|$|The {{three basic}} {{quantities}} from which most other mechanical units are derived are mass, length, and time. Physicists commonly {{prefer to use}} the system of units known as SI (Systeme Internationale in French), or metric units. SI units for these quantities are the kilogram for mass, the meter for length, and the second for time. According to the reference volume A Physicist's Desk Reference, these units are defined as follows- meter (symbol m) - "The meter is the length of path travelled by light in vacuum during the time interval 1 / 299, 792, 458 of a second. " kilogram (symbol kg) - "The kilogram is the unit of mass, it {{is equal to the}} mass of the international prototype of the kilogram. " (The international prototype is a platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the BIPM in Sevres, France.) second (symbol s) - "The second is the duration of 9, 192, 631, 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium- 133 atom. " This video aims to help clarify the meter unit by comparing a meter stick with the commonly used yardstick, which has been marked off in units of one inch. A kilogram mass is also compared with a one-pound weight of the same material. The conversions between SI units and common English units are- 1 m = 3. 28 ft = 39. 4 in 1 ft = 0. 305 m = 30. 5 cm 1 kg = 2. 2 lb 1 lb = <b>0.</b> <b>454</b> <b>kg</b> = <b>454...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Directional {{preferences}} during center-out horizontal shoulder-elbow {{movements were}} previously established {{for both the}} dominant and non-dominant arm {{with the use of}} a free-stroke drawing task that required random selection of movement directions. While the preferred directions were mirror-symmetrical in both arms, they were attributed to a tendency specific for the dominant arm to simplify control of interaction torque by actively accelerating one joint and producing largely passive motion at the other joint. No conclusive evidence has been obtained in support of muscle effort minimization as a contributing factor to the directional preferences. Here, we tested whether distal load changes directional preferences, making the influence of muscle effort minimization on the selection of movement direction more apparent. Methods The free-stroke drawing task was performed by the dominant and non-dominant arm with no load and with <b>0.</b> <b>454</b> <b>kg</b> load at the wrist. Motion of each arm was limited to rotation of the shoulder and elbow in the horizontal plane. Directional histograms of strokes produced by the fingertip were calculated to assess directional preferences in each arm and load condition. Possible causes for directional preferences were further investigated by studying optimization across directions of a number of cost functions. Results Preferences in both arms to move in the diagonal directions were revealed. The previously suggested tendency to actively accelerate one joint and produce passive motion at the other joint was supported in both arms and load conditions. However, the load increased the tendency to produce strokes in the transverse diagonal directions (perpendicular to the forearm orientation) in both arms. Increases in required muscle effort caused by the load suggested that the higher frequency of movements in the transverse directions represented increased influence of muscle effort minimization on the selection of movement direction. This interpretation was supported by cost function optimization results. Conclusions While without load, the contribution of muscle effort minimization was minor, and therefore, not apparent, the load revealed this contribution by enhancing it. Unlike control of interaction torque, the revealed tendency to minimize muscle effort was independent of arm dominance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Weight {{control and}} dieting {{is a subject}} of great {{interest}} to the American public. The use of pharmacolo-gically active agents to help take weight off and keep it off has ranged from following the golden rules of moderation, not eating to excess, and following a regular plan of exercise. Many people are unable or unwilling to maintain these well-known practices and have sought out chemical means of assisting them is losing weight and keeping it off. The sympathomimetics have a powerfully effective appetite suppres-sion, but also have a long list of serious and habituating adverse effects. Many diets have employed spe-cific schedules and types of food to eat or avoid, but there is no diet employing drugs that is completely safe and effective. One new diet, Fen-Phen represents a new approach. Instead of using a single agent, a combination of two agents is used which affects the brain’s neurotransmitters. The results have been impressive so far, but the adverse effects of these two agents and their use and possible interaction with other drugs remains a risk. WEIGHT CONTROL AND DIET HIS ARTICLE FOCUSES attention on an T area of nutrition in which the public is ex-posed to a great deal of fraudulent and danger-ous information and treatment. Through understanding the mechanisms of obesity and the safe and effective treatments, the pharnia-cist will be {{in a better position to}} counseI the patient and avoid unnecessary harm to the patient. Obesity is the pathological accumulation of fat in excess of that needed for normal body functioning. * From a practical viewpoint, obesity may be defined as the physical state where body weight in relation to height is more than 20 % above the ideal, caused by caloric in-take exceeding caloric expenditure. Table 1 lists desirable weights for men and women, according to frame size. 3 It takes 3, 500 excess calories to result in <b>0.</b> <b>454</b> <b>kg</b> (1 Ib) of fat.
