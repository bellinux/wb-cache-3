30|$|According to its {{critical}} {{state of conservation}} due {{to the passage of}} time and use but also to earthquakes and the humidity caused by the “altiplanic winter”, which causes rains between December and March, the mural paintings showed detachment of polychromy and plaster as well as warpings. The church was restored integrally with funds from the Regional Government, executed by Fundación Altiplano, between January 2016 and January 2017. The restoration proceedings were non-invasive and a lab was installed in situ. For the consolidation or re-adhesion of the polychromy and plasters, “mucilajo”, a mixture of <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>chopped</b> Opuntia cactus in water (with addition of peeled garlic) was used. Only the unstable warpings were treated by injection of a mortar and brick powder, micro-spheres, sodium hexametaphosphate dissolved in water, and “mucilajo”.|$|E

50|$|Per Thomas Keller's recipe, a pipérade {{is made of}} <b>peeled,</b> finely <b>chopped,</b> <b>and</b> reduced peppers, yellow onions, tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. The piperade {{is spread}} thinly in a baking tray or {{casserole}} dish, then layered on top with evenly sized, thinly sliced rounds of zucchini, yellow squash, Japanese eggplant, and roma tomatoes, covered in parchment paper, then baked slowly for several hours to steam the vegetables. The parchment is removed so that the vegetables may then roast, acquiring additional flavor through caramelization. To serve, the piperade is formed into a small mound, and the rounds arranged in a fanned-out pattern to cover the piperade base. A balsamic vinaigrette is drizzled on the plate, which may be garnished.|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} {{fresh fruits and}} {{vegetables}} is increasing rapidly. During the last 10 years, per capita con-sumption of fresh produce has grown by more than 10 % in the United States. Estimated sales in 1993 were over $ 62 billion (Rice, 1995). This increase has led to a relatively new market for minimally or lightly processed, fresh-like fruits and veg-etables. Some of these products are conveniently sold as pre-cut, prepared, and pre-packaged. Much research has been done to find the optimum condi-tions for whole fruits and vegetables, but only limited infor-mation is available on fresh cut and other minimally processed products.

40|$|Kitchen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects in our life. We wait eagerly for the delicious foodstuffs of our kitch-enette. However, many simple but repetitive kitchen activities can be a threat to our health. Such as <b>peeling</b> potatoes, <b>chopping,</b> <b>and</b> picking up heavy pots and kettles, overstretching to reach to utensils or ingredients etc. can cause or ag-gravate pain & discomfort in hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder and neck (Physical hazards). Musculoskeletal problems are not only the one, but various accidents also happen in domestic kitchen (Mechanical Hazards). Traumatic and repetitive injuries related to kitchen tasks include lacerations, cut, slips & falls, tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, thermal strains, burn etc. Those menaces generally occur due to poor ergonomics, as poor work practices, poor quality equipment and poorly maintained equipment. Key Words: Domestic kitchen, physical hazards, mechanical hazards Kitchen, “Meals & Memories are made here”; and defi-nitely we expect beautiful memories to spark. But the numbers of hazards are significantly higher in the kitchen than in the other high-risk rooms [1]. Accidents in domestic kitchen happen gener-ally due to poor ergonomics.
