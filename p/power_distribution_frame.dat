50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{two-phase}} <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> {{scheme for}} supporting quality-of-service (QoS) and best effort traffic is proposed. We first formulate the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for QoS traffic as an optimization problem {{so that the}} number of simultaneously transmitting connections is maximized. Optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> is difficult to implement in practice due to both the computational complexity and the requirement for global information about the mobile station (MS) locations, connection channel conditions, and traffic load in the system. We then propose a heuristic scheme of <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for soft handoff (SHO) connections. The full scheme includes an initial <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> (IPD) and a <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> adjustment (PDA). IPD allocates BS power resource based on the channel condition of each individual connection, while PDA further coordinates the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> between neighboring base stations (BSs) in order to accommodate more connections. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can achieve a capacity close to that of the optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution,</b> while providing much higher transmission throughput for best effort data traffic. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can be applied to existing SHO schemes for efficient BS power resource usage. The scheme does not require global information, and its implementation can be further simplified by performing IPD only with slight performance degradation.

40|$|Abstract—On-chip <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids with {{multiple}} supply voltages {{are discussed in}} this paper. Two types of interdigitated and paired <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids {{with multiple}} supply voltages and multiple grounds are presented. Analytic models are also developed to estimate the loop inductance in four types of proposed power delivery schemes. Two proposed schemes, fully and pseudo-interdigitated power delivery, reduce power supply voltage drops as compared to conventional interdigitated <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> systems with dual supplies and a single ground by, on average, 15. 3 % and 0. 3 %, respectively. The performance of the proposed on-chip <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids is compared to a reference <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid with a single supply and a single ground. The voltage drop in fully interdigitated and fully paired <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids with multiple supplies and multiple grounds is reduced, on average, by 2. 7 % and 2. 3 %, respectively, {{as compared to the}} voltage drop of an interdigitated <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid with a single supply and a single ground. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids are a better alternative to a single supply voltage and a single ground <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> system. On-chip resonances in <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids with decoupling capacitors are intuitively explained in this paper, and circuit design implications are provided.

40|$|Abstract — The size of on-chip <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> {{networks}} {{is increasing}} with each technology generation. Accurate and computationally efficient {{analysis of these}} <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> networks has therefore become increasingly challenging. High performance <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> networks are generally implemented as a uniform mesh structure. The uniformity of these <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> networks can be exploited for fast, accurate nodal analysis. A closed form expression is presented here for determining the voltage at any arbitrary node in a <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> network. The error of the proposed method as compared with SPICE is less than 0. 2 %. Since no iterations are required, the proposed method significantly outperforms previously proposed power grid analysis techniques in terms of computational speed while exhibiting low error. I...|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of strong mode-mixing, high order mode {{filtering}} is the primary remaining mechanism for potential change of an input mode <b>power</b> <b>distribution.</b> If a well-aligned laser is the optical source, the mode <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> is highly concentrated in the lowest order modes, and remains essentially unchanged with distance {{due to the lack}} of mode-mixing. If an optical source that overfills the fibre is used, only the highest order guided mode group experiences excess attenuation, and the mode <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> becomes slightly filtered as a result. (Mandrel wrapping is a viable method to artificially create this state.) Such mode <b>power</b> <b>distributions</b> are stationary; neither changes with fibre length, but equilibrium does not exist in either case because the distributions remain dependent on the input <b>power</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|R
