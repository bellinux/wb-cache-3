Under QR policy, a retailer can collect market {{information from the}} sales of a <b>pre-seasonal</b> product whose demand {{is closely related to}} a seasonal product's demand.

40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) {{is characterized}} by a Th 2 polarized immune response, and specific immunotherapy modifies this arrangement, restoring a physiologic Th 1 profile. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is widely prescribed. The aim of the study is to evaluate two different methods for assessing IFN-γ, namely ELISPOT and ELISA, before and after a <b>pre-seasonal</b> SLIT course as marker for Th 1 response. Thirty-eight AR patients with pollen allergy assumed <b>pre-seasonal</b> SLIT for 3 months. Patients' blood samples for assessing IFN-γ serum levels were collected before initiating SLIT (baseline - T 0), after 3 months <b>pre-seasonal</b> SLIT course (T 1), and three months after completion of SLIT (T 2). IFN-γ-specific producing cells, after allergen stimulation, were assessed by cytokine ELISPOT at the same time points. IFN-γ-specific producing cells significantly increased after SLIT both at T 1 and T 2 (p= 0. 0002). On the contrary, ELISA assessment did not reveal an increase in IFN-γ serum levels at any time point.

40|$|Background Birch pollen {{is highly}} {{allergic}} {{and has the}} potential for episodically long range transport. Such episodes will in general occur out of the main pollen season. During that time allergy patients are unprotected and high pollen concentrations will therefore have a full allergenic impact. Objective To show that Denmark obtains significant quantities of birch pollen from Poland or Germany before the local trees start to flower. Methods Simultaneous observations of pollen concentrations and phenology in the potential source area in Poland as well as in Denmark were performed in 2006. The Danish pollen records from 2000 - 2006 were analysed for possible long range transport episodes and analysed with trajectories in combination with a birch tree source map. Results In 2006 high pollen concentrations were observed in Denmark with bi-hourly concentrations above 500 grains/ m 3 before the local trees began to flower. Poland was identified as a source region. The analysis of the historical pollen record from Copenhagen shows significant <b>pre-seasonal</b> pollen episodes almost every year from 2000 - 2006. In all episodes trajectory analysis identified Germany or Poland as source regions. Conclusion Denmark obtains significant <b>pre-seasonal</b> quantities of birch pollen from either Poland or Germany almost every year. Forecasting of birch pollen quantities relevant to allergy patients must therefore take into account long-range transport. This cannot be based on measured concentrations in Denmark. The most effective way to improve the current Danish pollen forecasts is to extend the current forecasts with atmospheric transport models that take into account pollen emission and transport from countries such as Germany and Poland. Unless long range transport is taken into account <b>pre-seasonal</b> pollen episodes will have a full allergic impact, as the allergy patients in general will be unprotected during that time...|$|E

40|$|Background: in the {{investigation}} of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (SAR), quantitative skin and conjunctival allergen challenge tests may be used as a way of measuring individual allergen sensitivity. These tests are reproducible and relate well to prevalence, but their relationship to symptom severity is less well established. Objective: we wished to determine if quantitative skin prick tests (QSPT) and conjunctival provocation tests (CPTs) using a single grass pollen allergen extract are reproducible and predict symptom severity in SAR. Methods: we retrospectively analysed data from 91 participants in a previously published randomised placebo controlled study of low dosage allergen immunotherapy who were randomised to receive placebo treatment. We examined the relationship between <b>pre-seasonal</b> QSPT, CPT and SAR symptoms. Results: we found a high level of reproducibility when repeated measures were compared for both the QSPT (p < 0. 001) and the CPT (p < 0. 001) and moderate correlation (0. 493) between the standard skin prick test (SPT) and the QSPT (p< 0. 001). We found weak negative correlation (- 0. 27) between the QSPT and the CPT (p< 0. 001). We found no correlation between seasonal symptom, use of rescue medication or quality of life (QOL) scores and <b>pre-seasonal</b> QSPT or CPT. Conclusion: in the assessment of seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis, quantitative skin and conjunctival allergen challenge tests are strongly reproducible, although there is no correlation between these tests and seasonal symptom, use of rescue medication or QOL scores. <br/...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAllergen {{immunotherapy}} (AIT) is a guidelines-approved, disease-modifying treatment {{option for}} respiratory allergies, including allergic rhinitis (AR) induced by pollen. The various AIT regimens employed {{to date in}} pollen-induced AR can be classified as continuous (i. e. year-round) or discontinuous (i. e. <b>pre-seasonal</b> alone, co-seasonal alone or pre-and co-seasonal). Pre-and co-seasonal regimens are typically used for sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) and have economic and compliance advantages over perennial (year-round) regimens. However, these advantages must not come at the expensive of poor efficacy or safety. The results of recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials show that pre-and co-seasonal SLIT is safe and effective in patients with AR induced by grass pollen (treated with a tablet formulation) or by birch pollen (treated with a liquid formulation). Progress in SLIT {{has been made in}} defining the optimal dose of major allergen, the administration frequency (daily), the duration of <b>pre-seasonal</b> treatment (four months) and the number of treatment seasons (at least three). Post-marketing, " real-life " trials of pre-and co-seasonal birch or grass pollen SLIT regimens have confirmed the efficacy and safety observed in the clinical trials. In the treatment of pollen-induced AR, pre-and co-seasonal SLIT regimens appear to be at least as effective and safe as perennial SLIT regimens, and are associated with lower costs and good compliance. Good compliance may mean that pre-and co-seasonal SLIT regimens are inherently more effective and safer than perennial SLIT regimens. When considering the pre-and co-seasonal discontinuous regimen in particular, a 300 IR five-grass-pollen formulation is the only SLIT tablet with a clinical development programme having provided evidence of short-term, sustained and post-treatment efficacy...|$|E

Australian native arboreal pollen (ANAP), shed by taxa belonging to the families Cupressaceae, Casuarinaceae and Myrtaceae accounts for 18. 4 % of the total annual pollen count and is distributed in the atmosphere during the entire year with maximum loads restricted to the months May through November. Daily counts within the range 11 - 100 grains m- 3 occurred over short intervals each year and were recorded on 100 days during the five-year sampling period. Total seasonal ANAP concentrations varied each year, with highest annual values measured for the family Cupressaceae, for which greater seasonal frequencies were shown {{to be related to}} <b>pre-seasonal</b> precipitation (r 2 = 0. 76, p = 0. 05). Seasonal start dates were near consistent for the Cupressaceae and Casuarinaceae. Myrtaceae start dates were variable and established to be directly related to lower average <b>pre-seasonal</b> maximum temperature (r 2 = 0. 78, p = 0. 04). Associations between daily ANAP loads and weather parameters showed that densities of airborne Cupressaceae and Casuarinaceae pollen were negatively correlated with maximum temperature (p < 0. 0001), minimum temperature (p < 0. 0001) and precipitation (p < 0. 05), whereas associations with daily Myrtaceae pollen counts were not statistically significant. This is the first study to be conducted in Australia that has assessed the relationships between weather parameters and the airborne distribution of pollen emitted by Australian native arboreal species. Pollen shed by Australian native Cupressaceae, Casuarinaceae and Myrtaceae species are considered to be important aeroallergens overseas, however their significance as a sensitising source in Australia remains unclear and requires further investigation.

Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) was collected immediately before the first and immediately after the last injections (t 1 and t 2), during the pollen season (t 3) and after (t 4) the pollen season. EBC was analyzed to determine the levels of pH and 8 -isoprostane. Ten Parietaria-sensitive asthmatics served as the untreated control group at t 1 and t 2.

40|$|A {{statistical}} model for predicting seasonal tropical cyclone landfalls in Queensland, Australia using {{an index of}} the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is presented. The approach uses a generalised linear model (GLM) to relate seasonal counts to the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). A Bayesian methodology is employed to estimate parameters of the model. The available tropical cyclone record is first separated into historical (1910 / 1911 – 1959 / 1960) and instrumental (1960 / 1961 – 2004 / 2005) eras. Historical counts, which {{are considered to be}} less reliable observational sources, are used to specify informative prior distributions when fitting the GLM to instrumental counts with the Bayesian approach. The inclusion of historical information is found to lead to increased certainty in parameter estimates when compared to a model where historical counts are excluded and a non-informative prior model used. Predictive distributions are given, which allow inferences on seasonal landfall activity, given <b>pre-seasonal</b> values of the SOI. A cross-validation procedure shows that the model incorporating historical information outperforms, in terms of mean-squared prediction error, both the non-informative prior model and a model without the SOI-predictor (climatology). A trend analysis highlights possible decadal variability in the relationship between ENSO and seasonal tropical cyclone activity. Copyright 2007 Roya...|$|E

We explored {{the performances of}} methods dedicated to big data analysis for detecting independent associations between exposures and a health outcome. Methods: We searched for associations between 303 covariates and influenza infection in 498 subjects (14 % infected) sampled from a dedicated cohort. Independent associations were detected using two data mining methods, the Random Forests (RF) and the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT); the conventional logistic regression framework (Univariate Followed by Multivariate Logistic Regression -UFMLR) and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with penalty in multivariate logistic regression to achieve a sparse selection of covariates. We developed permutations tests to assess the statistical significance of associations. We simulated 500 similar sized datasets to estimate the True (TPR) and False (FPR) Positive Rates associated with these methods. Results: Between 3 and 24 covariates (1 %- 8 %) were identified as associated with influenza infection depending on the method. The <b>pre-seasonal</b> haemagglutination inhibition antibody titer was the unique covariate selected with all methods while 266 (87 %) covariates were not selected by any method.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{described}} and analysed changes {{in the numbers of}} large ovarian follicles (diameter 6. 1 - 9. 0 cm) and in the plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol- 17 beta (E 2 beta) in relation to individual egg production figures of farmed ostriches (Struthio camelus spp.) throughout one year. Ultrasound scanning and blood sampling for plasma hormone analysis were performed in 9 hens on a monthly basis during the breeding season and in two periods of the non-breeding season. Our data demonstrated that: (1) large follicles were detected and LH concentrations were elevated already 1 month before first ovipositions of the egg production season took place; (2) E- 2 beta concentrations increased as soon as the egg production season started; (3) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations were elevated during the entire egg production season; and that (4) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations decreased simultaneous with or following the last ovipositions of the egg production season. By comparing these parameters during the egg production season with their pre-and post-seasonal values, significant differences were found in the numbers of large follicles and E- 2 beta concentrations between the <b>pre-seasonal,</b> seasonal and post-seasonal period; while LH concentrations were significantly different between the seasonal and post-seasonal period. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that changes in numbers of large follicles and in concentrations of LH and E- 2 beta closely parallel individual egg production figures and provide some new cues that egg production in ostriches is confined to a marked reproductive season. Moreover, our data provide indications that mechanism, initiating, maintaining and terminating the egg production season in farmed breeding ostriches are quite similar to those already known for other seasonal breeding bird species.

40|$|Climate {{is a major}} {{determinant}} of crop productivity. Besides its direct impact on plant growth it has a major effect on the prevalence and incidence of plant diseases. The sensitivity of pathogens to climate is pronounced. While the local climate determines the general pattern of prevailing pathogen populations, specific weather conditions are important drivers in distinct phases of the life cycles of pathogens such as dormancy and survival, asexual or sexual propagation, and infection and colonization of host plants. Knowledge about the impact of weather variables on pathogens and diseases is an important part in predictive crop protection strategies. There is considerable data available from the past 30 to 40 years on climate-disease relationships, which have been used to develop weather-based forecasting models with the aim of predicting epidemic severity to maximise economic use of pesticides. A large number of such models have been constructed for specific diseases to help farmers and advisers in making their decisions about crop protection to save unnecessary sprays. Such weather-based disease forecast models {{can also be used to}} simulate epidemic severity and/or the geographic spread of a particular pathogen under future climatic change scenarios. However, there are some important constraints in making climate change-disease projections, the first resulting from the large variability and uncertainty of current climate prediction models themselves. Further complicating factors arise from the fact that climate not only affects pathogen or pest populations directly but also induces changes in the crop production systems and cropping techniques (soil tillage, irrigation, sowing dates, cultivars, crop species) that indirectly alter the prevalence of pathogens or pests. It is difficult to separate direct from indirect climate effects. Climate change effects can be exemplified with major pathogens of oilseed rape. Greater mean temperatures may be associated with spread of phoma stem canker further north and altered temporal pattern of the fungal life cycle and disease stages in the UK. There is also some indication that sclerotinia stem rot, after mild winter conditions, may perform a <b>pre-seasonal</b> sclerotial stage. In addition, root infection has occurred more frequently with yet unknown relation to recent climate shifts. Yield losses from ascospore infections at early flowering stages may increase compared to late infections. Soil-borne diseases will specifically be affected by altered temperature profiles in the soils. After mild winters, V. longisporum caused greater yield losses in Germany. Clubroot has recently become a serious threat in Germany, but its relationship to recent climatic changes is still unknown. Research is needed to improve and combine climate and disease prediction models to provide a realistic forecast of disease risks associated with climate change. As climate models are likely to continue to lack sufficient accuracy, thorough surveillance of disease epidemics will be more crucial than ever before, in order to detect changes and adaptation in pathogen (and pest) populations and to establish the appropriate crop protection systems early enoug...|$|E
