Thus, bending radii down to 15. 5 mm and 6. 8 mm are achieved for the devices on 100 mu m and 50 mu m Si supports, respectively. The GMR magnitude remains unchanged at the level of (15. 3 +/- 0. 4) % independent of the support thickness and bending radius. However, a progressive broadening of the GMR curve is observed associated with the magnetostriction of the containing Ni 81 Fe 19 alloy, which is induced by the tensile bending strain generated {{on the surface of the}} Si membrane. An effective magnetostriction value of lambda(s) = 1. 7 x 10 (- 6) is estimated for the GMR stack. Cyclic bending experiments showed excellent reproducibility of the GMR curves during 100 bending cycles...|$|R

The structure of the coating is optimized considering three figures of merit: the average transmittance in the visible range for normal incidence, the normalized average transmittance for oblique incidence at 550 run, and the transmittance quality factor. The nanotechnology exploited for the deposition of the transparent metals is the dual ion beam sputtering. Tests of durability, optical transmission, and shielding effectiveness demonstrate that the film has a high adhesion under mechanical solicitation, high resistance against aging, peak transmittance in the visible range higher than 70 %, onmidirectional properties in the range 0 degrees- 60 degrees, and shielding effectiveness of 40 dB up to 6 GHz...|$|R

The static bending tests were realized with the wood saturated with water (green wood) and theequilibrium moisture content of 12 % (dry wood). The results indicate that the presence of water in the timber substantially reduces the values of elasticity and strength.

40|$|For Brazil it is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> a high local production share because of high import tax rates. The rim drive concept offers an alternative for expensive heliostat drive solutions with slew and linear drives from abroad. By (locally produced) rims the demands on the drives regarding strength and precision are reduced to a very low value and low cost drives can be used. Sandwich facets (which are usually foreseen for rim drive heliostats) are not available from Brazilian manufacturers and are replaced by a frame work steel structure with 4 mm glass mirrors. The mirrors are bended only about one axis to avoid too high stress of the mirrors when low focal lengths (e. g. 30 <b>m)</b> have <b>to</b> be <b>realized.</b> For an 8. 1 m² heliostat the mirror panel was divided into six stripes of 2. 5 m x 0. 54 m. The stripes have to be canted to reach a sufficiently small focal spot. An accordant heliostat was designed and built. High stiffness was reached and sufficient durability of the mirror facets against wind loads.

40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to study the perceptibility of color difference of color pairs, caused by OBA differences in paper substrates, and its relationship with quantitative measurement metrics. Based on the psychometric experiments conducted, the results show the utilization of the visual difference index (VDI), from 0 (no difference) to 3 (noticeable difference), to rate 27 color pairs with each pair prepared by the same colorants but different OBA amount in the substrates. The findings indicate that (a) printed colors {{are affected by the}} presence of OBA from no difference to noticeable difference, (b) âˆ†E 00 has a stronger linear correlation with visual color difference than âˆ†E*ab does, (c) there is no significant association between illumination levels and visual color difference.

It also defines âˆ†OBA as the OBA difference between any color pairs, including substrates.

Standard time was calculated {{on the basis of the}} mathematical model of multiple linear regression of effective time. The average team standard time for two cutters is 25. 92 min/m 3 and the average standard time for two tractors ranges between 25. 06 min/m 3 (150 m) and 33. 20 min/m 3 (650 m). Standard time of the cutter-inspector is 4. 93 min/m 3 and it was used as the basic unit.
