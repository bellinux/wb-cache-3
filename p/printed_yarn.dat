50|$|By {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, hand {{knitting}} was declining {{as part of}} the knitting industry but was increasingly a hobby. <b>Printed</b> patterns and <b>yarn</b> were produced for leisure as well as for industrial use by authors such as Jane Gaugain.|$|R
50|$|Jetpur {{is one of}} {{the largest}} centers for screen-printing, block <b>printing</b> and <b>yarn</b> dyeing {{workshops}} in the country. It is famous for cotton saree udyog and is major exporter of khanga and kitenge (fabrics used by native Africans for various use). Local industrialists Shri Gordhandas Karsanji Bosamia and Shri Chunilal Karsanji Bosamia of Jagdish Mills set up the first Textile Mill in Jetpur and later in Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Jetpur is a pleasure for textile enthusiasts who can visit and experience the process of printing and dyeing. The city is nicknamed Mini Dubai because of its vibrant commercial activity.|$|R
40|$|Handcrafted objects, such as knit scarves or sweaters, subtly {{signify the}} time and skill {{involved}} in their creation. Yet a handcraft artifact itself cannot convey the experience of its creation. We present the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of Spyn, a system for knitters to virtually weave stories into their creations. Using Spyn, a knitter can record, playback and share information involved {{in the creation of}} handknit products. Spyn uses patterns of infrared ink <b>printed</b> on <b>yarn</b> in combination with computer vision techniques to correlate locations in knit fabric with events recorded during the knitting process. Using Spyn, knitters can capture their activities as audio, image, video, and spatio-temporal data. When users photograph the knit material, the Spyn system analyzes the ink patterns on the material and visualizes events over the photograph of the knit. In the design of Spyn, we investigate the role that technology can play in preserving and sharing the handcraft process over space and time...|$|R

40|$|Wastewater {{effluents}} from {{textile industry}} mainly contain dyes {{used in the}} dyeing or <b>printing</b> of textiles <b>yarns</b> or fabrics. A lot of technologies can be adopted for dye removal from wastewaters, including biological treatments based on activated sludge, adsorption on activated carbon, or membrane processes. Nevertheless, none of these methods is performing toward all classes of dyes; treatment plants of great dimensions and difficult handling can be required, while cost can be prohibitive. In the present study, dye adsorption was performed on low cost fibrous cellulose materials, submitted to a cationization process using a quaternary ammonium reagent. These materials were characterized by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, while the treatment efficiency was investigated through exhaustion and kinetic adsorption tests toward anionic dyes, such as acid, direct, reactive, and a cationic dye. Comparisons were carried out between treated and untreated samples, and with activated carbon. Best results were obtained with cationized cotton, both in linters or ‘‘tulle'' fabric form, showing good performance toward all the investigated dyes. Tests in continuous flow confirmed the good behavior of these materials, but tulle fabric was better as filtration medium for a lower pressure drop. Finally, regeneration tests by bleaching were carried out finding that regenerated material maintained good adsorption powe...|$|R
6000|$|Life {{must still}} be haunted in Badenoch, as it was on Ida's hill, by forms of unearthly beauty, the goddess or the ghost yet wooing the shepherd; indeed, the boatman told me many stories of living superstition and terrors of the night; but why should I exhaust his wallet? To be sure, it seemed very full of tales; these offered here may be but the legends which came first to his hand. The boatman is not himself a believer in the fairy world, or not more than all {{sensible}} men ought to be. The supernatural is too pleasant a thing for us to discard in an earnest, scientific manner like Mr. Kipling's Aurelian McGubben. Perhaps I am more superstitious than the boatman, and the yarns I swopped with him about ghosts I have met would seem even more mendacious to possessors of pocket microscopes and of the modern spirit. But I would rather have one banshee story than fifteen pages of proof that [...] "life, which began as a cell, with a c, is to end as a sell, with an s." [...] It should be added that the boatman has given his consent to the <b>printing</b> of his <b>yarns.</b> On being offered a moiety of the profits, he observed {{that he had no}} objection to these, but that he entirely declined to be responsible for any share of the expenses. Would that all authors were as sagacious, for then the amateur novelist and the minor poet would vex us no more.|$|R
40|$|A Tale of the Stinging Nettle - Wall {{installation}} – knitted {{merino wool}} and bamboo yarn – concertina book 2009 Friederike Krishnabhakdi-Vasilakis Coming {{out of my}} research on the hierarchically perceived relationship between oral and written dissemination of knowledge in Western society and how this determines the reception of Aboriginal art, I explore aspects of the fairy tale and knitting as social experience, where the rigidities of oral and literary knowing dissolve. The fairy tale is a mapping device of the unconscious; of origin and place. Fairy tales travel across time and space and adopt various forms across cultures, embodying displacement and placement at the same time. Before folklorists such as Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm wrote them down – fairy tales were passed on orally. Through the merging of the tactile (knitting), optical (photography), and cognitive (book) the memorising and discursive properties of these transformative media and their interrelationship come to the fore. Stinging Nettle is central in Anderson’s fairy tale and I use its materiality as meaning-making medium through the organic dye for wool and bamboo <b>yarn.</b> <b>Printing</b> is instrumental to discourse – however other such instrumental processes often precede the printing process. Internal narratives of the photograph and the external of the written text are juxtaposed with the hand-made garment. I employ knitting as social process - during which stories are told and retold - and as ReSearch of memory. Making of the garment becomes a thought process in itself and a frame for the social act of passing on knowledge wrapped in stories. [URL]...|$|R

Nevertheless, none of these methods is performing toward all classes of dyes; treatment plants of great dimensions and difficult handling can be required, while costs can be prohibitive. [1]. In the present work, a cotton tulle fabric functionalized by chitosan UV grafting was used as dyes adsorbent. The process parameters for the fabric finishing were optimized in terms of chitosan weight-on, impregnation time, temperature and pH, radiation time and intensity for curing. The as prepared material was then tested towards different dye classes: acid, reactive and direct dyes. Batch, kinetics as well as continuous flow assessment tests were carried out evaluating the adsorption capacity by spectrophotometrical measurements. Moreover the influence of liquid pH as well as temperature on the adsorbant capacity of the functionalized cotton were investigated. The material showed good adsorption capacity and very high rate of adsorption kinetics toward all the investigated dyes. Moreover, by assembling the functionalized cotton in a filter form, good adsorption capacity is ensured even at 25 °C, with good behavior in terms of filter exhaustion and pressure drop. A positive influence on adsorption capacity was displayed in acid conditions. The chitosan weighted cotton was finally characterized by SEM and FTIR-ATR analysis to evidence the deposition of chitosan on the single fibers surface and the grafting reactions occurred. [1] F.

Nevertheless, none of these methods is performing toward all classes of dyes; treatment plants of great dimensions and difficult handling can be required, while costs can be prohibitive. In a previous work we cationized cotton obtaining a strong improvement of dyes adsorption. In the present work, a cotton fabric was more eco-friendly functionalized by chitosan UV grafting and used as dyes adsorbent. The process parameters for the fabric treatment were optimized in terms of chitosan add-on, impregnation time, temperature, pH, radiation time and curing intensity. The cotton grafted by chitosan was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared analysis in Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The material was then tested towards different dye classes: acid, reactive and direct dyes. Batch, kinetic as well as continuous flow assessment tests were carried out, evaluating the adsorption capacity by spectrophotometric measurements.

Finally, regeneration tests by NaOH solution were carried out, with a good release of the adsorbed dye. In conclusion, obtained results show good perspectives for chitosan treated cotton use in wastewater filtratio...|$|R
