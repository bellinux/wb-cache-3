2500|$|Prior to its {{colonization}} by Europeans, Ivory Coast {{was home}} to several states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire, and Baoulé. Two Anyi kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi, attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and after independence. Ivory Coast became a protectorate of France in 1843–1844 and was later formed into a French colony in 1893 amid the European scramble for Africa. Ivory Coast achieved independence in 1960, led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who ruled the country until 1993. The country maintained close <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>association</b> with its West African neighbors {{while at the same}} time maintaining close ties to the West, especially France. Since the end of Houphouët-Boigny's rule in 1993, Ivory Coast has experienced one coup d'état, in 1999, and two religion-grounded civil wars.

50|$|He was {{admitted}} to the New York bar, and practiced in Buffalo. From 1883 to 1884, he taught at Williston Academy. He was an instructor of German at Yale from 1884 to 1886. He was associate editor of the New Englander and the Yale Review. In 1888, he took two years to travel abroad. Beginning in 1893, he moved his residence to New York City, and was engaged in editorial and other literary work there. In 1902 he became noted as an advocate of fair play to Cuba, defending the principle of reciprocity in the United States and urging concessions from the <b>political</b> leaders <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>associations</b> of Cuba. His principles were approximately those embodied in the treaty submitted to Congress and accepted in 1903.|$|R

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Manuel Aguilar, Barbara Boyer, Paul Anderson, Abbas DaneshvariGold jewelry, MesoamericaThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine gold jewelry from the regions of Mesoamerica, the Andes and Central America before the Spanish Conquest. The primary areas of {{research}} include six types of jewelry articles; crowns/diadems, necklaces, masks, pendants, nose ornaments, and lastly, earrings, which include ear spools and earplugs. A total of twenty-three cultures from regions of the American continent were examined as part of the thesis. Special interest is paid to the connection between gold and status. Gold was an important visual tool that legitimized power and carried overwhelming social, <b>political,</b> spiritual <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>associations</b> for those who were privileged to wear these gold jewelry objects...|$|R
30|$|Social {{capital is}} a {{collection}} of actual or potential resources in the process of social interaction in the form of relational network (Villalonga-Olives and Kawachi 2015). Resources include not only funds but also rights, knowledge, information, time and opportunities, and other intangible material resources (Tan and Li 2002). Social capital is produced through interactions between people and between individuals and organizations. The World Bank has made important contributions to the measurement of social capital and treats it as a multidimension construct with social networks and informal relations being important measure dimensions (Zhao 2012). Social capital {{is often referred to as}} “Guanxi” in Chinese contexts, and it plays an extremely important role in the Chinese society (Bian and Zhang 2013). Males and females also invest in social capital in different ways (Richard and Lundberg 1981). For example, Leeves and Herbert (2014) found that females invest more in nonmarket social capital while males engage more in <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>associations</b> <b>and</b> professional bodies which may help produce important knowledge and networks contributing to their career advancement. Duin et al. (2015) found that in Chinese culture, women are main caregivers in families and they have less time and energy to engage in physical activity and/or hobbies, which are important processes of accumulating social capital. On the other hand, men in Chinese society participate a lot more in entertainment, social gatherings, and leisure activities than women (Zhao 2012). Kim (2014) also found that women are less likely to utilize social capitals for their work and also are less likely to start up business compared to men. Therefore, the Chinese males are in a better position to produce social capital and, therefore, can take advantage of social capital <b>and</b> produce more <b>economic</b> outcomes (Zhang 2008).|$|R

40|$|When {{individuals}} receive {{benefits as}} a result of the burdens assumed by other people, they are expected to make a return in similar form. To do otherwise is considered as a failure to treat those other people with appropriate respect. It is this which justifies the expectation that individuals share in the labour that is necessary to preserve just institutions and productive practices that characterise complex schemes of social cooperation. In this paper, I argue that where benefits do not meet thresholds specifying the expected function and efficacy of those benefits, this does not simply issue in a ‘downward adjustment’ in the work expectations and reciprocal demands that are made of people. Rather, it legitimates refusal to engage in productive labour even where limited benefits are still being received. Other costs and obligations emerge that contribute to the creation of disruptive <b>political,</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> social <b>associations.</b> These not only replace the demands of reciprocity but actively target and disrupt the practices and exchanges that give form to reciprocity...|$|R
40|$|This article's {{point of}} {{departure}} is that low-quality institutions, concentration of <b>political</b> power <b>and</b> material wealth, and underdevelopment are persistent over time. Its analytical model views an equal distribution of political power as a commitment device to enhance institutional quality, thereby promoting growth. The politically powerful coalition contemplates relinquishing of its power through democratization, weighing this advantageous consequence against the limit on own appropriative ability that it entails. The possibility of two developmental paths is exhibited: with concentration of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> power, low-quality institutions, and slow growth; and a more equal distribution of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> resources, high-quality institutions, and faster growth.

Economic and political changes in the 1990 s modified both parties' participation in the international political economy, helping to overcome some of the structural obstacles to the relationship. The policy toward Latin America adopted by the EU in 1994 was influential.

The paper concludes that, although the establishment of the EuroNest PA as such provides a framework to advance the EP’s goals of transmitting its norms and values to the EU’s Eastern neighbouring countries, in practice socialization has taken place only to a limited extent thus far...|$|E
40|$|Through Americans in Waiting, Hiroshi Motomura {{tells us}} three differ- ent {{stories about how}} U. S. law and policy, over time, have framed the {{relationship}} between immigrants and the American body politic. He cap- tures the complexity, historical contingency, and democratic urgency of that relationship by canvassing the immigration law canon and teasing from it the three frameworks that have structured immigrants 2 ̆ 7 social status, their interactions with the state, and the processes of immigrant integration and naturalization. In so doing, he illuminates how popular mythologies about the assimilative capacity of the American melting pot obscure myriad politi- cal and social conflicts over how best to produce Americans. He also demonstrates how alternating cycles of inclusive and exclusionary politics have shaped the processes through which American citizenship has been defined. As he charts this history, Motomura {{reminds us of the}} unceasing importance of the institution of national citizenship, particularly in an era of semiporous borders and transnational forms of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>association.</b> He calls on Americans to honor the very best of the three historical traditions he presents by treating lawful immigrants as American citizens in waiting, presumptively entitled to all the prerogatives of membership...|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the first}} {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa, in 1991 Zambia experienced  a peaceful transition to multi-party rule. The new government, Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), also committed itself to implementing an economic reform programme. The international donor community in turn generously rewarded the new government’s commitment to both <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> change. Despite the optimistic forecasts in 1991, both the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> liberalisation processes in Zambia are today characterised by their partial implementation. Zambia has joined the vast majority of African reforming governments and entered into a 'transitional grey zone' in terms of democratic reforms, and remains stuck in a 'partial reform syndrome' characterised by a permanent economic crisis. What can explain the Zambian development trajectory? Why were some elements of the economic reforms implemented soon after the 1991 elections while other vital reform processes were postponed? To what extent did the processes of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> reform reinforce or hinder one another? This book analyses the implementation of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> liberalisation in Zambia during the first two election periods (1991 - 2001). Focussing on the negotiations between government and the key domestic interest groups, as well as the dialogues between the MMD government and the international donor community, the book argues that despite a disastrous socio-economic record, the processes of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> liberalisation proceeded concomitantly without seriously affecting or undermining each other. Contrary to expectations linked both to the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> reform processes, executive dominance increased in Zambia in the 1990 s. Stressing continuity rather than change, the analysis of Zambia's reform processes suggests that the practices of patronage politics associated with authoritarian regimes are compatible with processes of <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> liberalisation.
