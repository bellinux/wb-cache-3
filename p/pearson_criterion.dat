40|$|In this correspondence, {{we present}} a {{technique}} to find the optimal threshold for the binary hypothesis detection problem with identical and independent sensors. The sensors all use an identical and single threshold to make local decisions, and the fusion center makes a global decision based on the local binary decisions. For generalized Gaussian noises and some non-Gaussian noise distributions, we show that for any admissible fusion rule, the probability of error is a quasi-convex function of threshold. Hence, the problem decomposes {{into a series of}} quasi-convex optimization problems that may be solved using well-known techniques. Assuming equal a priori probability, we give a sufficient condition of the non-Gaussian noise distribution () for the probability of error to be quasi-convex. Furthermore, this technique is extended to Bayes risk and Neyman [...] <b>Pearson</b> <b>criteria.</b> We also demonstrate that, in practice, it takes fewer than twice as many binary sensors to give the performance of infinite precision sensors in our scenario...|$|R
40|$|The metal {{coordination}} {{patterns of}} hypoxanthine, xanthine and related oxy-purines have been reviewed {{on the basis}} of the structural information available in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), including also the most recent reports founded in SciFinder. Attention is paid to the metal ion binding modes and interligand interactions in mixed-ligand metal complexes, as well as the possibilities of metal binding of the exocyclic-O atoms. The information in CSD is also reviewed for the complexes of adenine in cationic, neutral and anionic forms with every metal ion. In contrast to the scarce structural information about hypoxanthine and related complexes, large structural information is available for adenine complexes with a variety of metals that reveals some correlations between the crystal–chemical properties of metal ions. Three aspects are studied in deep: the coordination patterns, the interligand interactions influencing the molecular recognition in mixed-ligand metal complexes and the connectivity between metals for different adenine species, thus supporting its unique versatility as ligand. When possible, the overall behaviour showed by adenine metal complexes is discussed according to the HSAB <b>Pearson</b> <b>criteria</b> and the tautomeric behaviour observed for each protonated species of adenine. The differences between the roles of adenine and the referred oxypurines ligands are underlined...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} feedback on a decentralized detection system consisting of N sensors and a data fusion center. It is assumed that observations are independent and identically distributed across sensors, and that each sensor uses a randomized scheme for compressing its observations into a fixed number of quantization levels. We consider two variations on this setup. One entails the transmission of sensor data to the fusion center in two stages, and the broadcast of feedback information from the center to the sensors after the first stage. The other variation involves information exchange between sensors prior to transmission to the fusion center; this exchange is effected through a feedback decision center, which processes binary data from the sensors and thereafter broadcasts a single feedback bit back to the sensors. We show that under the Neyman- <b>Pearson</b> <b>criterion,</b> only the latter type of feedback yields an improvement on the asymptotic performance of the system (as N ƀ), and we derive the associated error exponents. We also demonstrate that deterministic compression schemes are asymptotically as powerful as randomized one...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of soil pH using a field portable test kit represents a fast and inexpensive method to assess pH. Field based pH {{methods have been}} used extensively for agricultural advisory services and soil survey and now for citizen soil science projects. In the absence of laboratory measurements, there is a practical need to model the laboratory pH {{as a function of}} the field pH to increase the density of data for soil research studies and Digital Soil Mapping. The accuracy and uncertainty in pH field measurements were investigated for soil samples from regional Victoria in Australia using both linear and sigmoidal models. For samples in water and CaCl 2 at 1 [*]:[*] 5 dilutions, sigmoidal models provided improved accuracy over the full range of field pH values in comparison to linear models (i. e., pH 9). The uncertainty in the field results was quantified by the 95 % confidence interval (CI) and 95 % prediction interval (PI) for the models, with 95 % CI < 0. 25 pH units and 95 % PI = ± 1. 3 pH units, respectively.

40|$|The {{problem of}} calculating {{the local and}} global {{decision}} thresholds in hard decisions based cooperative spectrum sensing {{is well known for}} its mathematical intractability. Previous work relied on simple suboptimal counting rules for decision fusion {{in order to avoid the}} exhaustive numerical search required for obtaining the optimal thresholds. However, these simple rules are not globally optimal as they do not maximize the overall global detection probability by jointly selecting local and global thresholds. Instead, they maximize the detection probability for a specific global threshold. In this paper, a globally optimal decision fusion rule for Primary User signal detection based on the Neyman- <b>Pearson</b> (NP) <b>criterion</b> is derived. The algorithm is based on a novel representation for the global performance metrics in terms of the regularized incomplete beta function. Based on this mathematical representation, it is shown that the globally optimal NP hard decision fusion test can be put in the form of a conventional one dimensional convex optimization problem. A binary search for the global threshold can be applied yielding a complexity of O(log 2 (N)), where N represents the number of cooperating users. The logarithmic complexity is appreciated because we are concerned with dense networks, and thus N is expected to be large. The proposed optimal scheme outperforms conventional counting rules, such as the OR, AND, and MAJORITY rules. It is shown via simulations that, although the optimal rule tends to the simple OR rule when the number of cooperating secondary users is small, it offers significant SNR gain in dense cognitive radio networks with large number of cooperating users...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{operations}} {{with the use}} of standards Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM); Performance-based Navigation (PBN); auto landings on CATII CATIII ICAO categories have become common practices in relation to the relevant requirements of ICAO. In this case, operators should receive special operational permits, due to that the task of determining the feasibility of such operations became operational. Increasing the reliability requirements to estimate the accuracy characteristics quality of flight operations requires the development and improvement of methods for their evaluation. First of all, the application of methods based on more accurate representations of error models with more correct models of the error probability density distribution is required, especially in the field of large, rare errors. This article solves one of the tasks of this complex approach to estimate the accuracy characteristics – the task of processing flight information {{in order to determine the}} estimates of the accuracy characteristics of the flight-navigation complex (FNC), since the problem solving provides the possibility of obtaining an integral estimate of the accuracy characteristics based on the application of combined methods. It is shown that the power of the Nikulin criterion is almost twice as high as the <b>Pearson</b> power <b>criterion,</b> which in some cases excludes the acceptance of incorrect hypotheses about the form of the hypothetical distribution function. The use of Nikulin criterion makes it possible to significantly improve the assessments accuracy of flight quality performance characteristics according to RVSM, PBN, CATII and CATIII standards by increasing the criterion power.

In this regard, the actual problem is creation of means and methods for simultaneous measurement of pressure as discussed in the work. The first method. The holes of the selection pressure pneumatic tracks (PT) are connected to the pressure sensor (PS), which are connected to the channels of the measuring system (MS). In this MS apply precision instrumentation programmable filter, communication interface with computer and time measurement for channel ? 40 ms. The cost of this MS is high, even for 16 channels measurement interval ? 640 ms, which for most of the EI is not acceptable. The second method is the use of electro-mechanical pneumatic switches (EMPS). For example, in EMPS type PS- 180 / 300 / 420 continuously rotating the rotor of the switching node with a phase shift connects PT to PS, synchronously with the time of establishment of pressure measurement is performed. The third method is the use of mobile pneumatic modules with interface for the transmission of real-time experimental data (ED) in MS.

40|$|Optical {{spectroscopy}} and imaging has {{proving to}} be of diagnostic relevance in many organ sites. We use fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopy to study gynecological organ sites and develop classification algorithms for cancer diagnosis. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer. The American Cancer Society reports that for the year 20 I 0, there would be 21, 880 new cases of ovarian cancer and 13, 850 fatalities. This {{is partly due to}} the fact that current diagnostic and screening methods for the disease are not very accurate. In this study, we analyze the fluorescence spectra of excised normal and cancerous ovarian tissues at multiple excitation wavelengths. The data includes spectra obtained at the UVC wavelength 270 nm and UVB wavelength 300 nm. Excitation in the UVC has been especially understudied in spectroscopy for tissue diagnosis. We introduce the application of a novel SVM algorithm for the classification of fluorescence data. This SVM is trained subject to the Neyman <b>Pearson</b> (NP) <b>criterion</b> which allows for a decision rule that maximizes the detection specificity whilst constraining the sensitivity to a high value. This technique allows us to develop a binary classification algorithm that is not biased towards the larger group and this in tum leads to robust classifiers that are more suitable for clinical applications. We obtained sensitivities and specificities greater than 90 % for ovarian cancer diagnosis using this algorithm. Also, FTIR is used to analyze cervical tissues. Absorption of light in the mid-IR region by biomolecules show up as peaks in the FTIR spectra, and there is differential absorption in tissue depending on the histopathology. The spectroscopic analysis informed our choosing of a wavelength for the illumination source ofa mid-IR microscope. We then present the design of an imaging system that employs the use ofa mid-IR quantum cascade laser(QCL) which can potentially have clinical use in the future.

40|$|Cost {{complexity}} pruning {{of classification}} trees as {{introduced in the}} Classification and Regression Tree (CART) framework by Breiman et al. (1984) is a powerful technique to avoid overfitting the training data, while maintaining the interpretability of the tree. This approach involves a Bayesian cost which employs a fixed value of the prior probabilities, either obtained by Maximum Likelihood estimation or specified by the user. To use this approach with the Neyman <b>Pearson</b> (NP) <b>criterion</b> and generate a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), a few values of the priors are selected heuristically {{in an attempt to}} obtain some desired values of false alarm and detection probabilities. However, there is no systematic approach to integrating pruning with NP criterion and ROC generation, even restricted to those points which can be obtained by varying the priors, nor is there a method to select the complexity and prior parameters which is statistically robust and includes the randomization of pruned subtrees. In this thesis, we consider the cost complexity measure parameterized by both prior and complexity of the tree and examine the two dimensional pruning problem. A computationally efficient algorithm to determine the optimal pruning of the tree for each point in the parameter space is developed. This results in a family of pruned subtrees each of which is shown to be optimal over a convex polygonal region in the parameter space. The method solves the pruning problem for NP criteria and for ROC curve generation {{in the sense that it}} generates all possible solutions for different prior values. Also, a robust procedure for NP parameter selection which allows randomizations among pruned subtrees is formulated and solved as a linear programming problem. The pruned subtrees can also be used to solve the pruning problem with Minimax criterion and the problem of joint estimation of the priors and Bayesian pruning of the tree. Integration of the pruning approach with tree growing is also examined. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. ...|$|R

Numerous studies results show that the Gibrat’s law provides a basis for the analysis of the dynamics of the number of the employees of mature and large firms, which have already carved out a niche. Furthermore, the Gibrat’s law allows analyzing the dynamics and laws of the spatial distribution of the population of different countries in a case if their socioeconomic development is sustainable and equilibrium. The purpose of the study is testing the Gibrat’s law for Russian cities and towns of different sizes. If the Gibrat’s law is valid, we can conclude that the spatial distribution of the population in the country is equilibrium and the labour distribution is close to optimal. The opposite result demonstrates the imbalance between the allocation of manufacture and labour force. The author took 2010 national census results as source data. I have tested the hypothesis of the lognormal law of population distribution in Russia over different cities and towns using the <b>Pearson</b> fitting <b>criterion</b> with the value a = 0, 05. The results of the study have shown that the distribution of the population over Russia does not follow the Gibrat’s law.

The sheet data collection includes demographic data, PWT; Burn′s Wean Assessment Program (BWAP), and Morganroth′s scale. To determine the inter-rater reliability between researcher and his partner, Pearson correlation and paired t-test were used. To assess the criterion validity of the PWT in relation to Burn′s and Morganroth′s weaning scales (as <b>criteria),</b> <b>Pearson</b> correlation and McNemar tests were used. To specify a minimum acceptable score of the PWT for weaning from mechanical ventilation, receiver operating characteristic curve was used. Results: The results showed that there was statistically significant correlation between score of PWT and BWAP (r = 0. 370 with P < 0. 05) and there were no statistically significant differences between these tools in terms of identification of patients′ readiness for weaning (P = 0. 453). There was statistically significant correlation between PWT score obtained by researcher and his colleague (r = 0. 928), and the reliability of this tool was approved. The PWTs cut of point was calculated as 57 (sensitivity = 0. 679, specificity = 1). Conclusions: The reliability and validity of the PWT were confirmed for this study′s sample size. Consequently, {{the findings of this study}} can be used to measure the PWTs effectiveness and applicability in ICUs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the present regularities, {{specific}} to the employees’ salaries of aggregates of small and medium enterprises related to the three dimensional categories and located in different regions of Russia. The following tasks were solved: the indexes, characterizing average monthly salary of employees based on the mentioned enterprises were assessed, belonging to different size categories and located in each of the regions; the relations were established between the average monthly salaries of employees of aggregates of small and medium enterprises and the cost of living in all regions of the country. Preliminary results of stopwatch reading of small and medium business activities in 2015 were used as initial data. The research was based on the comparison of indexes for the entrepreneurial sector and the full range of enterprises and organizations. Modeling differentiation of salaries’ values of small and medium enterprises aggregations, as well as its relationship to the values of the subsistence level was based on the development of the density function of normal distribution. The quality of the developed models was checked according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, <b>Pearson</b> and Shapiro-Wilk <b>criteria.</b> The obtained results have some theoretical significance, in particular, when conducting research related to the justification of the proposed wage of employees of enterprises different in number, the formation of measures for increasing efficiency of the entrepreneurial sector activity. Density functions of normal distribution given in the paper can be used in the justification of concepts, plans and programs of developing small and medium entrepreneurship in regions and municipalities. The practical importance of research results connected with the possibility of their use by entrepreneurs directly (especially by beginners) when assessing the potential of enterprise creation and definition of employees’ proposed salaries. In addition, the results can be used by the departments of regional and municipal authorities engaged in the formation of projects and programs of entrepreneurship development, including entrepreneurship development in regions and municipalities with a low level of employee’s wages of small and medium enterprises. Further development of small and medium entrepreneurship in Russia puts forward the urgent need for raising the salary in this sector of the national economy based on increasing the number of highly productive jobs through mechanization and automation of production processes, widespread introduction of innovation. Special attention must be paid to the issue of equalizing levels of wages in the enterprise sector and the national economy. </p...|$|R
