In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, stimulated emission in the amplifier's gain medium causes amplification of incoming light.

25|$|The OPO {{consists}} essentially of {{an optical}} resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate {{at least one}} of signal and idler waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and idler waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and idler waves (<b>parametric</b> <b>amplification)</b> and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or idler or both) to oscillate in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to outcoupling by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the pump power, but the gain is dependent on pump power, at low pump power there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Only when the pump power reaches a particular threshold level, oscillation occurs. Above threshold, the gain depends also on the amplitude of the resonated wave. Thus, in steady-state operation, the amplitude of the resonated wave is determined by the condition that this gain equals the (constant) loss. The circulating amplitude increases with increasing pump power, and so does the output power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, optical <b>parametric</b> chirped-pulse <b>amplification</b> (OPCPA) {{has emerged}} as a {{powerful}} tool for the generation of ultrashort pulses with extreme peak intensity. It has enabled the generation of phase-controlled few-cycle pulses in widely different parts of the spectrum. For the near-infrared spectral range, OPCPA is becoming an interesting alternative to conventional Ti:Sapphire-based laser technology for various applications. In this paper, we discuss the physics behind OPCPA, as well as the practical design considerations for the development of highintensity, phase-stable few-cycle OPCPA systems. Also, we review the experimental achievements in ultrafast OPCPA systems to date.
