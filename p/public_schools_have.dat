25|$|In the United States, <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> a sex {{education}} program that teaches girls about menstruation {{and what to}} expect {{at the onset of}} menarche (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, menstruation was a private matter and a girl's menarche was not a community phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{experts say}} the rise in use of private schools in the 2000s {{is partly due to}} white Danish {{families}} putting their children in private schools when the neighbouring public school gets more than 30% pupils of immigrant background. About 24% of pupils grade 1-3 in Copenhagen attend private schools. Another factor is parents in small communities who have organized to start a private school when small <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> closed as a results of the Danish municipality reform which led to fewer municipalities.|$|E

25|$|Compulsory education, or grunnskóli, {{comprises}} {{primary and}} lower secondary education, which often is {{conducted at the}} same institution. Education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16years. The school year lasts nine months, beginning between 21 August and 1 September, ending between 31 May and 10 June. The minimum number of school days was once 170, but after a new teachers' wage contract, it increased to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.

2500|$|In the U.S. {{and some}} of the English-speaking {{majority}} of Canada, students at <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> historically been required to shower communally with classmates of the same sex after physical education classes. In the U.S., public objections and the threat of lawsuits have resulted in a number of school districts in recent years changing policy to make showers optional. Private boarding schools and military academies in the U.S. often have communal showers, since the focus there is on 24-hours-a-day education and rooming, rather than just acting as day schools. Students in these establishments need places to clean themselves daily. A court case in Colorado noted that students have a reduced expectation of personal privacy in regards to [...] "communal undress" [...] while showering after physical education classes. According to an interview with a middle school principal, most objections to showering at school that he had heard were actually from the students' parents rather than from the students.|$|E

But the house prefects had been against it. Sheen was in the sixth, and, however monstrous and unspeakable might have been his acts, it would hardly do to treat {{him as if he were}} a junior. And the scheme had been definitely discouraged by Drummond, who had stated, without wrapping the gist of his remarks in elusive phrases, that in the event of a court-martial being held he would interview the president of the same and knock his head off. So Seymour's had fallen back on the punishment which from their earliest beginnings the <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> meted out to their criminals. They had cut Sheen dead.|$|E

I have forgotten what I said, but I am quite {{certain that it}} was (like a certain Mr. Douglas in a poem which I have also forgotten) tender and true. In any case, what I say now is this. Human history is so rich and complicated {{that you can make}} out a case for any course of improvement or retrogression.

But I can prove anything in this way. I can prove that the world has always been growing greener. Only lately men have invented absinthe and the Westminster Gazette. I could prove the world has grown less green. There are no more Robin Hood foresters, and fields are being covered with houses. I could show that the world was less red with khaki or more red with the new penny stamps. But in all cases progress means progress only in some particular thing.
