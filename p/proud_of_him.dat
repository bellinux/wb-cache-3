5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} want the babies to die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I suspect," [...] said Dr. Morrell soberly, [...] "that Putney's {{championship}} isn't altogether an advantage. The {{people all}} concede his brilliancy, {{and they are}} <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> on account <b>of</b> his infirmity; but I guess they like to feel their superiority to him in practical matters. They admire him, but they don't want to follow him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{he did not}} die after all. Do not grieve, for {{if he did it}} was a very glorious death, and I am <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than I {{could have}} been had he lived on like the others--who wished to beat you off with oars. Whatever is, is by God's Will, and doubtless for the best. At the least, you and your child will be {{restored}} to your husband, though it cost me one who would have been--my husband." ...|$|R

O papa, never let any one have the right to say that again of us!

5|$|Now {{possessing}} three powers, Delsin encounters Hank, who {{has escaped}} again. Hank tells Delsin that Fetch and Eugene have been {{captured by the}} D.U.P., and are being held on an artificial concrete island in Puget Sound. However, the situation {{turns out to be}} a trap set by Augustine. Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a rocket launcher. While the brothers free Fetch and Eugene, Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform. As they dangle above the ocean, Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them, tells him that he is <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and lets Delsin's hand go and falls to his death. Distraught and enraged, Delsin climbs back up onto the platform and battles Augustine, destroying the entire island.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E

You know that the character of it was concentrated in, and to the full expressed by, its best king, St. Louis. You know St. Louis was a Franciscan, and that the Franciscans, for whom Giotto was continually painting under Dante's advice, were <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than <b>of</b> any other of their royal brethren or sisters. If Giotto ever would imagine anybody with care and delight, it would be St. Louis, if it chanced that anywhere he had St. Louis to paint.|$|R

60|$|Pony {{fell asleep}} {{thinking}} {{how he would}} come back to the Boy's Town with the circus when he was grown up, and when he came out in the ring riding three horses bareback he would see his father and mother and sisters in one of the lower seats. They would not know him, but he would know them, and he would send for them to come to the dressing-room, and would be very good to them, all but his mother; he would be very cold and stiff with her, though he would know that she was <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than all the rest put together, and she would go away almost crying.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard.

25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals. He enjoyed {{watching}} animals kill each other {{as well as the}} feeling he got from taking their lives. This continued as he got older. He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about {{what it would be like}} to do the same to a human.|$|E

Jamie also spoke about the number of messages sent by fans, saying, [...] "We have been so touched by the outpouring of sympathy from all over the world. We have had messages from India, Uganda, Australia – and from people aged between seven to 70. It is so nice to know how my father touched people's lives across all the continents." [...] Jamie went on to add, [...] "But I'm <b>proudest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> for the contribution he made to the Alzheimer's Society. He was so torn apart by his illness.

Finn is disappointed that the Army refused to change his late father's dishonorable discharge to an honorable one, and wonders to his mother (Romy Rosemont) whether his father would be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> if he became an actor.|$|E
60|$|The {{trouble with}} him was, {{that he had}} to live that kind of double life I have spoken of--the Boy's Town life and the Cloud Dweller's life--and that the last, which he was {{secretly}} <b>proud</b> <b>of,</b> abashed <b>him</b> before the first. This is always the way with double-lived people, but he did not know it, and he stumbled along through the glory and the ignominy as best he could, and, as he thought, alone.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2005, Curtis Strange said: [...] "Nick Faldo stared {{a lot of guys}} down.

We didn't say three words all day, which was fine with me. I'm <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> beating <b>him</b> when he was in his prime." ...|$|R

I was so <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> having <b>him,</b> that I gave myself up to him all at once, without giving <b>him</b> a chance <b>of</b> {{thinking}} of it. In a week or two it was done. Who could expect that such an engagement should be lasting?" ...|$|R

Maggie and I are very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I hope you respect I have nothing more to say on this.|$|E

60|$|Jees Uck was a {{young woman}} when she went back into the North, and men still looked upon her and yearned. But she lived straight, and no breath was ever raised save in commendation. She stayed for a while with the good sisters at Holy Cross, where she learned to read and write and became versed in {{practical}} medicine and surgery. After that she returned to her grand log-house and gathered about her the young girls of the Toyaat village, to show them the way of their feet in the world. It is neither Protestant nor Catholic, this school in the house built by Neil Bonner for Jees Uck, his wife; but the missionaries of all the sects look upon it with equal favour. The latchstring is always out, and tired prospectors and trail-weary men turn aside from the flowing river or frozen trail to rest there for a space and be warm by her fire. And, down in the States, Kitty Bonner is pleased at the interest her husband takes in Alaskan education and the large sums he devotes to that purpose; and, though she often smiles and chaffs, deep down and secretly she is but the <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
500|$|Following the {{win over}} Indiana, the student newspaper, The Wolverine noted: [...] "The 'Varsity showing was most satisfactory. Against a heavier team, on a {{slippery}} field {{which was all}} {{in favor of the}} visitors and directly opposed to our style of play, the 'Varsity was not found wanting and turned victory into a fight for big scores. Even the most optimistic did not look for such a large score, with the elements against us. The smiling, yet earnest face of Coach Yost has become a favorite feature at the games. His success as a coach has already been demonstrated, and every Michigan man is <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as an athlete, as a coach and as a man." ...|$|E

He knows that if he fails to bring home the kite, Baba would be less <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He feels incredibly guilty but knows his cowardice would destroy any hopes for Baba's affections, so he keeps quiet about the incident. Afterwards, Amir keeps distant from Hassan; his feelings of guilt prevent him from interacting with the boy.|$|E
6000|$|The answers sorely tried Mr. Satterlee's conscience, albeit {{he was not}} a man of the world. It set him thinking. He liked Jethro, {{this man}} of rugged power whose word had become law in the state. He knew best that side <b>of</b> <b>him</b> which Cynthia saw; and--if the truth be told--as a native of Coniston Mr. Satterlee felt in the bottom of his heart a certain pride in Jethro. The minister's {{opinions}} well represented the attitude of his time. He had not given thought to the subject--for such matters had came to be taken for granted. A politician now was a politician, his ways and standards set apart from those of other citizens, and not to be judged by men without the pale of public life. Mr. Satterlee in his limited vision did not then trace the matter to its source, did not reflect that Jethro Bass himself was almost wholly responsible in that state for the condition of politics and politicians. Coniston was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> Jethro, <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than ever since his last great victory in the Legislature, which brought the Truro Railroad through to Harwich and settled their townsman more firmly than ever before in the seat of power. Every statesman who drove into their little mountain village and stopped at the tannery house made their blood beat faster. Senators came, and representatives, and judges, and governors, [...] "to git their orders," [...] as Rias Richardson briefly put it, and Jethro could make or unmake them at a word. Each was scanned from the store where Rias now reigned supreme, and from the harness shop across the road. Some drove away striving to bite from their lips the tell-tale smile which arose in spite of them; others tried to look happy, despite the sentence of doom to which they had listened.|$|R
