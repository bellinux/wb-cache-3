40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{indirectly}} infected persons (persons infected by a person, infected by a person, etc., itself infected by a <b>public</b> <b>organism,</b> for AIDS, hepatitis C, etc.). It {{is assumed that}} fairness implies the national community to indemnify them. Graph theory is used to explain what is indirect infection. The concept of chains of infection, and their length is central. Re-infections are considered also because even individuals that are initially infected by another cause could become later indirectly infected by the public agent. The number of persons to be indemnified is larger than for direct infection, so the cost of compensation is higher, unless if compensation per capita is lower. The required quantity of information is so large that this is unrealistic and not democratic. The precision of the determination of infecting causes, {{as well as the}} responsibility, decreases rapidly when the length of chains increases. With re-infection, potentially all infected persons could become relevant of a compensation. Compensation of indirectly infected persons is unrealistic, what is unfair when the directly infected persons are compensate...|$|R

40|$|The {{access to}} the genetic {{resources}} and to associated traditional knowledge in Brazil is regulated by the Provisional Law 2. 186 - 16 / 01. The provisional nature of the legislation has remained {{for more than ten}} years, and there is not any prediction for a final definitive law. The Genetic Heritage Management Council (CGEN) created by the Provisional Law was initially the unique body responsible for the analysis and issue of licenses for access and collection of all natural heritage and its associated knowledge. This centralization has generated several difficulties for issuing such licenses. The goal of this work is to show how CGEN handles its skills, to offer more readiness to access its components, avoiding usual law impediments.

40|$|What {{constitutes}} a potentially hazardous object is often debated. This article analyses the polemic construction and negotiation of {{risk in the}} Swedish controversy {{over the use of}} antibacterial silver in health care and consumer products. This debate engages the media, government agencies, parliament and government, non-governmental organizations and companies. Texts and websites from these actors were studied using content analysis. Antibacterial silver is construed by some actors as a risk object with harmful effects on a series of objects at risk: the environment, <b>public</b> health, <b>organisms</b> and sewage treatment. In contrast, other actors deny that antibacterial silver is a risk object, instead construing it as mitigating risk. In such a schema, antibacterial silver is conceived of as managing the risk objects of bacteria and micro-organisms, in turn managing the risk objects of infection, bad smell and washing, and in turn helping the environment and public health (objects at risk). The structure of the debate suggests two basic modes of risk communication. First, antibacterial silver is construed as a risk object, endangering a variety of objects at risk, such as <b>organisms,</b> <b>public</b> health, the environment and sewage treatment. Second, this association between antibacterial silver and objects at risk is obstructed, by denying that antibacterial silver is a risk object or by associating silver with the benefit of mitigating risk...|$|R

40|$|Science, {{technology}} and innovation have a fundamental {{role in the}} development of a society, and can be observed in the investment that countries execute in the sector. Most of these funds are channeled through <b>public</b> <b>organisms</b> by the financing of project. In Argentina, universities lead a significant assignment in the allocation and distribution of resources, so that the activities related to project management become imperative. The increasing complexity of these tasks, which usually fall on the main teachers/researchers, means extra dedication to their daily responsibilities and limits the development of other activities for which their participation is essential. Now there are no systematic studies in the country to estimate the potential increase in the availability of time dedicated to research that could be achieved through the incorporation of methodologies and management processes of R&D projects. This paper presents the design of a tool to diagnose the activities related to R&D projects management carried out by teachers/researchers in universities. Questionnaire relieves the time spent by teachers/researchers in different tasks (Teaching, Research, Community engagement, and Others) and the time taken to manage on-going projects. Finally, it is highlighted that the instrument, developed to be used in a research program, was validated with teachers/researchers who develop their activities in participating universities, which allowed modifications to arrive at its final design...|$|E
40|$|The Public Relations are {{considered}} as a main function of the management, with a continuous and systematic activity, the organisations trying to get with their help the sympathy {{and the support of}} the present and future public. Their purpose is mainly to establish and maintain the understanding between an organisation and its public, represented by all those groups of people whom this is in touch or wants to be in touch with. The specialists organized in Public Relation structures of a commercial firm develop both internal and external activity. Internal Public Relations are used as a tool of communication with the inside public, represented by those who share the same institutional and organizational identity. This type of relations are necessary for avoiding or diminishing the opposition between the firm/employer who considers having done his duty by paying equitably the staff and the employees who don’t know the difficulties the firm passes through. Internal Public Relations are very important because both the social peace and the employees’ individual efficiency depend on them. External Public Relations of a commercial firm aim at the connections the firm has with the environment it operates on. Each constituent part of this environment becomes a distinctive category of public the firm has to apply to. Thus the external public of a commercial firm is composed of: goods suppliers, services providers, labour suppliers, clients, competitors, <b>public</b> <b>organisms.</b> Public relations; Communication; intern public; extern public; target public;...|$|E
