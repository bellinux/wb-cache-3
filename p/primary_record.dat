25|$|This {{solution}} {{fails to}} conform {{with any of}} the relationships appearing in the <b>primary</b> <b>record.</b> It is inferred that the relative familiarity with Germany and unfamiliarity with Hungary partly distorted the depiction of Agatha in the English sources; by this reconstruction she would have been niece of the King of Hungary (Stephen I), who was himself the brother-in-law of the Holy Roman Emperor (Henry II, and therefore kinsman of Henry III).|$|E

She believed that depending on a particular producer for her album was not something that suited her. Madonna said [...] "I learnt my lesson while creating my debut album, and the way Lucas left me in the water with the project, you can't trust men"—referring to the incident, when due to certain difference of opinion between producer Reggie Lucas and Madonna, Lucas had left the project half-way.

500|$|John Coltrane's <b>primary</b> <b>record</b> producer, Bob Thiele, who {{had worked}} with Coltrane on his {{previous}} albums Live! at the Village Vanguard (1961) and Coltrane (1962), acknowledged that the next three Coltrane albums to be released were to be recorded at his behest and as ballad-themed to quiet the negative criticism of Coltrane's more diverse playing. The material chosen for Coltrane's next records would be suited for more slow-tempo, smooth and romantic playing, in contrast to Coltrane's forceful, aggressive style that had dominated his previously issued recordings, and which had led to reviewers describing his playing as [...] "angry". The recordings featured on Coltrane for Lovers were recorded between December 1961 and April 1963, during his early years with Impulse! Records.|$|E

500|$|Waka ("Japanese poem") or uta ("song") is an {{important}} genre of Japanese literature. The term originated in the Heian period to distinguish Japanese-language poetry from kanshi, poetry written in Chinese by Japanese authors. Waka began as an oral tradition, in tales, festivals and rituals, and began to be written in the 7th century. In the Asuka and Nara periods, [...] "waka" [...] included a number of poetic forms such as tanka ("short poems"), chōka ("long poems"), bussokusekika, sedōka ("memorized poem") and katauta ("poem fragment"), but by the 10th century only the 31-syllable tanka survived. The Man'yōshū, of the mid-8th century, is the <b>primary</b> <b>record</b> of early Japanese poetry and the first waka anthology. It contains the three main forms of poetry at time of compilation: 4,200 tanka, 260 chōka and 60 sedōka; dating from 759 backwards more than one century.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, in {{an article}} meant not only to refute the Kievan hypothesis, but also to broaden the field of {{possible}} alternatives beyond the competing German Imperial and Kievan reconstructions, John Carmi Parsons presented a novel possibility. He {{pointed out that the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle represents the earliest surviving testimony, and argues that it was contemporary with Agatha and was very probably well informed in reporting an Imperial kinship. Parsons stresses that the sources claiming Russian parentage for Agatha, and her kinship with a Hungarian queen, are of much later date, and consequently likely to be less reliable than a source contemporary with her. [...] Purely in an attempt to show that not all avenues have been fully pursued in the effort to identify Agatha, Parsons pointed to the documented existence of a German Count Cristinus, whose given name might explain the name Christina for Agatha's daughter. [...] Count Cristinus married a Saxon noblewoman, Oda of Haldensleben, who is hypothesized to have been maternally a granddaughter of Vladimir I of Kiev by a German kinswoman of Emperor Henry III. [...] Parsons also noted that Edward could have married twice, with the contradictory <b>primary</b> <b>record</b> in part reflecting confusion between distinct wives.|$|E
