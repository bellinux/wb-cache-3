5|$|Mitchell {{turned himself}} in to {{authorities}} on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges. He was arraigned on March 22 on the charges, and a warrant for his arrest in Indiana for failure to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> led to his incarceration in Orange County, Florida. In May 2012, Mitchell {{filed a lawsuit against}} a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he suffers from headaches, insomnia, and memory loss. That memory loss was cited as a possible reason for his failing to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> in that case as well. His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to community service and probation. On October 29, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison. He began his sentence on December 6.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} began as Zolciak {{was in the}} middle of her first {{pregnancy}} by her boyfriend Biermann; she later gave birth to their son. Leakes continued divorce proceedings with Gregg, while Whitfield found herself in financial difficulties after her ex-husband failed to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> Meanwhile, Bailey opened her own modeling agency, while Parks looked to launch a family-operated funeral home. Leakes's new friendship with Hampton caused tension between all of the women, which escalated during a group vacation in South Africa; while Zolciak, who had remained home with her children, became upset by negative comments Bailey (not Burruss) made about her during the group vacation. As the season closed, Leakes began to reconsider her divorce from Gregg.|$|E
5|$|Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the {{marriage}} bore one child, Amanda. Rosaleen never watched Lawton play football during their ten-year marriage. Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> He would not hear from his daughter until she was convicted of stealing from playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen was on her fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E
5000|$|According to Jewish law, {{the father}} is the only parent {{responsible}} for <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> In Israel, the woman is always exempt from <b>paying</b> <b>child</b> <b>support,</b> and her income and assets are not a factor in awarding the <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> Therefore, even when a father is awarded custody of the children, he is still liable to <b>pay</b> full <b>child</b> <b>support</b> to his former wife, even if she does not raise the children. In certain situations a non-custodian mother can also collect [...] "hospitality fees", i.e. the father has to pay the mother for the costs of her visitations with the children.|$|R
50|$|The {{trial to}} end their 3½-year {{separation}} started on May 6, 2008. Jim asked the court for equal custody of their 8-year-old daughter. Matos McGreevey demanded $600,000 compensation. McGreevey received joint custody, and <b>pays</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> They will also be using a parenting coordinator.|$|R

5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E

25|$|Members of the fathers' rights {{movement}} state that child support should be terminated under certain conditions, such {{as if the}} custodial parent limits access to the children by moving away against {{the wishes of the}} other parent, gives fraudulent testimony, or if paternity fraud is discovered, adding that two men should not have to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> for the same child.|$|E
50|$|In May 2015, Mohammed {{issued a}} {{decision}} concerning twins born to different fathers, {{the result of}} a rare scientific phenomenon known as heteropaternal superfecundation.

25|$|Along {{with general}} {{information}} on life for young men, Leykis's 101 advice mostly consists of his principles of {{looking out for}} oneself. He argues that {{the institution of marriage}} is flawed and that family court systems are often corrupt because DNA testing after childbirth is not mandatory to prevent paternity fraud, and because courts have forced men to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> even after DNA testing has established that a man was not actually a child's father. Other examples of Leykis 101 guidelines include never dating single mothers or co-workers; never cohabiting with a woman; using birth control during each sexual encounter; and immediately ending a relationship if a woman issues an ultimatum.|$|E

[...] Darden had been married to Sheryl from 1972–1977 when they divorced. [...] He had previously been $5000 in arrears until being briefly jailed for failure to pay and cursing the judge. [...] He had been in contempt of court twenty times previously.|$|E
500|$|Barry's child, Carole Ann, {{was born}} in October 1944, and the {{paternity}} suit went to court in February 1945. After two arduous trials, in which the prosecuting lawyer accused him of [...] "moral turpitude", Chaplin was declared to be the father. Evidence from blood tests which indicated otherwise were not admissible, and the judge ordered Chaplin to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> until Carole Ann turned 21. Media coverage of the paternity suit {{was influenced by the}} FBI, as information was fed to the prominent gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, and Chaplin was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Child</b> <b>Support</b> Guidelines {{sets out}} the rules {{about how much}} <b>child</b> <b>support</b> should be paid {{according}} to the income of the person <b>paying</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> {{and the number of}} <b>children</b> <b>child</b> <b>support</b> is being paid for. For most people, the amount that should be paid is set out in a table {{at the end of the}} Guidelines.

500|$|Sarria did {{not have}} a {{relationship}} with his birth father, a man who showed zero interest in him and failed to provide his family with financial support. Julio Sarria was eventually arrested for failure to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> [...] A judge ordered that he pay $5 to be released; this money was then turned over for Jose's care. [...] Julio was arrested each month until he returned to Nicaragua in around 1926 or 1927; each time he paid the $5 and was released. Julio died in Nicaragua in 1945. Years later, José learned that his father had acknowledged him as his first-born.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Mitchell {{returned}} to Lakeland {{and bought a}} local barbecue restaurant called [...] "Brothers' Bar-B-Que." [...] In February 2009, Mitchell was under investigation when a package containing [...] of marijuana was delivered to his business. Mitchell was briefly detained, but was not charged. The restaurant was closed briefly in June for violations, but reopened shortly thereafter. On September 3, 2009, the restaurant was closed and Mitchell was named in a suit for failure to make payments on the business. Mitchell officially lost the restaurant in September 2009 after a court ruling. In December 2009, Mitchell was pulled over for speeding in suburban Philadelphia. Due to an outstanding warrant for failure to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support,</b> he was arrested on charges of being a fugitive from justice, and was later released on $250,000 bail.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{marriage}} {{ended in}} 1994, as {{she wanted to}} continue to perform as a porn actress and Koons {{wanted them to be}} monogamous. In violation of a US court order, Staller left the US for Italy, taking their then-two-year-old son, Ludwig. [...] A lengthy custody battle ensued.

2500|$|Consequently, court-mandated visitation in Japan only {{occurs with}} the {{cooperation}} of the custodial parent. U.S. Department of State website states that [...] "compliance with Family Court rulings is essentially voluntary, which renders any ruling unenforceable unless both parents agree." [...] Consequently, any attempt to obtain visitation (or child support and/or alimony) through legal enforcement would be futile. If the custodial parent, usually the mother, refuses to cooperate with visitation, the other parent, usually the father, will often refuse to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> According to New York City-based international family lawyer Jeremy D.

2500|$|Another {{widely publicized}} event {{took place in}} November 2006, when Leykis invited callers to make confessions about their {{wrongdoing}} or escapades which were never discovered. A listener from the Phoenix, Arizona area called the show and confessed to shooting {{the father of her}} child when he refused to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> The caller described herself as a nurse who went by her middle name, Sue, and said that she shot the man in the heart with a 9mm because she [...] "knew how to aim for it", and moreover asserted that she made the shooting look like a suicide. Leykis asked if the woman was serious, and the woman explained how she [...] "got away with it" [...] because police believed [...] "a blubbering, crying woman" [...] and that she was never arrested or charged.

2500|$|Around 1990, Koons {{lived in}} New York in a full-service hotel near Wall Street. During that time, {{he did not}} have a studio. In 1991, he married Hungarian-born naturalized-Italian {{pornography}} star Cicciolina (Ilona Staller) who for five years (1987–92) pursued an alternate career as a member of the Italian Parliament. After seeing her picture in two European magazines, he had flown to Rome, watched her perform, and gone backstage to suggest that they collaborate on what he then thought would be a movie. She agreed. A series of strenuous photographic sessions became the basis for the [...] "Made in Heaven" [...] paintings and sculptures, in various media. The movie never got made, but Koons and Staller fell in love. He courted her through an interpreter—she spoke very little English, and Koons, who spoke about four words of Italian, kept trying to communicate directly by speaking English with an Italian accent. The interpreter had to be let go, because she fell in love with Koons. He proposed to Staller in Venice that spring, and they were married a year later. While maintaining a home in Manhattan, Koons and Staller lived in Munich. In 1992, they had a son, Ludwig. The marriage ended soon afterward amid allegations that Koons had subjected Staller to physical and emotional abuse. Jeffrey Deitch, a close friend who became Koons's dealer after Sonnabend, couldn't understand the marriage to Staller. Koons himself says that Ileana Sonnabend and his father had warned him against it, fearing the worst. [...] "Jeff had confused fantasy with reality", Deitch said. [...] "It was as though he felt the 'Made in Heaven' work wouldn't be authentic unless they were married. It was a moral issue for him." [...] The marriage began to fall apart even before their child, Ludwig, was born. Staller wanted to keep on performing. (She also offered, publicly, to have sex with Saddam Hussein in exchange for his releasing foreigners held in Iraq.) And then, after divorce proceedings had begun in New York, Staller spirited baby Ludwig out of the New York town house that Koons had rented for them and took him to Rome. Koons spent more than a decade and millions of dollars in legal battles over custody. The battle ensued with the award of sole custody to Koons by the U.S. court in 1998, which had also dissolved the marriage. However, he lost custody when the case went to Italy's Supreme Court. In 2008, Staller filed suit against Koons for failure to <b>pay</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
50|$|By far, {{the most}} common, and most {{contentious}} method, is the IRD making a calculation {{for the amount}} of <b>child</b> <b>support</b> that a liable parent is required to <b>pay</b> in <b>child</b> <b>support.</b>|$|R
50|$|Payment is {{not made}} to {{children}} but between parents and the payee {{is not required to}} account for how <b>child</b> <b>support</b> money is spent. Critics of <b>child</b> <b>support</b> argue that, as a result, the support payments {{do not need to be}} used to <b>support</b> the <b>child</b> and can be regarded as a punishment to the parent who is <b>paying</b> <b>child</b> <b>support.</b> The response to that criticism is that if a parent is caring for the children, that parent will incur costs in providing that support, even if they have no duty to account for their expenditures in <b>support</b> of the <b>child.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The laws {{governing}} <b>child</b> <b>support</b> in Israel {{are based on}} the parent's religion.

In most divorces in Israel the parents are Jewish and therefore Jewish law, mostly enacted in the 11th and 12th centuries, and not modern civil law, controls the dispute in both family courts and the rabbinical courts. The laws applied are based mainly on halacha enacted in the 11th and 12th centuries.|$|R
