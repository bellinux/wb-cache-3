5|$|Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Burma {{probably}} in December 1886, after Upper Burma had been annexed by the British in late 1885. Much publicity {{had been made}} in the British <b>press</b> <b>about</b> the three Anglo-Burmese Wars, which had started in 1825 and culminated in December 1885 with the fall of Mandalay and the capture of King Thibaw Min.|$|E
5|$|After {{consecutive}} retirements in {{the previous}} three races which included first lap collisions in Austria and Germany, Michael Schumacher said that his objective in Hungary was to avoid any incidents on the first lap and to finish in a points-scoring position. He was also confident that Ferrari would perform well at the circuit. Barrichello revealed that he received backing from Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to challenge for more victories and the championship despite the latter's comments to the <b>press</b> <b>about</b> Barrichello assisting Michael Schumacher's title aspirations.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into direct {{sunlight}} and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a safe position, putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo believes that the uplink is being sabotaged. Belt orders the uplink to be cut, allowing the astronauts to rotate the craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the <b>press</b> <b>about</b> its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle program may be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} dozens of {{reports in the}} <b>press</b> <b>about</b> use and/or storage of {{military}} formulated herbicides on Okinawa that are based upon statements by former U.S. service members that had been stationed on the island, photographs, government records, and unearthed storage barrels. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has denied these allegations with statements by military officials and spokespersons, {{as well as a}} January 2013 report authored by Dr. Alvin Young that was released in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City {{prepared}} for the final at Southport, Lancashire, at the Palace Hotel. The players kept relaxed with massages, games of bowls and salt baths. On {{the day before the}} match travelled to Harrow on the Hill where they stayed at the Kings Head Hotel. They were open with the <b>press</b> <b>about</b> their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Cardiff were free to choose their first choice team, unhindered by injuries. They selected the same team as had featured against Reading in the semi-final, with the exception of Harry Wake, despite his experience from playing in the FA Cup final two seasons prior.|$|E
5|$|Further {{controversy}} ensued at the Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit. The circuit {{had been}} paved {{just days before}} the race, creating a track that many of the racers felt was unsafe due to diesel fuel seeping to the surface. Roberts and the new championship points leader, Virginio Ferrari, instigated a riders' revolt and refused to race. Once again, the FIM responded by suspending Roberts and Ferrari. The FIM later reduced this to another probation. The event highlighted the animosity between Roberts and the FIM concerning track safety. Roberts further irritated the FIM when he began talking to the <b>press</b> <b>about</b> forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM's monopoly.|$|E

60|$|The {{carriage}} which Belsize {{had ordered}} came round {{at this very}} juncture. Amidst the crowd, shrinking, bustling, expostulating, threatening, who <b>pressed</b> <b>about</b> him, he shouldered his way. Mr. Taplow, aghast, {{was one of the}} hundred spectators of the scene.|$|R
5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin <b>press</b> <b>about</b> the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1945, Smyth {{approached}} Datus C. Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University <b>Press,</b> <b>about</b> the possibility of renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that he {{found it hard to}} imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E
5|$|He {{also played}} in the Taranaki side that was only {{narrowly}} beaten by the touring Australians in 1913. His form in these games earned him a place with the All Blacks. On 6September 1913, he {{played in the}} 30–5 first test win over Australia at Athletic Park: Albert Downing and George Sellars played alongside him and were also later killed in action in the First World War. Dewar was then selected, along with four other Taranaki players, for the tour of North America, playing in 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 victory over the All America team for his second test cap. He received particular mention in the test match for a cunning dummy pass to Downing on his right, drawing the defence and passing to five-eighths McKenzie on his left to run in for a try. He scored just one try. There was little interest in the American <b>press</b> <b>about</b> the tour. A single short paragraph in the New-York Tribune reports on the 51–3 defeat of the USA team on 15November.|$|E
50|$|There {{were a few}} {{reports of}} {{negative}} <b>press</b> articles <b>about</b> non-Orthodox religions.

5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the <b>press</b> <b>about</b> newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{tensions}} between Stretford and the Estates Company {{began to come}} to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the <b>press</b> <b>about</b> the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council dismissed the petition, but later that year, following a petition organised by the Trafford Park Ratepayers Association, a new local government ward, Park Ward, was created within Stretford, The new ward did not include {{the western part of the}} park however, which remained under the control of Barton-upon-Irwell.|$|E
