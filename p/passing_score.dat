5|$|The Maryland offense had {{difficulty}} converting third downs, and managed only four on 13attempts, while their defense allowed 226passing yards and 201rushing yards. Late {{in the first}} quarter, Virginia quarterback Marc Verica completed a pass to receiver Kevin Ogletree for a 51-yard touchdown, the Cavs' first <b>passing</b> <b>score</b> of the season. Virginia was able to score twice more before half, to put the Terrapins into a 21–0 deficit. With {{seconds left in the}} second quarter, in a desperate gambit to recoup some points, quarterback Chris Turner attempted a hook and ladder play with a pass to Isaiah Williams who then lateraled to Darrius Heyward-Bey, who in turn lateraled to Da'Rel Scott. The maneuver picked up 45yards before Scott was shoved out of bounds, and a flag was thrown for a late hit by Virginia. Since a half cannot end on a defensive penalty, time would {{have been added to the}} clock, but it was ruled that the foul occurred after time had expired. Therefore, the penalty was assessed after the kick-off, and the Terrapins' trick play was for naught.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Middlesex Elderly Assessment of Mental State (MEAMS) was {{developed}} as a screening test to detect cognitive impairment in the elderly. It includes 12 subtests, each having a 'pass score'. A series of tasks were undertaken to adapt the measure {{for use in the}} adult population in Turkey and to determine the validity of existing cut points for passing subtests, given the wide range of educational level in the Turkish population. This study focuses on identifying and validating the scoring system of the MEAMS for Turkish adult population. Methods After the translation procedure, 350 normal subjects and 158 acquired brain injury patients were assessed by the Turkish version of MEAMS. Initially, appropriate <b>pass</b> <b>scores</b> for the normal population were determined through ANOVA post-hoc tests according to age, gender and education. Rasch analysis was then used to test the internal construct validity of the scale and the validity of the cut points for <b>pass</b> <b>scores</b> on the pooled data by using Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis {{within the framework of the}} Rasch model. Results Data with the initially modified <b>pass</b> <b>scores</b> were analyzed. DIF was found for certain subtests by age and education, but not for gender. Following this, <b>pass</b> <b>scores</b> were further adjusted and data re-fitted to the model. All subtests were found to fit the Rasch model (mean item fit 0. 184, SD 0. 319; person fit - 0. 224, SD 0. 557) and DIF was then found to be absent. Thus the final <b>pass</b> <b>scores</b> for all subtests were determined. Conclusion The MEAMS offers a valid assessment of cognitive state for the adult Turkish population, and the revised cut points accommodate for age and education. Further studies are required to ascertain the validity in different diagnostic groups. </p...|$|R
40|$|The highly {{qualified}} {{provision of the}} 2001 No Child Left Behind Act promoted licensure exams on a national level. The present study {{is an effort to}} explore the most commonly used Praxis licensure exams and their <b>passing</b> <b>scores.</b> Hypothesized was that <b>passing</b> <b>scores</b> are set at such a minimal level that they are ineffectual in identifying {{highly qualified}} teachers. More specifically, Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s low <b>passing</b> <b>scores</b> are examined by comparing the distribution of University of Arkansas Praxis scores to national trends. Based on low <b>passing</b> <b>scores,</b> the question was posed - At what point in teachers 2 ̆ 7 careers are expectations lessened? Academic data from Elementary Education graduates of the University of Arkansas College of Education and Health Professions were compared to colleagues with the conjecture that they would fall below. Finally, as the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind looms, the mandate for highly qualified teachers has become energized with the call for effective teachers. Student gains data of relatively new teachers from a local district were regressed on teacher scores on content knowledge exams as well as years of experience to explore the relationships. SEA <b>passing</b> <b>scores</b> were found to be low with all but a few exceptions using cut scores for licensure exams below the median of the national testing pool. Further, University of Arkansas testers, replicated national trends in scoring on Praxis exams eliminating any justification for Arkansas employing minimal standards. As conjectured, Elementary Education graduates of the U of A presented academic credentials below that of colleagues thus exacerbating the highly qualified conundrum. Lastly, the attempt to connect student achievement to teacher content knowledge through Praxis exam scores and years of experience proved unsuccessful. Higher standards, particularly for Elementary Education graduates, were discussed {{in the context of the}} Common Core State Standards and the push for effective teaching...|$|R

40|$|In a South Carolina middle school, {{students}} were performing poorly {{on the state}} assessment in reading.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether student performance on the Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) reading test in the fall predicted <b>PASS</b> <b>scores</b> in the spring. The theoretical framework was based on the item response theory (IRT) â??the relationship between individual performance on a test item and the test takers 2 ̆ 7 levels of operating along an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. The research question was used to examine how well student performance on the MAP predicts student performance on the PASS. MAP and <b>PASS</b> test <b>scores</b> were collected from 2012, 2013, and 2014 academic years from a total student sample of N = 741 from three out of the five middle schools in the North Central School District. The dependent variable was student <b>PASS</b> <b>score</b> and the independent variable was the MAP <b>score.</b> The <b>PASS</b> <b>scores</b> were correlated with the MAP scores to look for the strength and nature of the relationship, and a bivariate linear regression was conducted. The findings showed that student performance on the MAP reading test in the fall predicted <b>PASS</b> <b>scores</b> in the spring so that administrators might use these data to target student interventions. Professional development training was developed for teachers to apply best practices in the classroom to address areas of need as indicated by the MAP results. The implementation process would align with the district literacy initiatives Read to Succeed and Lindamood-Bell.
