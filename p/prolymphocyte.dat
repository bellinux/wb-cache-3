40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the morphofunctional characteristics of lymph node cells from patients with Hodgkin's disease by measuring silver stained nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs). METHODS: Nucleoli in Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, lymphocytes and <b>prolymphocytes</b> were investigated in cytological smears and histological sections of lymph nodes from 32 patients with Hodgkin's disease, and from 34 patients with reactive lymphadenopathy. According to the Rye histological classification of Hodgkin's disease, three cases were the lymphocyte predominant (LP) type, 14 the nodular sclerosing (NS) type, and 15 the mixed cellularity (MC) type. The investigation was done before treatment, {{by means of}} a one step silver staining method. In each case, 50 to 100 HRS cells, lymphocytes, and <b>prolymphocytes</b> were evaluated to determine the mean numbers of nucleoli and AgNORs per nucleus. The nonparametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the groups. RESULTS: The mean numbers of nucleoli and AgNORs were higher in lymphocytes and <b>prolymphocytes</b> compared with those from reactive lymph nodes used as controls. Numbers of nucleoli and AgNORs were higher (not significant) in the NS type of Hodgkin's disease than in the MC type. There was a significant increase in numbers of nucleoli in HRS cells, and their AgNOR counts were increased. The greatest number of nucleoli in HRS cells was found in the NS type. Furthermore, the nucleolar activity of HRS cells was greater in the NS type compared with the MC type (50. 2 (SEM 3. 9) v 37. 7 (2. 9) AgNORs per nucleus (p = 0. 025)). Comparative analysis of cytological and histological samples showed that the AgNOR score was significantly higher in touch imprints than in tissue sections with tumours of the same histological type. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of cell activity in Hodgkin's disease patients by silver staining is more convenient and informative in lymph node imprints than in histological sections. The highest expression of interphase ribosomal RNA cistrons found in NS HRS cells is probably explained by their high proliferative activity and elevated production of transforming growth factor 1 which is known to be the most potent cytokine present in the NS subtype of Hodgkin's disease...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{capacity}} of peripheral blood cells from 26 chronic B cell leukaemias to proliferate continuously in culture; 72 attempts to establish cell lines were made. The cells were treated in vitro with or without stimulating agents: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and/or phorbol-ester (TPA) were the most frequently used. Fourteen cell lines of continuous growth were established from cells from 11 patients, but only four of these were proven {{to be derived from}} the original leukaemic cells. Only in the latter four lines were the karyotypic abnormalities and the patterns of immunoglobulin (Ig) -gene rearrangements identical to those found in the patients' leukaemic cells. On the other 10 lines, five had both kappa- and lambda-producing cells, and the remaining five, despite showing light-chain restriction, were proved to be non-leukaemic clones by comparing the Ig-gene rearrangement patterns before and after culture. Three of the four leukaemic cell lines (JVM- 2, JVM- 3 and JVM- 13) were induced by EBV + TPA and derived from prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) cases; the fourth (JVM- 14) originated from a case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with increased percentage of <b>prolymphocytes</b> whose cells were stimulated in vitro with EBV. The immunophenotype of the three PLL lines is more mature than that of the original <b>prolymphocytes,</b> as shown by a reduction in surface-Ig and FMC 7 expression, enhancement of cytoplasmic-Ig and increase in CD 38 - and transferrin receptor-positive cells. The cells from line JVM- 14 retained the CD 5 -antigen, a marker of CLL. This study suggests that PLL and some CLL clones are arrested at a stage of maturation ideally suited to be triggered to continuous proliferation in culture. The presence of consistent chromosomal abnormalities in PLL may offer an alternative explanation for the greater proliferative potential of these cells in vitro...|$|R

The overall frequency of p 53 protein positivity in CLL was 15 % (27 of 181 cases).

By contrast, p 53 -positive patients had a significantly higher percentage of <b>prolymphocytes</b> (P =. 002) and a significantly lower percentage of residual CD 3 -positive T lymphocytes (P =. 0001). No correlation was found between the percentage of p 53 -positive cells and the percentage of cells in cycle assessed by the monoclonal antibody Ki- 67. When the percentage of p 53 positivity was correlated with the clinical stage of the disease, the proportion of p 53 -positive cases increased significantly from Binet's stage A (8 of 108; 7. 4 %), to stage B (12 of 49; 24. 4 %) and C (7 of 24; 29. 2 %) (P =. 002). p 53 positivity correlated also with the phase of the disease, showing a low expression at diagnosis (8 of 112; 7. 1 %) and a significantly higher expression in patients studied during the course of the disease (7 of 35; 20 %) and, to a further extent, with disease progression (12 of 34; 35. 3 %) (P =. 0001). The association of p 53 protein expression with mutations in the gene was confirmed by direct sequence of the entire cDNA in 15 of the 17 ICC positive cases tested (88 %). A significantly shorter treatment-free interval from diagnosis (P =. 003) and a poorer response to therapy (P =. 007) was observed in p 53 -positive compared with p 53 -negative patients. Overall survival from the time of diagnosis, as well as from the time of p 53 protein analysis, was significantly shorter in patients with p 53 protein expression (P =. 03 and. 0001, respectively). Moreover, in multivariate analysis, p 53 expression and stage C were independently associated with a short survival. The results of this study indicate that in CLL the expression of the p 53 protein, {{analyzed by}} a simple and reliable immunocytochemical method, is strongly associated with p 53 gene mutations, a morphological variant (CLL with > 10 % <b>prolymphocytes),</b> advanced clinical stage, progressive disease, poor response to therapy, and short survival.

40|$|According to the French-American-British (FAB) {{proposal}} on {{the classification of}} chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), the disorder can be subdivided into typical and atypical CLL. We recently demonstrated the prognostic significance of this subgrouping and based on these results we suggested that typical and atypical CLL represent two closely related, but different entities. These results prompted us to investigate 42 patients diagnosed with CLL {{based on the results}} of lymph node biopsy in order to identify the histologic counterpart of the CLL variants. A first group of 14 cases showed a monomorphic proliferation of small round lymphocytes associated with the occurrence of small pseudofollicles. All these cases were diagnosed as typical CLL on peripheral blood (13 cases) or bone marrow smear (1 case). The remaining 28 cases showed aberrant histologic features characterized by the presence of large numbers of paraimmunoblasts and <b>prolymphocytes,</b> forming very large pseudofollicles, and/or by nuclear irregularities of the neoplastic cells. Based on peripheral blood smears (22 cases) or bone marrow smears (six cases), two cases showed no peripheral blood involvement, 21 cases were diagnosed as atypical CLL, and five as typical CLL. From these data we can conclude that a histologic counterpart of the CLL variants recognized in the FAB proposal does exist; moreover, our data may explain reports on lymph node involvement by CLL composed of small cleaved cells and clarify the occurrence of pseudofollicles in cases described as mantle cell lymphomas. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Translocations {{involving}} MYC {{are rare}} in {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL), and up to now, their prognostic significance remains unclear. We report the characteristics of 21 patients with CLL and nine patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), diagnosed in multiple centers (n = 13), which showed an MYC translocation demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The prevalence {{was estimated to be}} < 1 %. Advanced age and male predominance were observed. Morphological analysis frequently revealed the presence of <b>prolymphocytes.</b> A typical "CLL-immunophenotype" was found in four of nine cases with PLL. Moreover, CD 5 and CD 23 were frequently expressed in PLL. The latter findings are atypical for PLL and may suggest transformation or progression of an underlying CLL. MYC translocations were frequently observed with concomitant adverse cytogenetic markers, such as del(11 q) (n = 8 / 30) and/or del(17 p) /monosomy 17 (n = 7 / 30). In addition, the presence of unbalanced translocations (n = 24 in 13 / 30 cases) and complex karyotype (n = 16 / 30) were frequent in cases with MYC translocations. Altogether, del(17 p) /monosomy 17, del(11 q), and/or complex karyotype were observed in 22 of 30 patients. Survival outcome was poor: the median time to treatment was only 5 months, and overall survival (OS) from clinical diagnosis and from genetic detection was 71 and 19 months, respectively. In conclusion, CLL/PLL with MYC translocations is a rare entity, which seems to be associated with adverse prognostic features and unfavorable outcome...|$|R
