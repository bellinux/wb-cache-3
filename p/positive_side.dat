5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory {{is a product of}} not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only <b>positive</b> <b>side</b> to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{defense was}} led by {{coordinator}} Bud Foster, who was named a candidate in several teams' searches for a new head coach, but decided to remain at Virginia Tech as the buildup to the Orange Bowl continued. Heading into the game, Tech's defense ranked 38th nationally in total yards allowed, its second-worst performance since 1993. Tech's run defense was 58th, permitting an average 148.9rushingyards per game. On the <b>positive</b> <b>side</b> of things, Tech's defense had the third-most interceptions (22) in the country, and its scoring defense was 16th (19.1 points per game).|$|E
5|$|In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men {{he brought}} into the battle, more than 30 percent of his army, {{including}} five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all the tents. Frederick required his generals {{to set an example}} of courage and leadership: they led from the front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 flags, and two standards. On the <b>positive</b> <b>side,</b> Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.|$|E

5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with <b>positive</b> <b>side</b> chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post {{to which he had}} been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with deep cuts in the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the <b>positive</b> <b>side,</b> the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E

25|$|MOSFET analog {{switches}} use the MOSFET to pass {{analog signals}} when on, {{and as a}} high impedance when off. Signals flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch.

All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate–source, gate–drain and source–drain voltages; exceeding the voltage, current, or power limits will potentially damage the switch.|$|E

25|$|Across Western Europe, {{the period}} from 1973 to 1981 {{marked the end of}} the booming economy of the 1960s. The Netherlands also {{experienced}} years of negative growth after that.
