5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, {{have been found}} to display a <b>preparedness</b> for social interaction. This <b>preparedness</b> is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E
5|$|To try {{to prevent}} {{repetition}} of such a disaster, the government of Colombia created the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres (National Office for Disaster <b>Preparedness),</b> {{now known as the}} Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and <b>Preparedness).</b> All Colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters.|$|E
5|$|Most {{thunderstorms}} {{come and}} go fairly uneventfully; however, any thunderstorm can become severe, and all thunderstorms, by definition, present the danger of lightning. Thunderstorm <b>preparedness</b> and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preparedness</b> {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some <b>preparedness</b> {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} {{focused attention}} on the Harper government's cancellation of the Joint Emergency <b>Preparedness</b> Program, which provides funds to Canada's five HUSAR teams. The province and the National Fire Protection Association denounced the cuts. The Canadian Centre for Emergency <b>Preparedness</b> suggested that such cuts would necessitate Canada asking for assistance from the United States in similar situations. Also cancelled by the Conservative federal government was the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of the cuts, noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Roy's {{arrival in}} the Mariana Islands and Guam, the public was given {{sufficient}} warning by the local disaster <b>preparedness</b> team. An estimated 1,200 people evacuated to shelters across Guam and all flights {{to and from the}} island were canceled for January 12.|$|E
5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved {{them to be}} a mixture {{of carbon dioxide and}} sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple <b>preparedness</b> techniques to local authorities.|$|E
5|$|As the Armero tragedy was {{exacerbated}} {{by the lack of}} early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program, the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres (National Office for Disaster <b>Preparedness),</b> now known as the Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness)to prevent such incidents in the future.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} his departure from Louisiana, Sherman traveled to Washington, D.C., possibly {{in the hope}} of securing a position in the army, and met with Abraham Lincoln in the White House during inauguration week. Sherman expressed concern about the North's poor state of <b>preparedness</b> but found Lincoln unresponsive.|$|E
5|$|Lane was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of <b>preparedness</b> in the prelude to U.S. involvement in World War I. In early 1917, he urged Wilson to authorize the arming and convoying of merchant vessels. Wilson refused, but changed his mind when informed of the Zimmermann Telegram. In a critical Cabinet meeting in March 1917, Lane, with other Cabinet members, urged American intervention in the war.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma was the 21st-largest {{recipient}} of medical {{funding from the}} federal government in 2005, with health-related federal expenditures in the state totaling $75,801,364; immunizations, bioterrorism <b>preparedness,</b> and health education were the top three most funded medical items. Instances of major diseases are near the national average in Oklahoma, and the state ranks at or slightly above {{the rest of the country}} in percentage of people with asthma, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, when a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Jamaica, Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson-Miller convened an emergency meeting of Jamaica's national disaster <b>preparedness</b> council. The Jamaican government finalized evacuation plans, which included converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political {{parties in the}} island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections to allow residents {{to prepare for the}} storm. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA), which was already responding to Hurricane Dean's impact in the Lesser Antilles, contacted the Jamaican Office of Disaster <b>Preparedness</b> and Emergency Management to confirm technical and logistics support, and to notify the Jamaican government that utilities teams had been placed on standby should they be needed. The North-West Caribbean Donor Group also met to consider what action might it might undertake in Dean's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|On {{one side}} of the Ring is a large star, {{borrowed}} from the seal of the state of Texas. The oak leaves symbolize strength. On {{the other side of the}} Ring are a cannon, a saber, and a rifle, symbolizing Aggies' <b>preparedness</b> and valor in defending their land. The crossed flags of the United States and Texas symbolize allegiance to both nation and state.|$|E
5|$|Overall, damage totaled $85,000 (1998 USD); {{the effects}} were {{described}} as minor. Although the effects from Hermine were small, counties in Louisiana and Texas were declared disaster areas due to damage associated with the earlier Tropical Storm Frances and the Louisiana Office of Emergency <b>Preparedness</b> extended these funds to cover damages from Hermine as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preparedness</b> for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings, {{protecting}} {{infrastructure and}} homes, and storing sufficient supplies {{of food and}} water to last until the ash fall is over and clean-up can begin. Dust masks can be worn to reduce inhalation of ash and mitigate against any respiratory health affects. Goggles can be worn to protect against eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} of 81 people has not since been equaled by a natural {{disaster}} in Canada. In addition to the casualties, over 4,000 families were left homeless. The Department of Public Safety and Emergency <b>Preparedness</b> Canada estimates {{the total cost of}} Hurricane Hazel for Canada, taking into account long-term effects such as economic disruption, the cost of lost property, and recovery costs, to be C$137,552,400.|$|E
5|$|The public Wright State University {{became a}} state {{university}} in 1967. Wright State University established the National Center for Medical Readiness, a national training program for disaster <b>preparedness</b> and relief. Wright State's Boonshoft School of Medicine is the Dayton area's only medical school and {{is a leader in}} biomedical research.|$|E
5|$|Though the cyclone {{developed}} quickly, {{authorities were}} prepared for the storm; earlier in the year, Madagascar's National Office for Natural Disasters <b>Preparedness</b> implemented a plan for localized storm warning. Officials deployed warnings via radio to citizens {{in the path of}} Fanele, as well as to fishermen who were told to avoid leaving port.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, all {{ports in}} Gujarat, {{including}} Kandla, {{one of the}} largest in the country, were closed as a precautionary measure. On May25, over 10,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in the threatened region. Throughout India, a total of 118,800 people were evacuated and 100,000 more were evacuated in Pakistan. The Indian military was placed on standby to undertake search-and-rescue missions immediately after the storms' passage. Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of <b>preparedness.</b> Seven emergency control centers were set up across the country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.|$|E
5|$|Amador Valley's main Speech and Debate teams {{places a}} heavy {{emphasis}} on public speaking skills. The school's Mock Trial team represented Alameda County at the California State Championships in 2007, and competed as the wildcard in 2009. The Mock Trial team has perennially been Alameda County finalists in this Constitutional Rights Foundation sponsored competition, holding the finalist title {{five of the six}} years from 2004–2009. Alameda County Superior Court Judge George Hernandez, who presided over the final county round in 2007, praised the level of <b>preparedness</b> of Amador Valley's Mock Trial team.|$|E
5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor {{and found them}} to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple <b>preparedness</b> techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials seismographs, but no instructions on how to operate them.|$|E
5|$|At home, staying {{informed}} about volcanic activity, and having contingency plans {{in place for}} alternative shelter locations, constitutes good <b>preparedness</b> for an ash fall event. This can prevent some impacts associated with ash fall, reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with such events. A few items such as a flashlight, plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the Territorial Force {{had some}} 30,000 men {{involved}} in divisional level training camps; two years previously, the manpower and logistical {{constraints of the}} force was such that only battalion level camps could be achieved. When General Ian Hamilton, the Inspector General of Overseas Forces, visited New Zealand in 1914, he {{was impressed with the}} level of <b>preparedness</b> of the country's military. This reflected positively on Godley's work, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good <b>preparedness</b> also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and <b>preparedness</b> of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Saint James, and Westmoreland parishes were {{considered}} disaster areas. A task force {{was established by}} the Prime Minister Michael Manley for reconstruction efforts. About 7,758families, a total of 36,391people, required assistance with food supplies for over 13weeks. The Housing Task Force called {{for the construction of}} 582new houses, 300of which for those left homeless. The houses constructed for the people rendered homeless were prefabricated by the Ministry of Housing and then erected by the local authorities, under the guidance of the Ministry of Local Government. In response to the disaster, the Government of Jamaica established the Office of Disaster <b>Preparedness</b> and Emergency Management in July1980.|$|E
5|$|Hotze's {{experience}} with military <b>preparedness</b> and organization {{gave him an}} advantage in establishing the lancers as a new combat arm. Recognizing the importance of lancers {{as part of the}} Austrian armed force, he embarked on an organizational and training program. The Emperor named him as commander of these corps, with the rank of a full colonel. In 1787, he returned temporarily to Russia, this time to establish a similar force in Catherine the Great's army. At the outbreak of the border war between the Ottoman Empire and Austria, he returned to Austria and took command of his regiment.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency <b>preparedness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, {{an effort}} arose to {{convince}} Jim Gilmore {{to run for}} president of the United States in 2008. The volunteers cited Gilmore's past experiences as qualifications for the job including his service as a counter-intelligence officer for the U.S. army, his post of attorney general of Virginia, his services as chairman of the Gilmore Commission and the National Council on Readiness and <b>Preparedness,</b> as well as his role as president of the non-profit homeland security think-tank USA Secure.|$|E
5|$|In June2011, {{a federal}} {{document}} detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents {{affected by the}} storm. The main complaint raised {{was related to the}} delay in accepting federal aid despite the severity of the damage. In an email sent on September21, 2010, Denys Doiron, the nation's Emergency <b>Preparedness</b> and Response Officer, relayed that local emergency services reported Igor to be the worst disaster they have had to deal with. Doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed the need for a {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's <b>preparedness</b> for war.|$|E
5|$|On July22, 1916, a bomb {{exploded}} during the San Francisco <b>Preparedness</b> Day Parade, killing ten people and wounding 40. Police suspected Berkman, {{although there was}} no evidence, and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman came to their aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{religious}} emblems {{programs are}} administered by various religious institutions and {{recognized by the}} BSA. These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot. Other advancement and recognitions—such as the 50-miler award, Crime Prevention Awards, Emergency <b>Preparedness</b> Award and World Conservation Award—are available to Scouts who show proficiency in special areas. BSA's National Court of Honor is responsible for lifesaving and meritorious awards. All Courts of Honor for Eagle Scout rank are convened as National Courts of Honor also.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} war, many Israelis demanded an {{impartial}} inquiry to investigate {{what became known}} as the machdal (the blunder), with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army, particularly their lack of <b>preparedness</b> for the attack and its ramifications. Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} denied {{knowledge of}} the incident, but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that {{it was on a}} MASINT spy mission. The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said it was a deliberate provocation by the United States to probe the Soviet Union's military <b>preparedness,</b> or even to provoke a war. The White House accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders, which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} was {{increased}} {{by the lack}} of early warnings, unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars, and the lack of <b>preparedness</b> in communities near the volcano. Colombia's worst natural disaster, the Armero tragedy (as it came to be known) was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée). It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD. Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history.|$|E
