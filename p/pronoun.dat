5|$|Pronouns {{are subject}} to a {{complicated}} system of social register, the choice of <b>pronoun</b> depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see Social registers below). Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Subject pronouns are frequently dropped in colloquial conversation.|$|E

Advocacy groups such as GLAAD, the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association, and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) encouraged media outlets to refer to Manning by her self-identified name and <b>pronoun.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pronouns</b> have {{traditionally}} been {{regarded as one of}} the parts of speech, but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform. Subtypes include personal <b>pronouns,</b> reflexive and reciprocal <b>pronouns,</b> possessive <b>pronouns,</b> demonstrative <b>pronouns,</b> relative <b>pronouns,</b> interrogative <b>pronouns,</b> and indefinite <b>pronouns.</b>|$|R

5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative <b>pronoun</b> who is the only interrogative <b>pronoun</b> to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the table}} above, genitive pronouns all end with -gin, which is {{separated}} orthographically by a hyphen that normally divides morphemes. The -gin form {{here is not}} a separate morpheme and cannot be lexically segmented; {{there is no such}} word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing-gin 'my/mine'. The fact that the genitive forms have regular endings across the entire <b>pronoun</b> paradigm may have been a historical accident.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa uses {{a set of}} demonstrative pronouns that {{contains}} terms unique to Ottawa, while other words in the set are shared with other Ojibwe dialects. Taken as a group the Ottawa set is distinctive. The following chart shows the demonstrative pronouns for: (a) Wikwemikong, an Ottawa community; (b) Curve Lake, an Eastern Ojibwe community; and (c) Cape Croker, an Ottawa community that uses a mixed <b>pronoun</b> set. The terms maaba 'this (animate)', gonda 'these (animate)', and nonda 'these (inanimate)' are unique to Ottawa.|$|E

50|$|In Saliba {{most of the}} {{interrogative}} <b>pronouns</b> also {{function as}} indefinite <b>pronouns.</b> Interrogative <b>pronouns</b> are <b>pronouns</b> used when asking a question. Indefinite <b>pronouns</b> are <b>pronouns</b> used to mention any sort of general person, place, or thing. The interrogative/indefinite <b>pronouns</b> for Saliba are listed below. All of the <b>pronouns</b> in this list except the last two are nouns. The last two happen to be verbs. An example of using one of these in a sentence would be haedi kwa lau? meaning 'where did you go?'.|$|R
5|$|The {{dropping}} {{of final}} short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, {{but also some}} gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel lengthening occurred in many situations to preserve the distinctions. For example, in the suffix conjugation, first-singular *-tu {{appears to have been}} remade into *-tī already by Proto-Hebrew on the basis of possessive -ī (likewise first singular personal <b>pronoun</b> *ʔana became *ʔanī).|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Jenner debuted her {{new name}} and image, and began {{publicly}} using feminine <b>pronoun</b> self-descriptors. Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner. Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed {{with the family}} in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized {{that there is no}} one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition. In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the <b>pronoun</b> is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

25|$|Here, an R-pronoun is a {{reflexive}} <b>pronoun</b> (like herself) or reciprocal <b>pronoun</b> (like each other). The minimal governing category (or MGC) is defined, broadly, as {{the smallest}} category that contains both the <b>pronoun</b> and a governor of that <b>pronoun.</b>|$|E
25|$|In many Indo-European languages, causative {{alternation}} regularly {{involves the}} use of a reflexive <b>pronoun,</b> clitic, or affix in the inchoative use of the verb. A reflexive <b>pronoun</b> is a <b>pronoun</b> that is preceded by the noun, adjective, adverb or <b>pronoun</b> to which it refers (its antecedent) within the same clause.|$|E
50|$|Concords are NOT <b>pronouns.</b> Concords {{are usually}} {{mandatory}} in certain places while <b>pronouns</b> are often not. <b>Pronouns</b> {{cannot be used}} in place of concords. <b>Pronouns</b> are complete words while concords are strictly affixes.|$|R
