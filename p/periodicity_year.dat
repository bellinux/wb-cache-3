40|$|Abstract: Long-term field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} between 1985 and 1988 {{to determine the effect}} of different irrigation intervals and pan coefficients on the fruit and trunk growth rates and yield of mature grapefruit trees grown in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey in a medium-light textured soil. Two different irrigation intervals (I 1 = 15 and I 2 = 25 days), and pan coefficients (k 1 = 0. 60 and k 2 = 1. 00) were used. Higher evapotranspiration values were obtained from the treatments with k 2 coefficient in the two irrigation regimes. The average irrigation water (IR) and evapotranspiration (Et) values were 796 mm and 1039 mm for I 1 k 2, and 782 mm and 988 mm for I 2 k 2, respectively. The grapefruit trees exhibited periodicity during the period of study. Results indicate that the effects of the irrigaiton programs on grapefruit yield were not significantly different. However, slightly higher yields were obtained from the frequently irrigated trees with an average of 67. 3 ± 0. 164 t/ha for I 1 k 1. In <b>periodicity</b> <b>years,</b> the yield and the number of fruits harvested decreased by 45 - 52 % and 77 - 85 % with respect to irrigation treatments. In normal-yield years, the average fruit weight and diameter were nearly 32 % and 20 % lower than in the <b>periodicity</b> <b>years,</b> and the seed number was two to four times greater than in the <b>periodicity</b> <b>years.</b> It was found that there was an inverse relationship between fruit extract and TSS (total soluble solid percentage). The fruit extract content increased to 41. 9 %, whereas TSS decreased to 11. 1 % in normal-yield years. Fruit extract and peel thickness varied during the experimental period. In the <b>periodicity</b> <b>years,</b> the average fruit extract was about 17 % lower and the peel thickness was 18 % higher than in normal-yield years.

40|$|Two {{population}} oscillations dominate {{terrestrial community}} dynamics in northern Canada. In the boreal forest, the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) fluctuates in cycles with an 8 – 10 <b>year</b> <b>periodicity</b> and in tundra regions lemmings typically fluctuate in cycles with a 3 – 4 <b>year</b> <b>periodicity.</b> I review 60 {{years of research}} that has uncovered many {{of the causes of}} these population cycles, outline areas of controversy that remain and suggest key questions to address. Lemmings are keystone herbivores in tundra ecosystems because they are a key food resource for many avian and mammalian predators and are a major consumer of plant production. There remains much controversy over the role of predation, food shortage and social interactions in causing lemming cycles. Predation is well documented as a significant mortality factor limiting numbers. Food shortage is less likely to be a major limiting factor on population growth in lemmings. Social interactions might {{play a critical role in}} reducing the rate of population growth as lemming density rises. Snowshoe hares across the boreal forest are a key food for many predators and their cycles have been the subject of large-scale field experiments that have pinpointed predation as the key limiting factor causing these fluctuations. Predators kill hares directly and indirectly stress them by unsuccessful pursuits. Stress reduces the reproductive rate of female hares and is transmitted to their offspring who also suffer reduced reproductive rates. The maternal effects produced by predation risk induce a time lag in the response of hare reproductive rate to density, aiding the cyclic dynamics...|$|R

We also use random sampling and manual, point-based classification of recent and historical aerial imagery to quantify land use change over the past seventy years in the 2, 704 km 2 Winooski River Basin of northern Vermont. We find a general increase in annual precipitation, discharge, and mean lake level with time in the basin; discharge increases 18 % over the period of record while precipitation increases by 14 %. Over the last 70 years, mean annual temperature has increased at the Burlington Vermont station by 0. 78 degrees Celsius (1. 4 degrees Fahrenheit). Four sets of aerial photographs, taken at intervals of 12 to 29 years between 1937 and 2003 at thirty randomly selected sites, demonstrate that actively cleared land area has decreased by 14 %, while forested land and impervious surfaces increased by 10 % and 5 %, respectively.

Ocean temperature anomalies {{in the upper}} 100 m are averaged over the eastern (80 °W– 90 °W, 5 °S– 5 °N) and central (160 °E– 150 °W, 5 °S– 5 °N) equatorial Pacific to construct the EP and CP subsurface indices, respectively. The analysis is performed {{for the period of}} 1958 – 2001 using an ocean data assimilation product. It is found that the EP/CP subsurface indices are less correlated and show stronger skewness than the sea surface temperature (SST) -based indices. In addition, while both quasi-biennial (∼ 2 years) and quasi-quadrennial (∼ 4 <b>years)</b> <b>periodicities</b> appear in the SST-based indices for these two types, the subsurface indices are dominated only by the quasi-biennial periodicity for the CP type and by the quasi-quadrennial (∼ 4 <b>years)</b> <b>periodicity</b> for the EP type. Low correlation, high skewness, and single leading periodicity are desirable properties for defining indices to separate the EP and CP types. Using the subsurface indices, major El Niño and La Niña events identified by the Niño- 3. 4 SST index are classified as the EP or CP types for the analysis period. It is found that most strong El Niño events are of the EP type while most strong La Niña events are of the CP type.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{assumption}} of constant quartz accumulation for the deep-sea sediment core Y 69 - 106 P, {{taken in the}} Panama Basin, {{has been used to}} date the core and construct a sedimentation rate versus time curve for it. Stratigraphic control for the calculated time scale includes three carbon- 14 measurements, the extinction of the radiolarian Stylatractus universus, and correlation with oxygen isotope curves from other dated cores. The model sedimentation rates and sediment composition data allow the determination of sediment accumulation rates for calcium carbonate, opaline silica, and remaining "detritus". Fluctuations in calcium carbonate accumulation rates correlate closely with variations in oxygen isotope ratios in biogenous carbonate from two other equatorial Pacific sediment cores. High oxygen isotope ratios correlate with high calcium carbonate accumulation rates. Opaline silica accumulation rates reflect changes in the dominance of radiolarian fossil groups which can be related to surface circulation in the Panama Basin. The successive maxima in opal and calcium accumulation rates and the oxygen isotope ratios in Y 69 - 106 P suggest {{that at the end of}} the last glacial period, the rate of calcium carbonate dissolution increased in the Panama Basin first, to be followed by a decrease in the intensity of the eastern equatorial Pacific upwelling, and finally the volume of continental glaciers decreased.

The wavelet results of the 14 C and 10 Be data show that the cycles of 2180 - 2310, 970, 500 - 520, 350 - 360, and 210 - 220 years are dominant, and the 1720 and 1500 year cycles are relatively weak and subdominant.

These de Vries cycle events occurred every 2270 years on average, implying a connection with the Hallstatt cycle.

40|$|Past {{studies have}} {{revealed}} solar cycle {{changes in the}} sunspot activity, {{as well as in}} many other solar parameters, such as, solar flares and solar coronal holes. These solar features in turn produce the observed cyclic variations in the interplanetary plasma and fields. Both the cosmic ray intensity as well as the intensity of geomagnetic disturbances are affected by the interplanetary changes and produce 11 / 22 <b>year</b> <b>periodicity.</b> An anomalous situation has been noticed during the year 1980 (period of high sunspot activity), when both the geomagnetic disturbance index Ap, as well as the magnitude and number of Forbush decreases as small. Such an anomaly occurs, {{in spite of the fact}} that both the sunspot numbers and the energetic solar flares are almost maximum during the present solar cycle...|$|R
