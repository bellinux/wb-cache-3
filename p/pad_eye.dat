40|$|Lifting is an {{essential}} part of almost every offshore operation, which includes a variation of structures with different sizes, shapes and weights. To ensure safe lifting operations, lifting equipment must be utilized. Among these lifting equipment, pad eyes and shackles play a significant role. These pad eyes must have high safety, reliability and appropriate costs. To test and analyze the capacity of pad eyes, traditional checking methods, such as laboratory testing are usually used, which can be exhausting, time-consuming and somewhat expensive. Therefore, a simpler, equally precise, less time consuming and more cost effective would be a proper alternative solution. This alternative approach to the traditional checking methods would be the FE simulation software, Abaqus/CAE. The purpose of this thesis is to compare the FE simulation results of the capacity of the pad eyes, with the experimental and theoretical results of the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> capacity obtained from the previous study “Offshore Hook-up Project Management”[1]. To conduct the simulation analyses of the design load capacity of pad eyes, several tests had to be made. Theses tests included different pinhole sizes in the pad eyes, different strain directions of <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> pinholes, and different loads that acted on the pad eyes. The purpose of this is to check the importance of following the requirements given in related standards. Each of the simulation tests that were carried out in two different cases. The first case was when the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> was without a plate, while the second was when the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> was firmly welded to a base plate. The purpose of this was to see how the addition of the plate to the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> affected the load capacity of the pad eyes. The results that were obtained showed that the addition of the plate to the pad eyes increased the capacity of the pad eyes. They further showed that the larger the pinhole size, the less capacity the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> had, which indicates the importance of following standard’s requirements. It was also observed that a reduction of the load capacity was recognized for angled loading relative to the vertical loading case, even though theoretical capacities provide the same for both cases. Finally, when the results were compared, it revealed that some of the simulation results were close to the experimental and the theoretical results, while others were somewhat far from them. Some factors, including the uncertainty of material behavior, may have caused these deviations...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of aromatherapy on the reduction of apnea, bradycardia, and Pulse Oximetry (SPO 2) in premature infants. Materials and Methods In a clinical trial study, 60 preterm neonates randomly divided in two groups and exposed to aromatherapy with Rosa damascenes distillate or distilled water beside the routine treatment. In experimental group, two drops of 10 % Rosa damascenes distillate was dropped on the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> in second day of birth at 6 Am. The intervention was repeated in 9 AM, 12 Am, 15 PM and 18 PM hours. A same condition applied for control group and distilled water was dropped on the <b>pad</b> <b>eye.</b> The number of apnea attacks, bradycardia and decrease in SpO 2 compared between two groups using chi-square test, independent t-test and repeated measure test. Results The overall apnea attacks, bradycardia, and SPO 2 in tree studied days were lower in intervention group than control group (0. 47 ± 0. 13 vs. 2. 6 ± 0. 41, 0. 47 ± 0. 13 vs. 2. 56 ± 0. 41 and 0. 70 ± 0. 17 vs. 2. 77 ± 0. 21, respectively). In addition, the repeated measurement test showed that the mean number of apnea attacks, decrease in heart pulse rate, and decrease in SpO 2 was statistically lower in intervention group with aromatherapy than controls in first, second, third and sum of three days (P< 0. 05). Conclusion Aromatherapy with Rosa damascenes distillate can reduce more and speedy the occurrence of apnea attacks, bradycardia and SPO 2 in premature infants, along with other routine treatment...|$|E

In this study, a specially designed platform was used to perform model tests with different loading angles and cyclic parameters. First, the short-term static capacities and the failure modes for the typical inclined loading angles were studied, and then the influences of cyclic amplitude, number of cycles and cyclic period on the subsequent failure mode, and caisson capacity were investigated by applying a series of one-way cyclic loadings. The experimental results showed that when the loading angle decreases from 50. 2 ° to 32. 0 °, the model caisson’s failure mode changes to a combined mode consisting vertical motion, horizontal motion, and anticlockwise rotation, and its corresponding capacity noticeably increases. However, the increases in amplitude, number, and frequency of the previous cyclic loadings would turn this combined failure into a dominant vertical pullout and reduce its capacity to some degree. Therefore, {{the influence of the}} previous cyclic loadings should be taken into account to accurately estimate the holding capacity of the suction caisson. Full Tex...|$|E

The EPESE and NHANES batteries of tests were not sufficiently challenging to allow successful discrimination among subjects in good health, even older subjects. The GBPS allowed objective quantitative measurements, but the test-retest correlations generally were not high. The GBPS variables correlated with age only when subjects stood on a foam pad; they also were correlated with anthropometric variables. Conclusion. Both EPESE and NHANES balance tests were too easy for healthy subjects.

Ten SwDS and eleven healthy subjects participated, aged 29. 8 (4. 8) and 28. 4 (3. 9), respectively. The time-series recorded with the sampling rate of 100 Hz were used to evaluate postural performance (COP amplitude and mean velocity) and strategies (COP frequency, fractal dimension and entropy). There were no intergroup differences in the amplitude except the stance on foam <b>pad</b> with <b>eyes</b> open when SwDS had larger sway. The COP velocity and frequency were larger in SwDS than controls in all trials on foam pad. During stances on the foam pad SwDS increased fractal dimension showing higher complexity of their equilibrium system, while controls decreased sample entropy exhibiting more conscious control of posture {{in comparison to the}} stances on hard support surface. This indicated that each group used entirely different adjustments of postural strategies to the somatosensory challenge.

METHODS: This cross-over design study was performed with 10 male subjects during 6 ° head down tilt: (a) with no countermeasure; (b) while standing 25 min per day; (c) during locomotion-like activities 25 min per day. Gait was evaluated by grading subjects' performance during various locomotion tasks. Equilibrium scores were derived from peak-to-peak anterior-posterior sway while standing on a foam <b>pad</b> with the <b>eyes</b> open or closed or while making pitch head movements. RESULTS: When no countermeasure was used, head movements led to decreased postural stability and increased incidence of falls immediately after bed rest compared to before. When upright standing or locomotion-like exercises were used, postural stability and the incidence of falls were not significantly different after the bed rest from the baseline. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that daily 25 -min of standing or locomotion-like exercise proves useful against postural instability following a 5 -day bed rest.

40|$|Introduction: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is {{currently}} {{defined as a}} group of diseases with progressive cerebellar syndrome, which manifests distinctively by ataxic stance and gait. In patients with SCA, deterioration of postural control occurs due to changes of pathophysiological degenerative nervous system. Control of postural stability is significantly influenced by somatosensory afferentation of soft tissue of foot. The work objective is to determine the effect of deep foot massage on postural stability in the group of patients and to compare obtained results with experiments without deep foot massage. Methods: Seven patients of the Clinic Rehabilitation at the Faculty Hospital, Prague Motol (average age 51. 9 ± 13. 9 years, 5 men, and 2 women) with SCA and clinical signs of cerebellar ataxia were participated in this study. All patients were examined using posturography before and after application of deep foot massage. Measurements were conducted on a firm surface, foam pad with open and closed eyes.

I think you won {{first place in the}} science fair in second grade. (That was number five.) Enclosed note: Here's the book you asked for, sorry there isn't more. One day when you have your own kids you'll understand. With the first one, you take hundreds of pictures and write down everything because it’s new to you. The same with second. You slow down with the third, and by the fourth and fifth, you've seen it all already. I tried to fill in what I could remember but I guess I just blocked those years out. Sorry, Mom. If a picture is worth a thousand words, no picture must be worth a thousand more. A baby book, by definition, must grow up. It’s nurtured by words and images; the virgin pages need to be marked they are to become anything. What to do with fifty blank pages...|$|R
