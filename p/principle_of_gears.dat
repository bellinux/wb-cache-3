40|$|Every now {{and then}} a technology, or set of technologies, comes along that offers a rich set of {{components}} that can be combined and recombined to create new products. The arrival of these components then sets off a technology boom as innovators work through the possibilities. This is, of course, an old idea in economic history. Schumpeter (1934), p. 66 refers to “new combinations of productive means. ” More recently, Weitz-man (1998) used the term “recombinant growth. ” Gilfillan (1935), Usher (1954), Kauffman (1995) and many others describe variations on essentially the same idea. The attempts to develop interchangeable parts during the early nine-teenth century {{is a good example of}} a technology revolution driven by com-binatorial innovation. 1 The standardization of design (at least in <b>principle)</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears,</b> pullies, chains, cams, and other mechanical devices led to the de-velopment of the so-called “American system of manufacture ” which started in the weapons manufacturing plants of New England but eventually led to a thriving industry in domestic appliances. A century later the development of the gasoline engine led to another wave of combinatorial innovation as it was incorporated into a variety of devices from motorcycles to automobiles to airplanes.

40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> cutting tool design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> shaper cutter design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey <b>of</b> involute cylindrical <b>gearing</b> geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> manufacturing using the gear shaper cutters. It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> shaper cutter. With cylindrical gear being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> shaper cutters. The knowl- edge about the profile of the cutter teeth and the profile cut by the cutter in the gear blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The gear shaper cutter is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These re-sharpening operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> it cuts. The changes in the cutter and gear geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. Gear shaper cutter profiles usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better cutter profile, while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for gear shaper cutter design should be able to show the profile of the cutter and the profile cut by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> shaper cutters profiles cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies <b>of</b> the real-life <b>gear</b> shaper cutter designs were performed...|$|R
