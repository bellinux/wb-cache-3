25|$|Whatever the {{promises}} {{and the costs}} of the many kinds of reform attempted by the Velasco government, the ship sank because of inadequate attention to balances between spending and <b>productive</b> <b>capacity,</b> and between export incentives and import demand. The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive external balance and <b>productive</b> <b>capacity</b> readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint on spending and deficits for several years but then let things get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 percent of GNP by 1975. Correspondingly, the external current-account balance was positive in the period 1968-70 but showed a deficit equal to 10 percent of GNP by 1975.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{government}} and related institutional approaches to increasing agricultural output and improving rural livelihoods in Honduras in the 1980 s were {{limited in their}} abilities to reduce the vulnerability' of small maize farmers to food insecurity.

However, such policies did not always take into account structural obstacles to change, such as the social relations of production and exchange in the countryside which affected access to and control over resources for and benefits from food production.

25|$|Despite these {{setbacks}} in {{the implementation}} of evacuation policy early in the war, around 12 million Soviet citizens successfully evacuated in 1941, even if a number of these were the result of disorganised, “spontaneous self-evacuation,” and another 4.5 million evacuated the following year. In addition, the factories that were successfully evacuated to the Central Asian rear would help provide the <b>productive</b> <b>capacity</b> the Soviets needed to eventually win the war, as well as preventing the Germans from acquiring additional industrial resources.

25|$|The {{economic}} losses affected everyone. Banks {{and insurance companies}} were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless.

The loss of infrastructure and <b>productive</b> <b>capacity</b> meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves.

25|$|Since {{joining the}} EU in 1973, Ireland has {{received}} over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These {{are made up}} of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These transfer payments from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased <b>productive</b> <b>capacity</b> is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the battle, the Germans greatly {{underestimated the}} size of the RAF and the scale of British {{aircraft}} production. Across the Channel, the Air Intelligence division of the Air Ministry consistently overestimated {{the size of}} the German air enemy and the <b>productive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the German aviation industry. As the battle was fought, both sides exaggerated the losses inflicted on the other by an equally large margin. However, the intelligence picture formed before the battle encouraged the Luftwaffe to believe that such losses pushed Fighter Command to the very edge of defeat, while the exaggerated picture of German air strength persuaded the RAF that the threat it faced was larger and more dangerous than was the case. This led the British to the conclusion that another fortnight of attacks on airfields might force Fighter Command to withdraw their squadrons from the south of England. The German misconception, on the other hand, encouraged first complacency, then strategic misjudgement. The shift of targets from air bases to industry and communications was taken because it was assumed that Fighter Command was virtually eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In the Persian Empire, a {{regulated}} {{and sustainable}} tax system {{was introduced by}} Darius I the Great in 500 BC; the Persian system of taxation was tailored to each Satrapy (the area ruled by a Satrap or provincial governor). At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 Satrapies in the Empire and each was assessed according to its supposed productivity. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Satrap to collect the due amount and to send it to the treasury, after deducting his expenses (the expenses and the power of deciding precisely how and from whom to raise the money in the province, offer maximum opportunity for rich pickings). The quantities demanded from the various provinces gave a vivid picture of their economic potential. For instance, Babylon was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities; 1,000 silver talents and four months supply of food for the army. India, a province fabled for its gold, was to supply gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4,680 silver talents. Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (and, later, of the Roman Empire) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. This tax was exclusively levied on Satrapies based on their lands, <b>productive</b> <b>capacity</b> and tribute levels.|$|E

40|$|Dairy cattle feeding guides are {{available}} in various forms. The feeding recommendations vary considerably among them, depending on the source of data, methods of analysis of data, methods of presentation and purpose of the feeding guide. The majority of the guides are difficult {{to adapt to the}} various dairy farm conditions. This study was an attempt to prepare a feeding guide which would include some of the factors whose effect on milk production can be measured. Secondary sources of data were used as it was impossible to conduct a controlled experiment. The feeding guide was made into two parts. The first part consisted on the basic data which gave estimates of milk production from cows of 26 different <b>productive</b> <b>capacities,</b> fed medium quality roughage freely and grain rations ranging from no grain to levels where the last pound of grain resulted in the production of 0. 3 pound of milk. The marginal physical product ranging from 1. 00 to 0. 30 at different levels of grain feeding was calculated for each of the 26 cows at different <b>productive</b> <b>capacities</b> to allow dairymen to estimate the point where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue. The second part of the feeding guide, made to fit over the first part, would allow estimates of milk production and the economic optimum level of feeding for factors that deviate from the basic part of the feeding guide. The features that can be considered in using the feeding guide are: Changes in the prices of hay, grain, and milk. Variations in the quality of roughage. Restricting the quantity of roughage feeding.
