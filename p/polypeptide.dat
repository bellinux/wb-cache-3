5|$|In 1991 a {{research}} {{group led by}} Clarence A. Ryan, isolated an 18 amino acid <b>polypeptide</b> from tomato leaves that induced the production of protease inhibitor proteins (PIs) in response to wounding. Experiments using synthetic radio-labelled forms of the <b>polypeptide</b> demonstrated that {{it was able to}} travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the wounding signal, it was named systemin, it was the first <b>polypeptide</b> found to function as a hormone in plants. mRNA encoding for systemin is found in all tissues of the plant except the roots. Later studies identified homologs of tomato systemin in other members of the Solanaceae including potato, black nightshade and bell pepper. Systemins have only been identified in the Solaneae subtribe of the Solanaceae, but other members of the family, such as tobacco, also respond to wounding by systemically producing protease inhibitors.|$|E

40|$|Over 30 viral-specified <b>polypeptides</b> are {{translated}} {{in vitro}} from RNA of cells productively infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The <b>polypeptides</b> map to sites in EBV DNA by hybrid selection. Almost {{all of the}} <b>polypeptides</b> are reactive with EBV immune human serum. Several of the <b>polypeptides</b> {{are part of the}} early antigen complex. Two others are likely to be major structural components of the virus. Genes encoding persistent early and late <b>polypeptides</b> are intermixed through most of the EBV genome...|$|R
40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -specified <b>polypeptides</b> induced upon viral {{replication}} in the P 3 HR- 1 cell line {{have been examined}} by immunoprecipitation with a high-titer human anti-EBV serum. Twenty-five predominant <b>polypeptides</b> were identified in cell extracts, whereas 18 <b>polypeptides</b> were precipitated from cell-free translation reactions directed by total mRNA. Hybrid selection of mRNA to the BamHI DNA clones of the EBV genome and immunoprecipitation of the corresponding cell-free translation products revealed 98 EBV-specified <b>polypeptides</b> and their coding location along the viral genome. In addition, the viral <b>polypeptides</b> that bind reversibly to DNA-cellulose have been characterized and the deduced map locations of this functional group of EBV-specified <b>polypeptides</b> is presented...|$|R
5|$|The words protein, <b>polypeptide,</b> and peptide are {{a little}} {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally {{used to refer to}} the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. <b>Polypeptide</b> can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the <b>polypeptide</b> poly-lysine and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the <b>polypeptide</b> poly-proline. Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers {{most of the remaining}} codons were then determined.|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid <b>polypeptide</b> which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid <b>polypeptide,</b> exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{messenger}} RNA (mRNA) for <b>polypeptides</b> of the chlorophyll a/b-protein complex of thylakoid membranes in etiolated and greening cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii y- 1 was examined by immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis of products of {{in vitro translation}} to determine at which stage production of these <b>polypeptides</b> is regulated. Cells grown 4 d in the dark at 25 degrees C contained small amounts of translatable mRNA for the major membrane <b>polypeptides.</b> Exposure of these etiolated cells to light, under conditions in which the membrane <b>polypeptides</b> accumulated, resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the quantity of the mRNA. In contrast, when etiolated cells were incubated for 1 - 2 h in the dark at 38 degrees C, translation assays indicated that mRNA for the membrane <b>polypeptides</b> became abundant. Moreover, the quantity of the mRNA did not increase when these cells subsequently were exposed to light. Therefore, at 38 degrees C the cellular level of the <b>polypeptides</b> is not regulated by synthesis of mRNA. The in vitro synthesized <b>polypeptides,</b> which were precipitated with antibodies prepared against the purified thylakoid <b>polypeptides,</b> had apparent molecular weights of 31, 500 and 30, 000. The corresponding immunoprecipitated <b>polypeptides</b> made in vivo had apparent molecular weights of 29, 500 and 26, 000. Thus, the membrane <b>polypeptides</b> are made as precursors. No net accumulation of the <b>polypeptides</b> occurred in cells in the dark at 38 degrees C, but immunoreactive <b>polypeptides</b> the size of the mature membrane components were labeled during incubation of cells with [14 C]acetate in the dark. These results indicated that the mRNA was translated in the dark, but since the <b>polypeptides</b> did not accumulate, the products of translation were probably degraded. We conclude from our experiments that at 25 degrees C production of the <b>polypeptides</b> is regulated by the level of translatable mRNA in the cells. At 38 degrees C, however, the accumulation of the <b>polypeptides</b> is controlled by posttranslational processes...|$|R

Individual <b>polypeptides</b> were identified by immunoprecipitation. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the <b>polypeptides</b> did not accumulate in the membranes but underwent rapid degradation.

A complex pattern of apparently virus-specified <b>polypeptides</b> exhibiting temporal {{control of the}} type seen with intracellular <b>polypeptides</b> after virus infection was observed. Some of the specifically secreted <b>polypeptides</b> were shown to be modified by glycosylation and sulfation. The possible significance of these results is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Some {{amino acids}} have special {{properties}} such as cysteine, that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues, proline that forms a cycle to the <b>polypeptide</b> backbone, and glycine {{that is more}} flexible than other amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The {{precursor}} to tomato systemin is transcribed as a 200 amino acid <b>polypeptide.</b> It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid <b>polypeptide</b> and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E
5|$|The {{amino acids}} in a <b>polypeptide</b> chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an {{individual}} amino acid {{is called a}} residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone.|$|E

40|$|In an n-alkane-assimilating Candida sp., {{transfer}} from glucose- to n-alkane-containing medium induced {{changes in the}} microsomal proteins, and several distinctive <b>polypeptides</b> were demonstrated in the solubilized microsomal fraction derived from n-alkane-grown cells. Long-term-labeling and pulse-labeling experiments in vivo demonstrated the synthesis of the specific microsomal <b>polypeptides.</b> The <b>polypeptides</b> were synthesized as in vitro translation products directed by polyadenylated RNA extracted from n-alkane-grown cells. Two major <b>polypeptides</b> were partially purified from the microsomal fraction from n-alkane-grown cells, and antiserum was prepared in a rabbit. Immunoprecipitation of these two <b>polypeptides</b> was accompanied {{by an increase in}} the amount of translatable mRNA. The molecular weights of the <b>polypeptides</b> derived from long-term-labeling, pulse-labeling and in vitro translation experiments appeared to be identical...|$|R
40|$|Branched <b>polypeptides</b> with polylysine {{backbone}} {{are promising}} candidates for selective delivery of drugs, epitopes. or reporter molecules. We reported earlier that polylysine-based <b>polypeptides</b> with polyanionic character were internalized by murine bone marrow derived macrophages via class A scavenger receptor. In the present studies, our investigations were extended to seven <b>polypeptides</b> with different amino acid composition and charge properties. We report on our {{findings on the}} concentration-dependent influence of these compounds on survival and chemotaxis of the murine macrophage-like cell line J 774 and internalization properties of the <b>polypeptides</b> by J 774 cells. Our observations indicate that the <b>polypeptides</b> regardless of their charge properties were essentially nontoxic and did not alter significantly the chemotaxis of J 774 cells; therefore, the <b>polypeptides</b> suit the requirements for nontoxic and "neutral" carrier molecules. We also demonstrated that the <b>polypeptides</b> were internalized efficiently by J 774 cells, depending on their chemical structure and charge properties. Using the scavenger receptor-ligand fucoidan as inhibitor, we established that the scavenger receptor played a role-in accordance with findings on murine bone marrow derived macrophages in the internalization only of the polyanionic <b>polypeptides...</b>|$|R
5|$|They used a {{cell-free}} {{system to}} translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) {{and discovered that}} the <b>polypeptide</b> that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine. They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} <b>polypeptide.</b> A protein contains at least one long <b>polypeptide.</b> Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single <b>polypeptide,</b> such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional gel {{electrophoresis}} resolves total cellular protein from Euglena gracilis klebs var bacillaris Cori into 640 <b>polypeptides,</b> 79 {{of which are}} induced by light exposure. The inhibition of chloroplast translation by streptomycin, the direct inhibition of photosynthesis {{as well as the}} indirect inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis by 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU) and the specific inhibition of photosynthesis but not chlorophyll synthesis by DCMU in the presence of 17 millimolar ethanol failed to inhibit the accumulation of 40 <b>polypeptides.</b> These <b>polypeptides</b> appear to be synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and their accumulation is independent of the developmental status of the chloroplast. Streptomycin but not DCMU completely inhibited the accumulation of six <b>polypeptides</b> which are undetectable in mutants lacking chloroplast DNA suggesting that these <b>polypeptides</b> are translated on chloroplast ribosomes. The accumulation of seven <b>polypeptides</b> which are detectable in mutants lacking chloroplast DNA was also inhibited by streptomycin but not by DCMU suggesting that the accumulation of these <b>polypeptides</b> is dependent upon stabilization by a chloroplast translation product. The accumulation of 12 <b>polypeptides</b> was inhibited by streptomycin and by DCMU under conditions in which chlorophyll synthesis was inhibited, but not under conditions in which chlorophyll synthesis was unaffected by DCMU. The inhibition by DCMU of the accumulation of these <b>polypeptides</b> appears to be due to the inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis suggesting that they are components of pigment protein complexes. The accumulation of six <b>polypeptides</b> was inhibited under all conditions in which photosynthesis was inhibited suggesting that the accumulation of these <b>polypeptides</b> is dependent upon a product of photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{patterns}} of <b>polypeptides</b> synthesized by two co-isogenic monokaryons and the derived dikaryon of the basidiomycete Schizophyflum commune, growing in surface culture, were compared by two-dimensional PAGE after labelling with [35 S]sulphate. Synthesis {{of most of}} the <b>polypeptides</b> (400 analysed) was common but at day 3 some 30 <b>polypeptides</b> were synthesized in the dikaryon which were not seen in the monokaryons. At this time the dikaryon had formed hyphal aggregates. Ten additional novel <b>polypeptides</b> were being synthesized in the primordia arising from these aggregates at day 4. In surface culture, monokaryons and dikaryon excreted 4 to 8 % of the labelled proteins (over 80 different <b>polypeptides)</b> into the medium compared with only 1 to 2 % when cultivation was done in liquid shaken cultures. The <b>polypeptides</b> specifically secreted by the dikaryon at the aggregation stage consisted of seven small <b>polypeptides</b> with molecular weights ranging from 10 to 14 x lo 3, and two <b>polypeptides</b> with molecular weights 18 x lo 3 and 26 x lo 3, respectively. Such differences in excreted proteins between monokaryons and dikaryon were not observed when the mycelia were grown in liquid shaken cultures, indicating a relationship with fruit-body format ion. A comparison of labelled proteins in isolated hyphal walls revealed six <b>polypeptides</b> specifically associated with the walls of monokaryons and dikaryon irrespective of the cultivation method. Among the <b>polypeptides</b> newly appearing in the dikaryon at aggregation two were associated with the walls and co-migrated with the <b>polypeptides</b> of molecular weights 18 x lo 3 and 26 x lo 3 excreted into the medium at this stage of development...|$|R

5|$|The two {{proteins}} can later fuse {{together to}} form a single <b>polypeptide.</b> Regardless of which protein comes first, this fusion protein may show similar function. Thus, if a fusion between two proteins occurs twice in evolution (either between paralogues within the same species or between orthologues in different species) but in a different order, the resulting fusion proteins will be related by a circular permutation.|$|E

40|$|To catalog <b>polypeptides</b> {{that were}} {{specific}} to developing hearts, we separated 35 S-methionine-labeled 9. 5 day mouse embyros into cardiac and noncardiac (carcass) components. Two-dimensional gels were {{then used to}} analyze the <b>polypeptides</b> synthesized in these two fractions. As a result, we were able to distinguish <b>polypeptides</b> that were specific to or increased in the heart as well as those <b>polypeptides</b> that were specific to or inceased in the embryo minus the dissected heart. Using this analysis, there were two <b>polypeptides</b> that were cardiac-specific and 17 that were expressed at increased levels by at least twofold in the heart. The cardiac-specific <b>polypeptides</b> may be used in further studies to identify early cardiac tissue. Conversely, there were 26 <b>polypeptides</b> unique to noncardiac structures and an additional 15 that were increased in the carcass more than twofold relative to the heart. The noncardiac-specific <b>polypeptides</b> may be used to define contamination of putative cardiac tissue with noncardiac material. Two of the <b>polypeptides</b> expressed more abundantly in the carcass appeared to correspond to known proteins in the mouse fibroblast database, cyclin and tropomyosin 4. Thus the heart at 9. 5 days of murine development can be distinguished readily from the remainder of the embryonic mouse both macroscopically and on two-dimensional gels...|$|R
40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} membranes of Rhodopseudomonas viridis {{consist of}} a regular array of structural units. Each unit is composed of a central core (thought to contain the reaction centre complex) surrounded by a subdivided ring of protein (of likely antennae function). These individual units can be dissociated from the membrances {{using a variety of}} detergent treatments. The absorption spectrum, used as a criterion of a native state, is retained. All of the seven major <b>polypeptides,</b> the four reaction centre <b>polypeptides</b> (cytochrome, H, M and L chain) as well as the three light-harvesting <b>polypeptides</b> (B 1015 -α, β and ξ) are shown to be present. Electron microscopy of the units shows a similar structure to the units within the membrane. surface-specific iodination of both membranes and units labels predominantly <b>polypeptides</b> H, B 1015 -α, and ξ. M and L are weakly labelled. In addition, B 1015 -β is labelled in the isolated units. This, with other evidence, supports an allocation of light-harvesting <b>polypeptides</b> to the outer ring. Further solubilisation of these units separates the reaction centre (as a native complex containing all four <b>polypeptides)</b> from the light-harvesting <b>polypeptides.</b> The light-harvesting <b>polypeptides</b> are obtained in a form containing all three <b>polypeptides</b> and bound pigment, however the peak at 1015 nm corresponding to native bacteriochlorophyll b is lost...|$|R

5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing <b>polypeptide</b> chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new <b>polypeptide</b> chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the <b>polypeptide</b> chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Short {{proteins}} {{can also}} be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield. Chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into <b>polypeptide</b> chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.|$|E

40|$|Major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} by one and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in Myriosclerotinia borealis, Coprinus psychromorbidus, Typhula idahoensis and Typhula incarnata. The number, molecular mass, relative proportions and isoelectric points of the major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> varied from species to species. Furthermore, several of the major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> were shown to be antigenically related by Ouchterlony double-diffusion and Western blot analysis. Polyclonal antibodies used for localizing the major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> in the sclerotia by immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the major <b>polypeptides</b> were sequestered in sclerotial protein bodies in all four species. This indicates that the major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> {{may play a role}} as storage proteins. Major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> were not detected in vegetative hyphae of M. borealis and C. psychromorbidus at 5 dollar∘dollarC, but significant accumulations were observed at 25 dollar∘dollarC by Western blot analysis. Major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> were detected in the vegetative hyphae of the Typhula species incubated at 5 dollar∘dollarC. Fluorographic analysis combined with Western blotting showed that synthesis of the major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> was induced when vegetative hyphae of M. borealis and C. psychromorbidus were shifted from 5 dollar∘dollarC to 10 dollar∘dollarC, whereas vegetative hyphae of T. idahoensis and T. incarnata showed constitutive synthesis of some of the major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> at 5 dollar∘dollarC. A shift from 5 dollar∘dollarC to 10 dollar∘dollarC had little effect on the synthesis of major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> in the Typhula spp. Thus, vegetative hyphae of M. borealis and C. psychromorbidus appeared to be much more sensitive to temperature as a cue for inducing synthesis of the major sclerotial <b>polypeptides</b> than vegetative hyphae of the Typhula spp. The significance of these observations and their bearing on sclerotial development in the species examined is discussed...|$|R
