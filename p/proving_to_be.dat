Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{formidable}} figure {{at the heart of}} his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss, but he dragged his shot wide.|$|E

Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> primitive recursive.

5|$|Peugeot's {{final year}} as Prost's engine {{supplier}} in 2000 saw some optimism, Prost hiring his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi {{to drive the}} lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one, with the AP03 <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unreliable and ill handling. Things weren't helped when both drivers collided {{with each other in}} the Austrian Grand Prix. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.|$|E

5|$|The European Cup was {{retained}} in 1980, this time against Kevin Keegan's Hamburger SV at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Clough and Taylor then {{began the process}} of breaking up the championship winning team, selling off Martin O'Neill, Ian Bowyer, Garry Birtles, and Larry Lloyd; as a new team was built based around youngsters such as Gary Mills, Stuart Gray, Colin Walsh, and Bryn Gunn. New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte. Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league, with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsuccessful. Clough would stay at Forest for another 11 seasons, but without Taylor would only add two League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club's trophy cabinet, and would struggle against alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Argyle {{salvaged}} a late point against Preston North End at {{the start}} of March, but remained in serious trouble at the bottom end of the table, seven points adrift of safety with 13 matches remaining. A 2–0 defeat followed at Queens Park Rangers, with Adel Taarabt playing a part in both of the home sides goals. Draws at Home Park were <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an Achilles' heel for Argyle, but they secured a creditable 1–1 draw at play-off chasing Coventry City, having taken the lead through a glancing header from Árnason. Three days later, a 20-yard strike from captain Fletcher earned Argyle their fifth home win of the season in a 3–2 thriller against Bristol City. They had taken a 2–0 lead through Chris Clark and an overhead kick from Bradley Wright-Phillips, his first for the club. However, the visitors responded in the second-half with two goals from Nicky Maynard before former Welsh international Fletcher scored with seconds to spare. Argyle travelled to play Scunthorpe United looking to keep up the momentum, but threw away a lead to be defeated by a deflected effort from Martyn Woolford.|$|E

It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E

5|$|By now the Ottomans had {{essentially}} won the war; Byzantium {{was reduced}} to a few settlements other than Constantinople and was forced to recognize its vassal status to the Ottoman Sultan. This vassalage continued until 1394. However, whilst Constantinople had been neutralized, the surrounding Christian powers were still a threat to the Ottomans and Asia Minor was not under complete Ottoman control. The Ottomans continued their thrust into the Balkans, <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great conquerors in Europe as they were in Anatolia; in 1385 Sofia was captured from the Bulgarians and Niš was taken the following year. Other smaller states were subjugated as vassals, including the Serbs. Serbian resistance was crushed at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, much of Bulgaria was taken in 1393 by Bayezid I (the Thunderbolt) and in 1396 the last bastion of Bulgarian independence was wiped out when Vdiin fell.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{opened the}} new season by {{claiming}} the 1976 FA Charity Shield with a 1–0 win over Southampton, {{and went on to}} win the league largely on their home form, Kennedy's goal in a 2–1 win over title contenders Ipswich Town on 30 April <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> decisive. Though Liverpool failed to win any of their last four league matches, they finished one point clear of Manchester City in second. Liverpool won the European Super Cup with a comprehensive 7–1 victory over German club Hamburg. Liverpool also reached the 1977 FA Cup Final, but lost the chance to follow Arsenal's feat at achieving the Double as they were beaten 2–1 by bitter rivals Manchester United. In the European Cup, Liverpool beat Crusaders (Northern Ireland), Trabzonspor (Turkey), AS Saint-Étienne (France), and FC Zürich (Switzerland) to reach the final against German side Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the final at Rome's Stadio Olimpico, Kennedy won a late penalty which Phil Neal converted to give Liverpool a 3–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF's {{board of}} {{directors}} initiated {{the search for a}} new stadium in the mid-1990s. Malmö Stadion, where Malmö FF had played since its construction in 1958, was starting to deteriorate by this time, and was also too large for the club, which often struggled to fill it for Allsvenskan matches. In 1995, club chairman Bengt Madsen began {{to raise money for the}} renovation of Malmö IP, the club's former home between 1910 and 1957, into a modern football stadium. Malmö IP was practical and economical for the club as it was already an extant site, and was smaller than Malmö Stadion, which was expensive to maintain. The renovation of Malmö IP was finished in August 1999, and Malmö FF moved in soon after. However, the renovated ground failed to live up to expectations, <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very basic by modern standards; the paltry capacity of 7,600 was also deemed a security issue. The club therefore moved back to Malmö Stadion in 2001.|$|E

Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
5|$|Serbia's strongest {{exports to}} the United States include Fiat {{automobiles}} manufactured in Kragujevac.

The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and is <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States. Serbia is also the largest exporter of raspberries in the world (as of 2009), and much of the raspberries consumed in the United States are grown in Šumadija.

5|$|The {{oldest and}} fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The {{two sides are}} local rivals, having both formed {{originally}} around local companies, with players {{living in the same}} localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.|$|E
