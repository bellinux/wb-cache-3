40|$|For a non-negative integer n an ordered {{partition}} {{of a set}} Xn with n distinct elements is called a <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> (PA). A barred <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> (BPA) is a <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> with bars in between the blocks of the partition. An integer sequence an associated with the counting PA's of Xn has been intensely studied over {{a century and a}} half in many different contexts. In this thesis we develop a unified combinatorial framework to study the enumeration of BPAs and a special subclass of BPAs. The results of the study lead to a positive settlement of an open problem and a conjecture by Nelsen. We derive few important identities pertaining to the number of BPAs and restricted BPAs of an n element set using generating- functionology.

40|$|A {{preferential}} arrangement {{of a set}} X_n={ 1, 2, [...] .,n} is an ordered partition of the set X_n induced with a linear order. Separation of blocks of a {{preferential arrangement}} with bars result in the notation of barred <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Roger Nelsen and Harvey Schmidt have proposed the family of generating functions P^k(m) =e^km/ 2 -e^m; which for k= 0 and for k= 2 they {{have shown that the}} generating functions are exponential generating functions for the number of <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> of a set X_n and the number of chains in the power set of X_n respectively. In this study we propose combinatorial structures whose integer sequences are generated by members of the family for all values of k in Z^+.

40|$|Because the European Union (EU) {{has sought}} from its {{earliest}} history to accommodate nonmember countries through various <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the further expansion toward {{the eastern part}} of Europe is bound to affect the benefits that partners in these <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> can count on.

This paper examines the various <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the major effects that are likely to be experienced by them as a result of the eastward extension of the EU.

The idea of a preferential arrangement has been extended to a wider combinatorial object called barred preferential arrangement with multiple bars.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{proliferation}} of proposals for bilateral free trade areas (FTAs) in East Asia in recent times. These initiatives fly {{in the face of}} the long-standing support of key players in the region such as Japan for the MFN-based non-discriminatory trading system and the commitment to non-discriminatory trade liberalisation and reform within APEC. As China establishes its role in the WTO, its interests are very much in an open global trading system. The paper argues that the core interests of East Asian economies remain in non-discriminatory global trading arrangements and prosecuting those interests within the Doha Round of trade negotiations. It suggests that a way forward in sorting out the trade-distorting and protectionist effects of FTAs would be for East Asian economies to take a lead in negotiations on strengthening the WTO rules on <b>preferential</b> trade <b>arrangements.</b> In terms of global economic welfare, the only good <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> is one that disappears in time.

Because there are reasons to anticipate a positive correlation between the predominant direction of trade flows in the past and membership in <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the present, there may be a tendency to spuriously attribute to <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> the effects of historical factors and to exaggerate the influence of the former. Thus, the standard gravity-model formulation, which neglects the role of historical factors, suffers from omitted-variables bias.

We find that historical factors exercise an important influence on trade even after controlling for the arguments of the standard gravity model. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> (bilateral and {{multilateral}} free trade areas and GSP systems (preferences for developing countries)) are emerging {{everywhere in the}} world trading system and are causing concern because they discriminate against non-members and add complexity, distortions and inconsistency to the global system. Rules of origin (ROOs) linked to these arrangements are {{a significant part of the}} problem.

This essay argues that WTO members should authorize negotiations seeking to harmonize preferential ROOs (rules of origin linked to <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements)</b> around core principles consistent with WTO rules. The harmonized preferential ROOs should be aligned as much as possible with the harmonized regime for non-preferential ROOs (rules of origin linked to non-preferential arrangements) likely to emerge from the current hold-over WTO negotiations authorized by the Uruguay Round ROOs Agreement. They should be nonrestrictive, based essentially on the principle that substantial transformation confers origin, and - except where developing countries benefit - should not allow cumulation (treating product components from within the preferential region as locally produced). Existing preferential ROOs not consistent with these principles could be argued to violate Article XXIV, and in some cases Article III, of GATT 1994. In the case of developing country preferences, bilateral cumulation in GSP systems could be argued to violate the Enabling Clause...|$|E
