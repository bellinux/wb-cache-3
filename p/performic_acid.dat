50|$|<b>Performic</b> <b>acid</b> is a colorless liquid soluble in water, alcohols, ether, benzene, {{chloroform}} {{and other}} organic solvents. Its strong oxidizing properties {{are used for}} cleaving disulfide bonds in protein mapping, {{as well as for}} epoxidation, hydroxylation and oxidation reactions in organic synthesis.

The success of protein identification in a PMF experiment {{is directly related to}} the amount of amino acid sequence coverage. In an effort to increase the amount of sequence information obtained in a MALDI PMF experiment, <b>performic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation is performed on tryptic digests of known proteins. <b>Performic</b> <b>acid</b> was chosen as the chemical oxidant due to the ease of use and to the selective oxidation of cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues.

40|$|Percarboxylic acids are {{commonly}} used as disinfection and bleaching agents in textile, paper, and fine chemical industries. All of these applications {{are based on the}} oxidative potential of these compounds. In spite of high interest in these chemicals, they are unstable and explosive chemicals, which increase the risk of synthesis processes and transportation. Therefore, the safety criteria in the production process should be considered. Microreactors represent a technology that efficiently utilizes safety advantages resulting from small scale. Therefore, microreactor technology was used in the synthesis of peracetic acid and <b>performic</b> <b>acid.</b> These percarboxylic acids were produced at different temperatures, residence times and catalyst i. e. sulfuric acid concentrations. Both synthesis reactions seemed to be rather fast because with <b>performic</b> <b>acid</b> equilibrium was reached in 4 min at 313 K and with peracetic acid in 10 min at 343 K. In addition, the experimental results were used to study the kinetics of the formation of <b>performic</b> <b>acid</b> and peracetic acid. The advantages of the microreactors in this study were the efficient temperature control even in very exothermic reaction and good mixing due to the short diffusion distances. Therefore, reaction rates were determined with high accuracy. Three different models were considered in order to estimate the kinetic parameters such as reaction rate constants and activation energies. From these three models, the laminar flow model with radial velocity distribution gave most precise parameters. However, sulfuric acid creates many drawbacks in this synthesis process. Therefore, a ´´greener´´ way to use heterogeneous catalyst in the synthesis of <b>performic</b> <b>acid</b> in microreactor was studied. The cation exchange resin, Dowex 50 Wx 8, presented very high activity and a long life time in this reaction. In the presence of this catalyst, the equilibrium was reached in 120 second at 313 K which indicates a rather fast reaction. In addition, the safety advantages of microreactors were investigated in this study. Four different conventional methods were used. Production of peracetic acid was used as a test case, and the safety of one conventional batch process was compared with an on-site continuous microprocess. It was found that the conventional methods for the analysis of process safety might not be reliable and adequate for radically novel technology, such as microreactors. This is understandable because the conventional methods are partly based on experience, which is very limited in connection with totally novel technology. Therefore, one checklist-based method was developed to study the safety of intensified and novel processes at the early stage of process development. The checklist was formulated using the concept of layers of protection for a chemical process. The traditional and three intensified processes of hydrogen peroxide synthesis were selected as test cases. With these real cases, it was shown that several positive and negative effects on safety can be detected in process intensification.

Treatment of the enzyme with N-acetylimidazole modified an amino group, exposed a previously inaccessible cysteine residue and inhibited hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate, but not its formation. 3. After reaction of the enzyme successively with N-acetylimidazole and with non-radioactive iodoacetamide/serine/borate, two active-site residues reacted with iodo[14 C]acetamide. One of these possessed a carboxy group, which formed a [14 C]glycollamide ester, and the other was cysteine, shown by isolation of S-[14 C]carboxymethylcysteine after acid hydrolysis. When N-acetylimidazole treatment was omitted, only the carboxy group reacted with iodo[14 C]acetamide. 4.

These observations were made possible by coupling a jet-stirred reactor with molecular-beam sampling capabilities, operated near atmospheric pressure, to a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer that employs single-photon ionization via tunable synchrotron-generated vacuum-ultraviolet radiation. On the basis of experimentally observed ionization thresholds and fragmentation appearance energies, interpreted {{with the aid of}} ab initio calculations, we have identified HPMF and its conceivable decomposition products HC(O) O(O) CH (formic acid anhydride), HC(O) OOH (<b>performic</b> <b>acid),</b> and HOC(O) OH (carbonic acid).

We show that the theoretical characterization of multiple conformeric structures of some intermediates is required when interpreting the experimentally observed ionization thresholds, and a simple method is presented for estimating the importance of multiple conformers at the estimated temperature (∼ 100 K) of the present molecular beam. We also discuss possible formation pathways of the detected species: for example, supported by potential energy surface calculations, we show that <b>performic</b> <b>acid</b> may be a minor channel of the O 2 + CH 2 OCH 2 OOH reaction, resulting from the decomposition of the HOOCH 2 OCHOOH intermediate, which predominantly leads to the HPMF. © 2015 American Chemical Society...|$|E

Immunoprecipitation with anti-oxytocin yielded 1 band at 14 kDa. On SDS-PAGE the 14 kDa band had a similar mobility to rat-hypothalamic oxytocin precursor.

40|$|Analysis {{results are}} discussed. The {{hydrolysis}} methods elaborated {{in this paper}} includes: (i) The use of 6 N hydrochloric acid solution at 110 and 145 °C {{for the analysis of}} most amino acids. (ii) The use of 6 N hydrochloric acid solution after pre-hydro-lysis oxidation procedure using <b>performic</b> <b>acid</b> for methionine and cystine determination; (iii) The use of sodium hydroxide or barium hydroxide solutions for tryptophan determination. Both precision and accuracy of the analytical data resulted from the application of those hydrolysis methods are also discussed. It may be concluded that {{in order to be able}} to determine all of the amino acids in the sample, more than one hydrolysis procedure or sample preparation method have to be used...|$|E
40|$|In this work, palm based dihydroxystearic acid (DHSA) was {{produced}} from epoxidation of oleic acid with <b>performic</b> <b>acid,</b> followed by hydrolysis of the epoxide. The crude DHSA was purified by employing solvent crystallization. Two different crystallization conditions (natural cooling and rapid cooling modes) were studied using ethanol as solvent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gas chromatography (GC) and {{particle size distribution}} (PSD) were used to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of the crystals. The SEM revealed that DHSA forms a sphere-like crystal. After crystallization, purity of the DHSA increased from 69. 3 to 86. 8 - 91. 4 %. It was observed that natural cooling mode yielded a broader distribution and larger particle diameter compared to rapid cooling mode...|$|E
