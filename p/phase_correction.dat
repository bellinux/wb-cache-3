40|$|In August 2005 an observing {{campaign}} {{was conducted to}} measure the horizontal variability in the temperature profile above the Chajnantor site. The temperature profile is known to affect pointing and <b>phase</b> <b>corrections,</b> as well as amplitude calibrations, and so knowledge of the likely variation in temperature is essential for planning ancillary meteorological equipment for the site. The campaign concentrated on analysing the atmosphere in two locations of the extended array configuration. In these two sites, radiosonde balloons were launched at regular intervals and high frequency surface measurements were taken using a meteorological mast. The {{results of the study}} have shown that the temperature profile in the first 100 m above the ground is strongly controlled by surface heating and cooling, and that variation in the altitude of the terrain can introduce horizontal temperature variations of up to 5 K over the site. We have analysed the likely impact of these temperature variations on pointing and <b>phase</b> <b>corrections,</b> looking at the errors introduced by assuming that the temperature profile from one location can be used to estimate the pointing and <b>phase</b> <b>corrections</b> at the second location.

A systematic program of evaluating the rst three eikonal corrections to Glauber theory has been developed and simple formulas for the eikonal <b>phase</b> <b>corrections</b> have been given. Wallace has deduced a generating function for the eikonal <b>phase</b> <b>corrections</b> of arbitrary order and also has conjectured a sum of the eikonal expansion valid in the limit of high energy and arbitrary potential strength.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{between theory and}} experiment is made for the XAFS of the Zr and Ba K-edges in BaZrO 3. BaZrO 3 is chosen because of its simple and well understood structure but combines metallic atoms with oxygens. It is found that adding <b>phase</b> <b>corrections</b> to the theoretical XAFS significantly improves {{the accuracy of the}} structural parameters. These corrections are changes in the core electron threshold energy E 0 for each single scattering path involving a different type of backscattering atom. This, together with the fact that no corrections were needed for pure metal Cu, suggests that the <b>phase</b> <b>corrections</b> needed are due to charge distribution effects which are neglected in the theory.

50|$|Lattice {{topology}} {{filters are}} not very common. The {{reason for this is}} that they require more components (especially inductors) than other designs. Ladder topology is much more popular. However, they do have the property of being intrinsically balanced and a balanced version of another topology, such as T-sections, may actually end up using more inductors. One application is for all-pass <b>phase</b> <b>correction</b> filters on balanced telecommunication lines. The theorem also makes an appearance in the design of crystal filters at RF frequencies. Here ladder topologies have some undesirable properties, but a common design strategy is to start from a ladder implementation because of its simplicity. Bartlett's theorem is then used to transform the design to an intermediate stage as a step towards the final implementation (using a transformer to produce an unbalanced version of the lattice topology).|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{found that the}} equations of motion of several semiclassical systems {{must take into account}} terms arising from Berry phases contributions. Those terms are responsible for the spin Hall effect in semiconductor as well as the Magnus effect of light propagating in inhomogeneous media. Intensive ongoing research on this subject seems to indicate that a broad class of quantum systems may be affected by Berry phase terms. It is therefore important to find a general procedure allowing for the determination of semiclassical Hamiltonian with Berry <b>Phase</b> <b>corrections.</b> This article presents a general diagonalization method at order ħ for a large class of quantum Hamiltonians directly inducing Berry <b>phase</b> <b>corrections.</b> As a consequence, Berry phase terms on both coordinates and momentum operators naturally arise during the diagonalization procedure.

50|$|The {{prototype}} {{lattice filter}} shown here passes low frequencies without modification but phase shifts high frequencies. That is, it is <b>phase</b> <b>correction</b> {{for the high}} end of the band. At low frequencies the phase shift is 0° but as the frequency increases the phase shift approaches 180°. It can be seen qualitatively that this is so by replacing the inductors with open circuits and the capacitors with short circuits, which is what they become at high frequency. At high frequency the lattice filter is a cross-over network and will produce 180° phase shift. A 180° phase shift is the same as an inversion in the frequency domain, but is a delay in the time domain. At an angular frequency of ω = 1 rad/s the phase shift is exactly 90° and this is the midpoint of the filter's transfer function.|$|E
5000|$|Adobe Audition is able {{to remove}} the effect using the Graphic Panner tool (the Automatic <b>Phase</b> <b>Correction</b> tool is unable to {{accurately}} do this) by manually selecting the [...] "Phase -90 degrees" [...] preset. The [...] "Auto Center Phase" [...] and [...] "Learn Phase" [...] features will also work, but are not recommended. There are sometimes slight offsets caused by various mixing effects and, to a lesser extent, tape-head misalignment; studio reverb or naturally decaying reverb is a prime example. As a waveform decays in a large room, it naturally changes phase. In Auto Center phase, this is (generally) shown as the upper frequencies making a drastic change. Tape head misalignment (azimuth) also will cause a phase change in upper frequencies. One {{should be aware of}} this when attempting to remove Haeco processing and not use auto-phase options. Azimuth alignment adjustment tools can however be used AFTER Haeco has been removed.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the target}} is rotated through 'large' angles, the Doppler {{frequency}} history of a scatterer becomes non linear, following a sine-wave trajectory. This Doppler history can not be processed directly by a Fourier transform because of the smeared Doppler frequency history resulting {{in the loss of}} cross range resolution. The maximum rotation angle which can be processed by an unmodified Fourier transform is determined by the constraint that the aperture phase error across the synthesized aperture should vary by less than a specified (arbitrary) amount, for example 45 degrees. This occurs when the synthetic aperture to the target range is less than required by the [...] limit where [...] is the required lateral extent of the target. At this point the synthetic aperture is within the target nearfield region and requires focusing. The focusing is accomplished by applying a <b>phase</b> <b>correction</b> to the synthetic aperture.|$|E

50|$|Ultra high {{intensity}} lasers are now {{commonly used in}} several fields of physics research, including X-rays, wakefield acceleration, proton generation and ICF, with the common idea of intensely focusing a laser beam to energy densities that can reach 1022 W/cm2 on a target. To achieve such a goal, the laser beam typically passes through several amplification stages and is transported with larger and larger optical components. As a result, the beam is affected by thermal effects and optical aberrations which distort the wavefront and affect the focusing quality. This decreases light intensity on the target. Usually, both spectral and spatial phases are adaptively controlled {{in order to achieve}} the required focusing. Over the last 2 decades, adaptive optics for wavefront correction and beam shaping have been commonly used in laser facilities by means of a wavefront sensor that measures the spatial phase and a deformable mirror that corrects it. Adaptive Optics systems (AOs) are now a must have in ultra-{{high intensity}} facilities, {{with some of the most}} recent systems needing several AOs to function..

For example, a maximum OPD of 2 cm results in a separation of [...] This is the spectral resolution {{in the sense that}} the value at one point is independent of the values at adjacent points. Most instruments can be operated at different resolutions by choosing different OPD’s. Instruments for routine analyses typically have a best resolution of around , while spectrometers have been built with resolutions as high as , corresponding to a maximum OPD of 10 m. The point in the interferogram corresponding to zero path difference has to be identified, commonly by assuming it is where the maximum signal occurs. The centerburst is not always symmetrical in real world spectrometers so a <b>phase</b> <b>correction</b> may have to be calculated. The interferogram signal decays as the path difference increases, the rate of decay being inversely related to the width of features in the spectrum. If the OPD is not large enough to allow the interferogram signal to decay to a negligible level there will be unwanted oscillations or sidelobes associated with the features in the resulting spectrum. To reduce these sidelobes the interferogram is usually multiplied by a function that approaches zero at the maximum OPD. This so-called apodization reduces the amplitude of any sidelobes and also the noise level at the expense some reduction in resolution.|$|E
