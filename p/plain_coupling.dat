40|$|Inorganic scintillators {{are widely}} used in modern medical imaging {{modalities}} as converter for the X- and gamma-radiation {{that is used to}} obtain information about the interior of the body. Likewise, they are applied in high-energy physics to measure the energy of particles that are produced in particle physics experiments. Their use is motivated by the very good detection efficiency of these materials for hard radiation which allows the construction of relatively compact and finely pixelised systems with a high spatial resolution. One key problem {{in the development of the}} next generation of particle detectors and medical imaging systems is the optimisation of the energy resolution of the detectors. This parameter is influenced by the statistical fluctuations of the light output of the scintillators, i. e. by the number of photons that are detected when a particle deposits its energy in the scintillator. The light output of the scintillator depends not only on the absolute number of generated photons but also on the geometrical shape of the material, its transmission properties at the wavelength of scintillation, and its refractive index. Especially in tiny detector crystals with small aspect ratio, a significant fraction of photons is lost before conversion into an electronic signal in the photo detector. This effect increases the statistical fluctuations of the light output and therefore, deteriorates the energy resolution. The present work explores possible ways to overcome the problem of total internal reflection at the surface of the scintillator that couples to the photo detector, which is one of the principal reasons for signal losses in heavy inorganic scintillators with high refractive index. The emphasis is placed on the recently developed Ce doped scintillators LuYAP:Ce and LYSO:Ce which are used in the dedicated PET imaging systems ClearPEM and ClearPET developed by the Crystal Clear Collaboration. Starting point of the work are Monte-Carlo simulations of standard LuYAP and LYSO crystals used in ClearPEM and ClearPET with the light ray tracing program LITRANI. These simulations are used to assess the losses induced by total internal reflection and the potential in effective light yield gain. In order to calibrate the model, experiments in several reference setups are performed and the results compared with those from simulations of equivalent systems. This combination of experimental and simulated data is also used for a precise determination of the absolute light yield of the scintillators. The results of the simulations are then used to study the effect of non-planar coupling faces on the light extraction. Two approaches are considered: A macroscopic one, in which trapezoidal grooves with a depth of several hundred micrometer are used to break up total internal reflection at the coupling face; and a microscopic one that uses the unique op tical properties of photonic crystals to assess photons outside the extraction cone of a <b>plain</b> <b>coupling</b> face. The potential of the macroscopic approach is assessed by means of LITRANI simulations and validated by experiments with prototype samples designed on basis of the simulation results. The experimental results show that the gain in light yield is less than predicted from simulations of an idealized system. However, they are found to be well described by a model where the crystal layers immediately beneath the groove surfaces are described by a heavily absorbing and diffusing material. The microscopic approach is probed by means of simulations with a scattering-matrix algorithm. This algorithm is used to evaluate the impact of several structural parameters of the photonic crystal on the transmission properties of the exit surface. From these data, a model is developed which uses the results obtained with LITRANI to calculate the gain in light collection efficiency for a number of possible designs. Finally, possible fabrication techniques for photonic crystal structures on scintillators are briefly discussed. The thesis closes with a short summary of the results and a short outlook on possible future projects based on the presented approaches...|$|E

Aside from salinity intrusion from the sea, the province is strongly affected by acidic pollution as 58 % {{of the area}} (250, 000 ha) is overlaid with acid sulphate soil (ASS). Previous studies showed that the eminent sea level rise (SLR) would influence the hydrology and salinity of the canal networks in the province. This study, using the previously validated hydraulic and water quality model VRSAP-ACIDITY (Vietnam River Systems And <b>Plains,</b> <b>coupled</b> with ACIDITY Module), aimed at quantifying impacts of different SLR scenarios (SLR = 17, 30, 50, or 75 cm) on acidic pollution in the province. Under the present sea level, widespread acidic pollution (pH < 5) of surface water occurred {{at the start of}} the rainy season, due to leaching of acidity from canal embankments and fields in ASS. The acceleration of SLR reduced the area of acidic polluted water. The lessening in acidic pollution was attributed to (1) SLR that raised the water level in the Mekong River, increasing the amount of fresh water flowing into the study area; and (2) the amount of water drained out of the study area increased, bringing with its acidity. It concluded that SLR has a positive effect on acidic pollution in the ASS coastal area...|$|R

The Shahrekord Plain aquifer system is located in a semi-arid area and acts as a key source of water supply. Groundwater management in this area is thus very important. Although change in the climatological factors is not possible, long-term fluctuation studies can help in managing the available water resources to overcome from drought or decrease its negative impact. The hydrodynamic study of the aquifer system coupled with the drought indices in each region can be useful in making decisions related to the hydro-ecosystem management of that region. In this article, hydrodynamics of the aquifer system of the Shahrekord <b>Plain</b> <b>coupled</b> with the ratio of P/PET as a drought index, are assessed on the long term. In Shahrekord Plain aquifer, there is a short-term seasonal fluctuation, which is increased by overexploitation during the dry season, when water is needed for irrigation.

40|$|Current North American {{operational}} satellite passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval algorithms consistently underestimate SWE {{levels for}} tundra environments {{when compared to}} four years of regional snow surveys conducted in the Northwest Territories and northern Manitoba, Canada. Almost all contemporary SWE algorithms {{are based on the}} brightness temperature difference between the 37 GHz and 19 GHz frequencies found onboard both past and present spaceborne sensors. This underestimation is likely a result of the distribution and deposition of the tundra snow, coupled with the influence of tundra lakes on brightness temperatures at the 19 GHz frequency. To better our understanding concerning the underestimation of passive microwave SWE retrievals on the tundra, Environment Canada collected in situ measurements of SWE, snow depth, and density at 87 sites within a 25 km by 25 km study domain located near Churchill, Manitoba in March 2006. Coincident multi-scale passive microwave airborne (70 m & 500 m resolution) and spaceborne (regridded to 12. 5 km & 25 km resolution depending on frequency) data were measured at 6. 9 GHz, 19 GHz, 37 GHz and 89 GHz frequencies during the same time period. The snow survey data highlighted small-scale localized patterns of snow distribution and deposition on the tundra that likely influences current SWE underestimation. Snow from the open tundra plains is re-distributed by wind into small-scale vegetated features and micro-topographic depressions such as narrow creekbeds, lake edge willows, small stands of coniferous trees and polygonal wedge depressions. The very large amounts of snow deposited in these spatially-constrained features has little influence on the microwave emission measured by large-scale passive microwave spaceborne sensors and is therefore unaccounted for in current methods of satellite SWE estimation. The analysis of the passive microwave airborne data revealed that brightness temperatures at the 19 GHz were much lower over some tundra lakes, effectively lowering SWE at the satellite scale by reducing the 37 - 19 GHz brightness temperature difference used to estimate SWE. The unique emission properties of lakes in the wide open expanse of the tundra <b>plains,</b> <b>coupled</b> with an insensitivity to the large amounts of SWE deposited in small-scale features provides an explanation for current passive microwave underestimation of SWE in the tundra environment...|$|R

It reproduced excellently the soil moisture, evapotranspiration and crop production of summer maize and winter wheat, correctly estimating crop water use. So, the spatial distribution of crop water use was reasonably estimated at daily steps in the simulation area. In particular, NICE-AGR reproduced groundwater levels better than the use of statistical water use data. This indicates that NICE-AGR does not need detailed statistical data on water use, making it very powerful for evaluating and estimating the water dynamics of catchments with little statistical data on seasonal water use. Furthermore, the simulation reproduced the spatial distribution of groundwater level in 1987 and 1988 in the Hebei Plain, showing a major reduction of groundwater level due mainly to overpumping for irrigation.

40|$|The Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau harbor {{hundreds}} of mountain lakes along {{with thousands of}} glaciers and high-elevation snowfields. This {{is the source of}} water for the upper reaches of Asia's main river systems, providing the livelihood for millions of people in the subregion. Climate change is therefore critical for the Himalaya snow and glacier hydrology, the dependent ecosystems, and the people. Whereas temperature and precipitation are common indicators for climate change, snow and glacier dynamics are reliable precursors of a warming or cooling climate. This study uses a simple empirical climate model (ECM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to analyze water storage dynamics in the 5. 072 x 10 (6) km(2) Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau region. About 72 consecutive months (January 2003 through December 2008) of data are used in the study. The temperature and precipitation (snow plus rain) data are acquired from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah land surface model and are validated with ground truth data from 205 meteorological stations. Total water storage change derived from the GRACE gravity data is fitted with a simple sinusoidal least squares regression model. A favorable agreement exists between the GRACE and sinusoidal curve (R(2) = 0. 81 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 8. 73 mm), suggesting that random errors in GRACE data are small. However, the sinusoidal fit does not quantify systematic errors in GRACE data. Agreements between the GRACE- and ECM-estimated storage changes are also favorable at both monthly (R(2) = 0. 93, RMSE = 5. 46 mm) and seasonal (R(2) = 0. 83, RMSE = 7. 64 mm) cycles. The agreements (significant at p < 0. 01) indicate not only GRACE's ability to detect storage signal but also that of the ECM model to characterize storage change in the snow and glacier hydrology. There is clear seasonality in the storage anomaly, with the highest in summer and lowest in winter. The corresponding storage change is delayed by a quarter of the year. The GRACE and ECM model indicate an overall negative storage trend of 0. 36 +/- 0. 03 mm/month or 21. 91 +/- 1. 95 km(3) /yr for the study area (significant at p < 0. 1). Given that snow and glaciers are particularly sensitive to temperature change, the negative storage trend could be indicative of warming climate conditions in the region. Groundwater abstraction (mainly for irrigation) in the southern <b>plains,</b> <b>coupled</b> with dwindling snowfall in the northern massifs, is a critical storage loss factor in the region. Invariably, storage loss in the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau region could have negative implications for the hydrology, dependent ecosystems, and livelihoods of millions of people...|$|R

The objective of our study was to establish an understanding of how wheat yield and input use efficiency can be improved and how land leveling and crop establishment practices can be modified to be more efficient in water use through layering of precision-conservation crop management techniques. The “precision land leveling with raised bed” planting can be used to improve crop yield, water and nutrient use efficiency over the existing “traditional land leveling with flat” planting practices. We conducted a field experiment during 2002 - 2004 at Modipuram, India to quantify the benefits of alternate land leveling (precision land leveling) and crop establishment (furrow irrigated raised bed planting) techniques alone or in combination (layering precision-conservation) in terms of crop yield, water savings, and nutrient use efficiency of wheat production in IGP.

40|$|The tectonic and magmatic {{framework}} of southeast Oregon provides the conditions {{necessary for the}} existence of geothermal energy resources. However, few detailed studies of geothermal systems {{in this part of the}} Basin and Range have been conducted. Young bimodal magmatism and faulting associated with the High Lava <b>Plains</b> <b>coupled</b> with the encroachment of the Basin and Range tectonic province and potentially the Walker Lane have created the structural configuration, heat source, and secondary permeability necessary for geothermal systems in southeast Oregon. The relative contribution of these provinces to the overall tectonomagmatic framework is less well understood. In this study, the geothermal system near Paisley, Oregon has been characterized by a detailed regional heat flow study, geologic mapping, aqueous geochemical analysis, a gravity survey, and a X-ray diffraction analysis of secondary alteration minerals. Based on these analyses, the Paisley geothermal system shares many aspects similar to Basin and Range geothermal systems. Geologic mapping has revealed a sequence of rocks with ages spanning from the mid Eocene-Present as well as structures related to the Basin and Range Province. A structural transfer zone connects two en-echelon normal faults in Summer Lake Basin, which controls the upwelling of thermal waters. The fault controlling fluid flow in the Paisley geothermal system was imaged using a gravity survey. Thermal water in the Paisley geothermal system has been determined to be of meteoric source, and is interpreted to be of Pleistocene age based on stable isotopes having average values of - 119. 59 ‰ and - 14. 18 ‰ for δD and δ 18 O, respectively. Recharge to the thermal aquifer is driven dominantly by topographic flow, with residence times on the order of 1000 s of years. Aqueous geochemistry was used to determine that the Paisley geothermal system is not magmatic in origin, with low values of magmatic SO 4, As, B, and high values of HCO 3 and Na. Geothermometers were used to calculate reservoir temperatures between 95 °C – 166 °C. These results were independently checked by X-ray diffraction studies of alteration mineral assemblages in reservoir rocks from two production wells drilled by Surprise Valley Electrification, which revealed similar temperatures for the stability field of mineral assemblages present in the wells. Because it has been determined that the Paisley geothermal fluids are not influenced by recent magmatism, the role of bimodal magmatism associated with the High Lava Plains on geothermal systems in southeastern Oregon appears to be minimal. However, in areas where magmatism is younger than 2 million years, this may not be true. Like the geothermal systems of the western Great Basin, the location of geothermal systems in southeast Oregon is highly dependent on the regional structural architecture. Also similar to some geothermal systems of the Basin and Range, the source of water is not modern meteoric water, but is “fossil” water, which implies that production must be managed carefully to create a sustainable resource...|$|R

To this effect, two 30 year long simulations, spanning the 1981 – 2010 period, with and without land-atmosphere coupling, have been performed with CRCM 5, driven by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis at the boundaries. In the coupled simulation, the soil moisture interacts freely with the atmosphere at each time step, while in the uncoupled simulation, soil moisture is replaced with its climatological value computed from the coupled simulation, thus suppressing the soil moisture-atmosphere interactions. Analyses of the coupled and uncoupled simulations, for the summer period, show strong soil moisture-temperature coupling over the Great Plains, consistent with previous studies. The maxima of soil moisture-precipitation coupling is more spread out and covers the semiarid regions of the western U. S. and parts of the Great Plains. However, the strength of soil moisture-precipitation coupling is found to be generally weaker than that of soil moisture-temperature coupling. The study clearly indicates that land-atmosphere coupling increases the interannual variability of the seasonal mean daily maximum temperature in the Great <b>Plains.</b> Land-atmosphere <b>coupling</b> is found to significantly modulate selected temperature extremes such as the number of hot days, frequency, and maximum duration of hot spells over the Great Plains. Results also suggest additional hot spots, where soil moisture modulates extreme events. These hot spots are located in the southeast U. S. for the hot days/hot spells and in the semiarid regions of the western U. S. for extreme wet spells. This study thus demonstrates that climatologically wet/dry regions can become hot spots of land-atmosphere coupling when the soil moisture decreases/increases to an intermediate transitional level where evapotranspiration becomes moisture sensitive and large enough to affect the climate...|$|R

40|$|Lake Victoria is {{of immense}} {{economic}} and environmental importance in the eastern and central African region. The lake is the largest freshwater body in the tropics and its basin supports one of the densest and poorest rural populations in the world. About 21 million people rely primarily on subsistence agricultural and pastoral production for their livelihoods. But pervasive poverty has hindered sustainable use of the land resources and there has already been considerable land degradation. There {{is little doubt that}} sedimentation and nutrient run-off, urban and industrial point source pollution and biomass burning, have induced the rapid eutrophication of Lake Victoria over the last fifty years. Invasion of water hyacinth and loss of endemic biodiversity are interrelated and compound problems for the lake environment and the welfare of its people. This project set out to assess the extent and causes of processes that contribute to pollution of the lake and to localize interventions for more sustainable land management. In a one year start-up phase, emphasis was placed on prioritizing river basins and assessing the land degradation problems in relation to nutrient and sediment inputs to the lake. This document summarizes progress on the proposed activities and the principal findings achieved under the start-up phase. The detailed results supporting these findings are given as an annex. A regional assessment identified the Nyando River Basin as a major source of sediment and phosphorus flow into Lake Victoria, and so much of the initial work was concentrated on this river basin while methods were being refined. The study identified severe soil erosion and land degradation problems throughout the Nyando river basin. Accelerated run-off and sheet erosion over much of the iii catchment area has led to severe rill, gully and stream bank erosion in lower parts of the river basin. The principal causes of erosion include deforestation of headwaters and overuse of extensive areas of fragile lands on both hillslopes and <b>plains,</b> <b>coupled</b> with loss of watershed filtering functions through encroachment on wetlands and loss of riverine vegetation. Associated with soil erosion, there has been substantial depletion of soil quality over much of the basin. Communities in the river basin are aware and concerned about water shortages and local land degradation but there is a low level awareness of the off-site effects. The lower parts of the river basin and the lake are particularly vulnerable to the return of a large rainfall event, such as experienced in the early 1960 ’s, which would cause catastrophic damage. The report outlines possible broad areas of intervention. The major requirements are to: (1) rapidly reduce pressure on vegetation cover over large areas of fragile land, including headwaters, shallow soils on hillslopes, and fragile soils on plains and the Nyando escarpment, (2) restore the filtering function of wetlands and riverine buffer strips, and (3) increase productivity of agricultural land that has high potential, particularly by removal of soil phosphorus and other soil nutrient constraints, which will help reduce pressure on fragile lands. The current catchment extension approach of the Soil and Water Conservation Branch has received considerable penetration in terms of number of participating farmers, but the efforts are unlikely to have significant impact on sediment and nutrient transfers to the lake. The Branch has had most impact in high population density areas largely within cash cropping systems. In contrast, it is in the marginal areas with extensive agropastoral systems that erosion risk is high. These are mostly communally-used grazing lands and government trust land where population density is fairly low and there is little incentive for investment in soil conservation. Complimentary approaches based on integrated watershed management are needed that jointly consider agricultural areas, forest areas and trust land, with highly active community participation. The emphasis must be on large area management of fragile lands and buffer zones around riparian zones, wetlands, and headwater catchment areas. Given the high cost of rehabilitation of marginal areas, priority should be given to assessment of their natural regeneration potential, in conjunction with policy and institutional innovation for their improved management. The project has been a focal point for the development of some exciting new methods for the quantitative assessment of land management problems that are of international significance. New remote sensing and ground survey tools were developed for rapid assessment of land and soil degradation and for precise spatial management of soils and vegetation. For example, critical target levels of dry season herbaceous vegetation cover depending on soil type and slope can be mapped. Progress towards achieving targets for buffer zone vegetation management can also be monitored. These tools are ready for deployment in the Nyando and other river basins...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} results of climate {{simulation}} in East-European <b>Plain</b> (EEP) by <b>coupled</b> climate models (which {{take part in}} project PMIP II (Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project)) are tested for different climatic periods (pre-industrial, Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)). The main parameters for comparison were: temperature, precipitations, evaporation and the Volga runoff. As a result, the model CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Meteorologie, France) {{was chosen as the}} best for this territory for pre-industrial climate. Its results were used to calculate runoff of the Volga river during the LGM and modern climate. «Climatic» component of the Volga runoff was calculated as the difference between precipitation and evaporation in the watershed. The «climatic» part of the Volga runoff 21 kyr decreased by 30 % compared with the modern (according to model CNRM). The main reason for the low values of «climatic» runoff was a reduction of precipitation on the territory of Volga watershed. The decrease of evaporation could not compensate for the deficit of precipitation. However, according to paleoreconstructions and the results of PMIP II simulation, a significant change to the hydrological regime of the Volga River (21 kyr BP) could be due to the contribution of melt water (about 384 km³/year). This means that to «climatic» component of runoff (about 78 km³/year), one has to add volume of the melt water of the Scandinavian ice sheet, which within the territory of Volga watershed. The results were used to assess the level of the Caspian Sea during this period (changes in the Caspian sea level compared with modern was about 48 meters.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Public {{works in}} {{progress}} in the Campanian plain north of Somma- ^ Vesuvius recently encountered the remains 15 of a prehistoric settlement close {{to the town of}} Afragola. Rescue excavations brought to light a Bronze Age 16 village partially destroyed and buried by pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) of the Vesuvian Pomici di 17 Avellino eruption (3. ^ 8 14 C ka BP) and subsequently sealed by alluvial deposits. Volcanological and rock- 18 ^ magnetic investigations supplemented the excavations. 19 Careful comparison between volcanological and archaeological stratigraphies led {{to an understanding of the}} 20 timing of the damage the buildings suffered when they were struck by a series of PDCs. The first engulfed the 21 village, located some 15 km to the north of the inferred vent, and penetrated into the dwellings without 22 causing major damage. The buildings were able to withstand the weak dynamic pressure of the currents and 23 deviate their path, as shown by the magnetic fabric analyses. Some later collapsed under the load of the 24 deposits piled up by successive currents. Stepwise demagnetization of the thermal remanent magnetization 25 (TRM) carried by potsherds embedded in the deposits yields deposition temperatures in the order of 260 – 26 ^ 320 °C, fully consistent with those derived from pottery and lithic fragments from other distal and proximal 27 sites. The fairly uniform temperature of the deposits is here ascribed to the lack of pervasive air entrainment 28 into the currents. This, in turn, resulted from the lack of major topographical obstacles along the flat <b>plain.</b> 29 The <b>coupling</b> of structural damage and sedimentological analyses indicates that the currents were not 30 destructive in the Afragola area, but TRM data indicate they were still hot enough to cause death or severe 31 injury to humans and animals. The successful escape of the entire population is apparent from the lack of 32 human remains and from thousands of human footprints on the surface of the deposits left by the first PDCs. 33 People were thus able to walk barefoot across the already emplaced deposits and escape the subsequent 34 PDCs. The rapid cooling of the deposits was probably due to both their thinness and heat dissipation due to 35 condensation of water vapour released in the mixture by magma–water interactio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a combined analysis of geological and geophysical data collected both onshore and offshore along the northwestern Peru forearc area (3 ° 30 '­ 7 ° 30 'S), from {{the coastal plain}} to the trench axis. Onshore, geomorphic analysis places constraints on {{the relative importance of}} eustatic versus tectonic factors in preserving and modifying the uplifted coastal landforms along the coastal plain. Breaking-wave morphologic markers were dated using the in situ produced 10 Be cosmonuclide. The data document a tectonic segmentation, allowing us to differentiate two areas with regard to their evolution through time: the northern Cabo Blanco and the southern Paita-Illesca segments. For the past 200 kyr, both segments uplifted at high rates of 10 to 20 mm yr- 1 through tectonic pulses coeval with the eustatic deglacial sea level rises of isotope stage 1 and warm isotope substage 5 e, respectively. The uplift and related extensive emersion of the coastal <b>plain</b> require high <b>coupling</b> along the subduction zone and/or underplating at depth. Offshore, industry-acquired reflection seismic lines combined with EM 12 bathymetric data allow us to investigate the tectonic regime and deformation of the continental margin and shelf. Major dipping seaward detachments control the long-term subsidence of this area. These main tectonic features define a tectonic segmentation. The Talara, Paita, and Sechura segments are identified from north to south. No clear tectonic correlation in time exists between the onshore and the continental margin segmentations, or in space either. The long-term subsidence of the offshore, indicative of subduction erosion working at depth, requires low coupling along the subduction channel at depth. The distribution of permanent deformation along the northern Peru forearc area includes long-term uplift along the coastal plain and long-term subsidence along the continental margin, the neutral line being located within the 10 km seaward from the Present coastline. An extensive sequence of raised marine cliffs and associated notches evidences that the most recent uplift step (20 ­ 23 ka to Present) along the Cabo Blanco segment is related to a sequence of major earthquakes. We infer that eustacy exerts important feedback coupling to the seismogenic behavior of the North Peru subduction zone. We speculate that during sea level fall, pore fluid pressure diminishes along the subduction channel inducing a possible seaward migration of the locked zone (i. e., migration of the updip limit) reaching a maximum {{by the end of the}} eustatic low stand. During eustatic sea level rise, pore fluid pressure increases along the subduction channel. This in turn is capable of weakening the previously locked zone along the plate interface beginning an earthquake sequence. Earth's orbital variations are a potential external cause that may control the physical processes at work along plate interface...|$|R
40|$|The phreatic {{basin of}} Ljubljansko polje (polje = plain, field) recharges its water supply {{mainly from the}} Sava river-bed and at a few other {{locations}} where connections with karstic subterranean waters might exist and only up to 15 % from precipitation. An important zone of infiltration in the river-bed is the bottom and not the bank which is {{to a large extent}} watertight due to organic debris (rests of Sphaerotilus e. g.). The main water-body moves about 10 m/day, there are however some local jets with far higher speeds. Yearly amplitudes of water temperatures are high near the river but in the centre of the <b>plain</b> only a <b>couple</b> of centigrades. Oxygen saturation is in the open river-water 100 %, dropping to 40 - 60 % just 1 m into the phreatic. True stygopsammal animals are represented here only by a few species and specimen in spite of the fact, that the interstices in the gravel are mostly filled with finer sediments. Remarkable is also the scarcity of Nematodes and the near absence of Acarina (compare with Danielopol 1976). Only a few specimen of the river benthos (Chironomidae, Tipulidae, Leuctra supp., Baetìs spp.) penetrate the interstitial water (compare with Ruffo 1961, Danielopol 1976) and only Naididae are more frequent there. However, many epigean animals occur in interstitial waters in the periodically flooded gravel-banks; one can explain this with oscillations of the water level. Some epigean animals (creno- and troglophilic) are quite regularly represented in the phreatic near the river, but have not been found in the river-bed. The distribution of phreatic species within the studied water-body seems to be controlled mainly by the presence of food supplies and the consequent competition among species. The same is true for the speed of the water current and some other factors which are less easily defined. The characteristics of the substratum as well as O 2 -saturation and other characteristics of the water seem to have little influence on the fauna. The energetically (food-) rich neighbourhood of the river is inhabited by a number of species in quite dense populations while the central parts of the phreatic water body exhibit a great poverty of species and of specimen. However, some species live here, which don’t occur in the presence of larger food supplies — and of greater competition (Niphargus serbicus). The higher current speed seems to prevent settlement of some species (Cyclopoida, Proasellus deminutus) while some are bound to such habitats (Proasellus vulgaris). Some species exhibit a high degree of euryvalency inside the stygopsephale habitats (Niphargus longidactylus e. g.), while some are highly specialized. Some of them form dense populations (comparatively dense even in energetically poor places) while others exhibit even in most favourable conditions very low densities (Niphargus jovanovici multipennatus). The present fauna is zoogeographically very diverse. Some species are distributed throughout Europe; some reach from Central Europe to the borders of Dinaride Karst (Bogidiella albertimagni) and some even penetrate it (Trichodrilus pragensis, Acanthocyclops kiefer). Bogidiella semidenticulata, Niphargus pectinicauda, Hadziella deminuta seem to be limited to the higher reaches of the Sava River. All of the above mentioned animals live regularly in interstitial waters and only sporadically in karstic hypogean waters. Niphargus stygius is here the only animal of a certainly karstic provenience; inside the plain it is limited to a completely special habitat. It is very likely that the entire Proasellus-deminutus group has developed in interstitial waters of larger plains which are in contact with karstic areas; some species penetrated from the plains into the karst rather than the reverse. To the contrary (judging from the distribution of the genera) karstic waters seem to be the cradle of Hauffenia and Hadziella. Such a sharp delimitation between cave- and interstitial fauna resp. in this area is very noteworthy. Both faunas live here in abundance and in close contact. It is very probable that particularly high competition and specialization of both faunas, caused by their richness and diversity, prevent mixing of species...|$|R
