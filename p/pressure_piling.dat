40|$|This paper {{presents}} the CFD simulation {{study on the}} effect of volume ratio on <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> The explosion of flammable mixtures in interconnected compartments is commonly defined as “pressure piling” and its occurrence is a relevant issue of industrial safety. <b>Pressure</b> <b>piling</b> is a situation where peak pressures much higher than the expected values predicted by thermodynamic are generated in the geometry. The geometric characteristics of the vessels such as the tube area and ratio of volumes of the interconnected vessels play important role in the intensity of the <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> Moreover, pre-compression and violence of explosion are the two main mechanisms affecting <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> A CFD-Ansys and RANS model were used in this paper. The models duplicated experimental explosion behaviours and the results were compared with experimental. Propane-air mixture was used to study <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> In the end it was found that pre-compression and violence of explosion are the two main mechanisms affecting <b>pressure</b> <b>piling,</b> which in turns affect the ratio between reaction and venting time in the second vessel (Brt). Higher the Brt number in the second vessel, lower the occurrence of <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> Lower the volume ratio, higher the violence of explosion. Increasing the volume ratio results in a more intense pre-compression (pressure in the secondary vessel at ignition time increases) thus suggesting that ignition in the second vessel occurs starting from a higher value of pressure.

40|$|Literature {{results show}} that the <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> {{phenomenon}} {{is the result of the}} combination of: (1) the precompression effect arising from the jet flow from the ignition vessel); (2) the turbulence induced by the fast flame propagation (jet ignition) in the secondary vessel; and (3) the vent flowing toward the ignition vessel, which mitigates the peak pressure. To control the severity of the explosion in the second vessel it is possible to either limit precompression or to reduce the characteristic ratio between the "reaction" and "venting" times. A mathematical model of the <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> phenomenon is proposed herein to study the possibility of reducing the peak pressure in the second vessel by limiting the turbulence level induced and thus increasing the reaction time with respect to the venting time. More precisely, the effect of geometry obtained by using divergent connection tubes from the ignition vessel to the second vessel and by varying the volume ratio between the two vessels has been evaluated, demonstrating that small modifications in the design will prevent the catastrophic behavior of <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—At certain depths during large {{diameter}} {{displacement pile}} driving, rebound well over 0. 25 inches was experienced, {{followed by a}} small permanent-set during each hammer blow. High pile rebound (HPR) soils may stop the pile driving and results in a limited pile capacity. In some cases, rebound leads to pile damage, delaying the construction project, and the requiring foundations redesign. HPR was evaluated at seven Florida sites, during driving of square precast, prestressed concrete piles driven into saturated, fine silty to clayey sands and sandy clays. Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) deflection versus time data recorded during installation, was used to develop correlations between cone penetrometer (CPT) pore-water <b>pressures,</b> <b>pile</b> displacements and rebound. At five sites where piles experienced excessive HPR with minimal set, the pore pressure yielded very high positive values of greater than 20 tsf. However, at {{the site where the}} pile rebounded, followed by an acceptable permanent-set, the measured pore pressure ranged between 5 and 20 tsf. The pore pressure exhibited values of less than 5 tsf at the site where no rebound was noticed. In summary, direct correlations between CPTu pore pressure and rebound were produced, allowing identification of soils that produce HPR.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the {{documentation}} {{of a study}} of gas explosions in closed, interconnected vessels. Explosions within such vessels is strongly affected by {{the characteristics of the}} geometry, and can, under given conditions, result in very high local peak pressure and rates of pressure rise. In these situations peak pressure andrate of pressure rise can be several factors higher than incomparable single vessel explosions. The term <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> or pre-compression is used to describes explosions that show such characteristics pressure development The focus for the present work has been to investigate the effect of fuel properties on <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> situations. Altogether more than 500 tests have been conducted with variation in some of the key parameters such as volume ratio between chambers, size and shape of transfer connection, location of ignition point and fuel mixtures. In each test, pressure has been measured and pressure time history recorded. For range of geometries used in this study, the level of <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> is consistently lower for hydrogen than for methane. The higher burning velocity of hydrogen is the main cause for this effect. Fast combustion in primary chamber means that the flame uses little time to propagate into the secondary chamber. Consequently {{only a small portion of}} gas is able to flow into the secondary chamber and the level of pre-compression is moderate. Subsequent combustion does not result in very high pressure. For this reason lean and rich mixture, which have lower burning velocities, are slightly more prone to <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> The range of burnable concentrations of hydrogen is very wide (5 - 75 %) and the characteristics of these mixtures change significantly with fuel content. Lean mixtures have a low ratio of laminar to turbulent burning velocity whereas rich mixtures typically will flow more easily. Both these factors have been shown to affect hydrogen’s tendency for <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> However, these effects are very geometry dependent and have moderate impact on the general pressure level. Tests of methane air mixtures with various equivalence ratios show that peak pressure is moderately affected by this parameter. In <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> situations, peak pressure will typically be just as high for rich and lean mixture as for stoichiometric equivalent mixtures. For slowburning mixtures (rich and lean) more gas will have time to flow into the secondary chamber and thereby compensate for the lower energy content in the gas. In the last phase of this work, the CFD-code FLACS has been used to simulate the experiments and the general trends seen in experiments are also seen in simulations. However FLACS tend to under predict peak pressure due to over prediction of laminar burning velocity in primary chamber. This effect is expected to be less important in larger-scale situations...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of explosion of flammable hydrocarbon-air mixtures {{in two or}} more interconnected compartments is commonly defined as "pressure piling" and it {{is characterized by a}} pressure peak higher than the thermodynamic value.

40|$|An {{explosion}} of flammable mixtures in interconnected compartments is commonly defined as <b>pressure</b> <b>piling.</b> Piling pressure is phenomenon when the peak pressure observed {{is higher than}} the predictable thermodynamic values. The two main mechanisms affecting <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> are pre-compression and violence of explosion. Therefore, this paper is aim study on the effect of ignition location on <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation. Different points of ignition were studied using this simulation which are central and end point in the interconnected vessel (primary vessel). Besides that the role played by pre-compression and violence of explosion were also studied. In this studied, CFD codes were used as this simulation able to reproduce the explosion phenomenon (propane air) strongly depends on the sub-models used for turbulence and combustion. The proportion of the propane air used was 50 - 50. The model of the interconnected vessel were construct in the Gambit with the height and width of the primary vessel are 0. 75 cm and 0. 305. Meanwhile the height and width of the secondary vessel are 0. 15 cm and 0. 26 cm. Later on, the model was imported to the Fluent to reproduce the explosion. From my research, the peak pressure for ignition location at the end in the primary vessel gives the highest value than the peak pressure of central ignition location. This is due to the end ignition location; the flame has much more time to develop turbulence before it enters the secondary vessel. This method is the best to study about an explosion in interconnected vessel because of low cost involve rather than sacrifice a plant which is something irrational to be done. From this study we can clearly see that the end ignition location produced higher peak pressure than the central ignition location due {{to the development of the}} turbulence intensit...|$|E

40|$|The {{explosion}} of flammable mixtures in interconnected compartments is commonly defined as "pressure piling". Peak pressures {{much higher than}} the predictable thermodynamic values are likely to be generated in this geometry, yielding the phenomenon of major interest in industrial safety. In this paper, a CFD model was implemented, aiming at understanding the major factors affecting <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> in two cylindrical interconnected vessels, by varying the volume ratio between the two interconnected vessels and the ignition position. A combustion model was specifically developed to follow the flame propagation in any combustion regimes {{as a function of the}} local conditions: laminar, flamelet and distributed reaction zone. The model was validated by comparison with experimental results. The agreement between the experiments and the simulations has allowed the interpretation of the <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> phenomenon and the understanding of the mechanisms involved. More precisely, the results have showed that the pressure peak intensity is mainly affected by the coupling between the pre-compression of the mixture in the secondary vessel and the violence of explosion in the same vessel as related to the venting time, the latest quantified by the turbulent Bradley number, Br(t) i. e. by the reaction time to the venting time ratio.

The primary purpose {{of this research is}} to improve safety in mining, but the data are also useful to other industries that manufacture, process, or use combustible dusts. Explosion characteristics such as the minimum explosible concentration and the rock dust inerting requirements were measured for various combustible dusts from the mining industries. These dusts included bituminous coats, gilsonite, oil shales, and sulfide ores. The full-scale tests were conducted in the Lake Lynn experimental mine of NIOSH. The mine tests were initiated by a methane-air explosion at the face (closed end) that both entrained and ignited the dust. The laboratory-scale tests were conducted in the 20 -L chamber using ignitors of various energies. One purpose of the laboratory and mine comparison is to determine the conditions under which the laboratory tests best simulate the full-scale tests. The results of this research showed relatively good agreement between the laboratory and the large-scale tests in determining explosion limits.

40|$|This paper applies a {{simplified}} conservative approach for analyzing elastic-plastic response of piping due to reflected gaseous detonations and deflagration-to-detonation transitions (DDT). A consequence associated with gaseous explosions {{is the potential}} for DDT to occur near the end of a closed pipe or gas pocket. As an accelerating deflagration flame approaches a closed end, the unburned fuel ahead of the flame front is compressed to an elevated initial pressure. This process {{is often referred to as}} <b>pressure</b> <b>piling</b> or pre-compression, and the combination of detonation reflection with the elevated initial pressure can produce extremely high peak pressures and large values of impulse. In this paper, the event where DDT occurs immediately ahead of the reflecting surface is referred to as a reflected-DDT (R-DDT). Due to the extreme pressures that R-DDTs can achieve, the piping can frequently experience elastic-plastic deformation. In this second part, the pressure time-history modeling methodology developed for elastic response in part one is extended to elastic-plastic analysis. The inelastic response of the piping material is modeled using a lower-bound strain hardening curve at a single representative strain rate. The pressure model is compared to a published reflected detonation pressure model for the stoichiometric mixture of ethylene and oxygen, and finite-element analysis results using the simplified methodology are compared to two recent sets of published plastic deformation data from ethylene oxygen explosion tests in austenitic stainless steel tubing and piping.

In addition to gas mixture and initial conditions, the peak pressure and shape of the pressure time-history associated with a reflected detonation or DDT is a function of the detonation propagation distance prior to reflection and the relative distance between the ignition location, the DDT location, and the reflecting surface. An empirical pressure time-history has been developed using pressure data from approximately 190 explosion tests using hydrogen and nitrous oxide mixtures in 2 -inch and 4 -inch pipe to describe events ranging from fully-developed reflected detonations to R-DDTs. The empirical model of the pressure time-history was validated by comparing measured elastic hoop strains to finite-element model predictions using the pressure time-history model.

This condition is not anticipated during the east span SFOBB new east span construction. The reduction in sound pressures provided by the bubble curtain system ranged considerably. The direct reduction in sound pressures, which is evaluated by comparing bubble curtain ON and OFF measurements, for Piles 1 and 2 was 6 to 17 dB for peak pressures and 3 to 10 dB for RMS sound <b>pressure</b> levels. <b>Piles</b> 1 and 2 were located next to each other. Reductions at Pile 3, which was in shallower water, were over 20 dB for both peak pressures and RMS sound pressure levels on the north side.

In this case, the horizontal <b>pressure</b> of the <b>pile</b> reactive force {{in the area of}} the pile connection with the raft is transferred to the raft. Pile failure at the hole boundaries will lead to the increase of the raft bearing distance above the karst hole. The inadequate raft bearing capacity can provoke the emergency situation.

The goal of this work is to develop the method of pile strip foundations analysis {{in the areas}} with karst risk in case of karst hole formation. The analysis of stress-strain state of the system “foundation soil — pile foundation” was carried out using numerical modeling in geotechnical program MIDAS GTS. As a result of numerical investigations, the diagrams of lateral soil <b>pressure</b> onto the <b>piles</b> and the raft are plotted. The <b>pile</b> <b>pressure</b> is approximated with the linear or bilinear function in dependence on geometrical dimensions of the karst hole and strength characteristics of soil that generates the horizontal pressure. In the Codes, the analysis of a pile under lateral soil pressure is given for a pile with the free end.

The {{strength of the}} soil and its stiffness decrease due {{to the increase in}} pore water <b>pressure.</b> The observed <b>pile</b> damage during earthquakes has provided an insight into the mechanism of soil-pile interaction in liquefying soils. The piles in liquefied soil may undergo large lateral displacements and my fail due to bending or buckling. The paper discusses the observed performance of piles in liquefying soils and the suggested methods for their design...|$|R
50|$|These disks {{are then}} {{put on a}} {{hydraulic}} piston, forming a <b>pile.</b> <b>Pressure</b> is applied on the disks, thus compacting the solid phase of the olive paste and percolating the liquid phases (oil and vegetation water). The applied hydraulic pressure can go to 400 atm. To facilitate separation of the liquid phases, water is run {{down the sides of}} the disks to increase the speed of percolation. The liquids are then separated either by a standard process of decantation or by means of a faster vertical centrifuge.|$|R
