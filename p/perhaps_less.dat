5|$|The Delichon martins have simple flight {{calls of}} one to three notes. In the two more {{widespread}} species these have a distinctive buzzing quality. The male's song is a short simple ripple, <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> musical than that given by other swallows.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than a week or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the local}} beliefs were <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> welcome to the {{practitioners}} of organised religion. An each-uisge was thought {{to live in a}} bottomless well near the summit of Macphee’s Hill, and faery sidhes and their associated music were taken for granted, if generally avoided. The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient for the treatment of diseases as serious as tuberculosis. Yet the old ways themselves were dying.|$|E

5|$|The present-day cone of Mount Baker is {{relatively}} young; it is <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> than 100,000years old. The volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called Black Buttes, which was active between 500,000 and 300,000years ago. Much of Mount Baker's earlier geological record eroded away {{during the last}} ice age (which culminated 15,000–20,000years ago), by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and surrounded the volcano. In the last 14,000years, the area around the mountain has been largely ice-free, but the mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time taken for the {{extinction}} to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over {{a relatively short period}} (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor–Lipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K-Pg clay from three sites suggest short duration of event, <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> than ten thousand years.|$|E

5|$|Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>less</b> {{productive}} was {{his work}} on physical anthropology, a topic which fascinated the Victorians. Huxley classified the human races into nine categories, and discussed them under four headings as: Australoid, Negroid, Xanthocroic and Mongoloid types. Such classifications depended mainly on appearance and anatomical characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The {{achievements}} of the Eighth Army in this last campaign are <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> well remembered than those during the Western Desert Campaign under Montgomery. This is because they were overshadowed by the contemporaneous campaign in Northern France following the Normandy landings in June 1944 which were {{the main focus of}} public attention at the time, and has similarly attracted more attention from subsequent historians.|$|E
25|$|Until 1969, the United Church of Canada was {{involved}} with and supported the Canadian Indian residential school system, {{which resulted in a}} painful legacy for many Aboriginal people and their communities. While the United Church's level of involvement was <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> egregious than its sister churches the Anglican Church of Canada and assorted Catholic orders, its contribution was significant. Of approximately 80,000 students alive today, about 10 percent attended United Church run schools.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to nationalize the foreign oil firm was immensely popular in Peru. It {{was seen as}} a legitimate response to many years of close collaboration between the company, which performed political favors, and a series of possibly selfinterested Peruvian presidents, who, in exchange, preserved the company's exclusive drilling rights. Nationalization was <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> a matter of an economic program than a reaction to a public grievance, a reaction bound to increase public support for the new government.|$|E
25|$|But {{discrimination}} was <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> overt than {{such events}} suggest. It {{could be argued}} that some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular books such as H. Glynn-Ward’s 1921 The Writing on the Wall and Tom MacInnes’s 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such as L. D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated a glut of editorials analyzing and warning about the “Oriental Menace,” as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.|$|E
25|$|While the Sandinistas {{encouraged}} grassroots pluralism, {{they were}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> enthusiastic about national elections. They argued that popular support was {{expressed in the}} insurrection and that further appeals to popular support {{would be a waste}} of scarce resources. International pressure and domestic opposition eventually pressed the government toward a national election. Tomás Borge warned that the elections were a concession, an act of generosity and of political necessity. On the other hand, the Sandinistas had little to fear from the election given the advantages of incumbency and the restrictions on the opposition, and they hoped to discredit the armed efforts to overthrow them.|$|E

25|$|In Rome {{however the}} mood was calmed by the Pope Constantine the Syrian. Relations between the Pope and the Emperor had greatly improved— with the Emperor kissing the Pope's feet and sending an {{impressive}} delegation before him to meet the Pope (consisting of the Patriarch of Constantinople and Justinian's son and co-emperor). Arriving at Constantinople in 711 he came to an accord with Justinian finally approving half of the 102 canons still outstanding from the Quinisext Council (dealing with the trivial matters he addressed before his exile) and agreeing to drop the other, <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> important canons. Satisfied he allowed the Pope a safe journey to Rome.|$|E
25|$|In the {{political}} life of Spain, the king {{would already be}} familiar with the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a General Election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party manifesto facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of coalitions, {{the political}} leaders would customarily have met beforehand to hammer out a coalition agreements before their meeting with the king. Once appointed, the President of the Government forms an administration whose ministers are appointed and removed by the king on the president's advice. No minister may take up his appointment until after they give their oath of office to obey the constitution with loyalty to the king.|$|E
25|$|The {{unit has}} been {{responsible}} for all search and rescue work from Bhamo, in Burma, north as far as allied planes regularly fly. Roughly, its jurisdiction extended from Tezpur, India to Yunnanyi, China. Before organized search and rescue, crews had been lost for weeks, sometimes months. Stretches up to 90 days were not unknown in a country where jungle thickets and dizzy mountain trails made each hour a nightmare to the lost crews fighting their way out. But today, ICD's unique outfit probably would have made the story a trifle less stark. Aerial supply drops of maps and pertinent homing information would have made the walk-out <b>perhaps</b> <b>less</b> circuitous, while certainly the hardships would have been alleviated by air-dropped medical supplies, food and clothing. S & R members have parachuted to lost aircrews to furnish medical aid and walkout assistance. As {{a direct result of the}} unit's work, the percentage of saved personnel steadily mounted and with it the confidence and assurance of ICD flight crews.|$|E
