When a sound basic immunity is established, e. g. with two doses of 135 Lf, sheep are protected to the same extent by a large (135 Lf) or small (25 Lf) booster dose given one year after the primary injection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> are at {{increased}} risk for adverse health outcomes in comparison to patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Therefore, patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> may have greater use of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders than patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> in the setting of an acute illness. We examined the association between advanced <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and use of DNR orders in patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to all greater Worcester, MA, hospitals as part of an epidemiological study. METHODS: Use of DNR orders in 4, 033 Worcester residents hospitalized with AMI at 11 greater Worcester medical centers during 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003 was examined. Advanced <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> was defined on the basis of serum creatinine level at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and AMI had a DNR order in their medical records compared with 21 % of patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> After controlling for a variety of potentially confounding factors, patients with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> {{were more likely to have}} a DNR order than patients without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 55; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 21 to 1. 98).

Anemia is common among those with diabetes and chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and greatly contributes to patient outcomes. Observational studies indicate that low hemoglobin levels in such patients may increase risk for progression of <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Objective: 1. Estimation of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and hemoglobin level in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. 2. To determine the prevalence of anaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Methodology : This is a descriptive analytical cross-sectional study carried out in Dhiraj Hospital, Piparia, Vadodara. A total no of 100 consecutive patients were enrolled; 25 patients having Diabetes, 25 patients having diabetes and chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease,</b> 25 patients having only chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> but no diabetes and 25 patients neither having diabetes nor chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> taken as a control group.

Accordingly, the impact of <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> on the benefit of BNP testing needs to be scrutinized. MethodsThis study evaluated patients with and without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) presenting with acute dyspnea. A total of 452 consecutive patients (240 with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and 212 without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease)</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} a diagnostic strategy with (BNP group) or without (control group) the use of BNP levels provided by a rapid bedside assay.

40|$|Chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> is {{considered}} an inflammatory state and a high fiber intake is associated with decreased inflammation in the general population. Here, we determined whether fiber intake is associated with decreased inflammation and mortality in chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease,</b> and whether <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> modifies the associations of fiber intake with inflammation and mortality. To do this, we analyzed data from 14, 543 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. The prevalence of chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2) was 5. 8 %. For each 10 -g/day increase in total fiber intake, the odds of elevated serum C-reactive protein levels were decreased by 11 % and 38 % in those without and with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease,</b> respectively. Dietary total fiber intake was not significantly associated with mortality in those without but was inversely related to mortality in those with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> The relationship of total fiber with inflammation and mortality differed significantly in those with and without <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Thus, high dietary total fiber intake is associated with lower risk of inflammation and mortality in <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> and these associations are stronger in magnitude in those with <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Interventional trials are needed to establish the effects of fiber intake on inflammation and mortality in <b>kidney</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
