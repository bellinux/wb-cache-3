40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} physical activity (PA) level of the Turkish males who lived in BUrsa. A total of 365 subjects between 18 - 69 age participated to this study. To determine physical activity levels, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was applied. PA levels of subjects were categorized as inactive, minimum active and HEPA active by using MET method. The relations of parameters, such as their age, BMI, education, marital status, number of children, smoking and alcohol use were determined with PA level. The results were analyzed by using Chi - Square test. The participants have 1725 METmin/week average physical activity level, and 47. 7 % of them were physically inactive, 30. 4 % were <b>physically</b> minimum <b>active</b> and 21. 9 % were <b>physically</b> hepa <b>active.</b> As a result, it can be said that the physical activity levels of Turkish males who lived in Bursa are not sufficient and the inactive people are very common...|$|R
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in <b>physically</b> <b>active</b> adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E

25|$|Stretching {{prior to}} strenuous {{physical}} activity has been thought to increase muscular performance by extending {{the soft tissue}} past its attainable length {{in order to increase}} range of motion.

When stretching, muscles should feel somewhat uncomfortable but not physically agonizing.|$|E
40|$|Background. This {{randomised}} controlled trial {{demonstrates the}} effectiveness of a value-based intervention program to encourage a <b>physically</b> more <b>active</b> lifestyle among <b>physically</b> inactive adults aged 30 to 50 years. The conceptual framework of the program is based on an innovative behavioural therapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) that aims to increase an individual’s psychological flexibility and support behaviour change towards a higher quality and more meaningful life. Methods. Participants will be randomly allocated to a feedback group (FB) or an Acceptance and Commitment based (ACT[*]+[*]FB) group. Both the groups will receive written feedback about their objectively measured physical activity levels and offered an opportunity to attend a body composition analysis. In addition, the Acceptance and Commitment based group will attend six group sessions and be given a pedometer for self-monitoring of their daily physical activity throughout the 9 -week intervention. The group sessions aim to clarify individual values and enhance committed actions towards the goal of achieving a more meaningful life. Participants will also be taught new skills to work on subjective barriers related to physical activity. Physical activity will be measured objectively by an accelerometer over seven consecutive days and by self-reported questionnaires at the baseline, as well as at 3, 6, 9 and 15 months after the baseline measures. In addition, psychological well-being will be measured through the questionnaires, which assess mindfulness skills, psychological flexibility, psychological distress and depressive symptoms. Discussion. This study’s objective is to demonstrate a research protocol for a randomized controlled study motivating a <b>physically</b> more <b>active</b> lifestyle based on one’s own values among physically inactive adults. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and intervention efficacy on physical activity and psychological well-being, and discuss challenges in motivating physically inactive adults towards <b>physically</b> more <b>active</b> lifestyles...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{research}} in my bachelor's thesis were physical activities of preschool children and their parents. We focused on the terms of different authors to describe physical activities of preschool children. We were interested whether the term physical/sports activity is appropriate to describe activities which include different recreation in preschool period. Our aim was {{to find out if}} there is any connection between activities of children and those of their parents as well as the influence over the choice of physical activities. In April and May 2015 we gave out questionnaires to 149 parents of preschool children. Their answers served as data for our analysis, which was then made by the SPSS statistics programme. On the basis of the gained data, we did not find any connection between physical activities of preschool children and those of their parents, which means that <b>physically</b> more <b>active</b> parents do not necessarily have <b>physically</b> more <b>active</b> children. But there is a statistical connection in physical activities of parents between their secondary school years and now – parents, who were more active in the time of secondary school are still very active today. One of our findings is also that the parents' attitude towards activities has greater influence than childrens' physical activity when choosing from various possible activities of preschool children. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study was undertaken {{to assess the}} nutritional status, dietary practices and physical activities of school going adolescents {{in public and private}} schools (PPSs) of Karachi, Pakistan. A sample of 101 boys and 100 girls from PPSs was randomly selected for their weight,height, waist and hip circumferences, percent body fat and lean body mass measurements. Adolescent boys and girls were interviewed for their dietary practices, socio-economic status, frequency and type of physical activities and their responses were recorded. Results by gender and school type revealed that both the boys and girls of private schools had a significantly lower mean age but significantly higher mean height-for-age Z-score, waist and hip circumferences than the public school adolescents. Food frequency results revealed that the frequency and patterns of breakfast, break-time snack, lunch and dinner of private school going adolescents were more diverse and nutritiously rich. Skipping breakfast was more common among adolescents being higher in girls than boys. Parents of adolescents belonging to private schools had a higher education and socio-economic status. Private school adolescents were <b>physically</b> more <b>active</b> (p< 0. 05) in terms of frequency and type of physical activities. The study concludes that the adolescents of private schools had a better nutritional status, consumed food and beverages of better quality and were <b>physically</b> more <b>active.</b> However, boys and girls of both the public and private schools failed to meet the national and international dietary guidelines of recommended food servings...|$|R

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Manchester Institute of Sport and Physical Activity (MISPA) at the Manchester Metropolitan University and the Youth Sports Trust, Wright Robinson has taken part in a ten-year research project. The project was designed to support the school's strategic aim of raising academic standards and increasing whole school participation in Physical Education and Sport. In ten years over 10,000 children and 1,000,000 hours of PE have been assessed. The evidence shows that participation in physical activity enables young people to significantly improve their physical competence, confidence and self-esteem.

25|$|The major {{landmark}} {{of puberty}} for males is spermarche, the first ejaculation, which occurs, on average, at age 13. For females, it is menarche, {{the onset of}} menstruation, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13. The age of menarche is influenced by heredity, but a girl's diet and lifestyle contribute as well. Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion of body fat to attain menarche. Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not <b>physically</b> <b>active</b> begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics). Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages.|$|E
25|$|Transdermal patches (adhesive patches {{placed on}} the skin) may {{also be used to}} deliver a steady dose through the skin and into the bloodstream. Testosterone-containing creams and gels that are applied daily to the skin are also available, but {{absorption}} is inefficient (roughly 10%, varying between individuals) and these treatments tend to be more expensive. Individuals who are especially <b>physically</b> <b>active</b> and/or bathe often may not be good candidates, since the medication can be washed off and may take up to six hours to be fully absorbed. There is also the risk that an intimate partner or child may come in contact with the application site and inadvertently dose himself or herself; children and women are highly sensitive to testosterone and can suffer unintended masculinization and health effects, even from small doses. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes.|$|E
