50|$|Greene’s {{best known}} work <b>Pursuits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> (1988) {{constructed}} a vastly influential new synthesis of colonial British American history and proposed {{a framework for}} a developmental narrative of early American history. Employing a broad regional framework and using the concept of social development as its principal analytic device, <b>Pursuits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> focused on the creation and subsequent histories of colonial regions {{as defined by the}} socioeconomic structures and cultural constructs devised and amended by settlers and their descendants to enable them to exploit the economic potentials of their new environments and to express the larger purposes of the societies they were creating. These processes, Greene argues, could not be traced exclusively to either the transfer of civilization from Britain to the Americas or the Americanizing effects of New World conditions. Rather, they were the products of a complex, regionally differentiated interaction between metropolitan inheritance and colonial experience. As a framework for understanding how these social processes worked, <b>Pursuits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> proposed a developmental model that understands the British North American colonial experience as a process of adaptation, institution building, and expansion of human, economic, social, and cultural resources. That model describes and explains the transformations of the simple and inchoate societies of the earliest years of settlement into the ever more complex, differentiated, and articulated societies of the late colonial era. <b>Pursuits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> presents this transformation, which proceeded through a series of phases (social simplification, social elaboration, and social replication) to show the common social processes at work in the regions of colonial British America as well as to direct attention to its variations. In contrast to some of the other attempts at synthesis at that time <b>Pursuits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> argued that overall colonialism did not lead in the direction of cultural divergence from Britain. Rather, it posited a gradual social convergence during the middle decades of the eighteenth century throughout the British Atlantic world. <b>Pursuits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> suggested that the product of this convergence served as a critical precondition for the American Revolution by intensifying demands among colonists for metropolitan recognition of their essential Britishness and thus providing the foundation for the loose political confederation that, after 1775, evolved into the United States.|$|R

5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>happiness</b> which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{there has}} never been a {{national}} political party called the Conservative Party.

25|$|On January 6, 1773, black petitioners {{submitted}} {{the first of}} five appeals written during the year, asking {{for a range of}} rights, to Governor Hutchinson and the General Court of Massachusetts. Though signed only by a slave named Felix, the document petitioned for the freedom and rights of all slaves in the Massachusetts colony. While the tone of the petition is cautious, it speaks to the “unhappy State and Condition” in which enslaved persons are forced to live. Abolitionists later published the petition as a pamphlet, along with letters and other abolitionist documents. Felix’s petition expressed the talk of freedom, liberty, and the <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>happiness</b> that was circulating around Massachusetts and other American colonies before the American Revolution. No record of a response from the Massachusetts General Court exists. Although slavery was never explicitly abolished or prohibited in the new Massachusetts Constitution after the Revolutionary War, rulings in freedom suits by Mum Bett and Quock Walker established that its representation of rights was incompatible with slavery, and remaining slaves effectively gained their freedom.|$|E

The comedy of remarriage is a subgenre of the screwball comedy that deals with a male and a female character that divorce or are already divorced {{at the beginning of the}} film, and eventually remarry at the end.

50|$|<b>Pursuits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> is {{also known}} for {{challenging}} the ideas {{that the experience of}} New England was paradigmatic for the colonies as a whole and that its culture was the seedbed of American culture. Greene argued that New England (particularly orthodox Massachusetts and Connecticut) was anomalous in its idea of colonists as a chosen people, its intense religiosity, and its culture that developed in <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> a holy society. Everywhere else, from Ireland to Virginia and Barbados to Pennsylvania, Greene pointed out, the emphasis in new English societies was on the <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> individual wealth, independence, and status, with settler-dominated colonial governments functioning as an adjunct to the preservation of individual property and status. Greene further argued that New England itself increasingly assimilated to this model during the eighteenth century. Greene explained the inclination to emphasize New England mostly as an unconscious effort to minimize {{the extent to which the}} success of Colonial British America and the early United States was rooted in slave labor.|$|R

500|$|Alongside Aladdins {{other main}} characters, Jasmine embodies the film's {{central theme of}} longing for freedom from some form of {{confinement}} or oppression. Both the film and its characters are influenced by Jasmine's [...] "power of choice". The character's desire for both freedom {{and a sense of}} agency is constantly threatened by other characters and situations; the sole decision Jasmine maintains complete agency over during the entire film is who she falls in love with – aided by the Genie's refusal to use his magical powers to force characters to fall in love – although not who she marries. Although Jasmine yearns to explore her kingdom beyond the confines of her palace, she only gets as far as the marketplace before returning home. Jasmine explores [...] "the idea that enclosing yourself behind walls can make you more vulnerable, not less", as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} character is unprepared and knows little about money when she ventures into the marketplace for first time.

[...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah Hight of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>happiness.</b> But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E

Cavell argues that these films, from the years 1934-1949, form part of what he calls the genre of [...] "The Comedy of Remarriage," [...] and he finds in them great philosophical, moral, and indeed political significance.
