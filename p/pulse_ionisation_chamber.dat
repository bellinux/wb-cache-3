40|$|A monitor for {{continuous}} {{observations of the}} atmospheric 222 Rn daughter activity has been improved and successfully implemented in a field study at a Russian site (Fyodorovskoye Forest Reserve). The alpha-activity of the short-lived 222 Rn and 220 Rn (212 Pb) decay products, which are attached to aerosols, is accumulated on a quartz aerosol filter and assayed on-line by alpha-spectroscopy. The alpha-activity from the 212 Pb daughters is determined by spectroscopy and corrected for. This monitor is suitable to measure 222 Rn activities at hourly resolution down to 0. 5 Bq m- 3 with an uncertainty well below ± 20 %. The prototype of this monitor is run in Heidelberg {{on the roof of}} the Institute’s building about 20 m above ground. For this site, the atmospheric radioactive disequilibrium was determined between the 222 Rn daughter 214 Po and 222 Rn, which has to be known to derive the atmospheric 222 Rn activity with the static filter method. We derived a mean disequilibrium 214 Po/ 222 Rn = 0. 704 ± 0. 081 for various meteorological conditions through parallel 222 Rn gas measurements with a slow <b>pulse</b> <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> At the Russian field site, continuous activity observations were performed from July 1998 until July 2000 with half a year interruption in summer/fall 1999. During intensive campaigns, a second monitor was installed at Fyodorovskoye at 15. 6 m (July/August 1998), and at 1. 8 m (July/August 1999 and October 1999) above ground. Pronounced diurnal cycles of the 222 Rn daughter activity were observed at all sites, particularly during summer when the vertical mixing conditions in the atmospheric surface layer vary strongly between day and night. The lower envelope of the continuous measurements at Fyodorovskoye and at Heidelberg changes on synoptic time scales by a factor of 4 to 10 due to long-range transport changes between continental to more maritime situations. Generally, the 222 Rn activity at 26. 3 m height at Fyodorovskoye is lower by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to Heidelberg at 20 m above ground. This unexpected result is due to considerably lower 222 Rn exhalation rates from the soils measured in the footprint of the Fyodorovskoye Forest tower compared to Heidelberg. With the inverted chamber technique 222 Rn exhalation rates in the range of 3. 3 to 7. 9 Bq m- 2 h- 1 were determined at Fyodorovskoye for summer 1998 and autumn 1999 (wet conditions with water table depths between 5 and 70 cm). Only during the very dry summer in 1999 the mean 222 Rn exhalation rate increased by about a factor of five. All measured exhalation rates at the Fyodorovskoye Forest are considerably smaller by a factor of 2 - 10 compared to what we observe in the vicinity of Heidelberg (ca. 50 to 60 Bq m- 2 h- 1) and generally in Western Europe...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the energy of}} a charged particle {{by means of the}} total amount of ionisation it produces in a gas, through which it passes, is well established. Gas filled devices may be subdivided into (a) current <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> and (b) <b>pulse</b> <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers,</b> proportional counters and Geiger counters. Proportional counters in a very crude form were used by Rutherford and Geiger in 1908. Soon afterwards the Geiger counter was developed, which after considerable improvement by Geiger and Müller in 1928, became the well known Geiger-Müller counter. In fact the three gas filled devices mentioned in (b) can be achieved with the same counter by using it with different applied voltages. If the applied voltage on a typical cylindrical counter is varied and the output pulse height is measured for a fixed number of ion pairs liberated in the gas, a characteristic curve of the form shown in Fig. (1) will be obtained. With voltages between say v₁ and v₂, the field strength is just sufficient to collect all the ion-pairs and no new ion-pairs are liberated, so the pulse height will remain constant. This is the region of pulse ionization chambers where the gas gain is unity. As the voltage is further increased to between v₂ and v₃ both elastic and inelastic collisions take place and the pulse height increases exponentially [...] ...|$|R

Simulations might help to understand in particular the behaviour of the sensitivity factors of an <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> in the mixed field. The study presented here is a continuation of previous work with the final aim to obtain validated computer models of the Mg-Ar and TE-TE <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers.</b> With these two chambers the so-called paired <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> technique is performed by which the neutron and gamma dose components can be separated and determined. By knowing exactly the neutron and gamma source in a simulation, the chamber response can be investigated. However, the validation of a simulated <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> set-up, starting directly with the mixed neutron/gamma fields is too complicated regarding the number of possibilities that could cause a discrepancy between measurements and simulations. Therefore, two simplified and well-known irradiation fields are considered first and will be discussed in this paper: an existing 60 Co calibration source and a 90 Sr check source which has been designed and constructed to perform <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> stability measurements. Both irradiation sources as well as the two <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> are modelled with MCNPX.

40|$|Background: Recent {{protocols}} for {{the determination}} of absorbed dose to water in high-energy photon and electron beams are based on air <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water in a 60 Co gamma ray beam (60, Co D w). To determine the absorbed dose to water in any other high-energy beam (excluding neutrons), the protocols use chamber dependent beam quality conversion factors. Such factors are published in different protocols {{but only for a}} selected number of <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> used clinically. These beam quality correction factors can alternatively be determined experimentally in the user’s beam qualities for each <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The measurement of beam quality correction factors (kQ for photons and kq,E for electrons) accounts for the actual design of different <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers.</b> Direct measurement in the user’s beams also helps to minimise the uncertainties inherent in the theoretical determination of beam quality correction factors based on a unified design. Purpose: The purpose of this work was to determine values of the beam quality correction factors in clinical high-energy photon and electron beams for PTW 30013 and PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers,</b> a PTW 31006 ‘Pinpoint’ <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber,</b> a PTW 31010 0. 125 cm 3 <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber,</b> a PTW 23343 Markus and a PTW 34045 Advanced Markus <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> Methods and materials: Siemens Primus linear accelerators were used to generate 6 and 18 MV photon beams and 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 and 21 MeV electron beams. An Equinox Theratron External Beam Therapy System was used to generate the 60 Co beam used in this study. The <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> were all cross-calibrated for 60, Co D w against the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> at 5 cm water-equivalent depth in the 60 Co beam. The field size at the reference depth was 10 cm x 10 cm. For the same set-up, the absorbed dose to water using the IAEA TRS- 398 (IAEA, 2000) was determined using the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The exposure calibration factor (x) for the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference chamber was then derived by equating the absorbed dose to water calculated from the IAEA TRS- 398 protocol to the absorbed dose to water calculated from the AAPM TG- 21 (AAPM, 1983) protocol. The cavity-gas calibration factor (gas) was then determined for the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The cross-calibrated 60, Co D w for each cylindrical chamber and the absorbed dose to water due to the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> in the 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams were used to determine kQ for each <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> at the respective photon energies. The plane-parallel and the cylindrical <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> were then cross-calibrated for gas in the 21 MeV electron beam. The absorbed dose to water in the electron beams was then calculated from first principles using the AAPM TG- 21 worksheets for all of the chambers.

The PinPoint chamber gave significant dose differences compared to the Farmer chamber. There were also differences of up to 12 % between the BJR Report 25 depth doses and the measured data. For the Bland-Altman plots, the lines representing the limits of agreement were selected to be a particular percentage agreement e. g. 1 or 2 %, instead of being based on the standard deviation (σ) of the differences.

40|$|It {{needs no}} {{introduction}} that good measurements regarding BNCT dosimetry are of vital interest. Above all, calculations for patient treatment planning are initially {{based on these}} measurements. Closely related, well understood dosimetry of mixed neutron and gamma fields is necessary to explain the outcomes of the many experiments performed. It is believed that the sometimes confusing and incomprehensible outcomes in BNCT research are due to incorrect dosimetry, i. e. misleading measurements. A popular detector {{used to describe the}} absorbed neutron and gamma doses is the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> To understand better the behaviour and intricacies of this detector, the collected and measured current is directly simulated with MCNPX. This Monte Carlo code is able to track neutrons, gammas and electrons all around and in the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The calculated dose deposited by the electrons in the gas is proportional to the current measured. Protons and alphas emanating from the wall and/or gas materials due to nuclear reactions can also cause ionisations and thus add to the current. A custom-made program has been written to simulate this contribution. The issue in this study is that a disagreement between simulated and measured current can be caused by the computer code and/or measurement set-up and/or unknown influences of source and/or materials. Therefore, the model of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> as well as the neutron and gamma source descriptions are validated step-by-step. After having obtained enough confidence in the model it can be concluded that <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements can be significantly affected by neutron interactions (this is energy dependent). Neutrons can increase the measured current due to unknown and unconsidered beta-, proton- and/or alpha-producers in the wall material and gas; this dose component does not exist without the presence of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> JRC.

30|$|MS is a {{detection}} technique {{based on the}} measurement of the mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of ionised analyte molecules. The obtained m/z ratio from an analytes can then be identified by correlating the mass {{with that of a}} specific molecule and/or by identifying characteristic fragmentation patterns that may occur during ionisation (de Hoffman & Stroobant 2007). In order to ionise the analytes in a solution there is need to transfer the molecules in to gas phase. One of the most widely used ionisation techniques is electrospray ionisation (ESI), which applies a high voltage to the mobile phase to create an aerosol within the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> (de Hoffman & Stroobant 2007). The droplets of solvent are then vaporised by heating up the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> situated prior to the MS inlet.|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of ambient doses at work places around high-energy accelerators is a challenging task due {{the complexity of}} the mixed stray radiation fields encountered. At CERN, mainly Centronics IG 5 high-pressure <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> are used to monitor radiation exposure in mixed fields. The monitors are calibrated in the operational quantity ambient dose equivalent H*(10) using standard, source-generated photon- and neutron fields. However, the relationship between <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> reading and ambient dose equivalent in a mixed high-energy radiation field can only be assessed if the spectral response to every component and the field composition is known. Therefore, comprehensive studies were performed at the CERN-EU high-energy reference field facility where the spectral fluence for each particle type has been assessed with Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, studies have been performed in an accessible controlled radiation area in the vicinity of a beam loss point of CERN's proton synchrotron. The comparison of measurements and calculations has shown reasonable agreement for most exposure conditions. The results indicate that conventionally calibrated <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> can give satisfactory response in terms of ambient dose equivalent in stray radiation fields at high-energy accelerators in many cases. These studies are one step towards establishing a method of ‘field calibration' of radiation protection instruments in which Monte Carlo simulations will be used to establish a correct correlation between the response of specific detectors to a given high-energy radiation fiel...|$|R

The locations were selected in order to perform the measurements in different stray field conditions. Various neutron detectors were employed: <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers,</b> conventional and extended range rem counters, both commercial and prototype ones, including a novel instrument called LUPIN, specifically conceived to work in pulsed fields.

The results show that the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> and LUPIN agree well with the expected H*(10) values, as derived from FLUKA simulations, showing no relevant underestimations even in strongly pulsed fields. On the contrary, the dead-time losses of the other rem counters induced an underestimation in pulsed fields that was more important for instruments characterised by a higher dead tim...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{designing}} a low background <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> is to measure long lived α-decay half-lives which might interfere with rare event searches. Such decays {{play a part}} in many fields in nuclear physics and are difficult to measure. A lot of Geiger-Nutall studies also depend on them. Among others the research is specifically aimed at the precision measurements of α emitters mainly within the Lanthanide region. The excellent energy resolution would also allow to search for excited states in α-decays. To achieve this goal a gridded <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> was constructed using the Frisch-Grid design. A background rate of only 10. 9 (6) counts per day has been achieved in the energy region of 1 [*]MeV to 9 [*]MeV and improvements are possible.

40|$|Gafchromic {{film has}} been used for {{measurement}} of computed tomography (CT) dose distributions within phantoms. The film was calibrated in the beam from a superficial therapy unit and the accuracy confirmed by comparison with measurements with a 20 mm long <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The results have been used to investigate approaches to CT dosimetry. Dose profiles were recorded within standard CT head and body phantoms and scatter tail data fitted to exponential functions and extrapolated to predict dose levels in longer phantoms. The data have been used to simulate both CT dose index (CTDI) measurements with <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> of differing length and measurements of cumulative doses with a 20 mm chamber for scans of varying length. The results show that the length of a pencil <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> is the most significant factor affecting measurements of weighted CTDI (CTDIw) and a 100 mm chamber would record 50 – 61 % of the dose measured with a 450 mm one. The cumulative dose measured at the centre of a 150 mm long body phantom records over 70 % of the equilibrium dose from a helical scan of a longer phantom. For routine CT dosimetry tests, the determination of correction factors could allow measurements with a 100 mm chamber to be used to derive the CTDI that would be recorded with a longer chamber, and cumulative doses measured with a 20 mm chamber in shorter phantoms to be used to calculate equilibrium doses for helical scans...|$|R
40|$|Intensity {{modulated}} {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) {{is a relatively}} new treatment planning and delivery technique. The complex multiple-segment nature of an IMRT plan makes it difficult to verify using traditional look-up tables and hand calculations. The purpose of this project was to develop an effective and time-efficient plan checking procedure using a combination of <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> and film. The dosimeters available were 0. 03 cc volume and 0. 6 cc volume thimble <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers,</b> Kodak X-Omat V (XV) film and Kodak Extende Dose Range (EDR 2) film. First the dosimeters were tested for accuracy in terms of their dose response in the clinical range required (up to about 200 cGy). All were found to be suitable for further investigation for use in IMRT plan checking. One non-IMRT and six IMRT plans were validated. The plans were transferred from the patient geometry to a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm cubic phantom made up of slabs of solid water. The <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> and films were calibrated and used to measure the dose delivered to the phantom at the isocentre for each beam and for an entire IMRT treatment. The film was also used to provide axial and planar dose distribution maps for comparison with the predicted distributions. Time restraints meant that not every type of dosimeter was used for every beam and treatment plan. It was found that the isocentric 0. 6 cc volume <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> provided a suitably accurate dose check, with an average difference between predicted and measured full treatment doses of 2. 0 cGy {{with a standard deviation of}} 2. 7 cGy and 1. 5 % with a standard deviation of 2. 1 %. The film was less successful, with the EDR 2 film (digitised and analysed using ImageJ software) giving an average difference between predicted and asured full treatment doses of 5. 4 cGy with a standard deviation of 4. 0 cGy and 4. 0 % with a standard deviation of 3. 1 %. The film was very useful for obtaining qualitative dose distribution maps, which could be used as surrogates to verify that the radiotherapy treatment planning system’s co-ordinate information was being transferred correctly. Following the results of the test cases a procedure was established for all future IMRT plans. The procedure can easily be varied to include further measurements if necessary, and consists of measuring the dose at isocentre from each beam and the whole treatment using the 0. 6 cc <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> EDR 2 film is to be used to visually verify the axial dose distribution, and XV film to verify planar dose distributions for each beam...|$|R
