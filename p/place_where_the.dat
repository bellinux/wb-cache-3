5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic.

The circus was the only <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|Sungei Road (Chinese: 双溪路; {{literally}} River Road) is a road in Singapore situated between Serangoon Road and Jalan Besar {{and runs}} along the Rochor Canal. The area around Sungei Road was formerly the homes of affluent Europeans and Asians, where many ornately designed buildings were built in its place. From the 1930s to the present, the road has been synonymous with the Thieves' Market, the largest and oldest flea market in Singapore, where the locals can hunt for old bric-a-brac or second-hand goods, as a cheap replacement for one's faulty or lost item. It's also the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> well-known Sungei Road Laksa, a local spicy noodle soup originated.|$|E
