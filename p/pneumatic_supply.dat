40|$|Abstract:- Flowrate {{control is}} of {{essential}} importance {{to a wide}} range of mechanical engineering applications, concerning hydraulic and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply,</b> precise measurement, driving and servo-systems [1]. Most flowrate control systems imply various valves as final control elements, responsible for the nonlinear and nonstationary properties of the generalized plant of process, transmission lines, flow sensor, actuator and valve characteristics [2]. Computer aided design and computer completion of more advanced control algorithms [3, 4, 5, 6] can improve the quality of flowrate control. The aim of the paper is to design a precise flowrate neural network controller. The main contribution is derivation of a generalized plant model and development of a reference model control algorithm by proper design and training of neural networks, using backpropagation methods in MATLAB.

The NASA Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) used for this investigation is a transport-size short takeoff and landing (STOL) research vehicle with a slightly swept wing that employs the upper surface blowing (USB) concept to attain the high lift levels required for its low speed, short-field performance. Minor modifications to the conventional nose gear assembly {{and the addition of}} a high pressure pneumatic system and a control system provided the extendible nose gear, or 'jump strut,' capability. The limited flight test program explored the effects of thrust-to-weight ratio, storage tank initial pressure, and control valve open time duration on the ground roll distance.

A self-tuning adaptive model of a wastewater aeration tank, as a non-stationary object, with variable time dependent sensitivity and inertia indexes, as the functions of input variable - air <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply</b> capacity Lg(t) (m 3 /min), output variable – dissolved oxygen concentration C(t) (g/m 3) and oxygen expenditure, as a load – q(t) (g/min), required for wastewater complete purification, is expounded. Virtual models, applying Laplace transforms and SIMULINK blocks library, are composed in order to compare the transient processes of dissolved oxygen concentration in the simplified stationary model with constant sensitivity and inertia coefficients, and in the non-stationary model with variable sensitivity and inertia indexes. The simulation block-diagram for non-stationary model adoption to the variable parameters is developed, using informative links from input variable Lg(t), from variable load q(t) and feedback from output variable C(t) as inputs of calculation modulus, allowing to instantly re-calculate the variable indexes during simulation time.

40|$|This is an {{open access}} article under the CC BY license ([URL] Supplementary data for this article is {{available}} in the Loughborough Data Repository at doi: 10. 17028 /rd. lboro. 5509528 In this paper, a purely data-driven modelling approach is presented for predicting and controlling the free bending angle response of a typical soft pneumatic actuator (SPA), embedded with a resistive flex sensor. An experimental setup was constructed to test the SPA at different input pressure values and orientations, while recording the resulting feedback from the embedded flex sensor and on-board pressure sensor. A calibrated high speed camera captures image frames during the actuation, which are then analysed using an image processing program to calculate the actual bending angle and synchronise it with the recorded sensory feedback. Empirical models were derived based on the generated experimental data using two common data-driven modelling techniques; regression analysis and artificial neural networks. Both techniques were validated using a new dataset at untrained operating conditions to evaluate their prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the derived empirical model was used as part of a closed-loop PID controller to estimate and control the bending angle of the tested SPA based on the real-time sensory feedback generated. The tuned PID controller allowed the bending SPA to accurately follow stepped and sinusoidal reference signals, even in the presence of pressure leaks in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply.</b> This work demonstrates how purely data-driven models can be effectively used in controlling the bending of SPAs under different operating conditions, avoiding the need for complex analytical modelling and material characterisation.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the unique pneumatic test {{requirements for the}} acoustic and shock separation testing of the Second Stage for the new Delta III Rocket at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The testing was conducted in the 45, 000 cu ft (25 -feet wide by 30 -feet deep by 50 -foot high) Acoustic Facility. The acoustic testing required that the liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tanks be filled with enough liquid nitrogen (LN 2) to simulate launch fuel masses during testing. The challenge for this test dealt with designing, procuring, and fabricating the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply</b> systems for quick assembly while maintaining the purity requirements and minimizing costs. The pneumatic systems were designed to fill and drain the both LOX and LH 2 tanks {{as well as to}} operate the fill/drain and vent valves for each of the tanks. The test criteria for the pneumatic sub-systems consisted of function, cleanliness, availability, and cost. The first criteria, function, required the tanks to be filled and drained in an efficient manner while preventing them from seeing pressures greater than 9 psig which would add a pressure cycle to the tank. An LN 2 tanker, borrowed from another NASA facility, served as the pre-cool and drain tanker. Pre-cooling the tanks allowed for more efficient and cost effective transfer from the LN 2 delivery tankers. Helium gas, supplied from a high purity tube trailer, was used to pressurize the vapor space above the LN 2 pushing it into the drain tanker. The tube trailer also supplied high pressure helium to the vehicle for valve control and component purges. Cleanliness was maintained by proper component selection, end-use particle filtration, and any on-site cleaning determined necessary by testing. In order to meet the availability/cost juggling act, products designed for LOX delivery systems were procured to ensure system compatibility while off the shelf valves and tubing designed for the semiconductor industry were procured for the gas systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{advance in}} {{microfluidics}} and microfabrication enables the miniaturization {{of the conventional}} biochemical reactions to achieve inexpensive and rapid assays. In this dissertation, biochemical reaction microsystems in two-phase microfluidic formats – air-liquid and liquid-liquid (droplet-based), were developed and studied to perform single- and multi-step amplification-based DNA analyses. Microfluidic valveless devices for single-liquid-phase-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed to reduce the evaporation loss relying {{on the principle of}} diffusion-limited evaporation. The evaporation can be suppressed using long narrow diffusion channels in conjunction with reducing the driving force for liquid evaporation by decreasing the interfacial temperature using thermal isolation and reducing the vapor concentration gradient through replenishing water vapor in the diffusion channels. With these techniques the evaporation loss can be limited to approximately 1 % of the reaction content. Performance of droplet-based PCR was also studied in a microdevice. Droplets with a volume range of 5 - 250 nL can be formed on-chip reproducibly, and PCR in the droplets showed amplification efficiency comparable to benchtop reactions with no evaporation loss. Reaction parameters such as reagent concentration, hold time at each cycling step, template concentration and the droplet size were characterized. The droplet-based PCR also demonstrated amplification with a cycle threshold of ~ 10 cycles earlier than the benchtop instruments. Operation of the droplet-based microdevice was then automated using on-chip electronic sensing. The sensing signal was used to track the oil/aqueous interface and control the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply</b> for automatically generating and moving droplets. The actual droplet size was very close to the designed value with a standard deviation less than 3 % of the droplet size. The droplets can be automatically confined in the reaction region with feedback pneumatic control. PCR has also been successfully performed in the automated generated and positioned droplets. Droplet manipulations such as merging and mixing were also studied in a microdevice for applications in multi-step bioreactions. Mixing in the merged droplets was achieved with the droplet kept in the chamber or moved out of the chamber. A droplet-based two-step bioreaction, nested TaqMan® PCR with enhanced sensitivity has been demonstrated by utilizing droplet generation, merging and mixing in the microdevice...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{awareness}} of our environment demands the aviation industry to produce eco-friendly and more efficient aircrafts. To support this the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) is developing and improving breakthrough technologies, that will be demonstrated on a flying prototype. The Clean Sky JTI is split up into six technology domains; {{one of these is}} the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA). This domain aims to develop and test a new wing design that makes use of passive and active flow and load control technologies. Department of Systems Engineering and Aircraft Design (SEAD) at Delft University of Technology has been asked to develop a simulation framework to support the internal systems design on the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft. During this thesis work a parametric model and framework has been created for two flow control technologies and their <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply</b> system. The model is based on Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) techniques, which aim to increase the productivity of engineers and allow more detailed and fair concepts trade-offs. The two selected ‘smart technologies’ are Hybrid Laminar Flow Control (HLFC) and Fluidic Actuated Flow Control (FAFC). The first extends laminar flow using a combination of Natural Laminar Flow and Boundary Layer Suction. The second delays separation, stalling and buffeting by reenergising the boundary layer using pulsating or synthetic jets. The parametric model creates a 3 D representation of various internal system concepts, which is used to evaluate the Internal Aerodynamics, External Aerodynamics (HLFC only), weight and cost. The internal aerodynamic analysis uses handbook relations and has been incorporated into the KBE environment. It has been validated for conceptual design with limited success. External aerodynamics is performed with a link to Xfoil-suc. The cost and weight are currently based on component and (sheet-) material price and weight. The product model created in this thesis work can evaluate multiple concepts of the internal system for both ‘smart technologies’ and thereby allow a more detailed and fair trade-off. Due to the lack of available input specifications, e. g. aircraft-type and external aerodynamic data, a trade-off between the concepts could unfortunately not yet be made.
