Materials and methods. With the microimmunofluorescence test (micro-IF) we evaluated the presence of C. pneumoniae specific antibodies in 1036 healthy subjects, in two periods of time, in 1991 – 93 and 1997 – 1998.

We {{developed an}} in vitro quantitative assay {{to evaluate the}} pathogenic strength of anti-Dsg 3 IgG autoantibodies in blister formation. To obtain intercellular adhesion mediated dominantly by Dsg 3, we used primary cultured normal human keratinocytes expressing low level of Dsg 2 {{in the presence of}} exfoliative toxin A that specifically digests Dsg 1. After incubation with various antibodies, monolayers released by dispase were subjected to mechanical stress by pipetting, and the number of cell fragments were counted. When anti-Dsg 3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) obtained from pemphigus model mice were tested, pathogenic AK 23 mAb yielded significantly higher number of cell fragments than AK 7 or AK 20 non-pathogenic mAb. Dissociation scores, defined with AK 23 mAb as the positive control, were significantly higher with active stage PV sera (n= 10, 77. 4 ± 21. 4) than controls (n= 11, 16. 0 ± 9. 6; p= 0. 003). When <b>pair</b> <b>sera</b> obtained from 6 PV patients in active stage and in remission were compared, the dissociation scores reflected well the disease activity as those in active stage were four to 17 times higher than those in remission.

40|$|Rift Valley fever (RVF) {{virus was}} {{isolated}} from 53 of 56 sera collected from {{patients with a}} clinical picture of dengue-like illness during {{the peak of the}} epidemic of RVF in Egypt in the autumn of 1977. RVF virus was also isolated from the throat washings of two patients and the faeces of four, all of whom were positive for virus isolation from the serum. All the isolates were identified by the complement fixation (CF) test. Serological diagnosis of RVF, using <b>paired</b> <b>sera</b> from 16 patients, was made by both the haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and CF tests. HI antibodies were demonstrated in all the acute sera, whereas CF antibodies, which seem to appear later, were detected in only seven acute and twelve convalescent sera. A longer period than the 12 days in this study must be allowed to elapse between the taking of the <b>paired</b> <b>sera</b> for a definite serological diagnosis to be obtained, especially when CF antibodies are taken into account...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} serologic immunity against clinical infections by heat-labile enterotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (LT-ETEC) {{in rural}} Bangladesh, 124 children and adult women with LT-ETEC diarrhea (cases) {{were compared with}} 347 age-matched community controls. In <b>paired</b> acute-convalescent <b>sera</b> from the cases, IgG anti-CFA I and anti-eFA II antibody titers increased eight-to ninefold after infection by LT-ETEC with the homologous CFA, and 19 O anti-LT antibody titers increased fourfold for all LT-ETEC infections. Anti-CFA and anti-LT titers peaked in con-trols aged 12 - 23 months, the age group with the highest incidence of ETEC infections. However, antibody titers were similar in acute sera from cases and in sera from controls. Although serum IgG anti-CFA and anti-LT antibodies rose in response to LT-ETEC infections and paralleled the age-specific incidence of ETEC in the community, these antibodies were not associated with a lower risk of LT-ETEC diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are documented important causes of diarrhea among children in developing countries and among persons from developed countries who travel to less developed areas [1].

50|$|Later, Angela and {{her lover}} Sera abduct the newborn {{daughter}} of Odin and Freyja. Unbeknownst to Odin, {{the baby is}} possessed by the spirit of Surtur and Odin orders Thor to hunt down the <b>pair.</b> Angela and <b>Sera</b> {{with help from the}} Guardians of the Galaxy, stay ahead of Thor and take the baby to Heven to be cleansed of Surtur's spirit. There, Angela throws the baby into the stalled engines of Heven. Surtur's fire is expelled from the baby and reignites the engines of Heven. For this action, Angela's debt to Heven is repaid and thus closes her last remaining connection to the realm.|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} are often marked by autoantibodies binding to self antigens. However, many healthy persons also manifest autoantibodies that bind to self antigens, known as natural autoantibodies. In order to characterize natural autoantibodies present at birth, we used an antigen microarray (antigen chip) to analyze informatically (with clustering algorithms and correlation mapping) the natural IgM, IgA, and IgG autoantibody repertoires present in 10 <b>pairs</b> of <b>sera</b> from healthy mothers and the cords of their newborn babies. These autoantibodies {{were found to}} bind to 305 different, mostly self, molecules. We report that in utero, humans develop IgM and IgA autoantibodies to relatively uniform sets of self molecules. The global patterns of maternal IgM autoantibodies significantly diverged from those at birth, although certain reactivities remained common to both maternal and cord samples. Because maternal IgG antibodies (unlike IgM and IgA) cross the placenta, maternal and cord IgG autoantibodies showed essentially identical reactivities. We found that some self antigens that bind cord autoantibodies were among the target self antigens associated with autoimmune diseases later in life. Thus, the obviously benign autoimmunity prevalent at birth may {{provide the basis for}} the emergence of some autoimmune diseases relatively prevalent later in life...|$|R
