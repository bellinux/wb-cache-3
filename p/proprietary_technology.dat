WMA Pro, a newer and more advanced codec, supports multichannel and high resolution audio. A lossless codec, WMA Lossless, compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA format is lossy). WMA Voice, targeted at voice content, applies compression using a range of low bit rates. Microsoft has also developed a digital container format called Advanced Systems Format to store audio encoded by WMA.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1990s, Dell {{expanded}} beyond {{desktop computers}} and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers {{at the time}} were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on <b>proprietary</b> <b>technology,</b> such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.|$|E
500|$|On April 15, 2009, the {{publishers}} of , Genius Products and Numark, sued against Scratchs developer, 7 Studios and Activision. The lawsuit contends that Activision purchased 7 Studios to both {{gain access to}} <b>proprietary</b> <b>technology</b> and to delay publication of the game so DJ Hero could come out first. The Los Angeles Superior Court in which the suit was filed did not grant the requested restraining order against Activision on DJ Hero. Activision states that Scratch was already delayed by as early as October 2008, before they made contact with 7 Studios, and their acquisition of the developers did not impede them from completing Scratch. However, on April 20, the court reversed its decision, awarding Genius and Numark a temporary restraining order, and ordered the [...] "immediate return" [...] {{of all of the}} material from 7 Studios from Activision, including all source code related to Scratch. 7 Studios subsequently filed a counter-suit against Genius Products, claiming that they engaged in [...] "unlawful and unsavoury business practices" [...] that limited 7 Studios from completing the game as planned.|$|E
500|$|Soviet Strike {{received}} criticism {{regarding the}} player's limited {{view of his}} surroundings and attacks from enemies out with it. To offset this potential problem, the developers added a radar to the HUD, which illustrated surrounding enemies to the player. Gamers also criticized the difficulty of Soviet Strike. A high difficulty level being traditional to the Strike series, the team {{did not wish to}} alienate long-term fans by making Nuclear Strike directly easier, but instead more accessible, using such devices as the new radar, a new compass indicating the direction of the next objective and [...] "a lot more visual and audible clues". Producer Kosaka explained: [...] "A lot of the stuff we couldn't fit in [...] is going in this one". The team added several new vehicles, as well as continuing the occasional real time strategy sections found in Soviet Strike. The jets proved problematic in early testing due to their speed, but appeared in the final game. Heat-seeking missiles were among other new additions, as was a <b>proprietary</b> <b>technology</b> termed the Interactive Music System. This generates more [...] "pulse pounding" [...] music depending on the level of action occurring in-game. Palomar Studios created the full motion video, for which some footage was shot in both Thailand and the Bronson Cave, used as the Batcave in the 1960s television incarnation of Batman.

500|$|They {{met with}} Katzenberg {{at a conference}} table in the Team Disney {{building}} at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. Catmull and Smith considered {{it would be difficult}} to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant. Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: [...] "Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I am a tyrant. But I'm usually right." [...] He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: [...] "John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way." [...] He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators—"ask them anything at all"—and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations. Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney. Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's <b>proprietary</b> <b>technology</b> for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused. In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused. Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July. Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues. It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early negotiations would become a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.|$|E

2500|$|Before Tesla had {{developed}} the Roadster's proprietary powertrain, they borrowed an AC Propulsion Tzero vehicle {{as a test}} mule and converted from Lead Acid AGM batteries to Lithium Ion cells which substantially increased the range, reduced weight, and boosted 0-60 performance. [...] Tesla then licensed AC Propulsion's EV Power System design and Reductive Charging patent which covers integration of the charging electronics with the inverter, thus reducing mass, complexity, and cost. However, Tesla was dissatisfied with how the motor and transmission worked in the chassis. Tesla then designed and built its own power electronics, motor, and other drivetrain components that incorporated this licensed technology from AC Propulsion. Given the extensive redevelopment of the vehicle, Tesla Motors no longer licenses any <b>proprietary</b> <b>technology</b> from AC Propulsion. The Roadster's powertrain is unique.|$|E

2500|$|Andreas Hackel, art {{director}} at Candygun Games described {{the inspiration for}} the game's visuals. [...] "I was inspired by games like Team Fortress 2 and classic B-movies of the 1950's", stated Hackel. When asked about the reason for choosing to set it in the 1950s, Hackel replied, [...] "not many games are set in this period and there are a whole slew of very typical and interesting design elements from this time period. Elements like the cars, milk bars, chrome, juke boxes, fashion and hairstyles are all instantly recognisable as coming from the 50's." [...] Hackel commented that Candygun wanted the characters to be [...] "people from the street", and not superheroes. Roger Joswig explained their choice of using Unreal Engine 3 instead of a <b>proprietary</b> <b>technology.</b> [...] "If you're looking to release your game on , Xbox 360 and PC as we were, developing your own engine is a lot more expensive, takes a long time if you start from scratch and needs a lot of QA support – so it wasn't really a feasible option for us as a small, start-up developer". He also noted that the engine is built to run on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows natively and that the team was familiar with the Unreal Engine tools. The in-game music was provided by the band Vampire State Building. The narrator's voice and in-game sound effects were outsourced to Periscope Studios.|$|E
