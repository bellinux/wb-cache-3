30|$|Over the <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>decade,</b> we have {{witnessed}} new applications of seismic attributes in seismic processing, reflector mapping, fault identification, bright spot identification, frequency loss, thin bed tuning, seismic stratigraphy and geomorphology. Gradually, as geophysicists realized that the additional benefits provided by 3 D seismic will improve stratigraphic interpretation of data; seismic interpreters quickly took advantage of this new insight by studying objects of different geologic origins and their spatial relationships. Not all stratigraphic features of interest are readily apparent in amplitude data (Hart 2013). Various seismic attributes have shown to be useful for detecting stratigraphic features in the data {{in the same way}} that some attributes are useful for identifying structural features such as faults (Hart 2013). In this study two unique and significant attributes—RMS amplitude and semblance were utilized in characterizing the reservoirs and identifying fault geometries (Figs.  3, 4). The RMS amplitude is a surface attribute that measures the root mean square of amplitude between two surfaces and it is useful in identifying reservoir extent and geometry. The semblance attribute is a volume attribute which measures the linear coherence of events in a multi-trace window and it is especially useful for identifying discontinuities such as faults and channels.|$|R
