40|$|The {{histogenesis}} of Kaposi's sarcoma {{was investigated}} by immunohistochemical staining of 20 skin specimens that represented four main histologic <b>stages.</b> The early <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>Stage</b> 1 contained lymphatic-like clefts lined by endothelial cells with thin, discontinuous basement membranes shown by anti-laminin, absent Factor VIII-related antigen reactivity (FVIIIRAg), and only rare staining with dilute Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I). In the late <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>Stage</b> 1, the clefts developed into anastomosing, blood-filled channels, and the basement membrane became complete. Endothelial marker reactivities were not definitive, but weak staining with UEA-I and variable staining for FVIIIRAg characterized the spindle cells <b>of</b> <b>Stage</b> 2. However, spindle cells in monomorphic nodules were individually enclosed by immunoreactive laminin. The sequence of events, {{particularly in light}} of previous angiographic findings of lymphaticovenous union, suggests a disturbance in lymphaticovenous differentiation in Kaposi's sarcoma.

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{requirements}} for X- 33 is that it be capable of flying autonomously. That is, onboard computers must be capable of commanding the entire flight from launch to landing, including cases where a single engine failure abort occurs. Guidance algorithms meeting these requirements have been tested in simulation and have been coded into prototype flight software. These algorithms must be sufficiently robust to account for vehicle and environmental dispersions, and must issue commands that result in the vehicle operating, within all constraints. Continual tests of these algorithms (and modifications as necessary) will occur {{over the next year}} as the X- 33 nears its first flight.

40|$|Primary {{objective}} of this work was the assessment of natural regeneration processes in the Norway spruce natural forest at its upper limit in the National Nature Reserve Kosodrevina. Dynamics of regeneration processes was quantified by numbers of individuals per hectare, specified by five height categories for each experimental plot. The evaluation of natural regeneration in the experimental plots involved analysis of growth medium impact as well (soil or coarse woody debris). The impact of seedbed was examined in 2006. Analysis of regeneration processes in the natural Norway spruce mountain forest confirmed that initial <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> breakdown <b>stage</b> generates optimal conditions for a continuous generation replacement. The number of individuals recorded in this stage ranged from 3. 501 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 2006) to 1. 800 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 1986). But on the other hand, research on regeneration dynamics in optimal stage showed that suitable conditions for germination, establishment and partial growth of seedlings were in advanced <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> this <b>stage.</b> From 2. 167 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 1996) to 1. 034 pcs .  ha− 1 (in 2006) were found in this plot.

40|$|AbstractIn North China, the Mesozoic {{terrestrial}} basins, sedimentary palaeogeography and tectonic settings involved five evolutionary stages: (1) the Early‒Middle Triassic, (2) the Late Triassic to Early‒Middle Jurassic, (3) the Late Jurassic {{to early}} Early Cretaceous, (4) the middle‒late Early Cretaceous and (5) the Late Cretaceous. The regional punctuated tectonic events occurred during these evolutionary stages. During the Early‒Middle Triassic (stage 1), the Xingmeng Orogenic Belt (XMOB, i. e., {{eastern part of}} Central Asia Orogenic Belt, CAOB) of the northern North China was settled in the transition of tectonic environment from syn‒orogenic compression to post‒orogenic extension with intensive uplifting. It is a main provenance in the unified Ordos‒North China Basin. The united continental plate of China and the Qinling‒Dabie‒Sulu Orogenic Belt formed due to convergence and collision between the North China Plate and the Yangtze Plate along two suture zones of the Mianlue and the Shangdan in the terminal Middle Triassic. During the Late Triassic to the Early‒Middle Jurassic (stage 2), the Late Triassic mafic or alkaline rocks and intrusions occurred on {{the northern and southern}} margins of North China Craton (NCC) and XMOB, implying that intensified extension happened all over the North China (early <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 2). Additionally, in the late <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 2, the basic volcanicfilling faulted basins were widely distributed in the northeastern North China during the Early–Middle Jurassic, including a series of small- to medium-sized basins with coal-bearing strata and some volcanic rocks in other areas of North China, which was the result of subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate during the Early–Middle Jurassic. An active continental margin with accretionary complex developed in the eastern Heilongjiang of China, Japan and the Far East of Russia at that time. However, in the end of the Early‒Middle Jurassic, because of the Yanshanian orogeny characterized by complicated thrust and fold, the previous unified Ordos–North China Basin was separated by the northeast-oriented Great Xing’an Range and Taihang Mountain uplifted linearment. The differential evolution of basins and sedimentary palaeogeography between eastern and western North China was initiated, and was interpreted to result in the closure of Okhotsk Ocean and the subduction of Palaeo-Pacific Plate (late stage 2). During the Late Jurassic (the early <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 3), a variety of faulted basins occurred in the Yanshan and Yinshan areas in the northeastern North China. In Yanshan area, basins were filled with thickened intermediate volcanic rocks and purple-red coarse-grained clastic rocks. In contrast, only thick layered sedimentary rocks with rare volcanic rocks developed in the Yinshan faulted basins, the Ordos Basin and basins in sourthern North China. XMOB was the main provenance of the Early Mesozoic basins in the North China, while the Ordos Basin and the Hefei Basin were partly supplied by the northern Qinling Orogenic Belt. During the Late Jurassic–early Early Cretaceous (the late <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 3), the northern and northeastern North China experienced extensional movement after the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate, the closure of the Mongolia–Okhotsk Ocean and the subsequent Yanshanian orogeny. At the same time, a NE-oriented, giant rift basin system (NE Asia Rift) extended from the Yanshan to the western Great Xing’an Range, where rift basins were filled with the regional, NE-oriented, thick coarse-grained clastic rocks and a belt of volcanic rocks. In the meantime, the eastern and northeastern China and most areas of NCC were presented as highland terrains. During the middle‒late Early Cretaceous (stage 4), rift basins developed and accumulated alluvial sediments and interbedded alkaline volcanic rocks in the western and northern North China, including Yingen, Ejinaqi and Erlian regions. Basins were formed {{on both sides of the}} Tan-Lu Fault Zone under a striking-slipping force. Furthermore, faulted basins developed in the Yishu Fault Zone of Shandong (central Tan-Lu Fault Zone) as well, where dinosaur fauna flourished. Basic volcanic rocks and fluvial‒lacustrine sediments were deposited in small- or medium-sized rift basins in the northeastern China. The Songliao Basin was a typical giant basin that was mainly filled with late Early Cretaceous lacustrine sediments. A group of rift basins occurred in the Sanjiang area, central Heilongjiang Province, northeastern China. From the middle‒late Early Cretaceous to the Late Cretaceous (stage 5), depositional and subsiding center of the basins constantly shifted southeastwards in Heilongjiang Province. The tectonic setting changed into the Palaeo-Pacific continental margin in north and northeastern China. Besides, during the Late Mesozoic, a huge terrestrial biota, mainly dinosaur fauna, dominated in North China. The Yanliao biota of the Middle–Late Jurassic and the Jehol biota of the Early Cretaceous are characterized by feathered dinosaurs, primitive birds, mammals, pterosaur, insects and plants (angiosperms). In northeastern Asia, this Late Mesozoic tectonic background, palaeogeoraphy and palaeoecology were shared by East China, Korean Peninsula, Japan and the Far East of Russia...|$|R
