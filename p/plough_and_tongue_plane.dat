40|$|Abstract- A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of different levels of soil tillage on soil physical properties of Benue River flood plains in Makurdi zone. The field was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four treatments and three replications. The treatments were <b>ploughing</b> <b>and</b> harrowing once (PH), <b>ploughing</b> <b>and</b> harrowing twice (PHH), <b>ploughing</b> <b>and</b> harrowing thrice (PHHH) and no – tillage (NT). A four – wheel drive Massey Ferguson tractor (MF 375 E), 3 – discs Massey Ferguson <b>plough</b> <b>and</b> 14 – discs offset Massey Ferguson harrow were used for the tillage operations. The soil properties studied were infiltration rate, bulk density, moisture content, particle size distribution and soil loss. The experiments were conducted during the cropping season from April to November, 2012. The total rainfall within the period was 928. 7 mm. Atmospheric temperatures fluctuated between 32 º...|$|R
