40|$|Floristic and Faunistic {{pattern of}} the area was studied based on {{inquiries}} from the local population, personal observation and forest officials. The study area falls under Dahej, Bharuch District of Gujarat state. Western {{part of the study}} area is occupied by the mud flats and Saltpans. There is almost plain without much undulation, a fallow land; hence not mush vegetation cover, except scattered Prosopis juliflora shrubs and few trees of Prosopis cineraria. Total 41 species of trees belong to 20 families are enumerated from the study area. Shrubs encountered during the present survey are 27 shrub species belong to 18 families are enumerated from the study area. The dominant shrub community in this area was represented by Prosopis Juliflora (Gando baval), Calotropis procera, C. gigantea (Akado), Ipomoea fistulosa (Nasarmo), Lawsonia inermis (Mendhi), Abutilon indicum (Khapat) and Lantana camara (Ganthai). Painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala) was observed which is grouped under near threatened birds by IUCN. Among the birds in the study area, Pea fowl (Pavo cristatus), is included in schedule I of Wild life protection Act (1972), while many other birds are included in schedule IV. Among the reptiles, Indian Cobra (Naja naja), and Common rat snake (<b>Ptyas</b> <b>mucosus)</b> were provided protection as per Schedule-II of Wild life protection act, (1972). Among mammals, Common Mongoose (Herpestes edwardsi), Jackal (Canis aureus (Linnaeus)) and Jungle cat (Felis Chaus) are schedule–II animals. Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) is protected as Schedule-III animal and Hares and five stripped squirrels are included in schedule IV of Wild Life Protection act 1972...|$|R
