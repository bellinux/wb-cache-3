60|$|Braithwaite came over, and Mr. Murray <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on his {{shoulder}} and one on Benjamin's.|$|E
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> in {{the front}} of his ragged jacket and pointed proudly with the other.|$|E
60|$|He {{followed}} me. <b>Putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> {{heavily on}} my shoulder, he {{forced me to}} face him once more.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan it is {{customary}} to <b>put</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> {{together and}} say [...] "Itadakimasu" [...] (いただきます) ("I humbly receive") before eating a meal.|$|R
5000|$|Leaning {{back on the}} board, <b>putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> {{behind you}} on the ground while {{gripping}} the board between your legs. This is considered [...] "bad form" [...] in the downhill community.|$|R
60|$|With a leer, he <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> {{into his}} outer garment and felt {{around in a}} pocket. Then he felt in his other pockets.|$|E
6000|$|Clarke interposed. [...] "I am impressed, gentlemen, to say: Let {{each of you}} <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on the psychic's head, {{the other}} on her arm." ...|$|E
6000|$|Whereupon John stepped up, <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> round Lucy's waist; {{and as one}} of hers gently {{fell upon}} his shoulder, Mr. Perkins took the other and said,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I-- I guess I'm all right," [...] stammered Dick, <b>putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> to his forehead, where a lump {{was rapidly}} rising. [...] "I got some fall though!" [...] he added, grimly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I didn't mean no harm, Sir,' whimpered Rob, <b>putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> to his throat, and the {{knuckles}} {{of the other}} to his eyes. 'I'll never come again, Sir. I only wanted work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>one</b> <b>puts</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> {{into other}} people's business, they won't come out clean," [...] said the judicious Stemm. [...] "But {{you must go}} on with it now, any way, Sir Thomas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> {{over the}} skipper's mouth fust, and then, finding {{that was no}} good, I put the other. It was no good wasting bad langwidge on 'Arry.|$|E
60|$|A dull, slow flush {{crept into}} the girl's face, and she <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> over the other as they rested on the fence. One looked so much less monstrous than two.|$|E
60|$|Here Mr. Toad <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on {{his stomach}} {{and tried to make}} a very grand bow. Peter Rabbit, hiding behind a near-by tree, almost giggled aloud, he looked so funny.|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (<b>putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on Craven's {{shoulder}} {{and the other}} on Cuthbertson's). Bless you, my children! (Cuthbertson, a little wounded in his dignity, moves away. The Colonel takes the jest in the utmost good humor.) ...|$|R
50|$|Ruku' is bowing {{down in the}} {{standing}} position during daily prayers (salat). The position of ruku' is established by bending over, <b>putting</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> on <b>one's</b> knees, and remaining in that position while also praising Allah and glorifying Him.|$|R
6000|$|Dorriforth. So {{much the}} better {{if there is to}} be no criticism. There is only a dirt prompter's book. <b>One</b> can't <b>put</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> upon it; <b>one</b> doesn't know what one is discussing. There is no [...] "authority"--nothing is ever published.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what a crack!" [...] murmured Jack, {{and then}} {{he sat up and}} stared around him. Pepper was also {{stirring}} and he slowly <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> to the cut on his temple.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my head! Oh, my head!" [...] came, with a groan, and the {{sufferer}} slowly stretched himself. Then he <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> {{up to his}} forehead. [...] "Oh, dear, what a crack I got!" ...|$|E
60|$|She sighed, and <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on his, but {{a gust of}} wind {{took that}} {{opportunity}} of getting under her cloak and sending it fluttering over her back, so that he had to catch it and return it to her grasp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue, Mitcham, or I'll {{pull your}} ears for you," [...] Corporal Skinner said: but {{his speech was}} cut short by Tom's <b>putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on the barrack table, {{vaulting}} across it, and striking Mitcham a heavy blow between the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll fix you for this!" [...] went on Haskett, <b>putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> to his chin, where a lump {{was rising}} rapidly. [...] "I never before allowed anybody to hit me--leastwise a boy." [...] And he rushed at Walter with a fierceness which boded the youth no good.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} used to win burro. One of them, called amago (hint) {{is to place}} your hand {{in the center of}} the table, saying a word other than burro. If a player puts his hand in the center, he will be assigned a letter. However, if no <b>one</b> <b>puts</b> their <b>hand</b> in the center, the letter will be assigned to the player who made the hint. Another technique would be feign <b>putting</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> down.|$|R
60|$|The words {{seemed to}} have a sobering effect on Captain Bayley. The blood seemed to die out of his face; he <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on a chair, as if to steady himself, while he looked fixedly in his nephew's face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{ready for}} her. Can your fine young ladies do this? or you either?' and burning to display her latest accomplishment, Josie {{ran to the}} nearest gate, <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on the top rail, and vaulted over as lightly as a bird.|$|E
60|$|He shuddered violently, {{clenching}} {{his teeth}} and fists hard to keep control. Then he went forward to her. He <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on her shoulder, the fingers of the other hand under her chin to raise her face. A convulsed shiver ran through her, once, twice, at his touch. She kept her head bent.|$|E
60|$|It was as Bertie had said. Scattered {{among the}} rocks were {{a score of}} ingots. They had lost their brilliancy, but shone with a dull copperish hue, with bright gleams here and there where rocks had grated against them. <b>Putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on a block of rock he lifted one of them with the other.|$|R
50|$|A wrestler <b>puts</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> {{under the}} {{opponent}}'s armpit and hold another {{hand over the}} opponent's hand. Wrestlers have to grip both hands from opponents behind and start to wrestle. The purpose is to drop opponent on its back or lift the opponent and drop on the ground. The first one to perform the winning moves three times wins.|$|R
50|$|This method can be {{performed}} with only three first responders. In this case, the chief {{plays the role of}} the first team member; he blocks the pole with his ankle, and <b>puts</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> under the neck, the other one under the back, between the shoulder blades. Only the team member at the hips steps over the stretcher.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice had}} taken the {{peculiar}} flatness of the blind. Maisie pressed herself up into {{a corner of the}} room. Her heart was beating furiously, and she <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on her breast to keep it quiet. Dick was staring directly at her, and she realised {{for the first time that}} he was blind.|$|E
60|$|He {{was only}} {{just in time}} to utter the warning words. He was only {{just in time to}} <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on each side of her slender waist, and hold her tight so, when the big wave which he saw coming struck full tilt against the vessel's flank, and broke in one white {{drenching}} sheet of foam against her stern and quarter-deck.|$|E
60|$|She <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> upon Rachel's shoulder, and stooping, {{picked up}} a pair of walking-shoes with the other, and placed them neatly side by side outside her door. As they walked down the passage they passed many pairs of boots and shoes, some black and some brown, all side by side, and all different, even {{to the way in which}} they lay together.|$|E
50|$|The quarter nelson {{involves}} <b>putting</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> on the opponent's neck, {{passing the}} free arm under {{the arm of}} the opponent, and locking the free arm to the other arm by clasping the wrist. In amateur wrestling a strong quarter nelson can be used to secure a pin, or to control the opponent and advance into a more dominant position.|$|R
5000|$|In birds, {{destruction}} of a clutch by predators (or removal by humans, for example the California condor breeding program) results in double-clutching. The technique is used to double {{the production of a}} species' eggs, in the California condor case, specifically to increase population size. The act of <b>putting</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> in a nest to remove eggs is known as [...] "dipping the clutch".|$|R
5000|$|The Stoessel lute (Stössel-laute) is {{a string}} {{instrument}} invented by Georg Stössel in 1914 in Cologne (Köln), Germany. Its steel strings are fingered not by <b>putting</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> round the neck, {{but over the}} end of it. To this end, most Stössel lutes have very short necks. It is, in effect, a hybrid between a necked string instrument and a zither.|$|R
