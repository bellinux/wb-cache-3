40|$|Abstract. In wood pellet production, {{knowledge}} is needed about {{the raw material}} properties that affect the energy requirements for <b>pelletizing</b> and pellet quality. This study presents novel methods for this purpose, including analyses of influence of the raw material properties on the energy requirements in the sequence of subprocesses (compression, flow, and friction components) that constitute the <b>pelletizing</b> process, {{and the strength of}} the pellets. The methods were used to analyze the importance of <b>pelletizing</b> temperature and MC and the differences between sawdust of European beech (Fagus sylvática L) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L). Results showed that increasing temperature and MC decreased the energy requirements for all components of the <b>pelletizing</b> process and that beech required more energy than pine in all components. Beech produced the stronger pellets; increasing temperature resulted in stronger pellets, whereas increasing MC caused weaker pellets. Also, a method to quantify the energy require-ments for the combined <b>pelletizing</b> process is presented. The methods can be used to analyze the allocation of the energy requirements of <b>pelletizing</b> in the die and can be useful tools for analyzing the <b>pelletizing</b> properties of wood and other biomass residues...|$|R

40|$|A <b>pelletizing</b> {{machine for}} the {{production}} of fish feed was designed and developed. It consists of a hopper, barrel which houses the screw conveyor (auger), the cutting knife and the die orifice. The machine is driven by a 2 kW, 1420 rpm single phase electric motor. The performance evaluation of the machine was carried out. The aim was to investigate the effects of moisture contents and the speed of operation on the performance of the machine. It was observed that the <b>pelletizing</b> efficiency, throughput capacity and the percentage recovery of the machine increased with the increase in moisture content and the speed of the machine. The machine showed higher throughput capacity of 19. 7 kg/h with maximum <b>pelletizing</b> efficiency of 87. 6 %. Moisture content constituted a greater portion of variability in efficiency than speed. A unit increase in moisture content resulted in an increase of about 20 % in pelleting efficiency whereas a corresponding unit increase in speed only increased the <b>pelletizing</b> efficiency by 3 %. The machine does not make use of steam thereby making it easier to operate. The adoption of the <b>pelletizing</b> machine by small and medium scale farmers {{would go a long way}} in helping them to produce their own feed with local contents thereby alleviating the problems associated with the sourcing of imported feeds...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of binders for {{iron ore}} <b>pelletizing</b> is {{required}} to: (a) increase the pellet strength before heating – green strength; (b) prevent {{the collapse of}} the pellets during firing, when the gases generated by water vaporization could cause cracks. Bentonite is the main binder used in industry, and its binding mechanism in iron ore pellets has been widely studied and understood. Efforts to solve the problems of using bentonite in iron ore <b>pelletizing</b> have focused on the employment of organic binders the composition of which presents dispersant properties. This review critically evaluates the current understanding of the influence of dispersants on the quality of iron ore pellets, by means of their action on the colloidal and rheological properties of iron ore ultrafine particles.
