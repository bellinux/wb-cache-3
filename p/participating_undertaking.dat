40|$|We {{read the}} work by Pringle at al. [1] with interest. One {{of the holy}} grails of Paediatric Emergency Medicine has been the rapid and {{reliable}} identification of the child with serious dehydration, and the converse, the ability {{to know when to}} safely discharge a child with a history of gastroenteritis. Recently there has been an external validation of a previously derived clinical dehydration scale by Bailey et al. [2]. It is encouraging to see this type of study as too often scoring systems are created without further testing. However we wondered about the generalisability of this result to routine Pediatric Emergency Care. Specifically we noted that in that study <b>participating</b> nurses <b>undertook</b> an additional training programme prior to study commencement. Is the score still valid if used by Pediatric Emergency Care staff who have not had this additional training? Our previous work has shown that experience and training in assessment may be vital in correctly assigning dehydration categories in children [3]. We found significant variability between junior doctors' assessments of dehydration compared to their seniors. We concluded previous studies on dehydration scoring systems may have benefited from well-trained staff and the introduction of these systems to naive health care professionals may not replicate initial results. The Pringle et al. study, while containing {{only a small number of}} subjects, challenges this conclusion again as it appears the care setting may influence the utility of the tool.

40|$|The Combinational Method, as a Combinational Creative Approach (CCA) of {{language}} teaching, introduces a new content to the presuppositions of “illustrating”, “ language textbooks” and “language teaching”, placing {{them on the}} base of the factors of creativity and art. The basic principle of this approach is that illustration, as the main representative of arts and as a meditative (with specific targets), overt, kinetic and emerging process, in which the pupil actively <b>participates</b> and <b>undertakes</b> a fundamental role in the presentation and performance of teaching. Ths effort is founded on the “combinational and creative spirit” and has as its strategic targets the creative learning and expression, the cultivation of aesthetics and the multi-lateral development of the student, through a process which fignts all ritualistic formalism, leaving the pupil’s and teacher’s creative powers, free. This Method, giving emphasis on the prototype, considers the open communication between the different forms of art (“multi-artistic expression”) and the various scientific fields, interscientific, as an essential presupposition, using the cultural component as a connective factor, which therefore, becomes the basic carrier of the educational system, giving the possibility to national and universal culture and art to rise to prominence {{and at the same time}} to make the creative man rise to prominence, too, at a personal and team level. For the support of this Method, findings of relevant international research and the PhD holder’s specific research findings were used regarding the main forms of illustrative expression (contemporary and diachronic research in two different research methods).

40|$|Abstract. Adoption of {{structured}} reuse {{approaches in}} practice often poses multiple challenges. Research-industry collaborations are consid-ered as suitable vehicle to mitigate adoption difficulties {{as well as}} to vali-date the applicability of scientific results. However, research cooperations with industry do not always live up to the expectations of either of the partners. Unfortunately for researchers and practitioners alike, insights behind the scenes of failed adoption and cooperation are often difficult to obtain. This hinders discussions on lessons learned by organizations during the adoption process and delays improvements. This paper aims to mitigate this issue by presenting lessons learned from interviews we conducted with practitioners {{in the context of a}} study on software reuse in industry. The study covered a wide range of aspects, including the process of reuse adoption. One of the <b>participating</b> compa-nies had <b>undertaken</b> two attempts to adopt a form of structured reuse.

The aim of this research project was to investigate whether there is a link between purposeful movement within mathematics and an increase in overall student engagement. This was investigated from the perspectives of both the participating teacher and her class of Grade 1 students.

In the present study, we examined the neural correlates underlying theory of mind (ToM) and empathy and the relationships between these two social cognitive abilities with schizotypy. Fifty-six first-year college students (31 males, 25 females) between 17 and 21 years of age (M = 19. 3, SD = 0. 9) from a medical university in China <b>participated.</b> All participants <b>undertook</b> a comic strips functional imaging task that specifically examined both empathy and ToM. In addition, they completed two self-report scales: the Chapman Psychosis Proneness scale and the Interpersonal Responsivity Index (IRI). Results showed that both empathy and ToM conditions of the task were associated with brain activity in the middle temporal gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the precuneus and the posterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, we found positive correlations between negative schizotypy and brain activity in regions involved in social cognition, namely, the middle temporal gyrus, the TPJ, {{as well as the}} medial prefrontal gyrus. These findings highlight that different dimensions of schizotypy may show different associations with brain regions involved in social cognitive abilities.

40|$|Background: A {{significant}} proportion of procured deceased donor kidneys are subsequently discarded. The UK Kidney Fast-Track Scheme (KFTS) was introduced in 2012, enabling kidneys at risk of discard to be simultaneously offered to <b>participating</b> centres. We <b>undertook</b> an analysis of discarded kidneys to determine if unnecessary organ discard was still occurring since the KFTS was introduced. Methods: Between April and June 2015, senior surgeons independently inspected 31 consecutive discarded kidneys from throughout the UK. All kidneys were biopsied. Organs were categorised as usable, possibly usable pending histology, or not usable for implantation. After histology reports were available, final assessments of usability were made. Results: There were 19 donors (six donation after brain death, 13 donation after circulatory death), with a median (range) donor age of 67 (29 - 83) years and Kidney Donor Profile Index of 93 (19 - 100). Reasons for discard were variable. Only three discarded kidneys had not entered the KFTS. After initial assessment post-discard, 11 kidneys were assessed as usable, with nine kidneys thought to be possibly usable. Consideration of histological data {{reduced the number of}} kidneys thought usable to ten (10 / 31; 32 %). Conclusions: The KFTS scheme is successfully identifying organs at high risk of discard, though potentially transplantable organs are still being discarded.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} {{type 2 diabetes}} poses a major public health challenge. Population-based screening and early treatment for type 2 diabetes could reduce this growing burden. However, the benefits of such a strategy remain uncertain. Methods and design The ADDITION-Cambridge study aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and cost-effectiveness of (i) a stepwise screening strategy for type 2 diabetes; and (ii) intensive multifactorial treatment for people with screen-detected diabetes in primary care. 63 practices in the East Anglia region <b>participated.</b> Three <b>undertook</b> the pilot study, 33 were allocated to three groups: no screening (control), screening followed by intensive treatment (IT) and screening plus routine care (RC) in an unbalanced (1 : 3 : 3) randomisation. The remaining 27 practices were randomly allocated to IT and RC. A risk score incorporating routine practice data was used to identify people aged 40 – 69 years at high-risk of undiagnosed diabetes. In the screening practices, high-risk individuals were invited {{to take part in a}} stepwise screening programme. In the IT group, diabetes treatment is optimised through guidelines, target-led multifactorial treatment, audit, feedback, and academic detailing for practice teams, alongside provision of educational materials for newly diagnosed participants. Primary endpoints are modelled cardiovascular risk at one year, and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity at five years after diagnosis of diabetes. Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, development of renal and visual impairment, peripheral neuropathy, health service costs, self-reported quality of life, functional status and health utility. Impact of the screening programme at the population level is also assessed through measures of mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, health status and health service use among high-risk individuals. Discussion ADDITION-Cambridge is conducted in a defined high-risk group accessible through primary care. It addresses the feasibility of population-based screening for diabetes, as well as the benefits and costs of screening and intensive multifactorial treatment early in the disease trajectory. The intensive treatment algorithm is based on evidence from studies including individuals with clinically diagnosed diabetes and the education materials are informed by psychological theory. ADDITION-Cambridge will provide timely evidence concerning the benefits of early intensive treatment and will inform policy decisions concerning screening for type 2 diabetes.

40|$|This paper focusses {{on young}} women working as peer {{educators}} through the charity Home-Start {{in the north}} of England. The paper is conceptual whilst incorporating findings from a small-scale empirical study undertaken in 2016. It holds relevance to the following SCUTREA conference themes: active citizenship; families and communities; formal and informal learning; social inclusion in times of austerity. The peer educators who <b>participated</b> are <b>undertaking</b> their work in a context where educational achievement is increasingly measured by certification {{and at a time when}} occupational hierarchies have been ‘professionalised’ whilst notions of what it is to be a professional have been drained of meaning in ways which can be seen as potentially democratising. State educational imperatives in the UK have focussed on academic excellence (for ‘the gifted few’) and the promotion of vocational opportunities (intended for those from ‘hard working families’) such as ‘apprenticeships’. Deeper and more critical understandings of learning, commitment and achievement are generally unrecognised and largely not valued by the state, remaining in the relatively invisible domain of third sector organisations, and at the level of community activism. Our conception of peer education is based on a democratic ethos which does not privilege the peer educator and which does not set the role in contradistinction to work undertaken by ‘high quality educated professionals’. We see the peer educator as generally similar to the individuals with whom and the groups with which they are working. They are likely to share characteristics including some (but not all) of the following: age, gender, ethnicity, social class, educational attainment, parental status, and specific social categories which may be applicable in relation to sexual orientation, and the use of alcohol and substances. The peer educators who participated in this study have worked together in circumstances that lead to mutual benefits which stand largely outside the educational mainstream. This paper considers the motivations for involvement as a peer educator, peer educators’ perspectives on the benefits/value of their involvement in this work, the impact of being a peer educator as well as discussing the peer educators’ experiences in relation to their engagements with professionals. The paper is informed by thinking on the power of informal learning, on citizenship and co-production, and by issues relating to recognition and empowerment arising from informal learning through the peer educator role. It briefly considers the potential power of peer education in an age of connectivity through communications technology...|$|R

We therefore investigated whether the V·O 2 attained was influenced by the pacing strategy adopted. Eight male middle-distance runners (age 25. 8 ± 3. 3 years; height 1. 78 ± 0. 10 m; mass 67. 8 ± 4. 7 kg) with a personal best 800 -m time of 112. 0 ± 3. 3 s volunteered to <b>participate.</b> Subjects <b>undertook</b> a speed ramped progressive test to determine V·O 2 max and three 800 -m pace runs to exhaustion all in a randomised order. The three 800 -m pace runs included constant speed, acceleration, and race simulation runs. Oxygen uptake was determined throughout each test using 15 -s Douglas bag collections. Following the application of a 30 -s rolling average, the highest V·O 2 during the progressive test (i. e., V·O 2 max) and the highest V·O 2 during the 800 -m pace runs (i. e., V·O 2 peak) were compared. For the eight runners, V·O 2 max was 67. 2 ± 4. 3 ml · kg- 1 · min- 1. V·O 2 peak was 60. 1 ± 5. 1 ml · kg- 1 · min- 1, 61. 1 ± 5. 2 ml · kg- 1 · min- 1, and 62. 2 ± 4. 9 ml · kg- 1 · min- 1, yielding values of 89. 3 ± 2. 4 %, 90. 8 ± 2. 8 %, and 92. 5 ± 3. 1 % V·O 2 max for the constant speed, acceleration and race simulation runs, respectively. Across runs, repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect (p = 0. 048). Trend analysis identified a significant linear trend (p = 0. 025) with the % V·O 2 max attained being higher for the acceleration run than the constant speed run, and higher still for the race simulation run. These results demonstrate that in middle-distance runners a) pacing strategy influences the V·O 2 attained, with a race simulation run elevating the V·O 2 attained compared with other pacing strategies, and b) regardless of pacing strategy the V·O 2 attained in an 800 -m pace run on a treadmill is less than V·O 2 max...|$|R

Within these groups, 66 % and 43 % of male sex workers had anal intercourse with a female client and non-paying partner respectively. Factors associated with reporting recent heterosexual anal intercourse in bivariate logistic regression after controlling for year of survey participation were being Muslim, ever or currently married, living with wife only, living with a female partner only, living with more than one sexual partner, self-identifying as basha/king/bisexual, having one's own children, and lower education. Conclusions: We found unexpectedly high levels of self-reported anal sex with women by male sex workers, including selling sex to female clients as well as with their own partners. Further investigation among women in Mombasa is needed to understand heterosexual anal sex practices, and how HIV programming may respond...|$|R
40|$|Lithuanian {{scientists}} {{investigating the}} history of science have limited possibilities of publishing personal research papers in scientific journals, and therefore the necessity of publishing a periodical discussing {{the history of}} science has arisen. The article deals with the need and possibilities of issuing a scientific journal of {{the history of science}} in Lithuania. The authors of the article have reviewed the situation of the discussed subject abroad and identified foreign universities and other establishments of higher education conducting researches on the history of science. It should be noticed that foreign institutions pay careful attention to the history of science organizing a number of congresses and conferences for scientists investigating the history of science, publishing a huge amount of journals coping with the main aspects of the history of science, defending dissertations, training postgraduate students, intensively <b>participating</b> in activities <b>undertaken</b> by the associations of science historians. The start of the history of science in Lithuania brings us back to 1950 and the pathfinder of this branch of history is eminent Professor Paulius Slavėnas (1901 – 1991). Within the period of 50 years (1940 – 1990) of Soviet occupation, the Lithuanian scientists of the history of science were suppressed ideologically. Moreover, in the majority of cases, research papers were published in the popular periodicals only. The situation started getting better since 1990 when Lithuania restored national independence. Presently, comparatively many books, monographs and articles focusing on the most famous Lithuanian scientists {{as well as on the}} development of science, technology and other researched fields are released. However, no particular emphasis has been shifted on the journal discussing the major points of the history of science. The authors of the paper have explored the situation on the history of science, the format of research activities and the possibilities of publishing a journal of the history of science in Lithuania. The idea has been widely accepted by Lithuanian and foreign scientists investigating the history of science.     Article in Lithuanian   Autoriai apžvelgia dalį užsienio mokslo įstaigų, kuriose vykdomi mokslo istorijos tyrimai, bei darbų publikavimo, disertacijų gynimo, magistrantūros studijų galimybes.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the capacities of ten to twelve year old students to develop the cognitive capacity of intrapersonal intelligence as defined by Howard Gardner. A group of forty, ten to twelve year old students across three Stage Three New South Wales classrooms were introduced to an Intervention Program specifically designed to foster their self knowledge as learners and their capacities to use this knowledge to develop the knowledge, skills and understandings collectively known as 2 ̆ 7 executive function 2 ̆ 7. The Intervention Program incorporated the theoretical foundations of the Multiple Intelligences perspective of executive function as defined by Moran and Gardner. The students were engaged in self selected learning tasks in the key learning area of English {{with the intention of}} helping them to identify their own relative strengths and relative limitations in this curriculum area. The program included a variety of activities and procedures including those that required students to determine their own learning goals, engage in reflective journaling both during the tasks and {{at the conclusion of the}} tasks and identify, plan and implement their own learning strategies in order to achieve their learning goals in English. The three <b>participating</b> teachers <b>undertook</b> to provide information related to the students 2 ̆ 7 work habits, on task behaviors, self monitoring strategies, the students 2 ̆ 7 capacities to improve their cognitive strategies when working on their self selected tasks and the students 2 ̆ 7 abilities to use these skills, knowledge and understandings to improve their learning outcomes in English. The results obtained evidenced a considerable improvement in the students 2 ̆ 7 intrapersonal intelligence, most especially in the knowledge, skills and understandings identified as 2 ̆ 7 executive function 2 ̆ 7.;The students became increasingly competent in the skills of planning, implementing and self monitoring; identified by Moran and Gardner as the 2 ̆ 7 hill 2 ̆ 7 the 2 ̆ 7 will 2 ̆ 7 and the 2 ̆ 7 skill 2 ̆ 7; in relation to their self selected learning goals in English and began to take increased responsibility for their own learning in English. In this way, they began to exhibit the distinct characteristics of the 2 ̆ 7 apprentice stage 2 ̆ 7 of 2 ̆ 7 executive function 2 ̆ 7 as described by Moran and Gardner. As the result of the findings of this study, there are clear implications that if students are provided with opportunities to develop their intrapersonal intelligence as learners, this improved awareness of 2 ̆ 7 self 2 ̆ 7 as learners can be translated into improved skills in the understandings, knowledge and skills that comprise 2 ̆ 7 executive function 2 ̆ 7 from a Multiple Intelligences perspective and result in improved learning outcomes. This study indicates that if teachers are able to provide students with the opportunities to know themselves better as learners, have some choice in determining the tasks that best suit their learning preferences and determine their own learning strategies, then the impact on students 2 ̆ 7 capacities to 2 ̆ 7 learn how to learn 2 ̆ 7 effectively is positive. The findings of the study also indicate that programs designed to support student learning through improved intrapersonal intelligence also supports teachers 2 ̆ 7 attempts to implement differentiated programs of work effectively in their classrooms and to meet the learning needs of all their students in the context of a rapidly changing twenty first century world and its ever increasing demands on the teaching profession. As a result, programs such as the one designed and implemented in this study may become a valuable part of school practice and curricula...|$|R
