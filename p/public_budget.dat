First part of the thesis is based on the theory of Public finance, Public choice and Political-business cycle.

25|$|Jakob Fugger was {{responsible}} for his family's business in Augsburg, Tyrol, Venice and Rome. Around 1485 the family also founded manufactories in Innsbruck (since 1510 in Hall, since 1539 in Schwaz). Through a small loan he there first {{came into contact with}} Archduke Sigismund, a member of the Habsburg family. The archduke had as the sole owner of the Tyrol property rights handed out permissions for mining operations to private investors which in return had to pay a share of their profits to Sigismund. Despite this income he was constantly short of money owing to a lavish lifestyle, several illegitimate children and his extensive construction projects. A responsibility to pay the amount of 100.000 guilders of war reparations to Venice was eventually financed by Jakob Fugger. In 1488 the total debt already amounted to more than 150.000 guilders. Notable was the form of payment: Instead of paying the Fürst directly the Fugger family paid the money to his creditors as well as providing the wages for the royal court and craftsmen. In 1517 the Fugger family financed more than half of Tyrol's <b>public</b> <b>budget.</b> As a result, they were at times entitled to all the silver and copper out of Tyrol.|$|E

Poincare‟s work {{illustrated}} the first indication of chaotic behavior in a dynamic system. Today, complexity studies extend to vast areas {{in the fields of}} natural and social sciences. These studies uncover information of complex nature through paradigms such as interconnectedness, network, process, self-organization, mutual causality, bifurcation, scattered matrix, emergence, collapse dynamics, and phase shift. In <b>public</b> policy and <b>budgeting,</b> complexity studies are also making their way to observe various complex phenomena, providing information that the traditional Newtonian sciences are not capable of providing. Yet, teaching <b>public</b> <b>budgeting</b> through complexity models still is not widely accepted in most institutions of higher education despite the in-depth and vast information that these models uncover. This is because most institutions of higher learning still are constrained by top-down hierarchal systems that promote control and linear observations. Studying <b>public</b> <b>budgeting</b> falls under such limitation, preventing students from appreciating the complex nature of the discipline. This article addresses the problems and limitations of the current linear methods in teaching <b>public</b> <b>budgeting</b> in most institutions of higher learning.
