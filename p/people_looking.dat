40|$|For many {{applications}} in graphics, design, and human computer interaction, {{it is essential}} to understand where humans look in a scene. This is a challenging task given that no one fully understands how the human visual system works. This thesis explores the way <b>people</b> <b>look</b> at different types of images and provides methods of predicting where they look in new scenes. We describe a new way to model where <b>people</b> <b>look</b> from ground truth eye tracking data using techniques of machine learning that outperforms all existing models, and provide a benchmark data set to quantitatively compare existing and future models. In addition we explore how image resolution affects where <b>people</b> <b>look.</b> Our experiments, models, and large eye tracking data sets should help future researchers better understand and predict where <b>people</b> <b>look</b> in order to create more powerful computational vision systems. by Tilke Judd.

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway and the {{proximity}} of Burgess Hill to Brighton, itself expanding {{as a result of}} the {{arrival of the}} railway led to an influx of professional <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> for places to live. Not far from the station, the common was ripe for development with the result that the Keymer and Clayton portion were enclosed in 1828 and 1855 respectively. Between 1850 and 1880 the area changed from an insignificant rural settlement to a town of 4,500 residents.|$|E

Ownership of public land was considered Roman by right of conquest; for local private real estate, citizens had to pay the Roman stipendium tax.|$|E

25|$|Until Ocean Grove's {{municipal}} authority was folded into Neptune Township in 1981, it boasted {{a set of}} unique laws, including one that made it illegal on Sundays to have cars {{on the streets of}} Ocean Grove. This had a significant effect on the development of a close-knit community. <b>People</b> <b>looking</b> to get away for the weekend typically avoided the Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, too). That meant the visitors were likely to be coming for a week-long visit or more. Most came to attend programs sponsored by the Camp Meeting.|$|E
25|$|As a Google search shows, {{the phrase}} ad orientem is today much more {{commonly}} used to describe a particular orientation of a priest in Christian liturgy, facing the apse or wall behind the altar, with priest and <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> in the same direction, {{as opposed to the}} versus populum orientation, in which the priest faces the congregation. In this use, the phrase is not necessarily related to the geographical direction in which the priest is looking and is employed even if he is not facing to the east or even has his back to the east.|$|E

IKEA Croydon, when {{it was built in}} 1992, brought many non-skilled jobs to Croydon. The store, which is a total size of 23,000 m2, took over the former site of Croydon Power station, which had led to the unemployment of many skilled workers. In May 2006, the extension of the IKEA made it the fifth biggest employer in Croydon, and includes the extension of the showroom, market hall and self-serve areas.|$|E

25|$|The UK was {{a primary}} {{destination}} for Caribbean <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> to emigrate {{as early as}} the 1950s. Because of this, Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is lovers rock, but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like drum and bass and dubstep. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the world's most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist Maxi Priest began his career with seminal British sound system Saxon Studio International.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on May 22, 2008, five-days of festivities {{celebrated the}} 125th {{anniversary of the}} bridge's opening. The events kicked-off with a live {{performance}} of the Brooklyn Philharmonic in Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park, followed by special lighting of the bridge's towers and a fireworks display. Other events held during the 125th anniversary celebrations, which coincided with the Memorial Day weekend, included a film series, historical walking tours, information tents, a series of lectures and readings, a bicycle tour of Brooklyn, a miniature golf course featuring Brooklyn icons, and other musical and dance performances. Just before the anniversary celebrations, artist Paul St George installed the Telectroscope, a video link between New York and London, on the Brooklyn side of the bridge. The installation lasted {{for a few weeks}} and permitted viewers in New York to see <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> into a matching telectroscope near London's Tower Bridge. A newly renovated pedestrian connection to the DUMBO neighborhood was also unveiled before the anniversary celebrations.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the criticism of social media driving eating disorders, platforms such as Instagram, have banned the use of ‘thinspiration’ and ‘thinspo’ related hashtags. Other solutions include transformation photos, {{and the promotion of}}  hashtags such as #SelfLove and #BodyPositivity'. Transformation photos are side-by-side images displaying an individual’s fitness or weight-loss progress. Although, it aims to “serve as inspiration for <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> to change themselves physically or live healthier lives”, some users have utilised this technique to showcase the level of deceptiveness within social media. Likewise, in an effort to actively help those suffering from eating disorders, Eating Disorder Hope launched the Pro-Recovery Movement. The project involved hosting of live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters. Other organizations such as ProjectHEAL, introduced a campaign called #WhatMakesMeBeautiful, with the aim of celebrating different talents, personalities, and other non-appearance related attributes that also make one beautiful. This movement was especially successful among the eating disorder community; hence, emphasising the “need for social media movements that celebrate self-love and looking at beauty through a different lens”.|$|E

25|$|The main {{components}} of LGBT tourism is for destinations, accommodations and travel services wishing to attract LGBT tourists; <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> {{to travel to}} LGBT-friendly destinations; people wanting travel with other LGBT people when traveling regardless of the destination and LGBT travelers who are mainly concerned with cultural and safety issues. The slang term gaycation has come to imply a version of a vacation that includes a pronounced aspect of LGBT culture, either in the journey or destination. The LGBT tourism industry includes destinations (tourism offices and CVBs), travel agents, accommodations and hotel groups, tour companies, cruise lines and travel advertising and promotions companies who market these destinations to the gay community. Coinciding with the increased visibility of LGBT people raising children in the 1990s, an increase in family-friendly LGBT tourism has emerged in the 2000s, for instance R Family Vacations which includes activities and entertainment geared towards couples including same-sex weddings. R Family's first cruise was held aboard Norwegian Cruise Lines's Norwegian Dawn with 1600 passengers including 600 children.|$|E
