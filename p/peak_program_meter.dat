This paper and its companion paper introduce the Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation (<b>PEAK)</b> <b>program,</b> an educational program designed to promote physical therapists' integration of research evidence into clinical decision-making. This, second of two, papers reports a mixed methods feasibility study of the <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> among physical therapists at three university-based clinical facilities. Methods. A convenience sample of 18 physical therapists participated in the six-month educational program. Mixed methods were used to triangulate results from pre-post quantitative data analyzed concurrently with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Feasibility {{of the program was}} assessed by evaluating change in participants' attitudes, self-efficacy, knowledge, skills, and self-reported behaviors in addition to their perceptions and reaction to the program. Results: All 18 therapists completed the program. The group experienced statistically significant improvements in evidence based practice self-efficacy and self-reported behavior (p < 0. 001). Four themes were supported by integrated quantitative and qualitative results: 1. The collaborative nature of the <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> was engaging and motivating; 2. PEAK participants experienced improved self-efficacy, creating a positive cycle where success reinforces engagement with research evidence; 3. Participants' need to understand how to interpret statistics was not fully met; 4. Participants believed that the utilization of research evidence in their clinical practice would lead to better patient outcomes. Conclusions: The <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> is a feasible educational program for promoting physical therapists' use of research evidence in practice.

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} {{theoretically}} grounded and evidence-based interventions that enhance the use of research evidence in physical therapist practice. This paper and its companion paper introduce the Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation (<b>PEAK)</b> <b>program,</b> an educational program designed to promote physical therapists' integration of research evidence into clinical decision-making. The pedagogical foundations for the <b>PEAK</b> educational <b>program</b> include Albert Bandura's social cognitive theory and Malcolm Knowles's adult learning theory. Additionally, two complementary frameworks of knowledge translation, the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) and Knowledge to Action (KTA) Cycle, were used to inform the organizational elements of the program. Finally, the program design was influenced by evidence from previous attempts to facilitate the use of research in practice at the individual and organizational levels. Discussion. The 6 -month <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> consisted of four consecutive and interdependent components. First, leadership support was secured and electronic resources were acquired and distributed to participants. Next, a two-day training workshop consisting of didactic and small group activities was conducted that addressed the five steps of evidence based practice. For five months following the workshop, participants worked in small groups to review and synthesize literature around a group-selected area of common clinical interest. Each group contributed to the generation of a "Best Practices List" - a list of locally generated, evidence-based, actionable behaviors relevant to the groups' clinical practice. Ultimately, participants agreed to implement the Best Practices List in their clinical practice. Summary. This, first of two companion papers, describes the underlying pedagogical theories, knowledge translation frameworks, and research evidence used to derive the <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> - an educational program designed to promote the use of research evidence to inform physical therapist practice. The four components of the program are described in detail. The companion paper reports the results of a mixed methods feasibility analysis of this complex educational intervention. © 2014 Tilson and Mickan; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Background: Evidence {{is needed}} to develop {{effective}} educational programs for promoting evidence based practice (EBP) and knowledge translation (KT) in physical therapy. This study reports long-term outcomes from a feasibility assessment of an educational program designed to promote the integration of research evidence into physical therapist practice. Methods: Eighteen physical therapists participated in the 6 -month Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation (<b>PEAK)</b> <b>program.</b> The participant-driven active learning program consisted of four consecutive, interdependent components: 1) acquiring managerial leadership support and electronic resources in three clinical practices, 2) a 2 -day learner-centered EBP training workshop, 3) 5 months of guided small group work synthesizing research evidence into a locally relevant list of, actionable, evidence-based clinical behaviors for therapists treating persons with musculoskeletal lumbar conditions [...] the Best Practices List, and 4) review and revision of the Best Practices List, culminating in participant agreement to implement the behaviors in practice. Therapists’ EBP learning was assessed with standardized measures of EBP-related attitudes, self-efficacy, knowledge and skills, and self-reported behavior at baseline, immediately-post, and 6 months following conclusion of the program (long-term follow-up). Therapist adherence to the Best Practice List {{before and after the}} <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> was assessed through chart review. Results: Sixteen therapists completed the long-term follow-up assessment. EBP self-efficacy and self-reported behaviors increased from baseline to long-term follow-up (p[*]<[*] 0. 001 and p[*]=[*] 0. 002, respectively). EBP-related knowledge and skills showed a trend for improvement from baseline to long-term follow-up (p[*]=[*] 0. 05) and a significant increase from immediate-post to long-term follow-up (p[*]=[*] 0. 02). Positive attitudes at baseline were sustained throughout (p[*]=[*] 0. 208). Eighty-nine charts were analyzed for therapist adherence to the Best Practices List. Six clinical behaviors had sufficient pre- and post-PEAK charts to justify analysis. Of those, one behavior showed a statistically significant increase in adherence, one had high pre- and post-PEAK adherence, and four were change resistant, starting with low adherence and showing no meaningful improvement. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility of the <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> to produce long-term improvements in physical therapists’ EBP-related self-efficacy and self-reported behavior. EBP knowledge and skills showed improvement from post-intervention to long-term follow-up and a trend toward long-term improvements. However, chart review of therapists’ adherence to the participant generated Best Practices List in day-to-day patient care indicates a need for additional support to facilitate behavior change. Future versions of the <b>PEAK</b> <b>program</b> and comparable multi-faceted EBP and KT educational programs should provide ongoing monitoring, feedback, and problem-solving to successfully promote behavior change for knowledge translation.

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent surge of {{interest}} from the renewable energy industry and environmental groups in net metering. The reason for this interest is that net metering is a simple, low-cost, and easily administered method to encourage direct customer investment in renewable energy technologies. The renewable energy industry supports net metering because it removes an economic disincentive for potential customers by increasing {{the value of the}} electricity generated by renewable energy technologies. Environmental groups support net metering because it promotes clean energy production. The concept of net <b>metering</b> <b>programs</b> is to allow the electric meters of customers with generating facilities to turn backwards when their generators are producing more energy than the customers` demand. Net metering allows customers to use their generation to offset their consumption over the entire billing period, not just instantaneously. This offset would enable customers with generating facilities to receive retail prices for more of the electricity they generate. Without a net <b>metering</b> <b>program,</b> utilities usually install a second meter to measure any electricity that flows back to the utility grid and purchase it at a rate that is much lower than the retail prices. There are various net <b>metering</b> <b>programs</b> in the country. Most are available to customer-owned small generating facilities only, some further restrict the eligibility to renewable energy technologies. This Topical Issues Brief discusses how these net <b>metering</b> <b>programs</b> have been implemented by different utilities an states, what the rationales are behind may net <b>metering</b> <b>programs,</b> and what the potential impact of net metering may be on the deployment of renewable energy technologies...|$|R
