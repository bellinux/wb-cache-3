5000|$|The first mutagens to be {{identified}} were carcinogens, substances that were shown {{to be linked to}} cancer. Tumors were described more than 2,000 years before the discovery of chromosomes and DNA; in 500 B.C., the Greek physician Hippocrates named tumors resembling a crab karkinos (from which the word [...] "cancer" [...] is derived via Latin), meaning crab. [...] In 1567, Swiss physician Paracelsus suggested that an unidentified substance in mined ore (identified as radon gas in modern times) caused a wasting disease in miners, and in England, in 1761, John Hill made the first direct link of cancer to chemical substances by noting that excessive use of snuff may cause nasal cancer. In 1775, Sir Percivall Pott wrote a paper on the high incidence of scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps, and suggested chimney soot as the cause of scrotal cancer. In 1915, Yamagawa and Ichikawa showed that repeated application of coal tar to rabbit's ears produced malignant cancer. Subsequently, in the 1930s the carcinogen component in coal tar was identified as a <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (PAH), benzoapyrene. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are also present in soot, which was suggested to be a causative agent of cancer over 150 years earlier.|$|E

40|$|A multivariate {{approach}} {{was used to}} evaluate the significance of synthetic oil-induced perturbations in the functional activity of sediment microbial communities. Total viable cell densities, ATP-biomass, alkaline phosphatase and dehydrogenase activity, and mineralization rates of glucose, protein, oleic acid, starch, naphthalene, and phenanthrene were monitored on a periodic basis in microcosms and experimental ponds for 11 months, both before and after exposure to synthetic oil. All variables contributed to significant discrimination between sediment microbial responses in control communities and communities exposed to a gradient of synthetic oil contamination. At high synthetic oil concentrations (4, 000 ml/ 12 m 3), a transient reduction in sediment ATP concentrations and increased rates of oleic acid mineralization were demonstrated within 1 week of exposure. These transient effects were followed within 1 month by a significant increase in rates of naphthalene and phenanthrene mineralization. After initial construction, both control and synthetic oil-exposed microbial communities demonstrated wide variability in community activity. All experimental microbial communities approached equilibrium and demonstrated good replication. However, synthetic oil perturbation was demonstrated by wide transient variability in community activity. This variability was primarily the result of the stimulation of <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mineralization rates.
