40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the reasons for the}} increasing use of <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrate</b> in Canada, we undertook a 4 -month study of <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrate</b> transfusion in six eastern Ontario hospitals in 1985. A total of 4801 units of <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrate</b> were transfused on 687 occasions to 303 patients; the average number of transfusions per patient was 2. 3, the average number of units per transfusion 7. 0 and the average number of units per patient 15. 8. The cardiovascular service used the largest proportion of units (28 %), aortocoronary bypass grafting being the most common procedure. The mean pretransfusion platelet count for the medical and oncology services was about 30. 0 X 10 (9) /L, compared with 155. 5 X 10 (9) /L for the cardiovascular service.

The number of white cells in the <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> is crucial to cytokine generation. Methods: This study was performed to determine whether WBC reduction in <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> by prestorage leukodepletion filters or inactivation by gamma radiation reduced the levels of these cytokines during storage for 3 days.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{clinical}} use of autologous <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> (also known as platelet-rich plasma) {{on the field}} of regenerative therapy, in the last decade {{has been the subject of}} several studies especially in equine medicine and surgery. The objectives of this study was: 1) to describe and compare the cellular population in whole blood, lower fraction (A) and upper fraction (B) of <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates,</b> 2) to measure and compare the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1) concentration in plasma and both <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> after be activated with calcium gluconate or batroxobin plus calcium gluconate and, 3) to determine correlations between cell counts in <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> and concentrations of TGF-β 1. Blood samples were taken from 16 dogs for complete blood count, plasma collection and <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> preparation. The <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> (PC) were arbitrarily divided into two fractions, specifically, PC-A (lower fraction) and PC-B (upper fraction). The <b>Platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> were analyzed by hemogram. After activated with calcium gluconate or batroxobin plus calcium gluconate, TGF-β 1 concentration was determined in supernatants of <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> and plasma. Results There were differences statistically significant (P[*] 1 concentration between whole blood, plasma and both <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates.</b> A significant correlation was found between the number of platelets in both <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> and TGF-β 1 concentration. Platelet collection efficiency was 46. 34 % and 28. 16 % for PC-A and PC-B, respectively. TGF-β 1 concentration efficiency for PC activated with calcium gluconate was 47. 75 % and 31. 77 %, for PC-A and PC-B, respectively. PC activated with batroxobin plus CG showed 46. 87 % and 32. 24 % for PC-A and PC-B, respectively.

The viability of T. cruzi after photochemical inactivation was determined by their ability to replicate in 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Controls, including treatment with 150 μM amotosalen or 3 J/cm 2 UVA alone, did not lead to reduction of the viability of T. cruzi in plasma or <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates.</b> However, treatment with 150 μM amotosalen plus 3 J/cm 2 UVA inactivated T. cruzi to undetectable levels in plasma and <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates.</b> This represented a > 5. 4 -log reduction of T. cruzi in <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> and > 5. 0 -log reduction of T. cruzi in plasma.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Different {{methods of}} {{platelet}} concentrate preparations leave behind {{certain number of}} residual leukocytes, accounting {{for most of the}} febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, especially in multitransfused patients. Various inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), and IL- 6 are generated during storage and have been implicated for these adverse effects. We have studied the levels of these cytokines and their correlation with leucocyte contents in <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> prepared by three different methods. Study Design and Methods: Five pools of platelet rich plasma <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> (PRP-PC) and buffy-coat <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> (BC-PC) each were prepared and divided into two halves. One half of the pool was leucofiltered (LF), whereas the other half was stored as such. Ten apheresis units were also included in the study. All the <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> were assessed for leucocyte load and cytokine content (IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and TNF-α) on different days of storage (0, 3, and 5) using Nageotte chamber and commercially available immunoassays respectively. Results: There was a statistically significant rise in cytokine levels (IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and TNF-α) in nonleucofiltered (NLF) random donor <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> (RDPs) (PRP-PC and BC-PC) during storage (day 3 and 5) whereas LF RDP concentrates (PRP-PC and BC-PC) and apheresis <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> (AP-PC) did not show any significant rise in cytokine levels (on day 3 and 5) over the baseline values at day 0. Conclusion: This data suggests that although AP-PCs are superior to PRP-PC (NLF) and BC-PC (NLF) in terms of in vitro quality control parameters and cytokine generation during storage, BC-PC mode of platelet preparation followed by leucofiltration is the best method to store platelets and minimise the cytokine accumulation. This strategy is best suited for transfusion in multitransfused hematooncologic patients, who cannot afford single donor apheresis platelets...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} are {{promising}} candidates in regenerative cell therapy. Conventional culture methods involve the use of animal substances, specifically fetal bovine serum as growth supplement. Since the use of animal-derived products is undesirable for human applications, platelet lysates produced from human platelets are an attractive alternative. This is especially true if platelet lysates from already approved transfusion units at blood banks can be utilized. The {{purpose of this study}} was to produce human platelet lysates from expired, blood bank-approved <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> and evaluate their use as growth supplement in the culture of mesenchymal stem cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were cultured with one of three culture supplements; fetal bovine serum, lysates from freshly prepared human <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates,</b> or lysates from expired human <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates.</b> The effects of these platelet-derived culture supplements on basic mesenchymal stem cell characteristics were evaluated. All cultures maintained the typical mesenchymal stem cell surface marker expression, trilineage differentiation potential, and the ability to suppress in vitro immune responses. However, mesenchymal stem cells supplemented with platelet lysates proliferated faster than traditionally cultured cells and increased the expression of the osteogenic marker gene RUNX- 2; yet no difference between the use of fresh and expired <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> was observed. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that human platelet lysates produced from expired <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> can be used as an alternative to fetal bovine serum for mesenchymal stem cell culture to the same extent as lysates from fresh platelets...|$|E
30|$|Here, it {{is worth}} {{discussing}} which functional states of platelets {{are expected to be}} maintained during storage for subsequent preparation of <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> (to be used for regenerative therapy).

Nevertheless, given that <b>platelet</b> <b>concentrates</b> are expected to provide significant amounts of growth factors and fibrin(ogen) at implantation sites, stored platelets are not necessarily expected to function as fully as fresh ones (e.g., in terms of aggregation). Rather, stored platelets are expected not to lose growth factors during the storage period, while coagulation factors, especially those involved in the endogenous coagulation cascade, should maintain their activities to convert and polymerize fibrinogen to form well cross-linked fibrin fibers.|$|E
