Despite the fact that the somatic follow-on effects are primarily emphasized, this master’s thesis establishes that the COPD patient also endures psychological difficulties caused by the disease. Based on four interviews focusing on gaining increased knowledge about life with COPD, three themes were identified as psychological difficulties; death as a new condition and a <b>pending</b> risk, <b>loss</b> of social relations – often caused by the patient him/her-self, and finally an altered relation to one’s self, comprising the breach in the building of identity caused by COPD. As the COPD patient’s own experience of self is considered of central significance, the pheno-menological method was used. Hereby it has been possible to approach the phenomenon psychological difficulties from a COPD patient’s perspective. Furthermore, the theoretical frame of understanding has been constituted by the existential psychology in explanation of COPD patients’ psychological difficulties. The direction is built on an understanding of the existence as being complicated and seeks an analysis of conditions, which applies to every being’s situation...|$|R
5000|$|Wilpon {{was one of}} {{the investors}} who {{invested}} a significant amount of money with Bernard Madoff which was lost when the Ponzi scheme collapsed in December 2008. It was reported that Wilpon had [...] "lost" [...] about $700 million because of Madoff, which has led to speculation that he may be forced to sell the team. Since then Wilpon has said that his losses were [...] "substantially less" [...] than that figure. Reports later surfaced that Wilpon and his family actually made about $300 million with Madoff and had not lost money as previously reported. [...] As a result, in December 2010, Wilpon was named in a lawsuit filed by Irving Picard on behalf of the victims of Madoff's investment scandal and on January 28, 2011 Wilpon issued a statement seeking “one or more strategic partners” interested in buying 20 to 25% interest in the Mets to offset <b>pending</b> <b>losses</b> due to litigation (which may total up to $1 billion). Wilpon and his partner and brother-in-law Saul Katz were involved in another Ponzi scheme which was orchestrated by Samuel Israel III and they were forced to pay $13 million to investors when Israel's hedge fund collapsed. It was revealed that Wilpon utilized Madoff in running the Mets' finances. It became a common practice to negotiate deferred money into players' contracts and then put that money with Madoff to invest because they were able to make money for themselves before paying players. The lawsuit also contends that Madoff funds were used to cover team expenses such as payroll and its minor league club in Brooklyn, as well as financing the creation of the cable network SportsNet New York and Citi Field. In an interview while in prison, Madoff claimed that Wilpon [...] "knew nothing" [...] about his Ponzi scheme. After it was reported that Major League Baseball loaned the Mets $25 million in November 2010 to shore up their finances, Wilpon is now willing to sell up to a 49% ownership stake of the team at a cost of $200 million. On May 26, 2011, it was reported that Wilpon has agreed to sell a minority share of the Mets to David Einhorn, president of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, but ended negotiations on September 1. After the Mets received a $40 million loan from Bank of America in November 2011, Major League Baseball is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared {{to take control of the}} team from Wilpon if he defaults on the loan. The trustee to the Madoff trust, Irving H. Picard, had declared that the Wilpons had enriched themselves over many years of profitable investing with Mr. Madoff while ignoring repeated warnings that he might have been a fraud. On March 19, 2012, Wilpon agreed to settle Picard's lawsuit for $162 million.|$|R

40|$|Exposing {{the health}} {{benefits}} from walnut consumption comes from {{an appreciation of the}} walnut as a plant food, with a nutrient content reflecting its own biology. Walnuts have a unique and intriguing nutritional composition. Like all nuts, {{a large proportion of the}} walnut is fat, (69 %) but 49 % is polyunsaturated and 6 % is omega 3 in the form of α linolenic acid. The benefits of reducing dietary saturated fat in favour of unsaturated fats have been known for some time and are linked to reductions in risk factors of coronary heart disease, and possibly also type 2 diabetes, by influencing insulin action. Our research has shown that including 30 g/day walnuts in a low fat diet (30 % energy from fat) produced favourable shifts in cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes. In a 12 -month trial we have also shown a place for walnuts in weight management, with outcomes <b>pending</b> publication. Weight <b>loss</b> and cholesterol change are ‘whole of diet’ effects, but walnuts were shown to substantially influence the dietary fat profile which in turn affects outcomes. Walnuts contain other nutritional attributes in the form of vitamins (walnuts have exceptionally high levels of tocopherol, a form of Vitamin E) and compounds with potent anti-oxidant activity, such as melatonin. The consumption of walnuts has been shown to increase the anti-oxidant capacity of blood which may afford a further protection against disease elements. Describing the benefits of walnut consumption means focusing on the whole food, with all its synergistic attributes, and distilling the effects in the context of a whole diet. From a range of research perspectives, walnuts have proven to be a nutritionally valuable food...|$|R

50|$|Hansen {{competed in}} the American Wrestling Association (AWA) from 1985 to 1986. He won the World Heavyweight Championship on December 29, 1985, from Rick Martel. On June 29, 1986, he no-showed a title defense against the number one {{contender}} Nick Bockwinkel due to disagreements with management, forcing the AWA to default the title to Bockwinkel. Rumors suggest that Hansen was actually in the building that evening and had been informed by AWA promoter Verne Gagne of the <b>pending</b> <b>loss</b> to Bockwinkel. Hansen allegedly called All Japan Pro Wrestling president Giant Baba to ask if losing the championship was acceptable, but Baba had already lined up challengers for Hansen and did not permit Hansen to drop the championship. In the end, Hansen refused to drop the title to Bockwinkel and was stripped of the championship; Bockwinkel was given one of the tag team belts, which was then billed as the AWA World Heavyweight Championship due to Hansen still possessing the true title belt. Hansen immediately returned to Japan and defended the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, despite being stripped of it. The AWA threatened legal action if Hansen continued to carry the belt and refer to himself as the organization's champion, so Hansen responded by running over the belt with his truck and mailing it back with the mud tracks still on it. This chain of events was reviewed {{in an interview with}} Hansen at an NWA Legends convention, in which he expressed regret over the way he handled the situation and ultimately complimented Gagne.|$|E

Radar track data surrounding 497 CA’s were examined and from these we extracted information as to whether the alert was true or false, whether a trajectory change was (response) or was not (non-response) evident, whether a loss of separation occurred, and the controller response time to the CA. Results revealed an overall 47 % false alert rate, but that increases in this rate across facilities was not associated with more non-responses or delayed responses to true alerts, or loss-of-separation. Cry-wolf appeared to be absent. Instead, desirable anticipatory behavior indicated that controllers often responded prior to the conflict alerts...|$|E
40|$|Methyl bromide-dependent {{plasticulture}} {{production of}} strawberries {{is an important}} component of income for small to midsize farms in North Carolina. This system consists of plastic mulch, drip fertigation, and soil pest-management treatment. This system is like a three-legged stool and the phase out of a major soil pest-management treatment, namely methyl bromide (MB), threatens the current profitability of strawberry enterprises. MB {{is an integral part of}} the small-scale farmer’s plasticulture tool box for growing profitable crops of strawberries (Poling and Monks, 1994). The expected economic impact is difficult to measure because there is no simple exchange of an alternative compound for methyl bromide. Changes in cultural systems or using alternative fumigants will require changes in management practices and scheduling of activities. Likewise, adopting alternative practices may impact pest populations and result in a shift of predominant or important pathogens, insects, or weeds. In 1997 we initiated four field trials in different regions of NC (Coastal, Piedmont, Mountains) to explore alternative products or alternative farming systems to minimize risk of decreased profits with the <b>pending</b> <b>loss</b> of methyl bromide as a soil fumigant (Louws et al., 1998 a, 1998 b).

40|$|Reward {{anticipation}} during {{learning is}} known to support memory formation but its role on processes engaged {{at the time of}} retrieval is so far unclear. Retrieval orientations, as a reflection of strategic or controlled retrieval processing, are one aspect of retrieval that might be modulated by reward. These processes can be measured using event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by retrieval cues from tasks with different retrieval requirements, such as changes in the class of targeted memory information. To determine whether retrieval orientations of this kind are modulated by reward during learning, the effect of high and low reward expectancy on ERP correlates of retrieval orientation was investigated in two separate experiments. In Experiment 1 reward manipulation at study was associated with later memory performance, whereas in Experiment 2, reward was directly linked to accuracy in a study task. In both studies, participants performed a recognition memory exclusion task 24 hours later. In addition to a previously reported material-specific effect of retrieval orientation, a frontally distributed, reward-associated retrieval orientation effect was found in both experiments. These findings were interpreted as indicating that reward motivation during learning leads to the adoption of a reward-associated retrieval orientation to support the retrieval of highly motivational information. Thus, ERP retrieval orientation effects not only reflect retrieval processes related to the sought-for materials but also relate to the reward conditions with which items were combined during encoding. In Experiments 3 a-d, effects of positive (potential gain of money) and negative incentives (potential loss of money) during learning on later memory performance were behaviorally investigated in a cross-cultural context with a similar experimental design as used in Experiment 1. Independent of participants 2 ̆ 7 origin (China or Germany), memory performance was better when the positive or negative incentive to memorize an item was high. However, a cross-cultural effect was found in the experiments that used negative incentives during learning. The magnitude of the differences in memory accuracy for items previously studied in apprehension of potential high loss of money compared to low loss was significantly higher in Chinese than in German participants. This effect might reflect that Chinese participants were more sensitive to the <b>pending</b> <b>loss</b> of money than German participants.

40|$|The current discussions {{surrounding}} the German {{health care system}} are being determined and defined by the concepts of "profitability", "efficiency" and "saving". These concepts also determine the demands made on this system and have {{had an effect on}} the medical profession. The economy's growing influence on physicians' decision-making and the increasing necessity to look at and regulate services under economic aspects arising from the need to save costs are seen by the medical profession as a threat to its autonomous conduct and freedom to make decisions, in other words it sees it as a danger to its medical orientation. Conflicts between medical autonomy and economic orientation in physicians' conduct are therefore already foreseeable, as are conflicts between medicine and economy in regards to who has the power to define the terms of the public health system. Objective: This article will outline the area of conflict based on the available literature. It will discuss how the political and economic regulatory attempts affect the medical profession's autonomous conduct. It will also discuss which conflicts of conduct emerge for physicians, what types of solutions the medical profession tends to develop as a reaction, and whether or not this tension between medical and economic orientation can be resolved in an acceptable way. Methodology: This article should first outline the changed economic and political basic conditions and the attempts to reform the German health care system, using this as a starting point. Following this, it will explore the significance professional autonomy acquires within the concept of profession {{from the point of view}} of the sociology of professions. With this in mind, the third part of this article will describe and analyze the effects of advanced economization on the medical profession's autonomous conduct, which has long been regarded as uncontested. This part of the article will also describe and analyze the medical profession's strategies it uses to defend its autonomy. Finally, this article will discuss whether or not a stronger integration of medical and economic responsibility is possible. Conclusion and summary: The conclusion that will be drawn from this discussion is that the medical profession can only avoid the <b>pending</b> <b>loss</b> of its autonomy (deprofessionalization) if it is able to combine cost efficiency and quality (and integrate economic aspects into its actions). If it is unable to do so, it will lose more and more control over the public health system to the state, economy, and management...|$|E
