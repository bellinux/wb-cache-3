25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high <b>pressure</b> <b>inlet</b> opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E

40|$|Lymphangions, the {{segments}} of lymphatic vessels between valves, exhibit structural characteristics {{in common with}} both ventricles and arteries. Although once viewed as passive conduits like arteries, it has become well established that lymphangions can actively pump lymph against an axial pressure gradient from low-pressure tissues to the great veins of the neck. A recently reported mathematical model, based on fundamental principles, predicted that lymphangions can transition from pump to conduit behavior when outlet <b>pressure</b> falls below <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this case, the axial pressure gradient becomes {{the major source of}} energy for the propulsion of lymph, despite the presence of cyclical contraction. In fact, flow is augmented when cyclical contractions are abolished. We therefore used an in vitro preparation to confirm these findings and to test the hypothesis that lymphangion contraction inhibits flow when outlet <b>pressure</b> falls below <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure.</b> Bovine postnodal mesenteric lymphatic vessels harvested from an abattoir were subjected to an <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> of 5. 0 cmH 2 O and an outlet pressure that decreased from 6. 5 to 3. 5 cmH 2 O under control conditions, stimulated with U- 46619 (a thromboxane analog) and relaxed with calcium-free solution. Under control conditions, lymphatic flow markedly increased as outlet <b>pressure</b> fell below <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this case, the slopes of the flow versus axial pressure gradient increased with calcium-free conditions (61 %, n = 8, P = 0. 016) and decreased with U- 46619 stimulation (21 %, n = 5, P = 0. 033).

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{vane pump}} has a circular rotor rotating inside a larger circular cavity. The centers {{of these two}} circles are offset, causing eccentricity. Vanes are allowed to slide {{into and out of}} the rotor and seal on all edges, creating vane chambers that do the pumping work. On the intake side of the pump, the vane chambers are increasing in volume. These increasing-volume vane chambers are filled with fluid forced in by the inlet <b>pressure.</b> <b>Inlet</b> pressure is actually the pressure from the system being pumped, often just the atmosphere. On the discharge side of the pump, the vane chambers are decreasing in volume, forcing fluid out of the pump. The action of the vane drives out the same volume of fluid with each rotation. Multistage rotary-vane vacuum pumps can attain pressures as low as 10−6 mbar (0.0001 Pa).|$|E
50|$|Matrix-Assisted Ionization MAI {{is similar}} to MALDI in sample preparation, but a laser is not {{required}} to convert analyte molecules included in a matrix compound into gas-phase ions. In MAI, analyte ions have charge states similar to electrospray ionization but obtained from a solid matrix rather than a solvent. No voltage or laser is required, but a laser can be used to obtain spatial resolution for imaging. Matrix-analyte samples are ionized in the vacuum of a mass spectrometer and can be inserted into the vacuum through an atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>inlet.</b> Less volatile matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid require a hot inlet tube to produce analyte ions by MAI, but more volatile matrices such as 3-nitrobenzonitrile require no heat, voltage, or laser. Simply introducing the matrix:analyte sample to the inlet aperture of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer produces abundant ions. Compounds at least as large as bovine serum albumin kDa can be ionized with this method. In this simple, low cost and easy to use ionization method, the inlet to the mass spectrometer can be considered the ion source.|$|E

Pierce, {{owner of}} the GN Pierce Co, built {{refrigerators}} and bird cages in the 1890s, and expanded into bicycle manufacture by 1892, with their famous 'arrow' logo; many of their bicycles used a shaft drive for the rear wheel. 3 members of the GN Pierce Board of Directors traveled to Europe in 1900, to acquire new technology, and purchased a DeDion engine to power a new automobile, the Pierce's son Percy was a competition driver of Pierce Motor Car Co automobiles, and by 1907 he was appointed {{head of the new}} Pierce Cycle Co, with the intention of producing motorcycles. Following factory tradition, he traveled to Europe for technical inspiration, and acquired a Belgian FN Four in 1908, which was shipped back to the Pierce factory for study. As the world's first production four-cylinder motorcycle, the FN was the apex of current technology, and the Pierce engineering team used the FN as a reference for their own four-cylinder motorcycle introduced in 1909; the Pierce Four. The new Pierce was innovative, with a stressed member engine and shaft drive, and a frame of very large-diameter tubing, that both hid the control cables and held oil and gasoline internally. The large diameter tubing is said to have increased the frame's strength, and reduced the number of parts required, making manufacture less expensive. Unlike FN's engine, the Pierce had a T-head sidevalve motor, and cam-driven intake valves rather than the 'automatic' (opened by atmospheric <b>pressure)</b> <b>inlet</b> valves of the FN. The Pierce was thus quite an improvement on the FN, and was the first four-cylinder motorcycle manufactured in the USA. Early models had no clutch and fixed gearing, like the competing FN Four, but the 1910 model was greatly improved, with a clutch and two-speed transmission.|$|E
