Each composite laminate was reinforced with two <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> jute <b>fabric</b> and two <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>fabric</b> by varying the position of layers. Dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) was used to examine the dynamic mechanical properties of composite laminates with increasing temperature.

40|$|Multilayered armors with a front ceramic {{followed}} by aramid fabric (Kevlar&# 8482;) are currently used against high velocity ammunition. In these armors, a front ceramic layer that shatters and spalls the bullet is {{followed by}} an intermediate layer, usually <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> aramid <b>fabric,</b> which dissipates both the bullet and ceramic fragments energy. In the present work, the intermediate aramid fabric layer was replaced by an equal thickness layer of 30 vol% jute fabric reinforced epoxy composite. Ballistic impact test with 7. 62 caliber ammunition revealed that both the plain epoxy and the jute fabric composite have a relatively similar performance of the Kevlar&# 8482; and also attended the NIJ standard for body protection.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} materials for repair and retrofit of structures {{has become a}} common use among the engineering community. Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) is a composite material specifically designed for masonry and concrete rehabilitation and is becoming {{a viable alternative to}} FRP, whenever the project conditions do not allow the use of organic polymer based composites. FRCM is usually constituted by one or multiple <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>fabrics</b> (carbon, glass, aramid, basalt or PBO fibers) embedded into an inorganic matrix. If a polymer is used to either cover or bond the fabric strands, such polymer does not fully penetrate and impregnate the fibers as it would for FRP. The purpose of this research work is to study how different types and amounts of organic coatings applied to a carbon fabric could affect the bond behavior between fabric and mortar. The effectiveness of coating treatments was studied by means of direct tensile, pull-off and shear-bond double-lap tests. Experimentation was carried out on different combinations <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> and mortars, by varying the levels of pre-impregnation <b>of</b> the <b>fabric</b> during its manufacturing. In addition, the use of a quartz sand layer applied to the fabric after impregnation was investigated.

40|$|During {{the impact}} of thin {{composite}} panels, well-defined flaps can develop on the exit face {{as a consequence of}} through-thickness penetration of the panel. For certain materials (for example, CFRP panels based on <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> plain-woven <b>fabric)</b> the flaps develop as four triangles, with the apex of each triangle at the point of impact. As the impactor is driven through the panel, the flap (i. e. crack) lengths increase, until complete penetration of the panel by the impactor occurs. In the experiments described within this paper, CFRP panels fabricated from epoxy resin reinforced with plain-woven carbon fibre fabrics have been impacted using controlled multiple impact tests. During these tests, the impactor is driven at a controlled velocity to a particular depth of penetration through the composite panel, withdrawn, and then driven further through the panel subsequently. The experimental results show that the dependence of the flap compliance is proportional to the square of the flap length, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions. This compliance/crack-length also enables a toughness value for the composite panel to be derived that is directly relevant to through-thickness impact. The relationship of this toughness value to measurements of the mode I toughness of the composite panel using single edge notch specimens is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of hollow glass fibers in laminates used in today's printed circuit boards, chip carrier substrates, and plastic {{ball grid arrays}} can {{have a significant impact}} on reliability. In the manufacture of laminates used for the electronic industry, glass fibers are used for reinforcement. Laminates are composed <b>of</b> several <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> glass <b>fabrics</b> encapsulated with a polymeric resin. The most common fabric fiber material used today in laminate manufacture is E-glass, a continuous filament glass yarn with a chemical composition by weight of mostly SiO 2, but also containing various amounts of CaO, Al 2 O 3 and other materials. Advantages of E-glass lie in its high tensile strength, water resistance, bond stability with resins, and relatively low cost. The dielectric constant (6. 3 at 23 oC and 1 MHz) is high, but acceptable for most low frequency applications. The manufacture of glass fiber begins with the dry mixing of silicas, limestone, clay, and boric acid in appropriate proportions. In the direct-melt process, the mixture is melted in a refractory furnace at temperatures between 2600 and 2800 oF and fed directly into bushings, which are platinum alloy plates with nozzles. Alternatively, the melt can be formed into marbles, cooled to room temperature and stored for future use. Additional information about this process is supplied by Loewenstein [1983]. A homogeneous melt composition with negligible impurities is necessary for the successful manufactur...|$|R
40|$|This Part 2 paper {{presents}} {{results of}} comparative {{experimental study of}} progressive damage in 2 D and 3 D woven glass/epoxy composites under in-plane tensile loading. As Part 1, this Part 2 work {{is focused on the}} comparison of in-plane tensile properties of two non-crimp single-ply 3 D orthogonal weave E-glass fibre composites {{on one side and a}} laminate reinforced with four <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> E-glass plain weave on the other. The damage investigation methodology combines mechanical testing with acoustic emission registration (that provides damage initiation thresholds), progressive cracks observation on transparent samples, full-field surface strain mapping and cracks observation on micrographs, altogether enabling for a thorough characterisation of the local micro- and meso-damage modes of the studied composites. The obtained results demonstrate that the non-crimp 3 D orthogonal woven composites have significantly higher in-plane strengths, failure strains and damage initiation thresholds than their 2 D woven laminated counterpart. The growth of transverse cracks in the yarns of 3 D composites is delayed, and they are less prone to a yarn-matrix interfacial crack formation and propagation. Delaminations developing between the <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> plain weave <b>fabric</b> in the laminate at certain load level never appear in the 3 D woven single-ply composites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The hydrolytic {{stability}} of high-temperature deposited Si-doped BN {{has been shown}} in the past to be superior in comparison to "pure" BN processed at similar or even higher temperatures. This type of material would be very desirable as a SiC/SiC composite interphase that is formed by chemical infiltration into multi-ply woven preform. However, due to rapid deposition on the preform outer surface at the high processing temperature, this has proven very difficult. To overcome this issue, single <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> woven <b>fabric</b> were infiltrated with Si-doped BN. Three composite panels of different SiC fiber types were fabricated with Si-doped BN interphases including Sylramic, Hi-Nicalon Type S and Sylramic-iBN fiber-types. The latter fiber-type possesses a thin in-situ grown BN layer on the fiber surface. High Si contents (approx. 7 to 10 a/o) and low oxygen contents (less than 1 a/o) were achieved. All three composite systems demonstrated reasonable debonding and sliding properties. The coated Sylramic fabric and composites were weak due to fiber degradation apparently caused during interphase processing by the formation of TiN crystals on the fiber surface. The Hi-Nicalon Type S composites with Si-doped BN interphase were only slightly weaker than Hi-Nicalon Type S composites with conventional BN when the strength on the load-bearing fibers at failure was compared. On the other hand, the Sylramic-iBN fabric and composites with Si-doped BN showed excellent composite and intermediate temperature stress-rupture properties. Most impressive was the lack of any significant interphase oxidation on the fracture surface of stress-ruptured specimens tested well above matrix cracking at 815 C...|$|R

The glass preforms were consolidated by application of heat and pressure over <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> the glass <b>fabrics</b> coated with various concentrations of a thermoplastic polyester binder. The peel strength of the preforms with various binder content was measured and the highest peel strength was obtained from preforms prepared with about 9 wt% of the binder. Composite laminates with and without binder were fabricated using VARTM technique and the effects of the binder on the composite mechanical properties were evaluated. It was found that the flexural strength and mode I interlaminar fracture toughness decreases by 15 % and 40 %, respectively, due to the presence of 3 wt% of the binder. Ballistic test was performed on E-glass/polyester composite panels using 1. 1 -g fragment-simulating projectiles and it was found that the binder amount has some considerable effect on the damage extension of the impacted composites.

Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) and Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) process have become {{important in the}} manufacture of these types of composites. In those techniques, use of fiber preforms offer some distinct advantages. Using thermoplastic binders that bond the fabrics together allows the plies to be consolidated into near net shape preform. In the present work, glass preforms were consolidated by application of heat and pressure over <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> the glass <b>fabrics</b> that were coated with various concentration of thermoplastic polyester binder. Composite laminates with and without binder were fabricated by utilizing VARTM technique. The peel strength of the preforms with various binder contents was measured to determine the optimum binder concentration. The highest peel strength was obtained from preforms that were prepared with about 9 wt. % of the binder. Preform compression test was also performed using universal test machine with preforms composed <b>of</b> eight <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> glass <b>fabrics</b> with binder (3, 6 and 9 wt. %) and without binder. It was observed that the binder has significant effect on the degree of preform compaction. The highest thickness reduction and therefore fiber volume fraction of the preforms was reached via 3 wt. % of binder. The flexural strength and modulus, compressive strength and modulus through ply-lay up and in-plane loading directions, apparent interlaminar shear strength, mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the composites with and without binder were measured to evaluate the effects of the binder on the mechanical properties of the composite plates. It was found that the flexural strength, mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the E-glass/polyester composite system decreases 30 and 40 percentage, respectively due to the presence of 3 wt. % and 6 wt. % of binder. On the other hand, the flexural modulus of the composite increases while the apparent interlaminar shear strength remains almost constant by the introduction of the binder. The ply-lay up compressive strength and modulus were found to increase up to 3 wt. % of binder and decrease upon further addition of binder. The same findings are valid for the compressive strength and modulus through in-plane loading direction. Ballistic test was performed on E-glass/polyester composite panels according to NATO standards 2920 using 1. 1 -gr. fragment-simulating projectiles (FSPs) to evaluate the effects of the binder on the ballistic performance of the E-glass/polyester composite laminates. The ultrasonic C-scan test method was used to monitor the extent of the damage on the panels due to ballistic impact. It was seen that the damage on the ballistically impacted composite panels decreases with increasing binder. A model matrix material was prepared adding various concentrations of the binder to the reacting resin system in order to follow the extend of binder dissolution within the matrix resin. It was found that there is no complete dissolution of the binder in the matrix resin...|$|R

The SYDs form flow channels, which determine the permeability of the NCF. The channels are connected to each other in overlap regions, allowing the fluid to flow from one channel to another and finally to impregnate the entire preform. A network of SYD flow channels is modelled to account for the statistical variations in the dimensions of the SYDs. The flow resistance of a single channel is calculated using a multigrid solver. The global flow is calculated by solving the effective resistance of all flow channels. Analysis of different networks, with varying spatial distribution of the dimensions of the flow channels, allows the prediction of the variation in the permeability of an NCF...|$|R
