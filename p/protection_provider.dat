Several investigations into detainee operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom identified a lack of clarity with regard to organizational structures, command relationships, and roles and responsibilities of personnel operating internment facilities. As a force health <b>protection</b> <b>provider</b> in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Task Force Med 115 developed a standing operating procedure (SOP) for Detention Health Care Operations. This SOP, combined with U. S. Army Medical Department Center and School staffing with subject matter experts, resulted in this Special Text. This publication shall provide commanders with a single, consolidated source of medical procedures that outline accurate information of planning for detainee operations; roles and responsibilities during detainee operations; capture, initial detention, screening, medical and transportation procedures; long term detention operations; and transfer or release from detention.

40|$|This study evaluates {{strengths}} and weaknesses of British Columbia’s policy response to two forms of child maltreatment – neglect and emotional maltreatment (NEM). Interviews with child <b>protection</b> service <b>providers</b> suggest that NEM cases often take lower priority than issues like physical and sexual abuse. Barriers to effective NEM intervention include the difficulty of substantiating NEM to meet the legal burden of proof, practical limitations of the initial protection report assessment process, and a shortage of resources necessary to provide ongoing support services to NEM-affected children. This study makes two recommendations aimed at improving BC’s child protection response to NEM issues. First, the provision of earlier intervention services is recommended in low-to-moderate risk cases of NEM; in these cases, more collaborative processes that do not require court involvement are emphasized. The study also recommends provision of longer-term supports (e. g. professional counseling) for children in higher risk cases of NEM...|$|R

40|$|Coccidioidomycosis is {{associated}} with soil-disruptive work in Coccidioides-endemic areas of the southwestern United States. Among 3, 572 workers constructing 2 solar power-generating facilities in San Luis Obispo County, California, USA, we identified 44 patients with symptom onset during October 2011 -April 2014 (attack rate 1. 2 cases/ 100 workers). Of these 44 patients, 20 resided in California outside San Luis Obispo County and 10 resided in another state; 9 were hospitalized (median 3 days), 34 missed work (median 22 days), and 2 had disseminated disease. Of the 25 patients who frequently performed soil-disruptive work, 6 reported frequent use of respiratory protection. As solar farm construction in Coccidioides-endemic areas increases, additional workers will probably be exposed and infected unless awareness is emphasized and effective exposure reduction measures implemented, including limiting dust generation and providing respiratory <b>protection.</b> Medical <b>providers,</b> including those in non-Coccidioides-endemic areas, should suspect coccidioidomycosis in workers with compatible illness and report cases to their local health department. 26484688 PMC 462223...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} process of {{mediation}} used {{in the context of}} child pro-tection mediation. The general aims of this study are to explore aspects of mediation which are unique to this process, and to identify mediative proc-esses which could be used effectively in other types of child protection inter-ventions. The primary source of data is derived from interviews with child protection workers, mediators, parents and other family members who partici-pated in mediation. The introduction of mediators in the child protection pro-cess was found to alter the dynamics and change the nature of the discourse between child protection workers and family members. However, other child <b>protection</b> service <b>providers</b> could employ many aspects of mediation. The rapid growth of mediation in fields as diverse as commercial dis-pute resolution and divorce mediation has raised the interest {{of a growing number of}} child welfare service providers and scholars interested in find-ing a more constructive process for developing collaborative service plans with families (Mayer, 1987).

The court disagreed with the claim by pointing out the majority of CCBill’s functions are outside providing information location services. In addition, P10 did not claim that CCBill infringed its copyrights by providing a hyperlink; rather, the alleged infringement was through other services provided by CCBill. Therefore, CCBill should not qualify for the § 512(d) safe harbor.|$|R
