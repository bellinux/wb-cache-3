30|$|However, REACH regulates {{only the}} use of SVHC within the European Economic Area (EEA). This holds also true for uses in articles. Art. 3 No 3 REACH defines the term ‘article’ as ‘object which during {{production}} is given a special shape, surface or design which determines its function {{to a greater degree}} than does its chemical composition’. Most products used e.g. in private homes such as furniture, textiles, toys, books or electronic devices are, therefore, covered [12]. Besides, the term may refer to complex articles (e.g., bicycle) and also to their constituent parts where these parts meet the article definition (e.g., bicycle tube) [13]. Whenever the <b>producer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> incorporates SVHC outside the EEA, Art.  56 (1) REACH does not apply. As a consequence, such articles may be imported into the EEA subject to the requirements of Art. 7 REACH, but there is no authorisation requirement for REACH Annex XIV SVHC contained. At the same time, Art.  56 (1) REACH does not apply to imported article parts of complex articles which are assembled within the EEA.|$|E
60|$|Direct {{taxes are}} either on income or on {{expenditure}}. Most taxes on expenditure are indirect, {{but some are}} direct, being imposed, not on the <b>producer</b> or seller <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article,</b> but immediately on the consumer. A house-tax, for example, is a direct tax on expenditure, if levied, as it usually is, on the occupier of the house. If levied on the builder or owner, {{it would be an}} indirect tax. A window-tax is a direct tax on expenditure; so are the taxes on horses and carriages.|$|R
60|$|But {{there are}} other respects, equally important, in which the charges brought by Socialists against {{competition}} do not admit <b>of</b> so complete <b>an</b> answer. Competition is the best security for cheapness, {{but by no means}} a security for quality. In former times, when producers and consumers were less numerous, it was a security for both. The market was not large enough nor the means of publicity sufficient to enable a dealer to make a fortune by continually attracting new customers: his success depended on his retaining those that he had; and when a dealer furnished good articles, or when he did not, the fact was soon known to those whom it concerned, and he acquired a character for honest or dishonest dealing of more importance to him than the gain that would be made by cheating casual purchasers. But on the great scale of modern transactions, with the great multiplication of competition and the immense increase in the quantity of business competed for, dealers are so little dependent on permanent customers that character is much less essential to them, while there is also far less certainty of their obtaining the character they deserve. The low prices which a tradesman advertises are known, to a thousand for one who has discovered for himself or learned from others, that the bad quality of the goods is more than an equivalent for their cheapness; {{while at the same time}} the much greater fortunes now made by some dealers excite the cupidity of all, and the greed of rapid gain substitutes itself for the modest desire to make a living by their business. In this manner, as wealth increases and greater prizes seem to be within reach, more and more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gambling spirit is introduced into commerce; and where this prevails not only are the simplest maxims of prudence disregarded, but all, even the most perilous, forms of pecuniary improbity receive a terrible stimulus. This is the meaning of what is called the intensity of modern competition. It is further to be mentioned that when this intensity has reached a certain height, and when <b>a</b> portion <b>of</b> the <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> or the dealers in it have resorted to any of the modes of fraud, such as adulteration, giving short measure, &c., of the increase of which there is now so much complaint, the temptation is immense on these to adopt the fraudulent practises, who would not have originated them; for the public are aware of the low prices fallaciously produced by the frauds, but do not find out at first, if ever, that the article is not worth the lower price, and they will not go on paying a higher price for <b>a</b> better <b>article,</b> and the honest dealer is placed at a terrible disadvantage. Thus the frauds, begun by a few, become customs of the trade, and the morality of the trading classes is more and more deteriorated.|$|R
30|$|The European {{chemicals}} regulation REACH 1907 / 2006 /EC [1] {{introduced a}} new communication duty concerning substances of very high concern (SVHCs) in articles (Art. 33). SVHCs are chemicals which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic for reproduction, or very critical for the environment because they are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) or which cause concern for other reasons such as endocrine disruptors ([1] Art. 57). They {{are listed in the}} so-called candidate list [2] which is updated twice a year (last update 12 / 01 / 2017 with <b>a</b> total <b>of</b> 173 entries) and which should include all relevant currently known SVHCs by 2020 [3]. According to Art. 33 (2), consumers have the right to receive information from the suppliers <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> who is “any <b>producer</b> or importer <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article,</b> distributor or other actor in the supply chain placing <b>an</b> <b>article</b> on the market” [1 Art. 3 (33)] about the presence of any SVHC. This applies for SVHCs that exceed <b>a</b> threshold <b>of</b> 0.1 % (weight/weight) in <b>an</b> <b>article</b> in terms <b>of</b> REACH, in <b>a</b> subassembly <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> [4, 5] or in its packaging. Information shall be provided within <b>a</b> time period <b>of</b> 45  days upon receipt free of charge. This information obligation is a very important element in the REACH regulation with the ambitious goal to minimize adverse effects for the consumer and the environment by increasing transparency and awareness on SVHCs in consumer articles, by helping the interested consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and by ensuring <b>a</b> safe use <b>of</b> <b>articles,</b> and it supports the efforts by producers to substitute SVHCs by less dangerous chemicals.|$|R
