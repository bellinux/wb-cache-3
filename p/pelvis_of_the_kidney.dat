40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} <b>the</b> {{protective effects}} <b>of</b> sirolimus on unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) induced renal fibrosis by blockage of mTOR and its mechanism. Methods　Forty-two female rats were randomized to 3 groups: UUO group, sirolimus group (Sir group), and control group. UUO rats underwent unilateral ureteral ligation to reproduce renal fibrosis model. Sir group received sirolimus 2 mg/kg wt per day (0. 4 ml, intragastric administration) {{from one day}} before the UUO procedure to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> study. <b>The</b> control group underwent surgery but without ureteral ligation. Obstructed kidneys were harvested on 7 th and 14 th day, and histological examination was performed for observing and comparing <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> renal and renal tubule expansion. <b>The</b> concentrations <b>of</b> sodium, potassium and calcium ion in the urine obtained from <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> with ligated ureters were determined. At the same time, <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and apoptosis were observed with immunohistochemical method and TUNEL respectively. MicroRNAs quantities (mir- 29 c, mir- 143, and mir- 155) were assayed by quantitative PCR. Results　At abovementioned two time-points, swollen kidneys and expanded renal tubules were observed in UUO and Sir groups as compared to control group, however, kidney in Sir group showed significantly less swelling and than that in UUO group (P < 0. 01). Histological observation found tubular injury, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis were more marked in UUO group as compared to Sir group. Na+, K+ and Ca 2 + of retention urine were significantly lower in Sir group than in UUO group (P < 0. 05). PCNA-positive cell ratio and apoptosis ratio were higher in UUO group than in Sir and control groups (P < 0. 01). No significant difference in expression of miR- 155 or miR- 143 was found between 3 groups, however, miR- 29 c expression in UUO group was down-regulated and significantly lower than that in control or Sir group (P < 0. 01).

50|$|The {{urinary system}} {{refers to the}} {{structures}} that produce and conduct urine {{to the point of}} excretion. The human body normally has two paired kidneys, one on the left and one on the right. Urine is formed by nephrons, the functional unit of the kidney, and then flows through a system of converging tubules called collecting ducts. The collecting ducts join together to form minor calyces, then major calyces, which ultimately join the <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> (renal pelvis). Urine flows from the renal pelvis into the ureter, a tube-like structure that carries the urine from the kidneys into the bladder.|$|E
50|$|A {{retrograde}} pyelogram is done {{to locate}} the stone in the kidney. With a small 1 centimeter incision in the loin, the percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCN) needle is passed into the <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> The position of the needle is confirmed by fluoroscopy. A guide wire is passed through the needle into the pelvis. The needle is then withdrawn with the guide wire still inside the pelvis. Over the guide wire the dilators are passed and a working sheath is introduced.A nephroscope is then passed inside and small stones taken out. In case the stone is big it may first have to be crushed using ultrasound probes and then the stone fragments removed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mixed {{epithelial}} and stromal tumour (MEST) {{represents a}} recently described benign composite neoplasm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> which predominantly affects perimenopausal females. Most tumours are benign, although rare malignant {{cases have been}} observed. Case report A 47 -year-old postmenopausal female presented to the urologist with flank pain. A CT scan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen showed a 30 -mm-in-diameter uniform mass adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>kidney.</b> Surgical exploration showed a tumour arising from the lower anterior hilus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>kidney.</b> <b>The</b> tumour could be excised by preserving <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> By intraoperative frozen section the tumour showed characteristic features of MEST with epithelial-covered cysts embedded in an "ovarian-like" stroma. Additional immunohistochemistry investigations showed expression for hormone receptors by <b>the</b> stromal component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumour. Discussion MEST typically presents in perimenopausal women as a primarily cystic mass. Commonly, the tumour arises from the renal parenchyma or pelvis. The tumour is composed of an admixture of cystic and sometimes more solid areas. The stromal cells typically demonstrate an ovarian-type stroma showing expression for the estrogen and progesterone receptors. Conclusion MEST represents a distinctive benign tumour entity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> which affects perimenopausal woman. The tumour should be distinguished from other cystic renal neoplasms. By imaging studies {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between a benign or malignant nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumour. Thus, intraoperative frozen section is necessary for conservative surgery, since the overall prognosis is favourable and renal function can be preserved in most cases. </p...|$|R

In addition, changes of the visualization {{in relation to the}} dose of contrast medium used was examined and compared with that of ionic contrast medium (60 % Urografin). The optimum photographing time was 15 minutes in the upper urinary tract (nephrogram, calyx, pelvis, upper ureter) and 20 minutes in the lower urinary tract (lower ureter, urinary bladder). Visualization of high usefulness appeared to be obtainable for the imaging diagnosis by DIP in subjects with normal renal function even when the photographing was completed 20 minutes after infusion of contrast medium. In relation to the doses of contrast medium used, no difference was observed in the variation pattern but a better imaging was obtained in the 100 ml group than 50 ml group with a significant difference (P less than 0. 01) in the 15 - 20 minute images of the calyx and <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> and urinary bladder in particular, this suggested the high usefulness of 100 ml dosing for the imaging diagnosis.

40|$|Hydronephrosis means {{dilation}} of the <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> by urine {{which has}} accumulated, because {{of obstruction of}} the urinary tract at some point distal to the pelvis, most commonly the pelvi-ureteral junction.

Formerly it was considered that either intermittent or gradually increasing obstruction was required to produce this condition, and that sudden complete obstruction led to anuria and atrophy, but Hinman and others have shown by animal experiment that complete obstruction is followed much more frequently by hydronephrosis than by primary atrophy. The increased intrapelvic pressure is in turn transmitted to the renal tubules, which dilate and press upon the adjacent veins, thus impeding the circulation and accelerating the process of atrophy of the parenchyma.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{clinical}} case of {{carcinoma of the}} rectum. A 45 -year-old patient had undergone resection of the rectum and proctostomy 22 months ago. Carcinoma caused metastasis to the corpora cavernosa of the penis in this patient, and caused local recurrence of the carcinoma of the rectum, pulmonary metastasis and malignant priapism. A statistical analysis of 62 cases of secondary tumor of the penis in Japan was also made. The present clinical case was the 62 nd case of secondary tumor of the penis in Japan, and the 4 th case of secondary penile tumor from the rectum. The primary foci of the secondary tumor of the penis are mostly in the urinary bladder and the prostate, followed by the rectum, kidney, <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> and the ureter. Primary sites in the urogenital organs were found in 82. 3 % and in the neighboring organs in 85. 2 %. As the route of metastasis of the secondary tumor of the penis, arterial blood, retrovenous, retro-lymph and direct infiltrating metastasis may be possible. Secondary tumor of the penis is mostly found in aged persons, and the major symptoms may be penile nodule and mass, malignant priapism, penile pain and tenderness, and difficulty in urination and retention of urine. Regardless of the length to metastasis and difference {{in the treatment of}} the metastatic focus, the secondary tumor of the penis is poor in prognosis, and survival period may be up to 7 months.

Activity in all three regions was inhibited by the aldose reductase inhibitors sorbinil, tolrestat and 7 -hydroxychromone- 2 -carboxylic acid. Based on substrate utilization and response to sulfate ion and inhibitors, the inner medulla contains primarily aldose reductase (EC 1. 1. 1. 21) while the cortex contains primarily aldehyde reductase (EC 1. 1. 1. 2).

40|$|The {{immediate}} {{effect of the}} operation on {{the portion of the}} kidney remaining is an infarcation of the tissue compressed by the sutures. This area of necrosis extends but a short distance into the adjacent kidney tissue. The infarcated tissue gradually becomes replaced by fibrous tissue and in three to four week's time the necrotic tissue entirely disappears. The amount of fibrous tissue in time becomes so slight and the healing so perfect {{that it is difficult to}} detect the site of the operation. The renal elements sometimes persist in the infarcated area and the glomeruli apparently are more resistant than the tubules. The tubules in the infarcated area sometimes become calcified and bone formation beneath the epithelium of the pelvis is of very frequent occurrence. The pelvic epithelium usually shows marked proliferation and may invade the field of operation in alveolar masses. Calculi may form in the <b>pelvis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> Sutures penetrating the pelvis as well as the necrotic tissue resulting from the compression of the sutures probably furnish the nuclei for the calculi. Removal of approximately half of one kidney did not alter either the remaining portion of that kidney or the size of the opposite kidney in two animals of this series. These experiments were terminated on the thirty-fourth and forty-seventh days. In a similar experiment of twenty-one day's duration there was slight but definite atrophy of the remaining tissue of the kidney operated upon. Removal of approximately half of each kidney at one operation did not alter the remaining kidney tissue in two animals of the second group. The longest period of observtaion was fifty-four days. On the other hand in a similar experiment where 164 days elapsed, the remaining portions of each kidney had increased markedly in size. Removal of one kidney and approximately half of the other did not alter the remaining kidney tissue in six animals in which from five to fifty-six days elapsed before termination of the experiment. In six experiments in which one kidney was removed and approximately half of the other, three of the animals died as a result of the operation on the sixth, seventh and tenth days. The probable cause of death was renal insufficiency: the animals refused food, vomited persistently and lost strength and weight. The other three animals recovered and were killed at periods varying from five to eight weeks. The reduction of the kidney tissue to one quarter of its original amount at one operation was attained with danger but was not necessarily fatal. In every experiment there was a loss of weight varying from four to twenty-four per cent. To what extent this loss in weight is due to the reduction of kidney substance and to what extent it is due to diet and confinement it is impossible to say, as we made no control experiments to elucidate these points...|$|E

P., are due to the effect of nephrotOmy rather than the effect of insertion of foreign body. (iii) There was higher P 2 distribution in the cortex than that in the medulla in every faction in the healthy kidneys. Though in the affected kidneys meanwhile, A. S. P. and L. P. were found abundantly in the cortex than that medulla, on the contrary, more N. A. P. was found in the medulla. (iv) There was no difference in P 32 distribution between A. S. P. and L. P. in comparison with the cortex of the healthy kidneys and that of the affected kidneys, but less quantity of N. A. P. was found in the affected kidney. On the other hand, more quantity of A. S. P. was found in the medulla of the affected kidney than that in the healthy kidney, indicating the increased A. S. P. metabolism in the medulla of the affected kidneys. (4) The most distinct results in the above experiments a r e the absolute increase in N. A. P. in the medulla of the affected kidney and relative increase in A. S. P. in the medulla of the affected kidney in opposition to A. S. P. in the cortex. It is thought that the former is due to the effect of nephrotomy and the latter is due to the effect of the foreign body inserted into the pelvis...|$|E
