40|$|Abstract—Most of {{the drugs}} used for {{pharmaceutical}} purposes are poorly water-soluble drugs. About 40 % of all newly discovered drugs are lipophilic and the numbers of lipophilic drugs seem to increase more and more. Drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles, micelles or liposomes are applied to improve their solubility and thus their bioavailability. Besides various techniques of solubilization, oil-in-water emulsions are often used to incorporate lipophilic drugs into the oil phase. To stabilize emulsions surface active substances (surfactants) are generally used. An alternative method to avoid the application of surfactants was of great interest. One possibility is to develop O/W-emulsion without any addition of surface active agents or the so called “surfactant-free emulsion or SFE”. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and characterize SFE as a drug carrier by varying the production conditions. Lidocaine base was used as a model drug. The injection method was developed. Effects of ultrasound as well as of temperature on the properties of the emulsion were studied. Particle sizes and release were determined. The long-term stability up to 30 days was performed. The results showed that the surfactant-free O/W emulsions with <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>oil</b> as drug carrier can be produced...|$|E
40|$|Oceans {{have shown}} {{tremendous}} importance and {{impact on our}} lives. Thus the need for monitoring and protecting the oceans has grown exponentially in recent years. On the other hand, oceans have economical and industrial potential {{in areas such as}} <b>pharmaceutical,</b> <b>oil,</b> minerals and biodiversity. This demand is increasing and the need for high data rate and near real-time communications between submerged agents became of paramount importance. Among the needs for underwater communications, streaming video (e. g. for inspecting risers or hydrothermal vents) {{can be seen as the}} top challenge, which when solved will make all the other applications possible. Presently, the only reliable approach for underwater video streaming relies on wired connections or tethers (e. g. from ROVs to the surface) which presents severe operational constraints that makes acoustic links together with AUVs and sensor networks strongly appealing. Using new polymer-based acoustic transducers, which in very recent works have shown to have bandwidth and power efficiency much higher than the usual ceramics, this article proposes the development of a reprogrammable acoustic modem for operating in underwater communications with video streaming capabilities.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} persistence and value relevance of earnings attributable to tax savings {{and the extent}} to which this persistence and value relevance differs from those of nontax earnings. After controlling for factors previously shown to be systematically associated with the tax component of earnings, results show that tax savings are significant and statistically persistent but statistically less persistent than earnings from nontax sources. Results also reveal that the persistence of tax savings changes across tax regimes whereas earnings from nontax sources remain relatively unchanged. Contextual analysis shows that (1) the persistence of tax savings is largely driven by firms in the <b>pharmaceutical,</b> <b>oil</b> and gas, financial services, insurance and real estate industries, (2) the persistence of tax savings is increasing in the R&D tax credit and (3) this persistence is increasing in settings where the ratio of foreign over domestic earnings is increasing. Additionally, the persistence and value relevance of tax savings is increasing for positive tax savings, implying a market reward (penalty) for lower (higher) tax savings (reported effective tax rates). When I compare the results from my valuation tests with those from my persistence tests, I find that tax savings are sometimes not persistent but value relevant and sometimes persistent but not value relevant whereas the persistence and value relevance of nontax earnings are always consistent. These findings are consistent with managerial opportunistic behavior, a market that suspects managerial opportunistic behavior or a stock market that does not understand fully the persistence of tax savings relative to nontax savings. Results from the Mishkin (1983) test show that the market appears to significantly overestimate both the persistence of tax savings and nontax earnings, implying that securities are mispriced. This potential mispricing appears to be more severe for tax savings, implying that, on average, the market does not appear to understand fully the persistence and value relevance of the tax component of earnings. Finally, this study reconciles some of the mixed results of prior research and carries significant implications for policy makers, firm management, market participants and accounting researchers...|$|E
40|$|The severe {{shortage}} of skilled and qualified {{personnel in the}} shipping industry has been addressed in various ways. This thesis looks into the issue from a new perspective where high mobility in the shipping industry {{is seen as a}} vehicle of knowledge flows {{that can be used for}} knowledge transfer. The rationality of this approach is that knowledge has been considered the most important asset that an organisation can possibly use as a leverage to gain competitive advantage, and the fact that knowledge management practices have been successfully applied into industries such as the <b>pharmaceutical,</b> <b>oil</b> and gas industries where skill shortages have been a major obstacle for development. It is argued that while an organisation cannot stop personnel leaving, it is possible, by utilising effective knowledge management practices, to retain part of the knowledge held by such personnel. As there is a dearth of research on knowledge management in the shipping industry, the objective of this thesis is to explore the appropriate application of knowledge management practices to the industry. This is achieved by (i) identifying the components of an organisational knowledge base (OKB); (ii) examining the effects of human mobility on the OKB; and (iii) investigating management practices for effective knowledge transfer in the shipping industry. A conceptual framework is established to address these three research questions. In order to empirically validate the research models, a sample of Chinese shipping companies (ship owners, manning companies, ship managers) was selected for a mail survey. The mail survey generated a 60 per cent response rate in which 166 valid questionnaires were returned. A wide range of statistical techniques such as reliability, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson‟s correlation, factor analysis (PCA), and multiple regression, was employed to analyse the data collected from the mail survey. The study made a number of findings. First, an OKB consists of fourteen knowledge components with four dimensions, and the perceived importance of these components vary according to business sectors, fleet sizes, and respondents‟ total work experience. Secondly, all personnel movements except those of ratings are considered critical to the OKB. Such perceived effects can be predicted by two of the three factors regarding current workforce stability (total preferred workforce, total stability and optimism). Finally, effective knowledge transfer practices are comprised of fourteen elements from three main management domains, that is, culture, leadership, and technology. A multiple regression analysis finds that current management practices (a four-factor solution) do not explain perceived effective knowledge transfer practices. It is found, however, that some elements are affected by the establishment of a knowledge management department or the designation of a chief knowledge officer, and that there are correlations between information communication technology related practices and the current/preferred means of communication. It is suggested that through the identification of the composition of an OKB, an organisation should provide a supportive culture, strong leadership, and relevant resources to manage its knowledge asset through effective knowledge transfer, given the impacts that high human mobility has on the OK...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. The idea of benefit-sharing has, {{over the}} past fifteen years, taken hold in several {{prominent}} arenas of research and development, from <b>pharmaceutical,</b> <b>oil,</b> and mineral prospecting to human genetic research. Broadly, the idea refers to a commitment to channel some kind of returns - whether monetary or non-monetary - back {{to a range of}} designated participants: “affected” parties, source communities or source nations, participants in clinical trials, patient groups etc. Derived from stakeholder theory and post-neoliberal attempts to frame market-based activity into presumed social and environmental ends (Hayden, 2003, 2007), benefit-sharing is often framed simultaneously as: a matter of justice, as a proxy for property rights, and as a “non-market” tool for redistributing value production. The politics, ethics, and practice of benefit-sharing have been elaborated most thoroughly, though not exclusively, in the realm of biological resources. Here, the promise of equitable returns to source communities and source nations was institutionalized as a multilateral principle for the sustainable management of biodiversity in the 1992 UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In this arena, and increasingly in others 1, a broad commitment to benefit-sharing is installed through a number of mechanisms: licensing agreements and royalty-sharing contracts; academic research protocols; ethical guidelines for corporation’s “good-practices”; multilateral mandates; government regulation and legislation. In 1992, in the face of considerable opposition from Northern interests, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) came into force and recognized states’ sovereign rights over their natural and biological resources. Although the convention was apparently beneficial and championed by many southern activists, environmentalists and scholars, Dorsey (2000) argues that christening plants as property underneath jurisdiction of the state was a “mixed blessing”: member nations were formally given what was arguably already theirs and simultaneously obligated to erect sufficient regulatory infrastructure to protect these resources from expropriation. In 2001, almost ten years after the publication of CBD, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (FAO International Treaty) was adopted by the FAO 2, highlighting very similar principles regarding the protection of farmer's rights. The FAO International Treaty recognises past, present and future contributions of farmers in all regions of the world in conserving, improving and making available plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. Like the CBD, the FAO International Treaty does not define the concept, but states explicitly that the responsibility for implementing its provision on farmers’rights rests with national governments. Governments are free to choose the measures they consider appropriate, according to their needs and priorities, as long as specific attention is given to the protection of traditional knowledge, fair and equitable distribution of benefits derived from the use of plant genetic resources and participation in decision-making processes (Muller, 2006). Fifteen years of CBD-sanctioned experiments have made evident the many difficulties that the principle of benefit-sharing is likely to confront. In this domain, matters of sovereignty mix with the delicate questions not just of “how much” should be shared, but with whom, and on what basis. In fact, a number of inter-related problems and questions arise provocatively alongside the ascendant politics of benefit-sharing: what kind of entitlement is benefit-sharing and what a benefit is (technology transfer, royalty payments, infrastructure building, community development projects) ? Who counts as a benefit-recipient (national biodiversity institutes, some communities and not others, developing country scientists) ? What principles and mechanisms - ethics, legal rights, trade, contract - shall guarantee such redistributions and render it in practice? These are not simple questions but conceptual matters that suggest significant gaps at the interface of conventional frameworks of community, nation, market, and rights. According to Hayden (2003), one way to look for an {{answer to the question of}} what benefit-sharing is, is to think about what it is not. In this vein, she traces the relation between intellectual property rights (IPR) and benefit-sharing. For her, although the relationship between the politics of benefitsharing and intellectual property is complex and under constant re-negotiation, where biologicals resources are concerned, benefit-sharing relies on the concept of IPR but is not at all isomorphic to it. She reminds that, intellectual property itself (as patents for example) is rarely, if ever, considered part of the package of goods to be redistributed to benefit-recipients. Benefits are, in other words, posed mainly as compensation tools, but not as rights. Similarly, for De Jonge and Korthals (2006), the present benefit-sharing application as an instrument for compensation or exchange is quite narrow and has very little to do with the concepts of distributive justice or community participation. It means that most existing mechanisms of benefit-sharing are downstream focused (at the end of the research and development pipeline) and the idea of shared decision-making regarding the technological utilization of the resources is, most of the times, not part of the deal. In Peru, a series of recent laws and regulations address the protection of traditional knowledge related to biological resources. The right to participate in the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from access to and use of plant genetic resources has been recognized in a series of laws and regulations. Most importantly, Law 27811 for the Protection of Collective Knowledge of Indigenous People, published in 2002, is a milestone in this regard. Specific projects which involve accessing and using farmers’ seeds and genetic resources and their related traditional knowledge have also incorporated benefit sharing conditions and commitments. For all these reasons, it is certainly worthwhile to question how feasible and effective is the paradigm of “benefit-sharing” in promoting biodiversity conservation, indigenous rights recognition and community development. In other words, to investigate what does this entitlement really mean for countries, corporations and holders of biological resources and traditional knowledge worldwide: a fundamentally new way of introducing equity into the market place or just business as usual with a politically correct face (Peterson, 2001) ? Through the lens of a recent benefit-sharing agreement that took place in Peru, some distinct but related questions are asked, in an attempt to enhance understanding of these complex issues. First: did this agreement actually secured fair and equitable benefits for holders of traditional knowledge, and if not, which aspects require further attention? Second, what could we possibly learn from the negotiating process to develop a benefit-sharing agreement that can usefully be applied in similar situations? The analyzed cases is the rapatriation agreement of a native potato germplasm bank negotiated in 2004 between the International Potato Center (CIP), which comes to be a member of the alliance of the 15 centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), and the Quechuas Communities of the Potato Park, represented by an indigenous NGO, ANDES. Information for the case study came from both secondary and primary sources. Primary data was gathered during field research in Peru, in June, 2007. The methodological approach was mostly qualitative and included guieded visits to the International Potato Center in Lima and to the communities of the Potato Park, near Cusco, as well as in-depth interviews with key-actors from both organizations. Besides, a group of actors closely related to the general scope of benefit-sharing regulation and traditional knowledge protection in Peru was also interviewed. These included policy-makers, scholars, NGO attorneys and private sector representatives 3.

An analysis of Dutch and Japanese sources revealed that this scroll goes back to reports on field work conducted by Braun and his predecessor Gottfried Haeck in the vicinity of Nagasaki during the late 1660 s and early 1670 s. Obviously the Japanese, while using Chinese books for their description of plants, had already become aware of the specific properties of their own flora. Thus the emancipaction of Japanese botany from its Chinese model began much earlier than presumed by previous researchers. シーボルト記念館所蔵の「阿蘭陀草花鏡図」とその背景について １６６７年に幕府は薬草の輸入、国内植物資源の開発と製薬技術の移転に目をむけるようになった。延宝７（１６７９）年に成立した「阿蘭陀草花鏡図」は東インド会社の薬剤師ヘックとブラウンが長崎付近で行われた薬草調査に遡っているが、「阿蘭陀本草図経」等々の周囲資料との比較分析により、阿蘭陀通詞でない著者は通詞の報告や中国本草学の資料を利用しながら日本植物の特集性を認識していたことが浮き彫りにされた。日本の独自の本草学への動きは、すでに１６６０年代に始まったようだ...|$|R
40|$|While {{research}} on environmental reporting frequently includes large multinational enterprises, {{the number of}} surveys that systematically analyses {{a whole set of}} such firms, including the non-reporters, is limited and mainly focuses on the United States. This article presents the state of environmental reporting by the Fortune global 250, all large multinationals with a potentially large impact on other firms. Of these 250 firms, 35 % has a recent environmental report, with another 32 % publishing other types of environmental information. Reporting frequencies between the financial and non-financial sector differed considerably with 15 % and 44 % respectively. Besides an analysis of the number and contents of environmental reports, the importance of sectoral differences and firms nationality is also considered. A framework is developed which posits the existence of reporting legislation in firms home countries (some in place/pending, or none) against the direct environmental impact of the sector (large or small). The results of the analysis fit partially in this framework. Only a small number of reporting firms originates from countries with some kind of legislation (particularly the Netherlands), but national societal pressure seems to play a large role (especially in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany). Many operate in sectors with a substantial direct environmental impact (chemicals, <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>oil,</b> and motor vehicles and parts); reporting in sectors with more indirect effects is getting off the ground...|$|R
5000|$|According to Rath, {{events of}} the last century in the {{international}} arena have been driven by <b>pharmaceutical</b> and <b>oil</b> companies. Rath claims that World War II was started and exploited by these interests. In court filings, Rath and his lawyers write that the pharmaceutical industry then started apartheid in South Africa as part of a global conspiracy to [...] "conquer and control the entire African continent." [...] Former Nazi officials and the German chemical company IG Farben are specifically mentioned as playing {{a central role in the}} alleged conspiracy. In these documents, Rath also compares his adversaries in court to Hitler's storm troopers.|$|R
