40|$|Theoretically, {{identifying}} <b>prediabetics</b> {{would reduce}} the diabetic burden on the American healthcare system.

For this purpose, responses of prediabetic/borderline diabetes patients from the most recent publicly available 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey were analyzed. The findings showed that there was a correlation between household income, geographic residence in the US, and risk for developing diabetes mellitus type 2, aside from the accepted risk factors such as high BMI. In conclusion, implementation of the National Diabetes Prevention Program is a rational way of reducing the burden of DM on the healthcare system both economically and by prevalence.

The results were as follows. 1) Characteristic vascular alteration of the skin in diabetics : Moderate to severe arteriolar wall thickening presented in 41. 7 % of diabetics and 3. 1 % of the control, and these changes {{were considered to be}} characteristic in diabetics. On the contrary, mild change was found in 34. 2 % of diabetic group and 40. 6 % of nondiabetic group, and this change was not charactesistic finding in diabetics. 2) Glinicopathological findings in diabetics : Increasing severity of skin vascular alterations was closely correlated with increasing duration of diabetes and presence of diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|SummaryPrediabetes, a {{state of}} mild glucose intolerance, can persist for years before a sudden decline in beta cell {{function}} and rapid deterioration to overt diabetes.

To evaluate the effect of increasing CMPF on diabetes progression, we used obese, insulin-resistant models of prediabetes. CMPF accelerated diabetes development by inducing metabolic remodeling, resulting in preferential utilization of fatty acids over glucose. This was associated with diminished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increased ROS formation, and accumulation of proinsulin, all characteristics of human diabetes.

40|$|BackgroundRecent {{evidence}} has suggested {{an association between}} subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, whether SCH is related to microalbuminuria among subjects with prediabetes has not been studied. Thus, we evaluated the association between SCH and microalbuminuria in a cohort of <b>prediabetic</b> Egyptian adults. MethodsA total of 147 <b>prediabetic</b> subjects and 150 healthy controls matched for age and sex were enrolled in this study. Anthropometric measurements, plasma glucose, lipid profile, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, triiodothyronine levels, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were assessed. ResultsThe prevalence of SCH and microalbuminuria in the <b>prediabetic</b> subjects was higher than that in the healthy controls (16. 3 % vs. 4 %, P< 0. 001; and 12. 9 % vs. 5. 3 %, P= 0. 02, respectively). <b>Prediabetic</b> subjects with SCH were characterized by significantly higher HOMA-IR, TSH levels, UACR, and prevalence of microalbuminuria than those with euthyroidism. TSH level was associated with total cholesterol (P= 0. 05), fasting insulin (P= 0. 01), HOMA-IR (P= 0. 01), and UACR (P= 0. 005). UACR was associated with waist circumference (P= 0. 01), fasting insulin (P= 0. 05), and HOMA-IR (P= 0. 02).

Among lipid lipoprotein risk factors, sd-LDL is the most atherogenic lipoprotein. Triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol (Tg/HDL-C) ratio is considered parallel with sd-LDL level. Nevertheless, there is no data about sd-LDL level and Tg/HDL-C ratio in <b>prediabetic</b> and normoglycemic subgroups of first-degree relatives from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) in Indonesia. The {{aim of this study}} was to prove that <b>prediabetic</b> subgroup have higher sd-LDL level compared to normoglycemic subgroup and Tg/HDL-C ratio is correlated well with sd-LDL level. Materials and methods : This cross sectional study is consisted of 96 subjects of first-degree relatives from patients with T 2 DM in Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, which was divided to <b>prediabetic</b> and normoglycemic subgroups of 48 subjects each.

40|$|Abstract: Despite our {{cognizance}} that diabetes {{can enhance}} the chances of heart failure, causes multiorgan failure,and contributes to morbidity and mortality, it is rapidly increasing menace worldwide. Less {{attention has been paid}} to alert <b>prediabetics</b> through determining the comprehensive predictors of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ameliorating DCM using novel approaches. DCM is recognized as asymptomatic progressing structural and functional remodeling in the heart of diabetics, in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension. The three major stages of DCM are: (1) early stage, where cellular and metabolic changes occur without obvious systolic dysfunction; (2) middle stage, which is characterized by increased apoptosis, a slight increase in left ventricular size, and diastolic dysfunction and where ejection fraction (EF) is, 50 %; and (3) late stage, which is characterized by alteration in microvasculature compliance, an increase in left ventricular size, and a decrease in cardiac performance leading to heart failure. Recent investigations have revealed that DCM is multifactorial in nature and cellular, molecular, and metabolic perturbations predisposed and contributed to DCM. Differential expression of microRNA (miRNA), signaling molecules involved in glucose metabolism, hyperlipidemia, advanced glycogen end products, cardiac extracellular matri...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{electromagnetic}} fields (dirty electricity), in the kilohertz range on electrical wiring, may {{be contributing to}} elevated blood sugar levels among diabetics and <b>prediabetics.</b> By closely following plasma glucose levels in four Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, we find that they responded directly {{to the amount of}} dirty electricity in their environment. In an electromagnetically clean environment, Type 1 diabetics require less insulin and Type 2 diabetics have lower levels of plasma glucose. Dirty electricity, generated by electronic equipment and wireless devices, is ubiquitous in the environment. Exercise on a treadmill, which produces dirty electricity, increases plasma glucose. These findings may explain why brittle diabetics have difficulty regulating blood sugar. Based on estimates of people who suffer from symptoms of electrical hypersensitivity (3 â 35 %), as many as 5 â 60 million diabetics worldwide may be affected. Exposure to electromagnetic pollution in its various forms may account for higher plasma glucose levels and may contribute to the misdiagnosis of diabetes. Reducing exposure to electromagnetic pollution by avoidance or with specially designed GS filters may enable some diabetics to better regulate their blood sugar with less medication and borderline or pre-diabetics to remain non diabetic longer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEpidemiological {{studies have}} argued that green tea could {{mitigate}} diabetes and its complications. This study investigated the phytophenolic profile of Mauritian green tea and its antioxidant propensity. The effect of green tea on the risk factors: waist-hip ratio, glucose level, arterial pressure, antioxidant status, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in <b>prediabetics</b> was assessed. The experimental group consumed 3 cups of green tea daily for 14 weeks followed by a 2 -week washout period. The control group followed a water regimen. Green tea contained high level of phenolics related to its antioxidant power. Green tea suppressed waist-hip ratio of women from a significant increase and suppressed mean arterial pressure {{of men and women}} from a significant decrease after week 14. It reduced ALT level in women by 13. 0 &#x 25; () while increasing the antioxidant potential of men and women sera by 2. 7 &#x 25; () and 5. 1 &#x 25; (). The study timescale may have been too short to enable demonstration of effects on fasting plasma glucose and HbA 1 c outcomes. Green tea regimen could form part of a healthy lifestyle that might ameliorate features of metabolic syndrome and subsequent risks for diabetes and its complications.
