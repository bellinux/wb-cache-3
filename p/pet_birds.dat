These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} Gouldian finches has {{decreased}} quite dramatically during the 20th century. Their habitat {{has been reduced}} or altered. Early research indicated a parasite called the air sac mite {{was responsible for the}} decline of the species. This is no longer considered to be a major factor. In general, Gouldian finches are susceptible to diseases and viral infections. Their beautiful colours mean that they are easily caught by predators. Fires are listed as the primary threat to the natural populations. The total number of Gouldian finches altogether is not low, however, because they are among the most popular <b>pet</b> <b>birds,</b> and are bred in captivity for the pet trade.|$|E

25|$|Modern Western sources {{recommend}} keeping pet crickets in transparent jars {{or small}} terrariums providing {{at least two}} inches of soil for burrowing and containing egg-crate shells or similar objects for shelter. A cricket's life span is short: Development from an egg to imago takes from one to two months. The imago then lives for around one month. Cricket hobbyists have to frequently replace aging insects with younger ones which are either specifically bred for cricket fighting or caught in the wild. This makes crickets less appealing as pets in Western countries. The speed of growth, coupled with the ease of breeding and raising larvae, makes industrial-grown crickets a preferred and inexpensive food source for <b>pet</b> <b>birds,</b> reptiles, and spiders.|$|E
25|$|Parrots may {{not make}} good pets for most people because of their natural wild {{instincts}} such as screaming and chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, they often become aggressive when mature (partly due to mishandling and poor training) and may bite, causing serious injury. For this reason, parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed through at least five homes before reaching their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. The parrots' ability to mimic human words and their bright colours and beauty prompt impulse buying from unsuspecting consumers. The domesticated budgerigar, a small parrot, {{is the most popular}} of all pet bird species. In 1992, the newspaper USA Today published that 11 million <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> were in the United States alone, many of them parrots. Europeans kept birds matching the description of the rose-ringed parakeet (or called the ring-necked parrot), documented particularly in a first-century account by Pliny the Elder. As they have been prized for thousands of years for their beauty and ability to talk, they have also often been misunderstood. For example, author Wolfgang de Grahl says in his 1987 book The Grey Parrot that some importers had parrots drink only coffee while they were shipped by boat, believing that pure water was detrimental and that their actions would increase survival rates during shipping. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted that the caffeine in coffee is toxic to birds.|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{relationship}} between <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping and lung cancer according to exposure to tobacco smoking {{was investigated in}} a case-control study in hospitals of New York City and Washington, DC, USA. Newly diagnosed lung cancer cases (n = 887) aged 40 - 79 years were compared with 1350 controls with diseases not related to smoking, of the same age, gender and date of admission as the cases. The prevalence of <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping was 12. 5 % in men and 19. 1 % in women. There was no association between ever keeping a <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> and lung cancer in never smokers (men adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0. 70, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 0. 15 - 3. 17; women, 1. 32, 95 % Cl 0. 65 - 2. 70), or in smokers and non-smokers combined, after adjustment for ever smoking (men: 1. 28, 95 % Cl 0. 88 - 1. 86; women: 1. 17, 95 % Cl 0. 83 - 1. 64; all: 1. 21, 95 % Cl 0. 95 - 1. 56). Risk did not increase in relation to duration of <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping. Cases and controls kept similar types of birds. There was a tenfold increase of lung cancer risk associated with smoking among non-bird keepers (adjusted OR = 9. 15). There was no indication of a synergism, either additive or multiplicative, between smoking and <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping with respect to lung cancer risk. Either alone or in conjunction with smoking, keeping parakeets, canaries, finches or parrots is not {{a risk factor for}} lung cancer among hospital patients i...|$|R

60|$|On the {{following}} day the crisis came. We were once more gathered in the room--all but Kua-ko and another of the men, {{who had not yet}} returned from some expedition--and for the space of half an hour not a word was spoken by anyone. Something was expected; even the children were strangely still, and whenever one of the <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> strayed in at the open door, uttering a little plaintive note, it was chased out again, but without a sound. At length Runi straightened himself on his seat and fixed his eyes on me; then cleared his throat and began a long harangue, delivered in the loud, monotonous singsong which I knew so well and which meant that the occasion was an important one. And as is usual in such efforts, the same thought and expressions were used again and again, and yet again, with dull, angry insistence. The orator of Guayana to be impressive must be long, however little he may have to say. Strange as it may seem, I listened critically to him, not without a feeling of scorn at his lower intelligence. But I was easier in my mind now. From the very fact of his addressing such a speech to me I was convinced that he wished not to take my life, and would not do so if I could clear myself of the suspicion of treachery.|$|E
60|$|At Willersey, a Mr Andrews, a {{lover of}} birds who owns a large garden and orchard in the village, gave me an {{entertaining}} account of a pet wood owl he once had. He had it as a young bird and never confined it. As a rule it {{spent most of the}} daylight hours in an apple loft, coming forth when the sun was low to fly about the grounds until it found him, when it would perch on his shoulder and spend the evening in his company. In one thing this owl differed from most <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> which are allowed to have their liberty: he made no difference between the people of the house and those who were not of it; he would fly on to anybody's shoulder, although he only addressed his hunger-cry to those who were accustomed to feed him. As he roamed at will all over the place he became well known to every one, and on account of his beauty and perfect confidence he grew to be something of a village pet. But short days with long, dark evenings--and how dark they can be in a small, tree-shaded, lampless village!--wrought a change in the public feeling about the owl. He was always abroad in the evening, gliding about unseen in the darkness on downy silent wings, and very suddenly dropping on to the shoulder of any person--man, woman, or child--who happened to be out of doors. Men would utter savage maledictions when they felt the demon claws suddenly clutch them; girls shrieked and fled to the nearest cottage, into which they would rush, palpitating with terror. Then there would be a laugh, for it was only the tame owl; but the same terror would be experienced on the next occasion, and young women and children were afraid to venture out after nightfall lest the ghostly creature with luminous eyes should pop down upon them.|$|E
