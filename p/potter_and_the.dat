5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series.

Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E
