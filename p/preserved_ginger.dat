'But,' {{says that}} fidgety person, the {{hypothetical}} objector (whom one always sets {{up for the}} express purpose of promptly knocking him down again), 'if it be the business of the fore part of the tongue to warn us against pungent and acrid substances, how comes it that we purposely use such things as mustard, pepper, curry-powder, and vinegar?' Well, in themselves all these things are, strictly speaking, bad for us; but in small quantities they act as agreeable stimulants; and we take care in preparing most of them to get rid of the most objectionable properties. Moreover, we use them, not as foods, but merely as condiments. One drop of oil of capsicums is enough to kill a man, if taken undiluted; but in actual practice we buy it in such a very diluted form that comparatively little harm arises from using it. Still, very young children dislike all these violent stimulants, even in small quantities; they won't touch mustard, pepper, or vinegar, and they recoil at once from wine or spirits. It is only by slow degrees that we learn these unnatural tastes, as our nerves get blunted and our palates jaded; and we all know that the old Indian who can eat nothing but dry curries, devilled biscuits, anchovy paste, pepper-pot, mulligatawny soup, Worcestershire sauce, <b>preserved</b> <b>ginger,</b> hot pickles, fiery sherry, and neat cognac, is also a person with no digestion, a fragmentary liver, and very little chance of getting himself accepted by any safe and solvent insurance office. Throughout, the warning in itself is a useful one; it is we who foolishly and persistently disregard it. Alcohol, for example, tells us at once that it is bad for us; yet we manage so to dress it up with flavouring matters and dilute it with water that we overlook the fiery character of the spirit itself. But that alcohol is in itself a bad thing (when freely indulged in) has been so abundantly demonstrated in the history of mankind that it hardly needs any further proof.|$|E

The aroma of ginger is pleasant and spicy and the flavour penetrating, pungent and slightly biting due to antiseptic and pungent compounds present in it that is why, it is used for manufacturing various products like ginger oil, oleoresin, <b>ginger</b> candy, <b>ginger</b> <b>preserve</b> or ‘murabba’, <b>ginger</b> pickle etc. In Ayurvedic medical system, ginger {{is considered to be}} carminative, stimulant, aphrodisiac, anti-flatulent, appetizer and good for heart. It reduces Kapha and Vatha (Pruthi 1998). A well-distributed rainfall during growing season and dry period before harvesting are required for large scale-cultivation of the crop. In areas receiving less rainfall, the crop needs regular irrigation. Moisture {{is one of the major}} biotic factors, which affect production of crop. Long dry spells during rainy season and few or no irrigation facilities after rains, often reduces crop yield drastically. Traditional crop like paddy though offer a low risk and require less technical input, yields low economic returns. Ginger besides being higher yielding crop, fetches great price in market, thereby provides more income to the growers. However, cultivation of ginger under rainfed conditions involves high risk and need some moisture conservation techniques to reduce moisture losses specifically during the crop period after the rains. Covering of soil with organic and inorganic materials prevents the extreme changes in soil temperature and creates a micro environment such in which moisture loss through evaporation comes down. Besides, mulching control weed infestation, reduce run off and soil loss, improves physical, chemical and biological properties of soil which leads to better yield of crop (Singh et al., 1976, Aggarwa...|$|R

Zingiber officinale(ginger), a spice and herbal medicine, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study has investigated the effects of ginger against DZN-induced testicular toxicity. Methods: Thirty two adult male mice were randomly divided into four groups. The control group; ginger group (200 mg/kg); DZN group (10 mg/kg) and ginger + DZN group. Ginger and DZN were received for 30 consecutive days by gavage and DZN treat one hour after receiving ginger. Sperm parameters, testosterone levels, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical assays of testis were evaluated. Results: The results revealed that treatment with DZN caused significant damage of sperm parameters (sperm motility, count, viability rate and abnormalities), increased oxidative stress (increased MDA and decreased GSH level), significant histopathological changes and decreased Johnsen’s Score, testosterone level and increased caspase- 3 immunoreactivity. <b>Ginger</b> <b>preserved</b> sperm parameters and mitigated the toxic effects of DZN. Also, pretreatment with ginger significantly reduced caspase- 3 immunoreactivity. Conclusion: Our results concluded that ginger probably with its antioxidant activity and scavenging free radicals protect against DZN-induced testicular toxicity...|$|R

Yesterday we were alarmed with the Queen's being ill: she had an aguish and feverish fit; and you never saw such countenances as we all had, such dismal melancholy. Her {{physicians}} from town were sent for, but towards night she grew better; to-day she missed her fit, and was up: we are not now in any fear; {{it will be at}} worst but an ague, and we hope even that will not return. Lord Treasurer would not come here from London, because it would make a noise if he came before his usual time, which is Saturday, and he goes away on Mondays. The Whigs have lost a great support in the Earl of Godolphin.(4) It is a good jest to hear the Ministers talk of him now with humanity and pity, because he is dead, and can do them no more hurt. Lady Orkney,(5) the late King's mistress (who lives at a fine place, five miles from hence, called Cliffden(6)), and I, are grown mighty acquaintance. She is the wisest woman I ever saw; and Lord Treasurer made great use of her advice in the late change of affairs. I heard Lord Marlborough is growing ill of his diabetes; which, if it be true, may soon carry him off; and then the Ministry will be something more at ease. MD {{has been a long time}} without writing to Pdfr, though they have not the same cause: it is seven weeks since your last came to my hands, which was N.32, that you may not be mistaken. I hope Ppt has not wanted her health. You were then drinking waters. The doctor tells me I must go into a course of steel, though I have not the spleen; for that they can never give me, though I have as much provocation to it as any man alive. Bernage's(7) regiment is broke; but he is upon half-pay. I have not seen him this long time; but I suppose he is overrun with melancholy. My Lord Shrewsbury is certainly designed to be Governor of Ireland; and I believe the Duchess will please the people there mightily. The Irish Whig leaders promise great things to themselves from his government; but care shall be taken, if possible, to prevent them. Mrs. Fenton(8) has writ to me that she has been forced to leave Lady Giffard, and come to town, for a rheumatism: that lady does not love to be troubled with sick people. Mrs. Fenton writes to me as one dying, and desires I would think of her son: I have not answered her letter. She is retired(9) to Mrs. Povey's. Is my aunt alive yet? and do you ever see her? I suppose she has forgot the loss of her son. Is Raymond's new house quite finished? and does he squander as he used to do? Has he yet spent all his wife's fortune? I hear there are five or six people putting strongly in for my livings; God help them! But if ever the Court should give me anything, I would recommend Raymond to the Duke of Ormond; not for any particular friendship to him, but because it would be proper for the minister of Trim to have Laracor. You may keep the gold-studded snuff-box now; for my brother Hill, Governor of Dunkirk, has sent me the finest that ever you saw.(10) It is allowed at Court that none in England comes near it, though it did not cost above twenty pounds. And the Duchess of Hamilton has made me pockets for (it) like a woman's, with a belt and buckle (for, you know, I wear no waistcoat in summer), and there are several divisions, and one on purpose for my box, oh ho!--We have had most delightful weather this whole week; but illness and vomiting have hindered me from sharing in a great part of it. Lady Masham made the Queen send to Kensington for some of her <b>preserved</b> <b>ginger</b> for me, which I take in the morning, and hope it will do me good. Mrs. Brent(11) sent me a letter by a young fellow, a printer, desiring I would recommend him here, which you may tell her I have done: but I cannot promise what will come of it, for it is necessary they should be made free here(12) before they can be employed. I remember I put the boy prentice to Brent. I hope Parvisol has set my tithes well this year: he has writ nothing to me about it; pray talk to him of it when you see him, and let him give me an account how things are. I suppose the corn is now off the ground. I hope he has sold that great ugly horse. Why don't you sell to him? He keeps me at charges for horses that I never ride: yours is lame, and will never be good for anything. The Queen will stay here about a month longer, I suppose; but Lady Masham will go in ten days to lie in at Kensington. Poor creature, she fell down in the court here t'other day. She would needs walk across it upon some displeasure with her chairmen, and was likely to be spoiled so near her time; but we hope all is over for a black eye and a sore side: though I shall not be at ease till she is brought to bed. I find I can fill up a letter, some way or other, without a journal. If I had not a spirit naturally cheerful, I should be very much discontented at a thousand things. Pray God preserve MD's health, and Pdfr's, and that I may live far from the envy and discontent that attends those who are thought to have more favour at Courts than they really possess. Love Pdfr, who loves MD above all things. Farewell, deelest, ten thousand times deelest, MD MD MD, FW FW, ME ME ME ME. Lele, Lele, Lele, Lele.|$|E

60|$|As, {{whenever}} the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother {{took it to}} be an infallible sign that he ‘wanted support,’ the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit. It was a most wonderful closet, worthy of Cloisterham and of Minor Canon Corner. Above it, a portrait of Handel in a flowing wig beamed down at the spectator, with a knowing air of being up to the contents of the closet, and a musical air of intending to combine all its harmonies in one delicious fugue. No common closet with a vulgar door on hinges, openable all at once, and leaving nothing to be disclosed by degrees, this rare closet had a lock in mid-air, where two perpendicular slides met; the one falling down, and the other pushing up. The upper slide, on being pulled down (leaving the lower a double mystery), revealed deep shelves of pickle-jars, jam-pots, tin canisters, spice-boxes, and agreeably outlandish vessels of blue and white, the luscious lodgings of <b>preserved</b> tamarinds and <b>ginger.</b> Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach. The pickles, in a uniform of rich brown double-breasted buttoned coat, and yellow or sombre drab continuations, announced their portly forms, in printed capitals, as Walnut, Gherkin, Onion, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Mixed, and other members of that noble family. The jams, as being of a less masculine temperament, and as wearing curlpapers, announced themselves in feminine caligraphy, like a soft whisper, to be Raspberry, Gooseberry, Apricot, Plum, Damson, Apple, and Peach. The scene closing on these charmers, and the lower slide ascending, oranges were revealed, attended by a mighty japanned sugar-box, to temper their acerbity if unripe. Home-made biscuits waited at the Court of these Powers, accompanied by a goodly fragment of plum-cake, and various slender ladies’ fingers, to be dipped into sweet wine and kissed. Lowest of all, a compact leaden-vault enshrined the sweet wine and a stock of cordials: whence issued whispers of Seville Orange, Lemon, Almond, and Caraway-seed. There was a crowning air upon this closet of closets, of having been for ages hummed through by the Cathedral bell and organ, until those venerable bees had made sublimated honey of everything in store; and it was always observed that every dipper among the shelves (deep, as has been noticed, and swallowing up head, shoulders, and elbows) came forth again mellow-faced, and seeming to have undergone a saccharine transfiguration.|$|R

40|$|Ginger, an ‘incorrigible colonist’ since prehistoric times, was {{transported to}} Australia as both living plant and dried spice on the First Fleet. The spice was in great demand in Britain, and Joseph Banks {{considered}} the plant a potential economic crop {{for the new}} colony. From the early 19 th century, Chinese settlers also brought ginger rhizomes with them. This thesis provides a commodity history of ginger, focusing on ginger growing {{and the use of}} ginger in Australia from 1788 to the mid- 20 th century. Both British and Chinese settlers arrived in Australia determined to maintain their traditional culinary and medical practices, which required large quantities of ginger. The thesis argues that it was the extent of this demand, together with suitable growing conditions, which eventually led to the establishment of an Australian ginger industry. It highlights the important part played by Chinese settlers, and adds to the written history of Australian culinary and medical practices. The Australian story is set in the context of ginger’s long-standing importance in China, India and Britain. Ginger has been indispensible to Chinese and Indian medicine and food since antiquity, {{and it was one of}} the earliest spices to reach the West. The thesis begins by exploring ginger in China and India, and then follows the spice from India through ancient Greece and Rome to Britain, where ginger became used widely in both food and medicine. It also traces the much later journey of the plant from India to the West Indies and then to hothouses in Britain, from where it was brought to Australia. Ginger was grown in the first garden in Sydney. As settlements were established further north, ginger thrived in Australia’s sub-tropical and tropical areas. Despite this, and considerable efforts by governments to persuade farmers to grow ginger commercially, a large-scale Australian ginger industry was not established until the mid- 20 th century. A major obstacle was that the British required ginger in dried and preserved forms, and processing had to be carried out close to the source of production. Chinese settlers also grew ginger, but Chinese and European ginger growing enterprises were carried out almost completely independently, with little communication. While Chinese gardeners supplied much of the Chinese need for fresh ginger, the Chinese also required ginger in dried and preserved forms. From the beginning of European settlement, large quantities of dried and <b>preserved</b> <b>ginger</b> were imported to meet the ever-increasing demands. As Australians continued British culinary practices, home cooks and food manufacturers used ginger extensively in a variety of cakes and puddings, jams and preserves, condiments and curries, and beverages. Chinese settlers, too, maintained their own food traditions. In addition, ginger continued to be valued for its medicinal properties. Traditional British and Chinese medical practices involved the widespread use of ginger for essentially the same purposes, principally to treat cold-related illnesses, as a digestive, and as a stimulant. The thesis provides compelling evidence that ginger remained in great demand in food and medicine for the period studied. Thesis (Ph. D.)
