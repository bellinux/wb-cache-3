30|$|We {{now know}} that the <b>prominences</b> form the core of most CMEs. After the {{demonstration}} by Janssen and Lockyer in 1868 that <b>prominences</b> can be observed outside of eclipses using spectroscopes, the knowledge on <b>prominences</b> grew rapidly. By 1871, Secchi classified <b>prominences</b> into active and quiescent <b>prominences.</b> By 1892, it was a common knowledge that <b>prominences</b> erupted with speeds exceeding 100  s of km/s (from Tandberg-Hanssen 1995). The disk counterpart of eruptive <b>prominences</b> was termed as disparition brusque (DB) by d’Azambuja and d’Azambuja (1948).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} of solar <b>prominences</b> show that slow upward motions (≌ 1 kms^) occur through quiescent <b>prominences</b> and a fast input of material with horizontal motions (≌ 5 kms^) occurs at both edges of <b>prominences.</b> A time-dependent dynamical model of solar <b>prominences</b> with current sheet is investigated. It is natural {{extension of the}} magnetostatic models proposed by Kippenhahn and Schluter (KS) and Kuperus and Raadu (KR). It is shown that horizontal nonlinear oscillations can exist in the <b>prominences.</b> The global structure of current sheet including solar wind plasmas is also simulated by means of full MHD equations...|$|R
40|$|A {{necessary}} condition {{for the formation of}} <b>prominences</b> is established where components of the magnetic field of opposite sign lie juxtaposed. This condition is sometimes recognizable prior to the formation of <b>prominences</b> in active centers and between adjacent active centers in H-alpha by paths of fibrils aligned nearly end to end. <b>Prominences</b> are usually not found in active regions until they are about 4 days old. After this time, the number of <b>prominences</b> appears to be a function of the large-scale complexities in the magnetic field pattern whether these are a result of emerging flux, the merging of adjacent active centers, or the coalescing of remnant fields of active centers. <b>Prominences</b> may disappear by the slow or rapid flow of mass into the chromosphere or by the more violent eruptives. The formation of new active centers has been associated with the eruption of some filaments related to weak chromospheric fields...|$|R

50|$|The {{result of}} {{emerging}} twisted flux tubes {{from the interior}} of the sun cause twisted magnetic structures in the corona, which then lead to solar <b>prominences.</b> Solar <b>prominences</b> are modeled using twisted magnetic flux tubes known as flux ropes.|$|R
40|$|Spectra and spectroheliograms of <b>prominences</b> {{have been}} {{obtained}} at wavelengths of 300 to 1400 A from instruments aboard the OSO 4 and OSO 6 spacecraft. Quiescent <b>prominences</b> appear in emission above the limb for all strong lines formed at temperatures below 300, 000 K, but not at higher temperatures. The gas pressure in the 100, 000 -K transition zone around <b>prominences</b> is approximately equal {{to that in the}} cooler (6500 K) central regions. The temperature and the hydrogen ground-state departure coefficient in the central regions are determined from the Lyman-continuum spectrum. <b>Prominences</b> on the disk (filaments) are visible in absorption in many lines, especially those at wavelengths below the hydrogen Lyman limit at 912 A...|$|R

5|$|Decades {{of civil}} war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly {{to the demise of}} the old {{aristocracy}} of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in <b>prominence</b> during {{the early part of the}} 1st century. One such family, the Flavians, or gens Flavia, rose from relative obscurity to <b>prominence</b> in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Domitian's great-grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar's civil war.

The results imply that <b>prominences</b> may form in globally magnetohydrodynamic-stable magnetic loops with very low field twist. Also, <b>prominences</b> are more likely to form in a region of weaker area-averaged magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Large-scale coronal {{structures}} (helmet streamers) {{observed in}} the white-light corona during total solar eclipses and/or with ground-based coronagraphs are mostly located only above a quiescent type of <b>prominences.</b> These helmet streamers are maintained due the magnetic fields of the Sun. Time-latitudinal distribution of <b>prominences</b> during a solar cycle, however, shows both the poleward and equatorward migrations, similarly as the 530. 3 nm emission corona (the green corona) intensities. Distribution of observed coronal helmet streamers during total solar eclipses, enlarged with the helmet streamers as were obtained by the ground-based coronagraph observations, are compared with the heliographic distribution of <b>prominences</b> and the green corona intensities for the first time. It is shown that the distribution of above mentioned helmet streamers, reflects – roughly- the time-latitudinal distribution of <b>prominences</b> and emission corona branches, and migrates together with them over a solar cycle...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the <b>prominence</b> of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the <b>prominence</b> of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{magnetic}} field in <b>prominences</b> from a statistical point of view, by using THEMIS in the MTR mode, performing spectropolarimetry of the He I D 3 line. Combining these measurements with spectroscopic data from IRIS, Hinode/EIS as well as ground-based telescopes, such as the Meudon Solar Tower, we infer the temperature, density, and flow velocities of the plasma. There {{are a number of}} open questions that we aim to answer: What is the general direction of {{the magnetic field}} in <b>prominences?</b> Is the model using a single orientation of magnetic field always valid for atypical <b>prominences?</b> %-	Does this depend on the location of the filament on the disk (visible in Hα, in He II 304 Å) over an inversion line between weak or strong network ? - Are <b>prominences</b> in a weak environment field dominated by gas pressure? -	Measuring the Doppler shifts in Mg II lines (with IRIS) and in Hα can tell us if there are substantial velocities to maintain vertical rotating structures, as has been suggested for tornado-like <b>prominences.</b> We present here some results obtained with different ground-based and space-based instruments in this framework...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the origins}} of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) show a strong {{association}} between CMEs and erupting <b>prominences.</b> 'Loop' CMEs form the most common morphological class for both Skylab and Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and the class most likely to be associated with erupting <b>prominences.</b> In the optically thin corona, the geometry of such structures is interpreted as either planar (two-dimensional), shell-like, or bubblelike (three-dimensional) structures. Trottet and MacQueen (1980) (hereinafter referred to as TM) first examined the orientations of <b>prominences</b> associated with Skylab CMEs and argued that looplike CMEs were planar structures in the plane of the sky. In this work, the initial orientations of <b>prominences</b> identified with SMM CMEs in 1980 were measured in order to examine the overall geometry of CMEs. Contrary to TM's result, no preferred orientation for <b>prominences</b> associated with SMM CMEs nor any difference between that population and the population of all disk filaments were found. In addition, plots comparing CME/filament orientation angles and the angular widths of the CME envelopes show large scatter. Taken together, these results support a shell-like rather than a planar geometry for at least looplike CMEs...|$|R
