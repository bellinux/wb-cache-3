40|$|Dealing {{with the}} <b>premium</b> <b>risk</b> problem is one ofthe main issues in private health {{insurance}} con-tracts in a long-term perspective.

Second, the share of individuals in a birth cohort who have turned chronically ill and, thus, represent high risks, rises.

40|$|The market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} but elusive parameters in finance. It is also called equity premium, market <b>premium</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>premium.</b> The term 'market risk premium' is difficult to understand because it is used to designate three different concepts: 1) Required market <b>risk</b> <b>premium,</b> which is the incremental return of a diversified portfolio (the market) over the risk-free rate (return of treasury bonds) required by an investor. It is needed for calculating the required return to equity (cost of equity). 2) Historical market <b>risk</b> <b>premium,</b> which is the historical differential return of the stock market over treasury bonds. 3) Expected market <b>risk</b> <b>premium,</b> which is the expected differential return of the stock market over treasury bonds. Many authors and finance practitioners assume that the expected market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is equal to the historical market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> and to the required market <b>risk</b> <b>premium.</b> The CAPM assumes that the required market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is equal to the expected market <b>risk</b> <b>premium.</b> However, the three concepts are different. The historical market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is equal for all investors, but the required and the expected market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> are different for different investors.

On the statistical side we improve on the methodology in QIS 3 by defining company specific estimators for all quantities of interest including <b>premium</b> <b>risk</b> and reserve risk volatilities as well as correlation coefficients at the granularity level of lines of business. We develop the non-life Solvency II economic capital formula applying both the value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measures under a log-normal distribution of the portfolio combined ratio, which {{is defined as the}} ratio of incurred claims inclusive “run-off ” to the premium and reserve volume. We determine confidence levels under which both methods yield approximately identical practical results. Moreover, we point out that economic capital modeling should neither be restricted to a log-normal distribution assumption nor to the VaR and CVaR risk measures and refer to the actuarial literature for various extensions on this. The portfolio combined ratio is decomposed in a weighted sum of the <b>premium</b> <b>risk</b> ratio and the reserve risk ratio as suggested in QIS 3. Based on the basic portfolio risk ratio model summarized in the Appendix, we propose simple weighted estimators for all volatilities and correlation coefficients of interest.

Of particular interest, the <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is increasing in the term structure slope; however, for either small or negative slopes, the <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is much more sensitive to changes in interest rates.
