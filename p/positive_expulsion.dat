Analyses must assess the draining efficiencies of such devices, because the minimization of supply tank residual contents is of the essence. Settling accelerations, passive expulsion, and <b>positive</b> <b>expulsion</b> methods of fluid control have all been successfully demonstrated in orbit.

40|$|Four Arde conospheroid {{metallic}} diaphragms {{were tested}} at NASA {{to evaluate their}} capability {{for use in the}} orbit adjust propulsion subsystem (OAPS) of the Atmosphere Explorer spacecraft (AE's C, D, and E). The diaphragms will be used for <b>positive</b> propellant <b>expulsion</b> and spacecraft center of mass (c. m.) control. A leak-free cycle life capability of nine reversals was demonstrated. The diaphragms rolled smoothly from ring to ring in a predictable manner on the first reversal. Varying amounts of diaphragm cocking and ring skipping were observed on subsequent reversals. The diaphragm pressure differential did not exceed 10 psid during any reversal. Cycle life capability, reversal mode, and pressure differential were not affected by sudden reversals, environmental tests, or 18, 000 partial reversals. An expulsion efficiency of approximately 97 percent was demonstrated. The results of these tests show that metallic diaphragms can be used as an effective means of positive fuel expulsion; however, to achieve spacecraft c. m. control, the diaphragm must not be reversed prior to flight...|$|R
40|$|Illegal {{migrants}} {{supply a}} valuable productive input: effort. But {{their status as}} illegals means that these migrants face a strictly <b>positive</b> probability of <b>expulsion.</b> A return to {{their country of origin}} entails reduced earnings when the wage at origin is lower than the wage at destination. This prospect induces illegal migrants to exert more work effort than comparable workers who face no such prospect. The lower the probable, alternative earnings, the harsher the penalty that illegal migrants will be subjected to upon their return, for a given probability of expulsion, and the higher the level of effort they will exert at destination. While the home-country wage that awaits the illegal migrants upon their return is exogenous to the host country, the probability of their return is not. Given the home-country wage, a higher probability of expulsion will induce illegal migrants to supply more effort. Hence, different combinations of probabilities of expulsion and home-country wages yield the same level of effort. Thus, variation in the extent to which receiving countries undertake measures aimed at apprehending and expelling illegal migrants can be attributed not to characteristics of the illegal migrants themselves but to a feature that pertains to the illegal migrants' country of origin.

40|$|Abstract. Effect of elastic modulus, {{yield stress}} and {{elongation}} percentage on buckling of spherical-cone diaphragm for <b>positive</b> <b>expulsion</b> tank has been analyzed by FEM based on orthogonal test, which highly decrease test {{numbers on the}} premise of validity of results. Numerical results are listed as follows: elastic modulus takes marked effect on buckling of diaphragm while yield stress and elongation percentage hardly affect buckling value of structure. As a result, larger elastic modulus will make for structural stability; different buckling values and modalities of structure are very close, which means that structural behavior is very sensitive to imperfections; local buckling of structure presents in column section, which avails to diaphragm inverting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The shperical-cylindrica metal {{diaphragm}} model is established to simulate with {{finite element analysis}} method in the large displacement for the elastic-plastic theory, {{which is based on}} the current research on the {{metal diaphragm}} for <b>positive</b> <b>expulsion</b> tanks. It shows that the unsteady state on the position of rolling is the main reason for the failure of the diaphragm. Based on the optimization to metal diaphragm's structure, The ring-stiffened metal diaphragm model is established to reduce the unsteady state. The simulation result concludes that the optimization can reduce the unsteady state effectively, which also provides the reference for the improving design of metal diaphragm...|$|E

Emphasized is {{the description of the}} unique features involving new space-flight concepts, procedures, and design incorporated in Skylab. The water supplied to the three Skylab missions was preloaded in stainless-steel tanks. These tanks were fitted with <b>positive</b> <b>expulsion</b> stainless-steel bellows. In-flight iodination of the water, for bacterial control, was accomplished as required. An in-flight bactericide monitor was used periodically to determine the level of bactericide in the water.

40|$|High-cycle life ring-reinforced {{hemispherical}} type <b>positive</b> <b>expulsion</b> diaphragm {{performance was}} demonstrated by room temperature fluid expulsion tests of 13 " diameter, 8 mil thick stainless steel configurations. A maximum of eleven (11) leak-free, fluid expulsions were achieved by a 25 deg cone angle diaphragm hoop-reinforced with. 110 -inch cross-sectional diameter wires. This represents a 70 % improvement in diaphragm reversal cycle life compared to results previously obtained. The reversal tests confirmed analytic predictions for diaphragm cycle life increases due to increasing values of diaphragm cone angle, radius to thickness ratio and material strain to necking capacity. Practical fabrication techniques were demonstrated for forming close-tolerance, thin corrugated shells and for obtaining closely controlled reinforcing ring stiffness required to maximize diaphragm cycle life. A non-destructive inspection technique for monitoring large local shell bending strains was developed...|$|E
40|$|Future long-duration {{missions}} to Mars using in situ resource production to obtain oxygen from the Martian atmosphere {{for use as}} a propellant or for life support will require long term oxygen storage facilities. This report describes preliminary analysis of design concepts for lightweight, collapsible liquid oxygen storage tanks to be used on the surface of Mars. With storage at relatively low pressures, an inflatable tank concept in which the cryogen is stored within a fiber-reinforced Teflon FEP bladder is an efficient approach. The technology required for such a tank is well-developed through similar previous applications in <b>positive</b> <b>expulsion</b> bladders for zero-g liquid fuel rocket tanks and inflatable space habitat technology, though the liquid oxygen environment presents unique challenges. The weight of the proposed structure is largely dominated by the support structure needed to hold the tank off the ground and permit a vacuum insulation space to be maintained around the tank. In addition to the inflatable tank concept, telescoping tank concepts are studied. For a telescoping tank, the greatest difficulty is in making effective joints and seals. The use of shape memory alloy to produce a passive clamping ring is evaluated. Although the telescoping tank concepts are a viable option, it appears that inflatable tank concepts will be more efficient and are recommended...|$|E
40|$|An integrated, generic unibody {{composite}} pressurized structure (UCPS) {{combined with}} a <b>positive</b> <b>expulsion</b> device (PED), consisting of an elastomeric bladder for monopropellant hydrazine, has been quasi-standardized for spacecraft use. The combination functions as an all-composite, non-metallic, propellant tank with bladder. The integrated UCPS combines several previous innovations - specifically, the linerless, all-composite cryogenic tank technology; all-composite boss; resin formulation; and integrated stringer system. The innovation combines the UCPS with an integrated propellant management device (PMD), the PED or bladder, to create an entirely unique system for in-space use. The UCPS is a pressure vessel that incorporates skirts, stringers, and other structures {{so that it is}} both an in-space hydrazine tank, and also a structural support system for a spacecraft in a single, all-composite unit. This innovation builds on the progress {{in the development of a}} previous SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) Phase I with Glenn Research Center and an SBIR III with Johnson Space Center that included the fabrication of two 42 -in. (107 -cm) diameter all-composite cryogenic (LOX and liquid methane) UCPS test tanks for a lunar lander. This Phase II provides hydra zine compatibility testing of the elastomeric bladder, a see-through PED to validate the expulsion process and model, and a complete UCPS-based PED with stringers and skirts that will be used to conduct initial qualification and expulsion tests. This extends the UCPS technology to include hydrazine-based, in-space pro - pulsion applications and can also be used for electric propulsion. This innovation creates a system that, in comparison to the traditional approach, is lower in weight, cost, volume, and production time; is stronger; and is capable of much higher pressures. It also has fewer failure modes, and is applicable to both chemical and electric propulsion systems...|$|E
