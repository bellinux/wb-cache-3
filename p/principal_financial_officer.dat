We base our measure of investor response on unsigned market-adjusted daily excess return around those events and compare these responses with identical measures for the same companies and reports in prior periods. We use unsigned excess return because we expect investors to respond in different ways to the certification requirements. We also test for variation in investor response {{on the basis of a}} proxy for the quality of financial reporting and subject the analyses to a number of controls and robustness checks. These tests help assure us that the effects we document are in {{response to the}} SEC requirement rather than to other...|$|R
