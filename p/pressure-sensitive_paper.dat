40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} static {{upper eyelid}} pressure and con-tact with the ocular surface {{in a group}} of young adult subjects. METHODS. Static upper eyelid pressure was measured for 11 sub-jects using a piezoresistive pressure sensor attached to a rigid contact lens. Measures of eyelid pressure were derived from an active pressure cell (1. 14 -mm square) beneath the central upper eyelid margin. To investigate the contact region between the upper eyelid and the ocular surface, the authors used <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> and the lissamine-green staining of Marx’s line. These measures, combined with the pressure sensor readings, were used to derive estimates of eyelid pressure. RESULTS. The mean contact width between the eyelids and the ocular surface estimated using <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> was 0. 60 0. 16 mm, whereas the mean width of Marx’s line was 0. 09 0. 02 mm. The mean central upper eyelid pressure wa...|$|E
30|$|Materials such as wax, occlusal {{registration}} paper, and <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> {{are used}} to examine occlusal contact. The present study utilized an examination method using silicone [11, 12, 16]. The Blue Silicone {{used in the present}} study is a cartridge type, which allows a nearly constant mixing ratio to be maintained, it has low viscosity and thus flows well, and it shows little dimensional change over time. It therefore fully met the requirements for a material for registration of occlusal contact status.|$|E

40|$|This {{monograph}} briefly {{describes a}} sampling of tools and technologies {{that can be used}} by adults with learning disabilities to improve their functional capabilities in employment, educational, or personal settings. Stressed is the importance of evaluating each technology in terms of the individual's unique profile, the function to be performed, and the particular context in which the technology will be applied. The assistive technologies are grouped according to the following functional areas: (1) organizational skills, memory, managing personal information, time management, and staying on task, through use of such devices as beepers/buzzers, tape recorders, and index cards; (2) auditory/listening management through use of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> for classroom note-taking, a laptop computer for notetakirig, and books on disc; (3) visual processing through use of tape recordings...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} apparatus {{has been}} developed that simulates horizontal and vertical brushing movements at various pressures on anterior and posterior shaped teeth. Cleaning efficiency or interproximal access is scored by measuring the removal of soft deposits on <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> placed around the simulated teeth. In this study, 14 different brushes with varying designs and textures were evaluated. All toothbrushes tested displayed consistent performance across the 3 main factors of brushing motion, tooth shape, and brushing pressure. Cleaning efficiency improved with softer texture and increasing pressure. V-shaped brushes had better interproximal access on posterior shaped teeth, whereas traight multitufted brushes tended to show improved cleaning efficiency scores on anterior shaped teeth. With bristle textures labeled soft, medium, and firm, V-shaped brushes had significantly better cleaning efficiency than straight multitufted toothbrushes of corresponding texture...|$|E
30|$|Estimating the {{thickness}} (or height) of the voids left after matching the walls is difficult. Recalibrating the topographic data acquired {{on each of}} the walls is problematic due to {{the thickness}} of the very small voids compared to the different undulations and irregularities of each wall. From a mechanical standpoint, some authors have limited themselves to estimating the contact zones: area and distribution. Among these methods are those based on the distribution of temperatures using thermocouples (Teufel and Logan 1978), on resistance to the passage of an electric current from one wall to the other (Power and Hencher 1996) and on the impression of the contact zones obtained with <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> (Duncan and Hancock 1966) or deformable film (Iwai 1976; Bandis et al. 1983). Methods of injecting the fracture using a metal alloy with a low melting point, such as Wood’s metal (Pyrak-Nolte et al. 1987; Yasuhara et al. 2006), also restrict the information obtained to binary data: injectable or contact zone. Furthermore, it does not enable reuse of the fracture after injection.|$|E

40|$|Scramjets {{have become}} a main focus of study for many researchers, due to their {{application}} as propulsive devices in hypersonic flight. This entails a detailed understanding of the fluid mechanics involved {{to be able to}} design and operate these engines with maximum efficiency even at their off-design conditions. It is the objective of the present cold-flow investigation to study and analyse experimentally the mechanics of the fluid structures encountered within a generic scramjet inlet at M = 5. Traditionally, researchers have to rely on stream-thrust analysis, which requires the complex setup of a mass flow meter, a force balance and a heat transducer in order to measure inlet-isolator performance. Alternatively, the pitot rake could be positioned at inlet-isolator exit plane, but this method is intrusive to the flow, and the number of pitot tubes is limited by the model size constraint. Thus, this urgent need for a better flow diagnostics method is addressed in this <b>paper.</b> <b>Pressure-sensitive</b> paint (PSP) has been applied to investigate the flow characteristics on the compression ramp, isolator surface and isolator sidewall. Numerous shock-shock interactions, corner and shoulder separation regions, as well as shock trains were captured by the luminescent system. The performance of the scramjet inlet-isolator has been shown to improve when operated in a modest angle of attack...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} pressure-sensitive labels for library application, techniques, and considerations for their removal from paper substrates. The aim was to use information from the literature to design a method for the removal of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> labels from <b>paper</b> covered half bindings using agar, commonly known as agar-agar, as a solvent gel. The study is divided into two parts: a literature study with the aim to compile information relevant to the purpose of the study, and a case study for the removal of barcodes from three books made available by the Humanities Library of Gothenburg University Library. To analyse the barcodes, stereo microscopy, Attenuated Total Reflectance – Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and spot tests were conducted. Agar was subsequently tested and evaluated as a solvent gel in a practical removal. Analysis of the barcodes on the studied books showed that they are built-up of three layers with a pressure-sensitive adhesive closest matching that of a poly(methyl acrylate) emulsion. A 2 % agar gel was divided into three batches and mixed with 20 % ethanol, 20 % 1 : 1 acetone:ethanol, and 29 % ethyl acetate. While all of the removals were considered somewhat effective, the ethyl acetate agar gel gave the best results with the least damage to the surface layer of the paper. Based on the evaluation it could be concluded that agar shows great promise as a solvent gel. The study showed that issues to take into consideration can be roughly divided into three aspects: 1) the purpose of the label, and historic circumstances related to the label; 2) whether the label obscures or contains information crucial to the interpretation of the object as an entity; and 3) damages caused, or potential damages that might arise from its continued adherance to the substrate.

40|$|Water-jet {{cavitation}} peening (WCP) is a {{new technology}} for the surface modification of metallic materials. The cavitation behavior in this process involves complex and changeable physics phenomena, such as high speed, high pressure, multiple phases, phase transition, turbulence, and unstable features. Thus, the cavitation behavior and impact-pressure distribution in WCP have always been key problems in this field. Numerous factors affect the occurrence of cavitation. These factors include flow-boundary conditions, absolute pressure, flow velocity, flow viscosity, surface tension, and so on. Among these factors, pressure and vapor fraction are the most significant. Numerical simulations are performed to determine the flow-field characteristics of {{both inside and outside}} the cavitating nozzle of a submerged water jet. The factors that influence the cavitation intensity of pressure are simulated. Fujifilm <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> is used to measure the distribution of impact pressure along the jet direction during the WCP process. The results show that submerged cavitation jets can induce cavitation both inside and outside a conical nozzle and a convergent-divergent nozzle when the inlet pressure is 32 MPa. Moreover, the shock wave pressure induced by the collapse of the bubble group reaches up to 300 MPa...|$|E
40|$|Bulk {{allograft}} reconstruction {{plays an}} important role in limb-salvage surgery; however, non-union has been reported in up to 27 % of cases. The purpose of this study is to quantify average surface contact areas across simulated intraoperative osteotomies using both free-hand and computer-assisted navigation techniques. <b>Pressure-sensitive</b> <b>paper</b> was positioned between two cut ends of a validated composite sawbone and compression was applied using an eight-hole large fragment dynamic compression plate. Thirty-two samples were analyzed for surface area contact to determine osteotomy congruity. Mean contact area using the free-hand osteotomy technique was equal to 0. 21 square inches. Compared with a control of 0. 69 square inches, average contact area was found to be 30. 5 % of optimal surface contact. Mean contact area using computer-assisted navigation was equal to 0. 33 square inches. Compared with a control of 0. 76 square inches, average contact area was found to be 43. 7 % of optimal surface contact. Limited contact achieved using standard techniques may play a role in the high rate of observed non-union, and an increase in contact area using computer-assisted navigation may improve rates of bone healing. The development of an oncology software package and navigation hardware may serve an important role in decreasing non-union rates in limb salvage surgery...|$|E
