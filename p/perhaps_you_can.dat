500|$|As {{a result}} of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to {{cooperate}} with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. [...] Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. [...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would not, if I were you, get too far from the original, as the President likes it. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make him like it better." ...|$|E
500|$|Goal Auzeen Saedi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for Psychology Today, emphasized the show's influence saying that: [...] "The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become." [...] Saedi also questioned {{their decision to}} appear on the show and added: [...] "But if living life in the spotlight is so taxing and demands multiple justifications for the way your life is being lived and criticized, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take the cameras out of your house." [...] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: [...] "roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, {{but for the most part}} this show is the 100% drizzling poops." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that [...] "even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not," [...] adding that the [...] "entertainment value [...] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change." [...] Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "in true Kardashian fashion, they managed to make everything about them," [...] after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the [...] "About Bruce" [...] special aired as part of the tenth season. Amatangelo felt that the conversations [...] "seemed a little too staged, too controlled", and noted that [...] "there was no attempt to educate the viewers about transgender issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 July 1938, {{with the}} help and support of Hahn, Meitner – born into a Jewish family – escaped to the Netherlands; before she left, Hahn gave her a diamond ring he had {{inherited}} from his mother, {{to be used to}} bribe the frontier guards if required. Meitner emigrated to Stockholm, and Hahn continued to work with Strassmann. In late 1938 they found evidence of isotopes of an alkaline earth metal in their sample. The metal was detected by the use of an organic barium salt constructed by Wilhelm Traube. Finding a group 2 alkaline earth metal was problematic, because it did not logically fit with the other elements found thus far. Hahn initially suspected it to be radium, produced by splitting off two alpha-particles from the uranium nucleus. At the time, the scientific consensus was that even splitting off two alpha particles via this process was unlikely. The idea of turning uranium into barium (by removing around 100 nucleons) was seen as preposterous. On 10 November during a visit to Copenhagen, where he was invited to lecture in Bohr's Institute, Hahn discussed these results with Niels Bohr, Meitner, and Otto Robert Frisch. Further refinements of the technique, leading to the decisive experiment on 16–17 December 1938 (the celebrated [...] "radium-barium-mesothorium-fractionation"), produced puzzling results: the three isotopes consistently behaved not as radium, but as barium. Hahn, who did not inform the physicists in his Institute, described the results exclusively in a letter to Meitner on 19 December: we are more and more coming to the awful conclusion that our Ra isotopes behave not like Ra, but like Ba. ... <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> suggest some fantastic explanation. We ourselves realize that it can't really burst into Ba. In her reply, Meitner concurred that Hahn's conclusion of [...] "the bursting of the uranium nucleus" [...] was very difficult to accept, but considered it possible.|$|E
