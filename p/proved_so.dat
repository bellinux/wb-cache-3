5|$|Burger King {{was founded}} in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centred around a piece of {{equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers. It <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> successful that, as they grew through franchising, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.|$|E
5|$|Stroma {{lacked a}} regular {{connection}} to the mainland until 1879, when the Post Office subsidised a weekly boat service from Huna on the mainland and established a post office on the island. However, the volume of mail from Stroma <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> small that the service was grossly uneconomical. By the 1950s, the Post Office was spending 1s. 2d. for each letter worth 2½d. in postage.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo's long {{association}} with penguins began in January 1914, {{with the arrival}} of three king penguins from the Christian Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching of a king penguin chick in 1919 was the first penguin to be hatched in captivity. These were the first penguins to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily penguin parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> popular with visitors and the penguins that it is a daily feature of the zoo today.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his positions in the media, Nash was also a publican, which <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> financially successfully {{he was able to}} pay cash for a house in the upmarket Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. An altercation with a drunken patron resulted in a broken left hip and forced Nash to sell his hotel, the Prince Alfred in Port Melbourne and gain employment as a clerk in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, a position he held until his mandatory retirement at 65.|$|E

5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{rejoined the}} AFDU at Wittering on 15 April 1943. On 19 April he began trials in the P-51 Mustang (termed Mustang IA by the RAF). He {{selected}} FD442 which became his personal mount. The P-51, {{was at that}} time, powered by a Allison V-1710 and armed with two 20mm cannon in each wing. MacLachlan also flew Mustangs powered by the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine which <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> successful in later variants which flew and fought in the USAAF. MacLachlan visited his old school at Monkton on 29 May 1943 which had pledged £1,000 for the five needed to buy a Spitfire {{as part of a}} local Wings for Victory campaign.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{also put}} {{together}} a trailer of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film, in which Andrea meets Miranda for the first time, to be used at previews and film festivals until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film. But, again, this <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation {{for the rest of}} the film without giving anything away.|$|E

5|$|Hancock was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 6th U.S. Infantry regiment, and initially was stationed in Indian Territory in the Red River Valley. The region was quiet at the time, and Hancock's time there was uneventful. Upon the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846, Hancock worked to secure himself {{a place at the}} front. Initially assigned to recruiting duties in Kentucky, he <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> adept at signing up soldiers that his superiors were reluctant to release him from his post. By July 1847, however, Hancock was permitted to join his regiment in Puebla, Mexico, where they made up a part of the army led by his namesake, General Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> popular that for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Published on 19 December, {{the first}} edition sold out by Christmas Eve; {{by the end of}} 1844 {{thirteen}} editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella positively. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, reducing further Dickens's small profits from the publication. He went on to write four other Christmas stories in subsequent years. In 1849 he began public readings of the story which <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.|$|E

5|$|The Haunting was {{released}} on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes {{with the intention of}} fixing their faces. The film <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> frightening, she said, that the women were jumping out of their seats and losing their items. In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100. Despite these stunts, The Haunting was only an average success at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The Hibbs-Murphy team <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> {{successful}} in To Hell and Back {{that the two}} worked together on {{a total of five}} subsequent films. Hibbs directed Murphy in Ride Clear of Diablo in 1954. The partnership resulted in the commercially unsuccessful non-traditional 1956 western Walk the Proud Land. Hibbs and Murphy teamed with each other for non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner. They worked together a final time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail. Veteran character actor Dan Duryea who portrayed villain Whitey Kincaide in Ride Clear of Diablo played a second lead in two more Murphy vehicles, Night Passage and Six Black Horses. The Story of Charles Russell with Murphy as the lead was under development at Universal but shelved after the disappointing receipts of Walk the Proud Land. Murphy, however, was enthusiastic enough about a biopic of Charles Marion Russell to give serious consideration tor his own production that would star Guy Mitchell in the lead, but no such film was made.|$|E
5|$|The film {{proved to}} be very successful, inspiring other films about Nation to be {{produced}} by other studios; Biograph Company made Carrie Nation Smashing a Saloon in April, while Lubin Manufacturing Company had produced a film entitled Mrs. Nation and Her Hatchet Brigade by early March. Siegmund Lubin had attempted {{to capitalize on the}} success of Kansas Saloon Smashers by making a film where Nation herself appeared; when he was unable to contact her, an actress was hired to play her. Lubin arranged with a Camden bar owner to film a staged destruction scene; however, the actress <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> convincing that bystanders began to destroy the bar for real and Lubin was forced to pay up to seven hundred dollars damage.|$|E

5|$|When the English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642, Portland was {{initially}} controlled by Parliamentary forces. The castle was captured in 1643 {{by a group of}} Royalists who gained access by pretending to be Parliamentary soldiers. As the war turned against the King in the south-west, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle for four months in 1644, and once again the following year. The castle finally surrendered to Vice-Admiral William Batten in April 1646. It is uncertain why the castle, which was not easily defensible on the landward side, <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> difficult to take; the historian Peter Harrington has suggested that its low-lying position may have made it difficult for Parliament to bombard it from the sea.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} Boston and {{pursuing}} his chosen major, English literature, Marcus began a lifelong hobby of collecting rare and antique books. To finance his pursuits, he began The Book Collector's Service Bureau, a mail-order book service, {{beginning with a}} letter of introduction sent to 100 homes. The venture <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of work full time, concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded {{him that he would}} always be granted the liberty of his own views, and pointed out that retailing was more profitable and thus would allow him to amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E
5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} {{a high level of}} success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This <b>proved</b> <b>so</b> effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E
