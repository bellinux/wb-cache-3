There are several thousand minicircles per kinetoplast and they are between 0.5 and 1kb in size. Maxicircles encode the typical protein products needed for the mitochondria which is encrypted. Herein lies the only known function of the minicircles - producing guide RNA (gRNA) to decode this encrypted maxicircle information, typically through the insertion or deletion of uridine residues. The network of maxicircles and minicircles are catenated to form a <b>planar</b> <b>network</b> that resembles chain mail. Reproduction of this network then requires that these rings be disconnected from the parental kinetoplast and subsequently reconnected in the daughter kinetoplast.

40|$|Abstract—A {{basic problem}} in network coding {{is to choose}} a field to perform the {{encoding}} and decoding operations in. The main message we wish to deliver in this work is that while unboundedly large fields are required for linear algebraic codes in arbitrary networks, very small finite fields may be sufficient for networks in practice. We use <b>planar</b> <b>networks</b> as a representative example of a practical network, which usually has a linear number of links, and exhibits a topology that is planar or close to planar. Focusing on a basic scenario of multicasting two source information flows, we prove that coding over GF (3) is sufficient for all <b>planar</b> <b>networks.</b> The proof applies existing techniques in the literature, including multicast flow decomposition, graph coloring, {{as well as new}} techniques that made these tools readily applicable to all undirected <b>planar</b> multicast <b>networks.</b> We further show that GF (3) is also necessary, by constructing two new <b>planar</b> multicast <b>networks,</b> one of which is a bipartite, that require coding over GF (3) for achieving the maximum throughput. For the special case of outerplanar networks, we prove that network coding is always equivalent to routing. Our results also invite a renewed look at the choice of deterministic vs. randomized network coding in practical networks. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{the network}} interdiction problem, an interdictor destroys {{a set of}} arcs in a capacitated network through which an adversary will {{maximize}} flow. The interdictor's primary objective is to use his limited resources to minimize that maximum flow, but other objectives may be important. Therefore, we describe algorithms for enumerating near optimal interdiction sets in <b>planar</b> <b>networks</b> so that these sets may be evaluated with respect to secondary criteria, e. g., safety of attacking forces, collateral damage, etc. Our algorithms are based on enumerating near shortest paths or cycles in the dual of a planar network; they find a single optimum interdiction set in pseudo polynomial time. We implement one algorithm applicable to s-t <b>planar</b> <b>networks</b> (s and t must lie on {{the perimeter of the}} network) and solve problems with up to 800 nodes and 1247 arcs.

40|$|This paper investigates a cross-layer design {{approach}} for minimizing energy consumption and maximizing network lifetime (NL) of a multiple-source and single-sink (MSSS) WSN with energy constraints. The optimization problem for MSSS WSN can be formulated as a mixed integer convex optimization {{problem with the}} adoption of time division multiple access (TDMA) in medium access control (MAC) layer, {{and it becomes a}} convex problem by relaxing the integer constraint on time slots. Impacts of data rate, link access and routing are jointly taken into account in the optimization problem formulation. Both linear and <b>planar</b> <b>network</b> topologies are considered for NL maximization (NLM). With linear MSSS and planar single-source and single-sink (SSSS) topologies, we successfully use Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to derive analytical expressions of the optimal NL when all nodes are exhausted simultaneously. The problem for planar MSSS topology is more complicated, and a decomposition and combination (D&C) approach is proposed to compute suboptimal solutions. An analytical expression of the suboptimal NL is derived for a small scale <b>planar</b> <b>network.</b> To deal with larger scale <b>planar</b> <b>network,</b> an iterative algorithm is proposed for the D&C approach. Numerical results show that the upper-bounds of the network lifetime obtained by our proposed optimization models are tight.

The segmentation is represented by a <b>planar</b> <b>network</b> of nodes (vertices, edges, faces) linked by adjacency links.

Constraint satisfaction and propagation is done uniformly over all nodes in the image, from each node to its adjacent neighbors.
