Cecil then made the foolish decision to allow the men to drink from the wine vats found in the local houses. A wave of drunkenness ensued, with few or none of Cecil's force remaining sober. Realizing what he had done, Cecil took the only course left open to him, and ordered that the men return to their ships and retreat.

The Oromo Liberation Front, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front had differing alliances with each other, the TPLF and EPLF had a strong alliance and they both had limited coordinations with the OLF. In 1990, the TPLF formed several other ethnic based political groups from prisoners it had released and <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> under an umberalla organization called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. The Oromo group in the EPRDF was the Oromo People's Democratic Organization and its creation was seen as an attempt to undermine the OLF.|$|E

[...] Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, {{and many of these}} stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

He is often criticised for the praise he gives to his own songs. He points out [...] "If you'd written 'Live Forever', you'd be walking to a different tune the next day too." [...] Gallagher has often been accused by critics of plagiarising the music of his heroes, but he has maintained outright homages in his music are his intention. In a 1996 Guitar World interview, he described himself as [...] "a fan who writes songs" [...] and stated, [...] "I'm not saying, 'I'm the greatest songwriter in the world. Listen to me.' Usually, I'm saying, These are the greatest songwriters in the world. And I'm gonna <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> in this song"'.

500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E

In Shechem, Jacob's daughter Dinah was kidnapped and raped by the ruler's son, who desired to marry the girl. Dinah's brothers, Simeon and Levi, agreed in Jacob's name to permit the marriage as long as all the men of Shechem first circumcised themselves, ostensibly to unite the children of Jacob in Abraham's covenant of familial harmony. On the third day after the circumcisions, when all the men of Shechem were still in pain, Simeon and Levi <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> to death by the sword and rescued their sister Dinah, and their brothers plundered the property, women, and children.

2500|$|While yet a young man, Nicholas {{followed}} {{the example of}} his uncle, the abbot, by making a pilgrimage to the birthplace of Christianity—the Holy Land. Desiring a serene time of preparation, Nicholas set sail on an Egyptian ship where the other pilgrims did not know who he was. The first night he dreamed a storm would <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> at peril. When he awoke {{in the morning he}} warned the sailors that a severe storm was coming, but they need not fear, for [...] "God will protect us." [...] Almost immediately the sky darkened and strong winds roared round the ship. The wind and waves made it impossible to keep the ship under control. Even with lowered sails, the sailors feared for their very lives and begged Nicholas to pray for safety. One sailor climbed the main mast, tightening the ropes so the mast would not crash onto the deck. As he was coming back down, the sailor slipped, fell to the deck, and was killed. While Nicholas prayed, the storm did quiet, relieving the sailors. Their comfort, however, was dampened by grief over their comrade's death. As Nicholas prayed over the dead sailor, he was revived, [...] "as if he had only been asleep." [...] The man awakened without pain and the ship finished the journey to the Holy Land. Nicholas then embarked on his pilgrimage to the holy places, walking where Jesus had walked.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of debuting with a {{full-length}} album, Swervedriver released {{a series of}} four-track EPs over the span of a year, subscribing to the popular trend in the early '90s. [...] "If you had 4 songs ready-ish, you would record them there and then and <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> out ASAP. No such thing as 'saving songs for the album' back then," [...] explained Hartridge. Recording was performed at The Greenhouse & Falconer Studios in London and all tracks were produced by the band. Swervedriver's debut offering, Son of Mustang Ford, was released on 16 July 1990 and included the song [...] "Kill the Superheroes", one of Franklin's first attempts at writing in an alternate tuning. Franklin stated in NME, [...] "Son of Mustang Ford {{was based on the}} Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas idea – driving around, out of your box, over America's landscapes." [...] The EP was characterized as [...] "a chromium-plated piece of automobile romanticism." [...] The group launched the release with an appearance on the John Peel BBC Radio 1 show on 31 July 1990, performing a select B-side from each of their three debut EPs along with the song [...] "Over" [...] (which would not see an official release for 15 years). The release of Rave Down, the second EP in the series, followed in November. Mary Anne Hobbs called its title track [...] "a cyclone of wild, swollen riff machinery that sounds like it's been played with dislocated shoulder joints." [...] Both EPs received favorable reviews and their title singles made their way into the UK indie and metal charts. However, mainstream British music press soon shifted their focus to bands who fit easier into the shoegazer mould. The group began gaining popularity in the United States, and in early 1991 Swervedriver signed with American label A Records and went on their first US tour, a brief [...] run of shows in support of Ned's Atomic Dustbin that kicked off at the Marquee in New York City. On 22 July 1991, their third EP, Sandblasted, was released with the title single reaching number 67 on the UK chart and being described as [...] "a head-on collision between guitars raging for chaos." ...|$|E
