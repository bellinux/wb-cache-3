We study a particular instance of this problem that we refer to as <b>path</b> <b>clearance</b> problem. This article presents a survey of our work on scalable and suitable for real-time use approaches to solving the <b>path</b> <b>clearance</b> problem. In particular, {{in the first part}} of the article, we show that the <b>path</b> <b>clearance</b> problem exhibits clear preferences on uncertainty. It turns out that these clear preferences can be used to develop an efficient algorithm called probabilistic planning with clear preferences (PPCP). The algorithm is anytime usable, converges to an optimal solution under certain conditions, and scales well to large-scale problems. We briefly describe the PPCP algorithm and show how it can be used to solve the <b>path</b> <b>clearance</b> problem when no scouts are present. In the second part of the article, we show several strategies for how to use the PPCP algorithm in case multiple scouting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are available. The experimental analysis shows that planning with PPCP results in a substantially smaller execution cost than when ignoring uncertainty, and employing scouts can decrease this execution cost even further...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In the <b>path</b> <b>clearance</b> {{problem the}} robot needs {{to reach its}} goal as quickly as {{possible}} without being detected by enemies. The robot does not know the precise locations of enemies, but has a list of their possible locations. These locations can be sensed, and the robot can go through them if no enemy is present or has to take a detour otherwise. We have previously developed an approach to the <b>path</b> <b>clearance</b> problem when the robot itself had to sense possible enemy locations. In this paper we investigate the problem of <b>path</b> <b>clearance</b> when the robot can use multiple scout robots to sense the possible enemy locations. This becomes a high-dimensional planning under uncertainty problem. We propose an efficient and scalable approach to it. While the approach requires centralized planning, it can scale to very large environments and to a large number of scouts and allows the scouts to be heterogenous. The experimental results show the benefits of using our approach when multiple scout robots are available. I...|$|E

40|$|In motion planning, high <b>clearance</b> <b>paths</b> are {{favorable}} due {{to their}} increased visibility and reduction of collision risk such as the safety of problems involving: human- robot cooperation. One popular approach to solving motion planning problems is the Probabilistic Roadman Method (PRM), which generates a graph of the free space of an environment {{referred to as a}} roadmap. In this work we describe a new approach to making high <b>clearance</b> <b>paths</b> when using PRM The medial axis is useful for this since it represents the set of points with maximal clearance and is well defined in higher dimensions. However it can only be computed exactly in workspace. Our goal is to generate roadmaps with paths following the medial axis of an environment without explicitly computing the medial axis. One of the major steps of PRM is local planning: the planning of motion between two nearby nodes PRMs have been used to build roadmaps that have nodes on the medial axis but so far there has been no local planner method proposed for connecting these nodes on the medial axis. These types of high clearance motions are desirable and needed in many robotics applications. This work proposes Medial Axis Local Planner (MALP), a local planner which attempts to connect medial axis configurations via the medial axis. The recursive method takes a simple path between two medial axis configurations and attempts to deform the path to fit the medial axis. This deformation creates <b>paths</b> with high <b>clearance</b> and visibility properties. We have implemented this local planner and have tested it in 2 D and 3 D rigid body and 8 D and 16 D fixed base articulated linkage environments.

Our results indicate that MALP generated higher <b>clearance</b> <b>paths</b> than SL local planning.

40|$|Abstract — Maintaining clearance, or {{distance}} from obstacles, {{is a vital}} component of successful motion planning algorithms. Maintaining high clearance often creates safer paths for robots. Contemporary sampling-based planning algorithms that utilize the medial axis, or the set of all points equidistant to two or more obstacles, produce higher <b>clearance</b> <b>paths.</b> However, they are biased heavily toward certain portions of the medial axis, sometimes ignoring parts critical to planning, e. g., specific types of narrow passages. We introduce Uniform Medial Axis Probabilistic RoadMap (UMAPRM), a novel planning variant that generates samples uniformly on the medial axis of the free portion of Cspace. We theoretically analyze the distribution generated by UMAPRM and show its uniformity. Our results show that UMAPRM’s distribution of samples along the medial axis is not only uniform but also preferable to other medial axis samplers in certain planning problems. We demonstrate that UMAPRM has negligible computational overhead over other sampling techniques and can solve problems the others could not, e. g., a bug trap. Finally, we demonstrate UMAPRM successfully generates higher <b>clearance</b> <b>paths</b> in the examples. I...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 34 - 36). Motion planning is the process of planning a sequence of motions to move an object from one configuration to another. Recently, randomized techniques known as PRMs have shown great potential for solving motion planning problems in complicated high-dimensional space. Motion Planning, or path planning for robots, becomes increasing difficult as the dimension of the planning space increases with the robot's degrees of freedom (dof). While the running time of deterministic motion planning algorithms grows exponentially with an increase in dof, PRMs can produce solutions in times that do not depend on the dof but only the difficulty of the problem. PRMs randomly generate collision free configurations in a robot's Configuration-space (Cspace), representing feasible positions and orientations for the robot. Nearby configurations are linked together by so-called local planners, and these connections are edges in a roadmap, a graph containing representative discrete paths the robot may travel. We present methods to extract optimal paths from roadmap-based motion planners.

40|$|Abstract: In a densely {{populated}} country like India, traffic and accidents are major problems. To overcome this, {{the government has}} to enlarge roads and introduce many infrastructures to reduce the traffic problems, but it’s not possible make infrastructural renovations in every requisite place. In order to reduce the traffic and road accidents this project introduces a TRANSCEIVER which is more or less like radar and it also uses a DIRECTION SENSOR – (like “cherry SD 1012 ”). Each vehicle has these two modules and each vehicle transmits and receives the signals of the vehicles around the range of the transceiver (say 500 m). With the reception of these signals from the vehicles around the specified range the traffic density can be found and we can prompt the user to take a different route or to slow down their speed using software programs from the received data. In order to know the vehicles that are going {{in the direction of the}} user, a direction sensor is used. If N number of vehicles are going in a direction (say north), then the TRANSCEIVER will filter the other signals and it will receive signals only from vehicles which are heading in the same direction, so the number of signals received is directly proportional to the traffic density, there by using algorithms we can instruct the user to either slow down or take detour. Using this same principle, by receiving the data from the upcoming traffic signal, we can also know the status of the signal and using algorithms we can instruct the user to either slow down or speed up, in this case traffic signals from a junction are given directions (north, south, east and west) so only the information of the traffic signal which matches the direction of the users ’ vehicle will be received and other signals can be attenuated.
