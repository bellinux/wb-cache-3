5|$|At {{this point}} Kantakouzenos {{received}} grave news from Constantinople. In late August Apokaukos attempted a coup {{and tried to}} kidnap John V.

The brigade returned in early 2013. Nine soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E
5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection).

5|$|In the afternoon, {{having failed}} to capture San Leonardo, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment sent two rifle {{companies}} {{to the aid of}} the Seaforth Highlanders, as Seaforth B Company attacked positions west of San Leonardo — inflicting 129 casualties on German forces in the area. However, the attack on San Leonardo by three Seaforth companies stalled rapidly when the 26th Panzer Regiment's armoured companies reinforced the sector. As a result, Forin was ordered to <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> withdrawal from the San Leonardo bridgehead.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Caesar {{began to}} <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This {{transformed}} the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops were}} told that they were to gather up all their {{ammunition}} and baggage and <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> night attack. By 21:00, the sick and wounded began to move to the Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for evacuation.

5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving is a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} that {{is estimated to}} take about 15 minutes on average to complete. Using the WASD keys and mouse, the player controls the main character, an unnamed spy who participates in an alcohol-smuggling operation. The player works alongside non-playable characters Anita, a demolitions expert, and Borges, a forger. The game follows the group as they <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heist and experience its aftermath. The robbery is omitted from the game, although it is revealed that it went wrong.|$|E

5|$|To <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{mission to}} {{discover}} {{the location of the}} Covenant's homeworld, SPARTAN-II soldiers are recalled to Reach. Two days before the mission was to begin, Covenant forces attack Reach and destroy the colony. A starship, the Pillar of Autumn, survives the onslaught with the SPARTAN-II Master Chief on board. The ship initiates a jump to slipspace (similar to hyperspace), hoping to lead the enemy away from Earth. The game starts with the Pillar of Autumn encountering Halo.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> strike.|$|E
5|$|Alex visits Meredith {{during her}} {{recovery}} {{and attempts to}} cheer her up. Alex realizes Meredith’s hearing has returned after she laughs {{at one of his}} jokes.

5|$|As Ali Riza Bey, the {{commander}} of the 13th Regiment, took charge of the Ottoman effort around Lone Pine, the grenading continued into the next day as the Ottomans began to <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large-scale counterattack. Throughout the morning the remaining Australian positions overlooking The Cup were abandoned before the fighting stopped briefly as both the Australians and Ottomans evacuated their wounded and removed the dead from the front-line. By this time the 1st and 2nd Battalions, which had been defending the heavily counterattacked southern flank, had suffered so many casualties that they were withdrawn from the line, with the 7th Battalion moving into their positions late in the afternoon. The 3rd, 4th and 12th Battalions remained holding the north and centre of the Australian line.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August, large {{forces from}} the NK 5th and 12th Divisions, as well was the 766th Independent Regiment were focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong. However {{they were unable to}} hold it because of U.S. air superiority and naval {{bombardment}} on the town. More importantly, the supply chain had completely broken down for the division, and more food, ammunition and supplies were not available. Captured North Korean prisoners claimed the units received no food after 12 August and had been so exhausted that they were completely unable to fight. Opposing them, the ROK Capital Division and Task forces P'ohang and Bradley which had joined forces to <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> final offensive to push the North Koreans out of the region.|$|E
5|$|Georgia coach Herman Stegeman, in {{the section}} on Southern {{football}} in Spalding's football guide, wrote that Vanderbilt had a good year {{but was unable to}} play up to its full capabilities and the Commodores should <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fine season the next year. For Stegeman, the contest for the theoretical title of greatest Southern team in 1921 was between Centre, Georgia Tech, and Georgia. Clyde Berryman retroactively listed Vanderbilt as national champion. Lynn Bomar at fullback, Pos Elam at tackle, and Thomas Ryan at end were listed on Walter Camp's list of notable players. Bomar, Elam, Ryan, Tot McCullough, Alf Sharpe, and Pink Wade all made an All-Southern team although, according to the yearbook, Tom Ryan was the only player in the group to appear on an All-Southern team.|$|E

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette left Boston for France on 18 December 1781. On arrival he {{was welcomed}} as a hero, and on 22 January 1782 he was {{received}} at Versailles. He witnessed {{the birth of}} his daughter, whom he named Marie-Antoinette Virginie upon Thomas Jefferson's recommendation. He was promoted to maréchal de camp, skipping numerous ranks. He was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. In 1782, with no treaty yet signed ending the war, Lafayette helped <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> combined French and Spanish expedition against the British West Indies. The Treaty of Paris signed between Great Britain and the U.S. in 1783 made the expedition unnecessary—Lafayette took part in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made the next day as Byng directed that the focus for the day was to simply consolidate the gains made and <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> further movement forward on 23 August. The relative inactivity of 22 August encouraged von Below in {{a belief that the}} attacks of the previous day were a failure. Seeking to take advantage, he arranged for counterattacks to be mounted by the 17th Army, and these resulted in the loss of Dovecot, which overlooked the New Zealand positions. The machine gun battalion of 42nd Division provided key support in driving off the counterattacks which, according to prisoners of war captured during the action, was launched by 52nd Infantry Division, largely made up of men from the Grand Duchy of Baden, which had newly arrived in the sector from Flanders.|$|E
