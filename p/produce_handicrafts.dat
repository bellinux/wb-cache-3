50|$|Benin is {{a country}} of origin and transit for {{children}} subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. Until recently, analysts also considered Benin a destination country for foreign children brought {{to the country and}} subjected to forced labor, but new information from government and non-government sources indicates the total number of such children is not significant. The majority of victims are girls trafficked into domestic servitude or the commercial sex trade in Cotonou, the administrative capital. Some boys are forced to labor on farms, work in construction, <b>produce</b> <b>handicrafts,</b> or hawk items on the street. Many traffickers are relatives or acquaintances of their victims, exploiting the traditional system of vidomegon, in which parents allow their children to live with and work for richer relatives, usually in urban areas. There are reports that some tourists visiting Pendjari National Park in northern Benin exploit underage girls in prostitution, some of whom may be trafficking victims. Beninese children recruited for forced labor exploitation abroad are destined largely for Nigeria and Gabon, with some also going to Ivory Coast and other African countries, where they may be forced to work in mines, quarries, or the cocoa sector.|$|E

The school students need to relax, as {{they have to work}} hard. They cultivate the fields of the school, thereby producing a large part of their food. And during the first years they should collect firewood, as well. Sometimes they had to walk 20 km in a day for this. Later the school acquired a car, but often not having petrol, the girls again had to get firewood by foot...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. The use of fire as a {{management}} tool and {{the harvest of}} plant parts, known as non-timber forest products, are traditional human activities that impact plant individuals, populations, plant communities and ecosystems. This dissertation focuses on the ecological consequences of harvest and management of goldengrass (Syngonanthus nitens, Eriocaulaceae). Golden-grass flower stalks are harvested to <b>produce</b> <b>handicrafts</b> which represent the most important source of income to hundreds of families in the Cerrado, in central Brazil. I applied an ethnoecological framework to: (i) characterize the local ecological knowledge related to golden-grass harvest and management in Jalapão region, Tocantins state, {{as well as in}} regions in Tocantins state to which the handicraft activities have expanded recently; (ii) experimentally test the effects of 'late' harvest, i. e., according to the traditional management practices, and 'early' harvest on goldengrass long-term population growth rates; (iii) experimentally test the effects of fire frequency and fire season on golden-grass populations, since fire is commonly applied in golden-grass management; and (iv) characterize fire behavior and intensity in the wet grasslands where golden-grass occurs. Ecological knowledge, specifically in relation to the timing of harvest is a determining factor for sustainability: harvesting 'late' has no negative effect on golden-grass populations, whereas 'early' harvest leads to accentuated population declines. As stated by experienced harvesters, golden-grass flower production is stimulated one year after fire. Biennial fire regimes, as preferred by experienced harvesters, yields higher long-term population growth rates (λ) compared to more frequent and sparser fire return intervals. Golden-grass populations were highly affected by variations in rainfall. Survival rates were significantly lower during dry years compared to rainy years, and this caused λ to decline significantly during dry years. Fires in wet grasslands are less intense and achieve relatively mild temperatures compared to fires in dry physiognomies, both within the Cerrado and in other tropical savannas. This dissertation has direct application to the management of golden-grass and fire in the Cerrado and also contributes to the NTFP and fire literature. Golden-grass harvesting has high potential for supporting conservation of biodiversity and local livelihoods. The sustainability of this activity {{is directly related to the}} timing of harvesting...|$|E

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of Southern women worked. About three-quarters of all white Southern families did not own slaves {{on the eve of}} the Civil War, and consequently women in these families generally shared with black women the necessity of working. Whatever else may have divided them, and there was much, black and white women regularly toiled in the fields to produce goods for the market and for the dinner table, they worked in the home caring for children and occasionally <b>producing</b> <b>handicrafts</b> and in urban areas, as this essay will demonstrate, they pursued a variety of wage-earning occupations. As Stephanie McCurry has demonstrated, this was true in some slaveholding families as well. It was the work of the wives that helped to secure the economic independence of yeoman households in coastal South Carolina, even those owning up to ten slaves. Only a small number of elite white women in the South enjoyed the leisured lifestyle popularized in twentieth-century mythology...|$|R
