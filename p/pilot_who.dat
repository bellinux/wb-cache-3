50|$|Enlisted {{pilots were}} called flying sergeants. Graduating enlisted pilots were graded as flight staff sergeants while <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> {{graduated}} {{at the top}} of their class were graded as flight technical sergeants. They were usually assigned to flying transport and liaison aircraft. Their pilot status was only indicated by their pilot's wings, often leading to enlisted aviators being mistaken for air crew or harassed for impersonating a pilot. This caused a lot of bad feelings between the enlisted <b>pilots</b> (<b>who</b> had more dangerous jobs for lower pay and no privileges) and the officer <b>pilots</b> (<b>who</b> received the same pay, promotability, and privileges as officers).|$|R

5|$|The {{accident}} board {{stated that}} Colonel Holland's macho, daredevil personality significantly influenced the crash sequence. USAF personnel testified that Holland {{had developed a}} reputation as an aggressive <b>pilot</b> <b>who</b> often broke flight-safety and other rules.

Apart from the British actor Jason Flemyng who took the part of Jim Bailey, the ex-R.A.F. <b>pilot</b> <b>who</b> owned Drum, {{the rest of the}} parts were taken by South African actors, the best known being Zola (credited as Bonginkosi Dlamini) playing the part of Slim, the Sophiatown gang leader.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the <b>pilot</b> <b>who</b> decides whether or not to take off.|$|E

5|$|Callaghan {{is perhaps}} best known for ordering, despite {{disagreement}} from some of his crew, that an honorable funeral be held for an enemy <b>pilot</b> <b>who</b> died during a suicide attack on the Missouri in 1945. Following World War II, he directed the US Navy's transportation service and filled senior command roles in eastern Asia, including leadership of the US Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force during the Korean War. He retired from the US Navy at the rank of vice admiral in 1957 and worked in civilian maritime transport before retiring to Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young <b>pilot,</b> <b>who</b> I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E

5|$|Green Lantern is a 2011 American superhero film {{based on}} the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The film stars Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett and Tim Robbins, with Martin Campbell directing a script by Greg Berlanti and comic book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim, which was subsequently rewritten by Michael Goldenberg.

5|$|Hambleton, whose {{call sign}} was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the <b>pilot,</b> <b>who</b> gave the signal {{for everyone to}} eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
5|$|In April 1946, Kenney {{became the}} first {{commander}} of the newly formed Strategic Air Command (SAC). He was encouraged by Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington {{to join him in}} the political battle surrounding the establishment of an independent United States Air Force. Separately, the two men gave promotional speeches around the country. As a result, SAC's efficiency suffered. On 8 May 1946, Kenney publicly presented the Medal of Honor to the family of Thomas B. McGuire, Jr, the second-highest scoring US fighter <b>pilot,</b> <b>who</b> had been killed in action.|$|E

5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots {{turned out to be}} more {{difficult}} than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The <b>pilot</b> <b>who</b> flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the aircraft for the aerial shots.|$|E
5|$|Since 1993, Curtis had {{frequently}} read {{morning news}} stories and exchanged them with friends. Although this {{would later become}} the inspiration for Fark, Curtis {{toyed with the idea}} of starting an online curry recipe database. In 1999, eighteen months after registering the domain name, he launched Fark as a way to share interesting news postings with his friends rather than sending them numerous emails. The first story posted was an article about a fighter <b>pilot</b> <b>who</b> crashed while attempting to moon another fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{contributed to the}} cancellation. The XF-85's {{deficiencies}} revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also {{a factor in the}} cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup. Schoch was the only <b>pilot</b> <b>who</b> ever flew the aircraft.|$|E
