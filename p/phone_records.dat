40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{gain insight into}} the effect of mobile phone quality on voice {{identification}} using an ecologically realistic design. A total of 165 participants were exposed to an unfamiliar voice, either directly <b>recorded</b> or mobile <b>phone</b> <b>recorded,</b> for 40 seconds. After a two week delay, {{they were asked to}} identify the target-voice in a 7 voice target-present line-up. We used a between subjects design, where half of the subjects were exposed to a directly recorded line-up, and the other half to a mobile <b>phone</b> <b>recorded</b> line-up. Data analysis did not show any significant effect of presentation format or line-up format. These results suggest that the detrimental effect on voice recognition suggested by the poorer sound quality of mobile phone recordings is minimal. They also indicate that there is no benefit from conducting a mobile <b>phone</b> <b>recorded</b> line-up, if the voice is originally heard over a mobile phone. More research is needed, however, before definitive conclusions may be drawn. The overall accuracy for correct identifications was 12. 7 % which is expected by chance. Further, one particular foil attracted 54 % of all false identifications. Future research should focus on explaining why earwitnesses perform so poorly and develop methods to improve identification accuracy...|$|R

25|$|In October 2013, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, {{author of}} the Patriot Act, {{introduced}} a proposal to the House of Representatives called the USA Freedom Act to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while it also would require a warrant to deliberately search for the e-mail and phone call content of Americans that is collected {{as part of a}} surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA <b>phone</b> <b>records</b> database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for <b>phone</b> <b>records.</b> Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.|$|E
