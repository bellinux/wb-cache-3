40|$|In the 2000 {{redesign}} of the Survey of Income and Program Participation sample, a two-stage sample design is adopted. In the first stage, two geographic <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units are selected {{from each of}} the strata within each state. In selecting <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units, if a <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit that was in the 1990 design is reselected in 2000, then the experienced field representative in that <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit can remain working on the survey. If a new <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit is selected, then a new field representative will have to be hired and trained. Therefore, reselecting as many of the <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units that were in the 1990 design as possible would minimize this turnover of field representatives. This will help reduce nonsampling errors caused by the inexperience of newly hired field representatives and the costs to train them. The Bureau of the Census employs the Ernst (1986) algorithm to select <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units while maximizing the <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit overlap between the 1990 and 2000 designs. Ernst's approach (1986) is demonstrated on test data for selecting two <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units from each stratum. The test results are reported in this paper...|$|R

The <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> units were selected by a probability sampling with inclusion probabilities proportional to the population of each unit. In the 14 <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> units, 16 households were chosen (20 households in cities with higher probability with non-response).

50|$|Visman {{proved that}} the {{variance}} of the <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> selection stage (the sampling variance) {{is the sum of}} the composition variance and the distribution variance. The composition variance is a measure for variability between particles within primary increments. The distribution variance, in contrast, is a measure for variability between primary increments in a sampling unit, and, thus, for its degree of heterogeneity. He described a simple experiment to estimate the composition and distribution components of the sampling variance. The distribution heterogeneity causes spatial dependence between measured values in ordered sets determined in sampling units and sample spaces.|$|E

After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other. It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.|$|E

40|$|AIM: This aim of {{this paper}} was to explore new doctors' {{preparedness}} for prescribing. METHODS: This was a multiple methods study including face-to-face and telephone interviews, questionnaires and secondary data from a safe prescribing assessment (n= 284). Three medical schools with differing curricula and cohorts were included: Newcastle (systems-based, integrated curriculum); Warwick (graduate entry) and Glasgow [problem-based learning (PBL) ], with graduates entering F 1 in their local deanery. The <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> consisted of final year medical students, stratified by academic quartile (n= 65) from each of the three UK medical schools. In addition an anonymous cohort questionnaire was distributed at each site (n= 480), triangulating interviews were conducted with 92 clinicians and questionnaire data were collected from 80 clinicians who had worked with F 1 s. RESULTS: Data from the <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> and cohort data highlighted that graduates entering F 1 felt under-prepared for prescribing. However there was improvement over the F 1 year through practical experience and support. Triangulating data reinforced the <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> findings. Participants reported that learning in an applied setting would be helpful and increase confidence in prescribing. No clear differences were found in preparedness to prescribe between graduates of the three medical schools. CONCLUSION: The results form part of a larger study 'Are medical graduates fully prepared for practice?'. Prescribing was found to be the weakest area of practice in all sources of data. There is a need for more applied learning to develop skill-based, applied aspects of prescribing which would help to improve preparedness for prescribing...|$|E

Preclinical research suggests that NMDA-R antagonists interfere with the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons and alter brain oscillations. These changes have been hypothesized to contribute to psychosis. In this investigation, we evaluated {{the hypothesis that the}} NMDA-R antagonist ketamine produces alterations in cortical functional connectivity during rest that are related to symptoms. We administered ketamine to a <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> of twenty-two subjects and to an additional, partially overlapping, sample of twelve subjects. Symptoms before and after the experimental session were rated with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). In the <b>primary</b> <b>sample,</b> functional connectivity was measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging almost immediately after infusion began. In the additional sample, this assessment was repeated after 45 minutes of continuous ketamine infusion.

Methods: Blood from six leukaemic patients was collected into seven <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> tubes (Monovette, Sarstedt) : sample A, heparinized blood gas syringe (potassium reference value); sample B, plasma Li-heparin without separator gel; sample C, plasma Li-heparin with separator gel; and sample D, serum with separator gel. The <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> tubes designated B, C and D were transported to the laboratory manually. Duplicates of the same sample tubes, BPT, CPT and DPT, were sent to the laboratory by pneumatic tube. Results: In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), there was no increase in the concentration of potassium in samples B, C and D when compared to the reference value. Transport of the samples by pneumatic tube led to a pronounced increase in potassium concentration in samples BPT and CPT, whereas there was no increase in sample DPT when compared to the reference value. In the patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), an increase in potassium concentration occurred in sample D and in samples BPT, CPT and DPT. A similar finding was observed in the patient with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), furthermore with an extremely high concentration of potassium in samples C and CPT.
