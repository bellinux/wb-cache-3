40|$|This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{efficiency}} of a sequential sampling plan for bean and soybean seeds, in the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum detection. Firstly the heterogeneity of Pérola and Bolinha Bean cultivars lots samples and IAC-Foscarin soybean was assessed, through H and R testing values, verifying their physiological and sanitary quality. To test the pathogen presence or absence a <b>positive</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> was used, in naturally infected seeds, and recovered by Neon-S and Roll Paper tests. The Neon-S test efficiency was obtained {{at different levels of}} infection. Statistical analysis for each test was made in DIC with four replications and the data subjected to variance analysis, and averages compared using the Tukey test (P < 0. 05) probability. The soybean and bean seeds sampling sequence for mycelial Sclerotinia sclerotiorum detection was efficient, once at least 800 and 1. 000 seeds are evaluated considering 0. 01 and 0. 005 %, incidences respectively.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} the kanji combinations that form common (or general) and proper nouns in Japanese. The following three results were obtained. First, the degree of distribution results from two similar processes which are based on a steady-state of birth-and-death processes with different birth and death rates, resulting in a <b>positive</b> negative <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> with the proper nouns and in a positive Waring distribution with common nouns. Second, all rank-frequency distributions follow the negative hypergeometric distribution used very frequently in ranking problems. Third, the building of kanji compounds follows a dissortative strategy. The higher the outdegree of a kanji, the more it prefers kanji with lower indegrees. A linear dependence can be observed with common nouns, whereas the relationship between compounded kanji is rather curvilinear with proper nouns. The actual analytical expression is not yet known...|$|R
40|$|In {{the peak}} over {{threshold}} model {{resulting in the}} Extreme-value distribution, type I, (EV 1) the first e of the distribution function {{is based on the}} Poisson number of exceedances, and the second e arises from the Exponentially distributed magnitudes. This paper, on the one hand, generalises the Poisson model to the (<b>positive</b> and negative) <b>Binomial</b> <b>distribution,</b> and, on the other hand, the Exponential distribution is generalised to the Generalised Pareto distribution. Lack of fit with respect to the Poisson and Exponential distribution is measured by statistics derived from those which would be locally most powerful if the estimates of the location and scale parameter were equal to the true parameter values.

40|$|We study density-dependent {{resource}} harvest patterns due to Bayesian foraging {{for different}} distributions of resources. We first consider a forager {{with information about}} the stochastic properties of its environment. In this case we show that {{when the number of}} food items per patch follows a distribution from the exponential family, the density dependence is given by the ratio _ 2 + of the distribution of number of food items per patch. Bayesian foraging can therefore lead to <b>positive</b> (negative <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution)</b> or negative (<b>binomial</b> <b>distribution)</b> density dependent resource harvest and even to density independent (Poisson distribution) resource harvest, depending on the distribution of resources in the environment. In a second stage we incorporate learning about the distribution of resources in the whole environment. The mean of the distribution of number of food items per patch of a given environment is learnt faster than the variance of the distribution. Learning occurs faster in poorer than richer environments. ] 1997 Academic Press Different foraging theory models focus on different aspects of the predator-prey interaction. A large body of the literature concentrates in looking for ‘‘optimal’’ foraging strategies, behaviors that will maximise expected net energy intake during the foraging period in a number of circumstances (see Stephens and Krebs, 1986; Lima and Dill, 1990; Ylo nen and Magnhagen, 1992 for different reviews). Other models study the changes in feeding efficiency in response to changes in resource den-sity across patches (Holling, 1965; Charnov, 1976; Green, 1988; Bernstein et al., 1991). This second aspect has obvious links with predatorprey theory and popula-tion dynamics and stability (see Murdoch and Oaten...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{standardize}} catch per unit effort (CPUE) for yellowfin caught by Brazilian baitboats, the data reported in Task II database were analyzed during the assessment meeting for tropical tunas. Models and results gathered during that exercise {{are described in}} this document. I have used generalized linear models (GLMs) to estimate standardized CPUE. Gamma density distributions were used to model the <b>positive</b> catches, while <b>binomial</b> <b>distributions</b> were used to model the proportion of positive catches. Factors included in the GLMs were area, quarter and year. Two databases were analyzed, namely “complete ” and “set by set”. In the latter, fishing days are reported one by one. However, “complete ” data set includes all available data, no matter if effort and catch were summed up by trip, fleet, month or area. Standardized catch rates as calculated using both dataset showed slight increasing trends. Because data about some potentially important explanatory variables (e. g. amount of bait released) are not available those estimates are not ideal relative abundance indices.
