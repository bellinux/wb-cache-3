This included items, such as total number of packets on the various subnetworks, source/destination of packets, percent utilization of network capacity, peak traffic rates, and packet size distribution. The NASA/KSC LAN was stressed to determine the useable bandwidth of the Ethernet network and an average design station workload was used to project the increased traffic on the existing network and the <b>planned</b> <b>T</b> 1 link.

40|$|The {{current state}} of coffee {{production}} is reviewed; from {{the origins of the}} plant grown to modem coffee brew techniques. Initial experiments are reported in which coffee was brewed at different temperatures for different lengths of time. The resultant drink was found to undergo changes in the objective properties of acidity and total dissolved solids (TDS), as well as changes in the subjective measurement of flavor depending on brew parameters. This discovery indicated that the flavor of coffee could be improved through precise control of coffee brew parameters, namely brew temperature and duration. A business model and internet-connected system for coffee brewing is presented. An automatic coffee machine that is capable of precisely controlling brew parameters was designed, manufactured, and tested. The machine showed potential by brewing two cups with exceptional flavor, but faced challenges with reliability and ease of use. Future work is <b>planned</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E

40|$|In aortic {{stenosis}} (AS), {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} (LVH) isone of the fundamental mechanisms of adaptation as a re-sult of an increased afterload [1]. Even though initially this is an useful compensatory process, it may lead to progressive myocardial failure [2] due to the increased susceptibility of the hypertrophied myocardium to ischaemia [3]. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) has produced {{a dramatic change in}} the natural history of AS. In this context, measurement of the degree of LVH in patients with AS, particularly the assess-ment of the regression of such hypertrophy after valve re-placement is of major importance [4]. In the previous studies [5 – 7], it was found that LVH regression is a time-consuming process and occurs {{over a period of several}} months. The aim of the present study is to clarify the degree of short-term reversal of LVH after 3 months of AVR. To this end we designed a prospective study in which we <b>planned</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E

40|$|Force-field and quantum-chemical {{calculations}} {{have been}} combined to model at the atomistic level the packing of pentacene molecules on two polymer dielectric layers (PMMA versus polystyrene – PS) {{widely used in}} field-effect transistors and {{to assess the impact}} of electrostatic interactions at the interface on the charge mobility values in the pentacene layers, respectively. The results show unambiguously that the electrostatic interactions introduce a significant energetic disorder in the pentacene layer in contact with the polymer chains; a drop in the hole mobility by a factor of 5 is predicted with PS chains while a factor of 60 is obtained for PMMA due to the presence of polar carbonyl groups. 2 The field of organic electronics has developed tremendously over the last twenty years. [1] The key advantages of organic semiconductors compared to their inorganic equivalents are the versatility of chemical synthesis, the ease of processing (in particular over large areas), and low production costs.

40|$|For many years, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has {{believed}} that its activities promote better income tax compliance {{in the general}} population—both through deterrence and taxpayer service—but we {{had never been able}} to quantify this impact, or even verify that it exists. Two recent research studies at the IRS, however, have produced estimates of at least some of these effects, providing an empirical basis for choosing the best combination of major IRS activities to improve the voluntary filing and reporting compliance of taxpayers. The first study was an econometric analysis of data aggregated by state and by year, which included variables for seven IRS activities in addition to a wide variety of tax policy, opportunity, and economic/demographic determinants of voluntary compliance. Five of the IRS activities were found to have a statistically significant impact on compliance, including audits and criminal investigations. The second study was more qualitative, eliciting the consensus judgment of senior IRS operations executives as to the relative magnitudes of the indirect effects of a much broader range of IRS activities. Together, the results of these studies will help IRS to allocate its resources so as to promote greater voluntary compliance. More research is <b>planned</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|Position in {{the social}} {{hierarchy}} can influence brain dopamine function and cocaine reinforcement in nonhuman primates during early cocaine exposure. With prolonged exposure, however, initial differences in rates of cocaine self-administration between dominant and subordinate monkeys dissipate. The present studies used a choice procedure to assess the relative reinforcing strength of cocaine in group-housed male cynomolgus monkeys with extensive cocaine self-administration histories. Responding was maintained under a concurrent fixed-ratio 50 schedule of food and cocaine (0. 003 - 0. 1 mg/kg per injection) presentation. Responding on the cocaine-associated lever increased {{as a function of}} cocaine dose in all monkeys. Although response distribution was similar across social rank when saline or relatively low or high cocaine doses were the alternative to food, <b>planned</b> <b>t</b> tests indicated that cocaine choice was significantly greater in subordinate monkeys when choice was between an intermediate dose (0. 01 mg/kg) and food. When a between-session progressive-ratio procedure was used to increase response requirements for the preferred reinforcer (either cocaine or food), choice of that reinforcer decreased in all monkeys. The average response requirement that produced a shift in response allocation from the cocaine-associated lever to the food-associated lever was higher in subordinates across cocaine doses, an effect that trended toward significance (p = 0. 053). These data indicate that despite an extensive history of cocaine self-administration, most subordinate monkeys were more sensitive to the relative reinforcing strength of cocaine than dominant monkeys...|$|E
