40|$|Background Current {{research}} suggests that administration of vasopressin to patients with uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (UHS) can avoid the detrimental effects associated with aggressive fluid resuscitation. However, vasopressin has a short half-life of 10 ~ 35 minutes in in vivo use and precludes its use in the pre-hospital setting. To increase the half-life of vasopressin, we proposed to synthesize liposome-encapsulated vasopressin and test it in a rat model of UHS. Methods The film hydration method was used to prepare liposomal vasopressin consisting of: Dipal-mitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and <b>dipalmitoyl</b> <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (20 : 20 : 1 mole ratio). 42 rats were subjected to UHS and randomly received 5 different treatments (vasopressin, liposomal vasopressin, lactate ringer (LR), liposome only and sham).

40|$|Both {{wide-angle}} and lamellar {{x-ray diffraction}} data are interpreted {{in terms of}} a difference in hydrocarbon chain tilt between fully hydrated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and <b>dipalmitoyl</b> <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (DPPE). Although the hydrocarbon chains of multilayers of DPPC tilt ty approximately 30 degrees relative to the normal to the plane of the bilayer, as previously reported by others, the hydrocarbon chains of DPPE appear to be oriented approximately normal to the plane of the bilayer. It is found that the chain tilt in DPPC bilayers can be reduced by either: (a) adding an n-alkane to the bilayer interiors or (b) adding lanthanum ions to the fluid layers between bilayers. A molecular packing model is presented which accounts for these data. According to this model, DPPC chains tilt because of the size and conformation of the PC polar head group...|$|R

The images were taken in air, and show lipid bilayers adhering to the surface either in isolated patches or in continuous sheets, depending on the deposition conditions. Epifluorescence light-microscopy shows that the lipid is distributed on the substrate surfaces as seen in the AFM images. In some instances, when DPPE was used, whole, unfused vesicles, which were bound to the substrate, could be imaged by the AFM.

The dependence on content, Xp, of PEG-DPPE lipid was studied for different polar headgroup sizes, np, of the polymer lipid, throughout the lamellar phase of the mixtures with DPPC. Mean-field theory for the polymer brush regime predicts that the downward shift in {{transition temperature}} should vary with polymer size and content as npXp 5 / 3 (∼npXp 11 / 6 for scaling theory). Any shift induced by the charge on PEG-lipids is independent of polymer size. These predictions are reasonably borne out for the longer polymer lipids (PEG molecular masses 750, 2000 and 5000 Da). Transition temperature shifts in the lamellar phase, {{before the onset of}} micellisation, are in the region of − 1 to − 2 °C (± 0. 1 – 0. 2 °C) in reasonable accord with theoretical estimates of the lateral pressure exerted by the polymer brush.

40|$|We have derived the {{monolayer}} spontaneous curvatures J 0 for {{a series}} of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol as a function of temperature. For this purpose lipids were transferred into inverted hexagonal phases using <b>dipalmitoyl</b> <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> according to established protocols (see, e. g. [1 - 3]) and investigated by small angle x-ray scattering. The neutral plane for each lipid, which defines J 0, was determined from the corresponding electron density maps. Spontaneous curvatures of phosphatidylethanolamines and cholesterol were found to be at least a factor of two more negative than those of phosphatidylcholines, whose J 0 is closer to zero. Interestingly, a significant positive J 0 = + 0. 1 nm− 1 was retrieved for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine at 25 °C. Spontaneous curvatures in general were found to become more negative with increasing temperature with thermal expansion coefficients that ranged between − 1 · 10 − 3 to − 3 · 10 − 3 (°C nm) − 1 for most investigated lipids.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the binding of 7 -ethoxy-, 7 -n-propoxy- and 7 -n-pentoxy-coumarin to {{cytochrome}} P- 450 (2) reconstituted into large unilamellar liposomes composed of a mixture of egg L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, egg <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> and <b>dipalmitoyl</b> phosphatidic acid (2 : 1 : 0. 06, by weight). The apparent spectral dissociation constants K(s) app. increased linearly with increasing proteoliposomal concentration. When both cytochrome P- 450 (2) and NADPH:cytochrome P- 450 reductase were reconstituted into liposomes, the apparent Michaelis constants K(m) app. for O-dealkylation of 7 -methoxy-, 7 -ethoxy- and 7 -n-propoxy-coumarin showed a similar dependence on the proteoliposomal concentration. The results were in accordance with models for kinetic or equilibrium processes in biphasic systems containing membrane-bound catalytic or acceptor sites, in which a linear solute partition in the bilayer membrane is postulated. The methyl, ethyl and n-propyl ether were readily dealkylated. However, the O-dealkylation rate of 7 -n-butoxycoumarin was low and became very small for longer alkyl ethers. Both the effective dissociation constants and effective Michaelis constants decreased with elongation of the alkyl side chain of the coumarins. From plots of the apparent dissociation constants and apparent Michaelis constants against the lipid volume fraction of the proteoliposomes, the membrane partition coefficients for several homologues were calculated. When protein-free liposomes were added to 7 -n-alkoxycoumarin solutions, the fluorescence intensity of the coumarins decreased and eventually became negligible in the presence of an excess of liposomal material. On the assumption that the overall fluorescence can be ascribed exclusively to the fraction of 7 -n-alkoxycoumarin molecules present in the aqueous phase, partition coefficients for liposomal accumulation of the test compounds could be determined directly. For several coumarin ethers, comparable values were derived for the membrane partition coefficients from binding, kinetic and fluorescence intensity measurements. The change in free energy per methylene group of the 7 -n-alkoxycoumarins for partitioning between n-octanol and buffer was significantly different from the value for liposome partitioning. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that C 5 b- 6 binds to the erythrocyte membrane via an ionic interaction with sialic acid before {{the addition of}} C 7 and subsequent membrane insertion. In this study we assessed the role of anionic lipids in the binding of the terminal complement proteins to the membrane and the efficiency of subsequent hemolysis. Human erythrocytes were modified by insertion of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcho-line (DPPC), dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine (DPPS), dipalmi-toyl <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (DPPE), or <b>dipalmitoyl</b> phos-phatidic acid (DPPA). Lipid incorporation and the hemolytic assays were done {{in the presence of}} 100 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate to prevent enzymatic redistribution of lipid. We found that the neutral lipids, DPPC and DPPE, did not affect C 5 b- 7 uptake or hemolysis by C 5 b- 9. In contrast, the two acidic phospholipids, DPPS and DPPA, caused a dose-dependent increase in both lysis and C 5 b- 7 uptake. We conclude that the presence of anionic lipids on the exterior face of the membrane increases C 5 b- 7 uptake and subse-quent hemolysis. It is known that sickle cell erythrocytes have increased exposure of phosphatidylserine on their external face and are abnormally sensitive to lysis by C 5 b- 9. The data presented here provide a plausible mechanism for this increased sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the interaction of}} the cationic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) tritrpticin (VRRFPWWWPFLRR, TRP 3) with Langmuir monolayers of zwitterionic (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, DPPC, and <b>dipalmitoyl</b> <b>phosphatidylethanolamine,</b> DPPE) and negatively charged phospholipids (dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid, DPPA, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol, DPPG). Both surface pressure and surface potential isotherms became more expanded upon addition of TRP 3 (DPPE similar to DPPC << DPPA < DPPG). The stronger interaction with negatively charged phospholipids agrees with data for vesicles and planar lipid bilayers, and with AMPs greater activity against bacterial membranes versus mammalian cell membranes. Considerable expansion of negatively charged monolayers occurred at 10 and 30 mol% TRP 3, especially at low surface pressure. Moreover, a difference was observed between PA and PG, demonstrating that the interaction, besides being modulated by electrostatic interactions, displays specificity with regard to headgroup, being more pronounced in the case of PG, present in large quantities in bacterial membranes. In previous studies, it was proposed that the peptide acts by a toroidal pore-like mechanism [1, 2]. Considering the evidence from the literature that PG shows a propensity to form a positive curvature as do toroidal pores, the observation of TRP 3 's preference for the PG headgroup and the dramatic increase in area promoted by this interaction represent further support for the toroidal pore mechanism of action proposed for TRP 3.

40|$|Three model {{biomembrane}} systems, monolayers, micelles, and vesicles, {{have been}} used to study the influence of chemical and physical variables of hapten presentation at membrane interfaces on antibody binding. Hapten recognition and binding were monitored for the anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody 4 - 4 - 20 generated against the hapten, fluorescein, in these membrane models as a function of fluorescein-conjugated lipid architecture. Specific recognition and binding in this system are conveniently monitored by quenching of fluorescein emission upon penetration of fluorescein into the antibody's active site. Lipid structure was shown to play a large role in affecting antibody quenching. Interestingly, the observed degrees of quenching were nearly independent of the lipid membrane model studied, but directly correlated with the chemical structure of the lipids. In all cases, the antibody recognized and quenched most efficiently a lipid based on dioctadecylamine where fluorescein is attached to the headgroup via a long, flexible hydrophilic spacer. <b>Dipalmitoyl</b> <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> containing a fluorescein headgroup demonstrated only partial binding/quenching.

Cytostatic and tumoricidal activities by thioglycolate-elicited M phi against two tumor cell lines were examined in vitro following incubation with the acetyl-LDL:MTP-PtdEtn complex. Cytostatic activity against B 16 F 10 melanoma cells was induced after the incubation of thioglycolate-elicited M phi with a minimum of 25 micrograms of acetyl-LDL protein containing 2. 5 micrograms of bound MTP-PtdEtn (approximately equal to 40 molecules per particle of acetyl-LDL). The induction of cytostasis was not affected by liposome bilayers, which were also endocytosed by the M phi. In addition, tumoricidal activity against P 815 mastocytoma cells was demonstrated at a 40 : 1 effector-to-target ratio using 18 micrograms of the acetyl-LDL:MTP-PtdEtn complex containing 3. 6 micrograms of MTP-PtdEtn (approximately equal to 80 molecules per particle).

40|$|The {{success of}} lipid {{membranes}} as cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) adjuvants requires targeted uptake by antigenpresenting cells (APCs) {{and delivery of}} the antigen cargo to the cytosol for processing. To target the phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor of APCs, we prepared antigen-loaded liposomes containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine and archaeal lipid liposomes (archaeosomes), containing an equivalent amount of archaetidylserine, and compared their ability to promote short and long-term CTL activity in animals. CTL responses were enhanced by the incorporation of PS into phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes and, to a lesser extent, into phosphatidylglycerol/cholesterol liposomes, that correlated {{to the amount of}} surface amino groups reactive with trinitrobenzoyl sulfonate. Archaeosomes contrasted to the liposome adjuvants by exhibiting higher amounts of surface amino groups and inducing superior shorter and, especially, longer-term CTL responses. The incorporation of dipalmitoyl lipids into archaeosomes induced instability and prevented long-term, but not short-term, CTL responses in mice. The importance of glycero-lipid cores (isopranoid versus dipalmitoyl) to the longevity of the CTL response achieved was shown further by incorporating <b>dipalmitoyl</b> <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (DPPE) or equivalent amounts of synthetic archaetidylethanolamine (AE) into archaeosome adjuvants. Both DPPE and AE at equivalent (5 mol%) concentrations enhanced the rapidity of CTL responses in mice, indicating the importance of the head group in the short term. In the longer term, 5 % of DPPE (but not 5 % of AE) was detrimental. In addition to head-group effects critical to the potency of short-term CTL responses, the longer term CTL adjuvant properties of archaeosomes may be ascribed to stability imparted by the archaeal isopranoid core lipids.

40|$|The {{molecular}} packing {{details of}} lipids in planar bilayers are well characterized. For curved bilayers, however, little data is available. In this paper we study {{the effect of}} temperature and membrane composition on the structural and dynamical properties of a liposomal membrane {{in the limit of}} high curvature (liposomal diameter of 15 - 20 nm), using coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations. Both pure dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes and binary mixtures of DPPC and either <b>dipalmitoyl</b> <b>phosphatidylethanolamine</b> (DPPE) or polyunsaturated dilinoleylphosphatidylcholine (DLiPC) lipids are modeled. We take special care in the equilibration of the liposomes requiring lipid flip-flopping, which can be facilitated by the temporary insertion of artificial pores. The equilibrated liposomes show some remarkable properties. Curvature induces membrane thinning and reduces the thermal expansivity of the membrane. In the inner monolayer the lipid head groups are very closely packed and dehydrated, and the lipids tails relatively disordered. The opposite packing effects are seen in the outer monolayer. In addition, we noticed an increased tendency of the lipid tails to backfold toward the interface in the outer monolayer. The distribution of lipids over the monolayers was found to be strongly temperature dependent. Higher temperatures favor more equally populated monolayers. Relaxation times of the lipid tails were found to increase with increasing curvature, with the lipid tails in the outer monolayer showing a significant slower dynamics compared to the lipid tails in the inner monolayer. In the binary systems there is a clear tendency toward partial transversal demixing of the two components, with especially DPPE enriched in the inner monolayer. This observation is in line with a static shape concept which dictates that inverted-cone shaped lipids such as DPPE and DLiPC would prefer the concave volume of the inner monolayer. However, our results for DLiPC show that another effect comes into play that is almost equally strong and provides a counter-acting driving force toward the outer, rather than the inner monolayer. This effect is the ability of the polyunsaturated tails of DLiPC to backfold, which is advantageous in the outer monolayer.
