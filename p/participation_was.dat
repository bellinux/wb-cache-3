Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with that of the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that British <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> complete and wholehearted.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match.

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly {{through the ranks}} in United States sports groups. As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against a boycott of the 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews. Although Brundage was successful in getting a team to the Games in Berlin, its <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> controversial and has remained so. Brundage {{was elected to the}} IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement. He was elected IOC president in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō was {{slightly}} damaged {{by a single}} bomb or aerial rocket hit when the Allies attacked Kure again in July 1945. Information is scarce {{on the extent of}} the ship's involvement in the action, but it appears the carrier's <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> minimal, as it embarked no aircraft at the time. Hōshō was repaired within 15 days, but the termination of hostilities in September 1945 found the carrier still docked at Kure.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the link between}} individual schooling and political <b>participation</b> <b>is</b> affected by country characteristics. Using individual survey data, we find that political <b>participation</b> <b>is</b> more responsive to schooling in land-abundant countries and less responsive in human capital–abundant countries, even while controlling for country political institutions and cultural attitudes. We find related evidence that political <b>participation</b> <b>is</b> less responsive to schooling in countries with a higher skill premium, as well as within countries for individuals in skilled occupations. The evidence motivates a theoretical explanation in which patterns of political <b>participation</b> <b>are</b> influenced by the opportunity cost of engaging in political rather than production activities...|$|R

5|$|In the past, the {{decision}} to allow athletes to return to <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems.

40|$|The {{field of}} public <b>participation</b> <b>is</b> a distinct, but yet unpolished facet {{within the public}} {{relations}} industry.

Likewise, even among those who endorse the necessity of public participation, its methods and strategies {{continue to be a}} mystery to most. One industry, in particular, that has recognized and embraced the benefits of conducting public <b>participation</b> <b>is</b> the water utility industry.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} team sport of football, which had 16 participants, fencing and wrestling were the sports in which Egypt had the most participants, sending 12 representatives to each.

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 regular season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 rushing offense in Division I-A college football, averaging 292 rushing yards per game and 422 overall yards per game. Despite those figures, the Cornhuskers' two leading rushers were hampered by injury and their <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> in doubt. Ahman Green, who led the Nebraska offense with 155 carries, 917 rushing yards, and seven touchdowns, suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the second-to-last Nebraska regular-season game. The No. 2 rusher, DeAngelo Evans, had 776 rushing yards and a team-high 14 rushing touchdowns, but was limited by a groin injury. Because of the injuries, Damon Benning, who earned 465 yards and seven touchdowns during the regular seasons, was anticipated to see significant playing time. Wide receiver Brenden Holbein also suffered an ankle injury in practice, but was able to play.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Federer and Nadal competed {{on the same side of}} a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point).

5|$|From 1927 to 1928, Agârbiceanu, a {{recipient}} of the National Prize for Literature, headed the Cluj chapter of Astra and edited Transilvania. It was in this magazine that he wrote a number of articles in support of eugenics, calling on priests to promote the movement in their parishes. Given the secular values of the movement's leaders in Romania, his <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> somewhat incongruous, but Agârbiceanu did not see a conflict between his religious creed and a current centered around supposedly objective natural laws. From 1930, he participated in Astra's literary section and headed its cultural congress, in which capacity he lectured on the organization's role in Romanian cultural life. Additionally, he played a prominent role during its annual congresses and committed himself to social activism. He was involved in Astra's literacy campaigns, inspecting and fundraising for village libraries {{in places such as}} Aleșd.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the Bosnian Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Syrian government also made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, but say it is possible that Bosnian Muslim <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest that up to 4,000 Bosnian Muslim volunteers took part.

5|$|In {{the postwar}} years, Porto Alegre turned his {{attention}} to politics, retiring from his military career as a lieutenant general, the second-highest rank in the Imperial Army. He was an affiliate of the Liberal Party at the national level and was elected to the legislature of Rio Grande do Sul. He also founded a provincial party, the Progressive-Liberal Party—a coalition of Liberals like him and some members of the Conservative Party. Porto Alegre later entered the lower house of the Brazilian parliament and was briefly Minister of War. When the Paraguayan War erupted in 1864, he returned to active duty. One of the main Brazilian commanders during the conflict, his <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> marked by important battlefield victories, as well as constant quarrels with his Argentine and Uruguayan allies.|$|E
5|$|Launched on 10 May 1940, {{the revised}} version of Unternehmen Gelb (Operation Yellow), {{also known as the}} Manstein Plan, succeeded. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Army escaped during the Battle of Dunkirk. Nevertheless, the Belgian Army, Dutch Army and most of the elite French forces were {{destroyed}} in the encirclement. This left just second rate French units to combat the entire German Army. The Luftwaffe had played an integral part in disrupting Allied operations in this early phase. The Luftwaffe's <b>participation</b> <b>was</b> particularly crucial during the Battle of Sedan which enabled the German Army to carry out Operation Yellow. By early June the Dunkirk siege was over, and on 3 June, the Germans began preparations for the conquest of the rest of France under the codename Fall Rot (Case Red).
