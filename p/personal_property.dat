5|$|It {{conveyed}} a {{tenth of}} the royal demesne– the lands of the crown as opposed to the <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> of the sovereign– into the hands of churches, ecclesiastics and laymen. In Anglo-Saxon England property was either folkland or bookland. The transmission of folkland was governed by the customary rights of kinsmen, subject to the king's approval, whereas bookland was established by the grant of a royal charter, and could be disposed of freely by the owner. Booking land thus converted it by charter from folkland to bookland. The royal demesne was the crown's folkland, whereas the king's bookland was his own <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> which he could leave by will as he chose. In the decimation Æthelwulf may have conveyed royal folkland by charter to become bookland, in some cases to laymen who already leased the land.|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{familiar}} criterial view of personhood, {{according to which}} the possession of <b>personal</b> <b>properties</b> such as self-consciousness, emotionality, sentience, and so forth is necessary and sufficient for {{the status of a}} person. I argue that this view confuses criteria for personhood with parts of an ideal of personhood. In normal cases, we have already identified a creature as a person before we start looking for it to manifest the <b>personal</b> <b>properties,</b> indeed this pre-identification is part of what makes it possible for us to see and interpret the creature as a person in the first place. This pre-identification is typically based on biological features. Except in some interesting special or science-fiction cases, some of which I discuss, it is human animals that we identify as persons...|$|R

40|$|Anonymous {{credentials}} {{allow to}} selectively disclose <b>personal</b> <b>properties</b> {{included in the}} credential, while hiding the other information.

This is a considerable improvement w. r. t. the user's anonymity. However, by disclosing too much <b>personal</b> <b>properties,</b> the user can drastically decrease his anonymity and can even become identifiable. Credentials can be shown multiple times under the same pseudonym, making usages of the same credential linkable which introduces new anonymity threats. These threats are discussed in this paper and a method is proposed whereby a user agent retrieves data in order to inform the user about his minimum level of anonymity w. r. t. a particular service provider. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Carucage was {{a medieval}} English land tax {{introduced}} by King Richard I in 1194, {{based on the}} size—variously calculated—of the estate owned by the taxpayer. It was a replacement for the danegeld, last imposed in 1162, which had become difficult to collect because of {{an increasing number of}} exemptions. Carucage was levied just six times: by Richard in 1194 and 1198; John, his brother and successor, in 1200; and John's son, Henry III, in 1217, 1220, and 1224, after which it was replaced by taxes on income and <b>personal</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The work {{presented}} in this paper aims to provide an approach to classifying web logs by <b>personal</b> <b>properties</b> of users. Design/methodology/approach – The authors describe an iterative system that begins with a small set of manually labeled terms, which are used to label queries from the log. A set of background knowledge related to these labeled queries is acquired by combining web search results on these queries. This background set is used to obtain many terms that are related to the classification task. The system then ranks each of the related terms, choosing those that most fit the <b>personal</b> <b>properties</b> of the users. These terms are then used to begin the next iteration. Findings – The authors identify the difficulties of classifying web logs, by approaching this problem from a machine learning perspective. By applying the approach developed, the authors are able to show that many queries in a large query log can be classified. Research limitations/implications – Testing results in this type of classification work is difficult, as the true <b>personal</b> <b>properties</b> of web users are unknown. Evaluation of the classification results in terms of the comparison of classified queries to well known age-related sites is a direction that is currently being exploring. Practical implications – This research is background work that can be incorporated in search engines or other web-based applications, to help marketing companies and advertisers. Originality/value – This research enhances the current state of knowledge in short-text classification and query log learning.
