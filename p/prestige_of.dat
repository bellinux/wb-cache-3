5|$|The British Empire had {{received}} the Christmas present the Prime Minister had wanted to give them, along with the moral <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> effecting a Christian occupation of Jerusalem. It was a huge blow to the Ottoman Empire, which had suffered the loss of yet another Muslim Holy Place (having already lost Mecca and Baghdad).|$|E
5|$|The Shogunate {{also was}} {{preparing}} for further conflict by modernizing its forces. In line with Parkes' designs, the British, previously the Shogunate's primary partner, proved reluctant to provide assistance. The Tokugawa thus came to rely mainly on French expertise, comforted by the military <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> Napoleon III at that time, acquired through his successes in the Crimean War and the War of Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{powers and}} <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> the prime {{minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power.

5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> the award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> {{winning the}} Cup grew, {{so did the}} need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a {{resolution}} {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E
5|$|Debates over {{rules and}} {{schedules}} {{might have been}} solvable had the league achieved economic stability but losses amongst American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively lost more than US$20 million. The Baltimore Sun provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport losses were estimated at about US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore losses were comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league given the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> the franchise.|$|E

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> elite {{knowledge}} that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and reinforced the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was born}} at Windsor Castle on 13 November 1312, and was often {{referred}} to as Edward of Windsor in his early years. The reign of his father, EdwardII, was a particularly problematic period of English history. One source of contention was the king's inactivity, and repeated failure, in the ongoing war with Scotland. Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive patronage {{of a small group of}} royal favourites. The birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily improved EdwardII's position in relation to the baronial opposition. To bolster further the independent <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> the young prince, the king had him created Earl of Chester at only twelve days of age.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a {{military}} threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army double the size of Muhammad's. The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to {{the decline of the}} <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> Meccans. Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.|$|E
5|$|General Germanus died {{in battle}} against the Persians. An army sent by Phocas against Khosrow was {{defeated}} near Dara in Upper Mesopotamia, leading to the capture of that important fortress in 605. Narses escaped from Leontius, the eunuch appointed by Phocas to deal with him, but when Narses attempted to return to Constantinople to discuss peace terms, Phocas ordered him seized and burned alive. The death of Narses along with the failure to stop the Persians damaged the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> Phocas' military regime.|$|E
5|$|In 332BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt {{with little}} {{resistance}} from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer.

The city showcased the power and <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> Hellenistic rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous Library of Alexandria. The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.|$|E

5|$|In England, Anne largely {{turned from}} {{political}} {{to social and}} artistic activities. Though she participated fully {{in the life of}} James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E

The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable damage on the <b>prestige</b> <b>of</b> medicine in the Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{influence}} of socio-economic status, size of home town, clothing importance, sorority or non-sorority membership and price on the <b>prestige</b> ratings <b>of</b> selected garments. Stores where the consumer usually shopped were investigated in relation to the <b>prestige</b> rating <b>of</b> the store. Part of the problem was to develop a measure <b>of</b> <b>prestige</b> for clothing items. The results of this study indicate that the clothing prestige measure used was successful. Single, undergraduate women at the University of Nebraska comprised the random sample. Data were gathered by mailed questionnaires. No relationship was found between socio-economic status, size of home town, and sorority or non-sorority membership and <b>prestige</b> ratings <b>of</b> garments. Some significant relationships were established for both garment price and the importance of clothing to the individual in relation to garment prestige. It was found that students shopped more often in high prestige stores. Advisor: Audrey Newto...|$|R
