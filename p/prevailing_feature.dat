It {{was equipped with}} a turret adopted from the M8 Greyhound and a manual transmission. Its <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> were two sets of rear road wheels linked by an articulated, boomerang-shaped suspension which boosted rear wheel drivea characteristic that became nearly synonymous with the Cascavel and Urutu.|$|E
60|$|Serenity was the <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> in the {{character}} of old Allan Gordon, the laird of Kinlossie; but when that amiable, portly, grand, silver-headed old gentleman suddenly met an unknown young man of fine proportions carrying his favourite niece, wrapped up as a bundle in his arms, all his serenity disappeared, and he stared, glared, almost gasped, with mingled astonishment and consternation.|$|E
60|$|John's knife {{fell from}} his hand. He tried {{to rise to}} his feet; then {{everything}} seemed to swim round, and he fell, insensible. Titus rose to his feet. He was shaken by the fall; and he, too, had lost much blood. Panting from his exertions, he looked down upon his prostrate foe; and the generosity which was the <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> of his character, except when excited in battle, mastered him.|$|E
50|$|KWE is {{characterized}} by a number of anomalies affecting the skin. Erythema causes redness of the skin, which is generally associated with inflammation and irritation. Including erythema and hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum), naturally occurring keratolytic peeling and scaling, with increased manifestation in winter, are <b>prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of the disorder.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{malformation}} apparent with JBS is hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of {{the nasal}} alae, or [...] "wing of the nose". Both hypoplasia and aplasia (partial or complete absence) of structural cartilage and tissue {{in this area of}} the nose, along with the underlying alae nasi muscle, are <b>prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of the disorder. Together, these malformations give the nose and nostrils an odd shape and appearance.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few days}} the <b>prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of camp life for Madeline's guests were sleep and rest. Dorothy Coombs slept through twenty-four hours, and then was so {{difficult}} to awaken {{that for a while}} her friends were alarmed. Helen almost fell asleep while eating and talking. The men were more visibly affected by the mountain air than the women. Castleton, however, would not succumb to the strange drowsiness while {{he had a chance to}} prowl around with a gun.|$|R
60|$|But the great, significant, and <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> of {{that winter}} was snow. Never within {{the memory of}} man had there been such heavy, continuous, {{persistent}} snow. It blocked up the windows so that men had constantly to clear a passage for daylight. It drifted up the doors so that they were continually cutting passages for themselves to the world outside. It covered the ground {{to such an extent}} that fences began to be obliterated, and landmarks to disappear, and it weighted the roofs down until some of the weaker among them bid fair to sink under the load.|$|E
60|$|Grass is the <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> of the country, {{as there}} are few shrubs, and still fewer trees. Goats and the common Indian cow are plentiful; {{but it is not}} swampy enough for the buffalo; and sheep are scarce, on account of the heat of the climate. This {{uniformity}} of feature over so immense an area is, however, due to the agency of man, and is of recent introduction; as all concur in affirming, that within the last hundred years the face of the country was covered with the same long jungle-grasses which abound in the Terai forest; and the troops cantoned at Titalya (a central position in these plains) from 1816 to 1828, confirm this statement as far as their immediate neighbourhood is concerned.|$|E
60|$|At {{first there}} were few things, apparently, that did seem to his infant mind desirable, for his {{earliest}} days were marked by a sort of chronic crossness that seemed quite unaccountable in one so healthy; but this was eventually traced {{to the influence of}} pins injudiciously disposed about the person by nurse. Possibly this experience may have tended to develop a spirit of brave endurance, and might perhaps account for the beautiful modifications of character that were subsequently observed in him. At all events, sweet, patient amiability was a <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> in the boy long before the years of infancy were over, and this heavenly aspect of him was pleasantly diversified, in course of time, by occasional displays of resolute--we might almost say heroic--self-will, which proved a constant source of mingled pride and alarm to his widowed mother.|$|E

40|$|Brucellosis is a known {{occupational}} hazard for shepherds, abattoir workers, veterinarians, dairy industry professionals and personnel in microbiological laboratories. Any organ {{may be affected}} by Brucella species but to date, severe manifestations in the pharynx have never been reported as the <b>prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of brucellosis. We report two cases in stockbreeders who presented with high-grade fever and severe exudative pharyngitis accompanied by severe odynophagia {{in the first and}} with high-grade fever and a history of relapsing tonsillitis in the second. We therefore recommend including brucellosis in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients suffering from unexplained pharyngitis or tonsillitis who belong to high-risk groups for contracting brucellosis...|$|R
40|$|Scuba diving {{has become}} a popular form of marine-based tourism and {{adventure}} activity. Yet, little empirical information details what transpires during an encounter once a diver descends from the surface. Using a qualitative methodology, the stories of scuba diving experiences were collected and examined {{in an effort to}} define some of the <b>prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of an underwater encounter. The presence of comfort, constraint, and negotiation (CNN) emerged as important features of scuba diving. Titled CCN, this article offers a conceptual model that presents the central concepts and depicts the association between comfort, constraints, and negotiation during scuba diving as dynamic elements of the activity...|$|R
60|$|Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid {{attention}} thus {{excited by}} objects {{in their own}} nature frivolous, must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination. It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme condition, or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually not frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom, until, {{at the conclusion of}} a day dream often replete with luxury, he finds the incitamentum, or first cause of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the primary object was invariably frivolous, although assuming, through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance. Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations were never pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> of the disease. In a word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as I have said before, the attentive, and are, with the day-dreamer, the speculative.|$|E

5000|$|The same {{principle}} governed {{the choice of}} site for Cistercian abbeys in that a most dismal site might be improved by the building of an abbey. The Cistercian monasteries were founded in deep, well-watered valleys, always standing at a stream's edge. The building might extend over the water {{as is the case}} at Fountains Abbey. These valleys, now rich and productive, had a very different appearance when the brethren first chose them as their place of retreat. Wide swamps, deep morasses, tangled thickets, and wild, impassable forests were their <b>prevailing</b> <b>features.</b> Clara Vallis of St Bernard, now the [...] "bright valley" [...] was originally, the [...] "Valley of Wormwood".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine if anaerobic adhesive {{can be used as a}} <b>prevailing</b> torque locking <b>feature.</b> Maintaining preload in critical joints is the usual standard that anaerobic adhesives are held to in aerospace and other industry. To test if anaerobic adhesive can be used as a <b>prevailing</b> torque locking <b>feature</b> a test procedure was developed and implemented to measure the removal torque of threaded fasteners after an allotted cure time. In total, 191 threaded fasteners of different material and coatings were tested in the unseated and seated states with various strengths and varieties of anaerobic adhesive. A series of three tests were conducted: initial use, reuse with no added anaerobic adhesive, and a third test with added product to the bolt and nut to see how removal torque would behave in these conditions. It was found that using anaerobic adhesive as a <b>prevailing</b> torque locking <b>feature</b> is viable in many cases. No published work to date analyzes anaerobic adhesive at the standard of a <b>prevailing</b> torque locking <b>feature...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the second}} half of the XIXth century, Europe, the United States and Russia {{witnessed}} a blossoming interest in the use of photography in the anthropological field, its specific use was not very clear and defined yet; as a consequence, its heuristic methodologies, technical shooting modalities, stylistic elements and figurative conventions were not clear either. We range goes from anthropometric photography to an ethnographic and folkloric portrait painting signed at the same time by anthropologists and travellers, professional photographers looking for exotic subjects, amateur photographers and soldiers who encourage a figural medley characterised by scientific, commercial and artistic veins that slowly finds its definition in some of its <b>prevailing</b> <b>features,</b> in primis those of the portrait with pictorial origins, however continuously declined and reinterpreted in several ways.

50|$|St Giles Trust was {{originally}} established in February 1962 as The Camberwell Samaritans. Based in the crypt of St Giles' Church, Camberwell, it provided emergency relief {{and support for}} the large number of homeless men in the area - a <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> of Camberwell due to a number of local hostels and shelters, including the infamous Camberwell Spike. Over the decades its work evolved to focus on providing support in a day centre located in its current head offices in Georgian House, Camberwell Church Street. In the late 1990s, it embarked on providing a housing casework service in HMP Wandsworth to help the large number of men leaving this prison only to become homeless. In the early 2000s, St Giles Trust re-positioned itself as an offender charity in response to the changing profile of clients using its services. It developed its prison and community-based work to other areas outside the capital.|$|E
40|$|Context: Except for the Ca II {{resonance}} lines, fibrils are ubiquitously {{present in}} most high-resolution observations of chromospheric lines. Aims: We show that fibrils {{are also a}} <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> in Ca II K, provided the spatial-resolution is sufficiently high. Methods: We present high spatial resolution observations of an active region in the Ca I} K line from the Swedish Solar Telescope. Through a comparison between photospheric intensity and magnetic field data, we study the connection between bright chromospheric fibrils and photospheric structures. Additionally, using Fourier analysis we study how the fibrils {{are linked to the}} observed dynamics. Results: We find that very narrow, bright fibrils are a <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> over large portions of the observed field. We also find a clear connection between the fibril footpoints and photospheric magnetic features. We show that the fibrils play two distinct roles in the observed dynamics: depending on their location they can act as a canopy suppressing oscillations or they can channel low-frequency oscillations into the chromosphere. Conclusions: The Ca II K fibrils share many characteristics with fibrils observed in other chromospheric lines, but some features, such as the very small widths, are unique to these observations.

40|$|The Sespe {{formation}} comprises {{a series}} of sandstones, shales and conglomerate, several thousand feet in thickness, and receives {{its name from the}} type locality of its occurrence on Sespe Creek north of the Santa Clara Valley, Ventura County, California. Originally described by Watts [1], this formation has been recognized as furnishing an important stratigraphic record of the early Tertiary in the southern coast ranges with a position between marine sediments of Eocene age and marine sediments of Miocene age. At a number of localities in southern California deposits having the stratigraphic position and lithologic characteristics of the Sespe are designated by that name and are regarded as the correlatives of this formation. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>features</b> which have been noted with regard to the Sespe are (1) the presence of red beds, and (2) the absence of a fossil record...|$|R

40|$|Over recent times, {{social work}} has faced many challenges. This chapter does {{not focus on}} these challenges, but takes them into account when giving {{consideration}} {{to the construction of}} the profession in general, and the welfare regime of which it is a part. In giving consideration to this construction, the meaning of the ‘social’ component of ‘social work’ is deemed to be important to the identity of the profession, along with the socio-economic context from which it emerged, and to which it currently belongs. This theoretical foundation calls into question the essentialism of a fixed professional identity, but it also assumes that there is a body of practice known as social work which, over time has become associated with some <b>prevailing</b> <b>features.</b> A chronological approach to the construction of social work is taken and then a case study is offered.

40|$|Earthquakes {{occur as}} dynamic shear cracks and convert {{part of the}} elastic strain energy into {{radiated}} and dissipated energy. Local evolution of shear strength that governs this process, which is variable in space and time, can be studied from laboratory experiments and rupture models. At the same time, increasingly accurate measurements of radiated energy and other quantities characterize earthquakes in a rupture-averaged way. Here, we present and study two approaches to averaging frictional dissipation during dynamic rupture. The first one {{is based on the}} actual progression of dissipation, but the associated averaged shear stress does not reflect the local friction behavior. The second one is constructed to preserve <b>prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of local stress-slip response and performs well in the examples studied. The developed approach should be useful for visualizing energy partitioning in dynamic models and linking them to observations using diagrams that reflect dominant features of local stress evolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a novel learning scheme for hidden dependencies in video streams. The proposed scheme aims to transform a given sequential stream into a dependency structure of particle populations. Each particle population summarizes an associated segment. The novel {{point of the}} proposed scheme is that both of dependency learning and segment summarization are performed in an unsupervised online manner without assuming priors. The proposed scheme is executed in two-stage learning. At the first stage, a segment corresponding to a common dominant image is estimated using evolutionary particle filtering. Each dominant image is depicted based on combinations of image descriptors. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of a dominant image are selected through evolution. Genetic operators introduce the essential diversity preventing sample impoverishment. At the second stage, transitional probability between the estimated segments is computed and stored. The proposed scheme is applied to extract dependencies in an episode of a TV drama. We demonstrate performance by comparing to human estimations...|$|R

40|$|Identity is {{an ironic}} concept {{in the heart}} of {{consumer}} research. Although endowed with the art of unfolding the mysteries of identities and myriads of meanings, consumer research, itself, needs to be identified as a ‘distinct academic discipline ’ in the area of social sciences (Belk 1986; Simonson et al. 2001). One of the main causes of such a distinction deferral is rooted in consumer research’s predominant focus on developed and Western contexts and neglecting less developed and non-Western countries (Arnould and Thompson 2005). This, however, is related to the fact that consumerism, as a <b>prevailing</b> <b>feature</b> of modern societies (Zukin and Maguire 2004) originated from Western and developed con-texts (Silverstone 1981). Therefore, the most fundamental step for consumer research to be differentiated as a distinct academic discipline is conducting ‘global consumer research ’ (Firat an...|$|E
40|$|Burst {{suppression}} is an electroencepholagram (EEG) {{pattern in}} which high-voltage activity alternates with isoelectric quiescence. It {{is characteristic of}} an inactivated brain and is commonly observed at deep levels of general anesthesia, hypothermia, and in pathological conditions such as coma and early infantile encephalopathy. We propose a unifying mechanism for burst suppression that accounts {{for all of these}} conditions. By constructing a biophysical computational model, we show how the <b>prevailing</b> <b>features</b> of burst suppression may arise through the interaction between neuronal dynamics and brain metabolism. In each condition, the model suggests that a decrease in cerebral metabolic rate, coupled with the stabilizing properties of ATP-gated potassium channels, leads to the characteristic epochs of suppression. Consequently, the model makes a number of specific predictions of experimental and clinical relevance. National Institutes of Health (U. S.) (Grant DP 1 -OD 003646) National Institutes of Health (U.
