50|$|These {{compounds}} react readily with nucleophiles like water, alcohols, amines, thiols, and Grignard reagents. If the nucleophile <b>is</b> {{water the}} <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfinic acid, {{if it is}} an alcohol the <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfinic ester, {{if it is a}} primary or secondary amine the <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfinamide, if it is a thiol the <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a thiosulfinate, while if it is a Grignard reagent the <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfoxide. Because of their reactivity and instability, alkanesulfinyl chlorides are generally used without purification immediately after their synthesis. Storage is not recommended since pressure develops within the container due to hydrogen chloride release.|$|R

5|$|AlCl3 is {{probably}} the most commonly used Lewis acid and {{also one of the most}} powerful.

It also finds use in polymerization and isomerization reactions of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the <b>products</b> <b>are</b> easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side <b>products</b> <b>are</b> gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
