50|$|<b>Progress</b> <b>Notes</b> are {{the part}} of a medical record where {{healthcare}} professionals record details to document a patient's clinical status or achievements {{during the course of a}} hospitalization or over the course of outpatient care. Reassessment data may be recorded in the <b>Progress</b> <b>Notes,</b> Master Treatment Plan (MTP) and/or MTP review. <b>Progress</b> <b>notes</b> are written in a variety of formats and detail, depending on the clinical situation at hand and the information the clinician wishes to record. One example is the SOAP note, where the note is organized into Subjective,Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections. Another example is the DART system, organized into Description, Assessment, Response, and Treatment.Documentation of care and treatment is an extremely important part of the treatment process. <b>Progress</b> <b>notes</b> are written by both physicians and nurses to document patient care on a regular interval during a patient's hospitalization.|$|R

40|$|Background: Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on physicians’ accuracy in coding for their services. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the current procedural terminology (CPT) evaluation and management coding accuracy of family physicians and define demographic variables associated with coding accuracy. Methods: Six hundred randomly selected active members of the Illinois Academy of Family Physicians were sent six hypothetical <b>progress</b> <b>notes</b> of office visits along with a demographic survey. The study group assigned CPT evaluation and management codes to each of the <b>progress</b> <b>notes</b> and completed the demographic survey. Five expert coders also assigned codes to each of the cases. The accuracy of family physicians in determining CPT E/M codes was determined relative to that of expert coders. Results: Family physicians agreed with the experts’ CPT evaluation and management codes for 52 % of established patient <b>progress</b> <b>notes,</b> the most common error being undercoding. In contrast, for new patient <b>progress</b> <b>notes,</b> family physicians agreed with the experts only 17 % of the time, the predominant error being overcoding. No surveyed demographic variable was associated with coding accuracy. Conclusions: The error rate for physician CPT coding is substantial and occurs more commonly with new patients.

5000|$|The urge amongst clinicians for faster {{text entry}} while {{attempting}} to retain semantic clarity {{has contributed to the}} noisy structure of progress notes. A <b>progress</b> <b>note</b> is considered as containing noise when there is difference between the surface form of the entered text and the intended content. For instance, when a clinician enters [...] "blood pressure" [...] or [...] "bp" [...] instead of [...] "blood pressure", or an acronym such as [...] "ARF" [...] that could mean [...] "Acute Renal Failure" [...] or [...] "Acute Rheumatic Fever". The more noise clinicians introduce in their progress notes, the less intelligible the notes will become. Some of the common types of noise are abbreviation, misspelling and punctuation errors.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the major}} issues {{relating}} {{to the use of}} speech recognition in healthcare is that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to [...] "Meaningful Use" [...] standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an Electronic Health Record or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, <b>progress</b> <b>note</b> or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a controlled vocabulary) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.|$|E

40|$|A b s t r a c t Objective: To {{investigate}} whether using a computer-based patient record (CPR) affects the completeness of documentation and appropriateness of documented clinical decisions. Design: A blinded expert panel of four experienced internists evaluated 50 <b>progress</b> <b>notes</b> {{of patients who}} had chronic diseases and whose physicians used either a CPR or a traditional paper record. Measurements: Completeness of problem and medication lists in <b>progress</b> <b>notes,</b> allergies noted in the entire record, consideration of relevant patient factors in the <b>progress</b> <b>note’s</b> diagnostic and treatment plans, and appropriateness of documented clinical decisions. Results: The expert reviewers rated the problem lists and medication lists in the CPR <b>progress</b> <b>notes</b> as more complete (1. 79 / 2. 00 vs. 0. 93 / 2. 00, P < 0. 001, and 1. 75 / 2. 00 vs. 0. 91 / 2. 00, P < 0. 001, respectively) {{than those in the}} paper record. The allergy lists in both records were similar. Providers using a CPR documented consideration of more relevant patient factors when making their decisions (1. 53 / 2. 00 vs. 1. 07 / 2. 00, P < 0. 001), and documented more appropriate clinical decisions (3. 63 / 5. 00 vs. 2. 50 / 5. 00, P < 0. 001), compared with providers who used traditional paper records. Conclusions: Physicians in our study who used a CPR produced more complete documentation and documented more appropriate clinical decisions, as judged by an expert review panel. Because the physicians who used the CPR in our study volunteered to do so, further study is warranted to test whether the same conclusions would apply to all CPR users and whether the improvement in documentation leads to better clinical outcomes. n JAMIA. 1999; 6 : 245 – 251...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{develop a}} model as a starting-point for {{developing}} a problem-oriented clinical notes application as a generic component of an Electronic Health Record (EHR). Methods: We used the generic conceptualization of Weed's problem-oriented medical record (POMR) to link progress notes to problems, and the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP) headings to classify elements of these notes. Health Level 7 (HL 7) Version 3 and Unified Modeling Language (UML) were used for modeling. We looked especially at the role of Conditions and Concerns, and how to model these to document clinical reasoning. Results: We developed a generic HL 7 -based model for progress notes. In this model the specific clinical note has a condition as its reason. An assertion can be made about a condition. Any condition, observation or procedure can be a concern {{that has to be}} tracked. Utmost important is the relationship between constituting parts of a <b>progress</b> <b>note</b> and specially between progress notes by linking a <b>progress</b> <b>note</b> to conditions that are part of an earlier <b>progress</b> <b>note.</b> From this model a comprehensive hierarchical condition tree can be built. Several views, such as chronological, SOAP and condition-oriented, are possible. The clinical notes application is used in daily clinical practice. The model meets explicit design criteria and clinical needs. Conclusions: With the comprehensive HL 7 standard it is possible to model and map progress notes using SOAP headings and POMR methodology. We have developed a generic, flexible and applicable paradigm by using acts for each assessment that refer to a condition (1), by separating conditions from concerns (2), and by an extensive use of the working list act (3) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: To explore {{different}} user-interface {{designs for}} structured <b>progress</b> <b>note</b> entry, with a long-term goal of developing design guidelines for user interfaces where users select items from large medical vocabularies. Design: The authors created eight different prototypes of a pen-based progress-note-writing system called PEN-Ivory. Each prototype allows physicians to write patient progress notes using simple pen-based gestures such as circle, line-out, and scratch-out. The {{result of an}} interaction with PEN-Ivory is a <b>progress</b> <b>note</b> in English prose. The eight prototypes were designed in a principled way, so that they differ from one another in just one of three different user-interface characteristics. Measurements: Five of the eight prototypes were tested by measuring {{the time it took}} 15 users, each using a distinct prototype, to document three patient cases consisting of a total of 63 medical findings. Results: The prototype that allowed the fastest data entry had the following three user-interface characteristics: it used a paging rather than a scrolling form, it used a fixed palette of modifiers rather than a dynamic “pop-up ” palette, and it made available all findings from the controlle...|$|E
