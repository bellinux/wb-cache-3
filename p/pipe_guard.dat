30|$|Comparing {{the steel}} {{guardrail}} and the steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe,</b> the GHG emissions {{of the steel}} <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> were 127  % of the GHG emissions of the steel guardrail, which was significantly higher. There are two likely reasons for this. First, the <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> has a narrower support post spacing (3  m), and therefore uses {{a larger number of}} support posts with an attendant increase in the emissions associated with the raw material procurement and production of support posts, as well as their construction. Second, the <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> is installed in three tiers of beams, which increases the number of attachment fittings. While the GHG emissions from raw material procurement and production of attachment fittings for the steel guardrail were 1.36  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, the equivalent emissions for the steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> were 6.00  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the wooden}} {{guardrails}} with the steel guardrail and <b>guard</b> <b>pipe,</b> the GHG emissions {{of the wooden}} type no. 1 {{were significantly higher than}} the emissions of the steel guardrail and steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> (158 and 125  %, respectively, for the painted case; 175 and 138  %, respectively for the pressure-injected case). Looking at the wooden type no. 3, the emissions were much smaller than the emissions of the steel guardrail and steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> (83 and 65  %, respectively, for the painted case; 92 and 72  %, respectively for the pressure-injected case). Incidentally, there have recently been examples of the wooden type no. 3 being installed with support post spacing extended from 2 to 3  m, and these have passed the vehicle collision test [35]. There are no such installations within Nagano Prefecture yet; however, the GHG emissions of the pressure-injected case in the example of a 3  m installation with a 20 -year service life are calculated to be 28.34  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, which correspond to about 86  % of the current 2  m example. A further GHG emission reduction effect is therefore achievable.|$|R
30|$|The steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe,</b> {{which was}} {{recently}} {{developed as a}} type that is more considerate of the surrounding scenery, has more support posts and beams than the steel guardrail, and accordingly its GHG emissions are greater (127  % of those of the steel guardrail).|$|R
30|$|Greenhouse gas (GHG: {{specifically}} CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O) emissions {{over the}} life cycles of type no. 1 and no. 3 wooden guardrails widely used in Nagano Prefecture were evaluated. A comparison with steel (guardrail and <b>guard</b> <b>pipe)</b> types was conducted to investigate the GHG emission reduction effect of wooden guardrails. It was shown that the greatest GHG emissions {{for all types of}} guardrails occur during the raw material procurement and production process. The amount of total (life cycle) GHG emissions for pressure-injected wooden type no. 3 guardrails (92  % of steel guardrails and 72  % of steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipes)</b> shows that replacing steel with this type of wooden guardrail can reduce GHG emissions. On the other hand, comparison of the GHG emissions for pressure-injected type no. 1 guardrails with steel (175  % of guardrail; 138  % of <b>guard</b> <b>pipe)</b> shows that no reduction is achieved. When the disposed wooden beams (painted type no. 1; painted and pressure-injected type no. 3) are chipped and used for energy as a substitute for Type-A heavy oil, the volume of the GHG emission reduction significantly exceeds the GHG emission volume, and GHG emissions can be reduced by up to a maximum of 117.67  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the wooden}} {{guardrails}} with the steel guardrail and <b>guard</b> <b>pipe,</b> {{we found that}} the GHG emission reduction effect of replacing the steel items with wooden ones could be a maximum of 117.67  kg-CO 2 -eq/m when replacing steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> with painted wooden type no. 3. However, there would not be any reduction if replacing steel guardrail with pressure-injected wooden type no. 1. On the other hand, as explained in “Method of evaluating life cycle GHG emissions” in this study, the target for evaluation is the emission and reduction of GHGs originating from fossil fuel consumption, and the carbon reserve and CO 2 (other than CH 4 and N 2 O) emissions of the wood itself are not evaluated. Therefore, considering the CO 2 balance of the wood itself could change the GHG balance in wooden type no. 1 and No. 3 guardrails, and the GHG emission reduction amount due from substitution of steel types. Examination of this possibility is a topic for future study.|$|R
