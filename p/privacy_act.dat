5|$|Related to privacy, the ACLU {{engaged in}} several battles {{to ensure that}} {{government}} records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family Educational Rights and <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act,</b> which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act</b> which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act</b> places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of the air traffic control transmissions associated with the flight. The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act,</b> the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 air traffic control audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act. Several key minutes of the air traffic control audio {{can be found on the}} Toronto Star web site.|$|E

5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act)</b> for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E

On December 2, 2009, in an interim decision on Aguirre's FOIA case, the Court again ruled in his favor. On May 26, 2010, Aguirre filed papers in this case, seeking an order directing the SEC to release additional Pequot records {{to him on the}} grounds that under the FOIA, the SEC had to turn the records over to him because it had filed no case against Pequot or anyone else.

The former could release transmitted data only to its sender or recipient; the latter could also release that information to the subscriber regardless of who had sent or received it.|$|E

25|$|The Public Safety and Cyber Security Enhancement Act was {{introduced}} on September 20 to the House by Republican Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX). Its main {{focus was on}} the unauthorized access of protected computers and proposed making modifications to the laws based on the Cable TV <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act</b> surrounding cable TV subscriber privacy, as well as various changes to pen register and trap and trace laws. The bill would have made an exception for foreign intelligence gathering in the laws that require a court order necessary for pen register and trap and trace surveillance. It would also have removed restrictions on the prohibition of gaining access to cable television subscriber records and only prohibited the disclosure of viewing patterns of cable television subscribers.|$|E
25|$|The {{new rules}} {{allowing}} document reclassification were outlined in Executive Order 12356. Previously, Executive Order 12065, issued by Jimmy Carter in 1978, had prohibited document reclassification. Executive Order 12356, issued by Ronald Reagan in 1982, eliminated the reclassification prohibition and described {{situations in which}} documents could be reclassified. Released documents could be reclassified {{as long as they}} could be reasonably recovered (meaning that documents available to the public at large would not meet this criterion). It also allowed documents requested under the FOIA or <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act</b> to be classified or reclassified provided they met specified requirements (e.g., certain matters related to national security). According to Bamford, he could not be prosecuted under the new rules because of the principle of ex post facto.|$|E
25|$|The {{second term}} of the Binns {{government}} saw continued economic growth with new business investment,economic diversification, export and tourism growth, and construction of the Atlantic Technology Centre in Charlottetown {{as a catalyst for}} development of the burgeoning IT sector. Investments continued in education and health care for extensive school construction and repair, creation of the PEI Cancer Treatment Centre in Charlottetown and Prince County Hospital in Summerside. The province's first Freedom of Information and Protection of <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act</b> was also passed. During this time Prince Edward Island launched Waste Watch, becoming the first Canadian province to offer waste management services to every home and business resulting in a 65% waste diversion rate and closure of many community landfills. Investments were also made to expand renewable energy use with the development of the North Cape Wind Farm in West Prince, strengthening Prince Edward Island's credentials as a national leader in environmental sustainability.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, while filming for the show, the CBSA {{conducted}} {{a raid on}} a construction site in Vancouver. They arrested a Mexican national, Oscar Mata Duran, and brought him to an immigration detention centre where he was presented with a filming consent form. Canada's Privacy Commissioner, following a complaint from the man, investigated. The Commissioner found that the CBSA breached Canada's <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act</b> by filming their interaction with Duran before he was advised {{of the purposes of}} filming and found that the coercive nature of being detained in a holding facility would have prevented Duran from providing informed consent for his appearance. The Commissioner lauded Duran as a real hero for lodging the privacy complaint even though he would not personally benefit from it. Duran was deported following the raid. In light of Duran's complaint the Privacy Commissioner recommended that the CBSA end its participation in the show, the CBSA announced that the show would not return for a fourth season.|$|E
25|$|Ruppersberger, {{along with}} Michigan Republican Mike Rogers, co-sponsored the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, {{designed}} to increase intelligence sharing between private cyber security firms and government agencies. More than 60 businesses and trade organizations submitted letters of support including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Time Warner, Verizon and AT, IBM and Intel. Despite several amendments to address privacy concerns, some groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have criticized the act {{for a lack of}} civil liberties protections, claiming that it authorizes government surveillance of private communications and allows companies to hand over large amounts of personal information on their clients without a warrant or judicial oversight, and thereby creates a cybersecurity loophole in existing privacy laws, such as the Wiretap Act and the Electronic Communications <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act.</b> CISPA passed the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012. It was reintroduced into the House on February 13, 2013, and passed on April 18, 2013, by a bipartisan vote of 288-127.

500|$|In June 2012, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{brought forth}} controversial legislation, known as Bill 29, that reformed the province's Access to Information and Protection of <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act.</b> The {{amendments to the}} act expanded the government's ability to deny access to information by keeping ministerial briefings secret, ignoring requests for information that cabinet ministers deem to be [...] "frivolous," [...] and barring the auditor general from a wider array of records. Deadlines to respond to requests were pushed back, and fees were increased from $15 to $25. The opposition leaders immediately condemned the bill and said they would team up to filibuster the bill. An expert on international access-to-information laws, Toby Mendel, called key changes to the act “breathtaking,” and said the province will rank lower than some third world countries with the new legislation. As well 75 people also assembled outside the Confederation Building to protest the bill. However, Newfoundland and Labrador's information commissioner, Ed Ring, said bill 29 was {{not a bad thing}} and that it would not stop the Access to the Information and Protection of <b>Privacy</b> <b>Act</b> from doing its job. Bill 29 led to a four-day filibuster in the House of Assembly, which eventually ended when the government invoked closure to the debate. NDP leader Lorraine Michael's accusation that the government was being racist, when referring to Mendel's criticism of the bill, was cited by the government as reasons to end debate.|$|E
