40|$|Stenopelmatus navajo is {{sympatric}} {{and closely}} related to S. fuscus. They can only be identified by study of live individuals. Drumming patterns of <b>S.</b> <b>navajo</b> and <b>S.</b> fucus are also very similar and cannot be used for field identification. DESCRIPTION: Size of <b>S.</b> <b>navajo</b> is very large for the genus. Ground color whitish, and the abdomen is bulky, and black-banded. They have a large head with a large powerful jaw, with which they can bite severely, although they are non-poisonous. The space between the eyes is wide. They are wingless, and have strong spiny legs, that allows they to burrow rather rapidly. The tarsi is not lobed, but more or less flattened laterally. The hind femora do not extend beyond {{the apex of the}} abdomen. This species usually occurs under stones in loose soils. Identification of species within this genus is difficult with preserved specimens, because color patterns may be lost. AIDS TO IDENTIFICATION: Large size, pale coloration.

40|$|I am not Navajo and, therefore, I do not {{practice}} Navajo weaving. I do use the wedge weave technique that was {{practiced by the}} Navajo for a period in the late 1800 <b>s.</b> A <b>Navajo</b> wedge weave is easily recognizable because of the colors used and the shapes consistent with other Navajo weaving. Although I use the same technique, my use of color and shape transforms wedge weave into a contemporary weave. Wedge weave is an unusual form of tapestry. Pictorial imagery is not its goal. Instead, the weft is woven {{in such a way}} that the actual horizontal-vertical structure of the woven plane is challenged. The weft is woven diagonally from right to left in one section or wedge and then from left to right in the next section or wedge. This diagonal pressure on the warp forces it out of the vertical. The edges of the weaving push out as a result to form a scallop. Wedge weave will be explored and explained through traditional and contemporary examples...|$|R

40|$|Food deserts are low-income areas lacking {{access to}} nutritious and {{affordable}} food. Such limited access has various implications for public health, particularly diet-related {{diseases such as}} diabetes. Among American Indian communities, diabetes is particularly rampant at nearly {{twice the rate of}} white populations in the U. <b>S.</b> On the <b>Navajo</b> Nation, diabetes incidence has been estimated to be as high as 1 in 3. According to the USDA, the majority of the Navajo Nation is considered a food desert. This paper utilizes food sovereignty as a lens for decolonization to identify the underlying causes of hunger and nutrition-related diseases within Diné communities. This paper will explore the histories of the change in the Diné diet and how colonial processes and the loss of traditional food systems affects current food and health patterns on the Navajo Nation. By expanding the scope of public health issues such as obesity and diabetes in Native American communities from food access and nutrition to power relations embedded in colonial structures that have resulted in the loss of indigenous sovereignty and power, I hope to pinpoint entry points for future indigenous researchers to develop and enact policies that will expand access to healthy and culturally significant foods on the Navajo Nation and contribute to efforts to restore food sovereignty of the Navajo Nation by rebuilding local food economies...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{estimating}} the value of sums of the form [...] . when one {{has the ability to}} sample xi;> 0 with probability proportional to its magnitude. When p = 2, this problem is equivalent to estimating the selectivity of a self-join query in database systems when one can sample rows randomly. We also study the special case when {x} is the degree sequence of a graph, which corresponds to counting the number of p-stars in a graph when one has the ability to sample edges randomly. Our algorithm for a [...] . -multiplicative approximation of Sp has query and time complexities [...] . Here, m = [...] . is the number of edges in the graph, E 2 Sp or equivalently, half the number of records in the database table. Similarly, n is the number of vertices in the graph and the number of unique values in the database table. We also provide tight lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic factors) in almost all cases, even when {xi} is a degree sequence and one is allowed to use the structure of the graph {{to try to get a}} better estimate. We are not aware of any prior lower bounds on {{the problem of}} join selectivity estimation. For the graph problem, prior work which assumed the ability to sample only vertices uniformly gave algorithms with matching lower bounds [Gonen, Ron, and Shavitt. SIAM J. Comput., 25 (2011), pp. 1365 - 14111. With the ability to sample edges randomly, we show that one can achieve faster algorithms for approximating the number of star subgraphs, bypassing the lower bounds in this prior work. For example, in the regime where [...] ., our upper bound is [...] . in contrast to their [...] . lower bound when no random edge queries are available. In addition, we consider the problem of counting the number of directed paths of length two when the graph is directed. This problem is equivalent to estimating the selectivity of a join query between two distinct tables. We prove that the general version of this problem cannot be solved in sublinear time. However, when the ratio between in-degree and out-degree is bounded-or equivalently, when the ratio between the number of occurrences of values in the two columns being joined is bounded-we give a sublinear time algorithm via a reduction to the undirected case. by John Lee Thompson <b>Peebles,</b> Jr. Thesis: <b>S.</b> M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2016.

40|$|The ongoing {{drought in}} the US Southwest (SW) {{has led to}} {{particularly}} large and severe wildfires, tree die-off events, insect outbreaks, and increased forest stress levels. These disturbances underscore the vulnerabilities of SW dry conifer forests to climate change and past land-uses. Climate projections show a clear upward trend in regional temperatures, which will lead to accelerated heat-related stressors and disturbances in the coming decades. Already, more than 20 % of the dry conifer forests of the SW have been severely impacted. This number is likely to grow, but we lack {{a clear picture of}} where, when, and to what degree other forest areas will be affected. Here, I apply dendroecological methods to evaluate patterns and processes that might determine greater or lesser vulnerability in dry conifer forests. Much of this work stems from critical concerns voiced by the Navajo Forestry Department (NFD). Long-term and representative data are necessary for the NFD, as they are responsible for closely managing over 250, 000 hectares of forests and woodlands for the traditional products and ecosystem services that their forests provide for the Navajo people. The first study takes a multi-century perspective on changing fire regimes across Navajo forests, and places current forest structure and recent severe events in a long-term context. We found that surface fires were frequent across the landscape from at least the late- 1500 <b>s</b> until 1880. <b>Navajo</b> settlement of the area began to affect the fire regimes with added small fires in some areas beginning in 1700. By 1832, the rise of traditional pastoralist practices and transhumant migrations reduced fire activity in areas of greater use. Conditions changed following the establishment of the Navajo reservation in 1868, as livestock herds grew rapidly and initiated a near-synchronous and widespread collapse of fire regimes across the study area by 1880. The legacies of this change in land use are greater forest densities and higher fuel loads in some areas, raising the vulnerability of the forest to more severe fires. The second study assesses {{one of the most dramatic}} long-term consequences of recent high-severity fires in the SW, the rapid post-fire transition of dry conifer forest to oak-dominated shrubfields. To assess probable successional trajectories and interactions with climate change of recently converted forests, we reconstructed the age structures and fire regimes of some of the largest and oldest shrubfields in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. We found that shrubfields are a resilient configuration to drought and fire, historically burning at the same rates and under similar climate as dry conifer forests. Dense shrubfields pose a significant challenge to conifer recruitment from competition effects, with our sites persisting for over 100 years in the absence of burning and through periods of favorable climate to conifers. Given future warming favoring oak over pine, and projected trends in fire activity and high-severity fire behavior, we expect much more forest area to convert to shrubfield, especially in the absence of restoration efforts to reduce crown fire potential. Finally, we evaluate landscape-scale variability in tree growth response to regional climate across the Navajo forest. Projections of climate-induced forest decline often omit upper-elevation and mesic sites because they are not represented in regional tree-ring chronology networks. We found that these stands had much lower response to 20 th century droughts than mid to lower elevation stands, and that targeted tree-ring sites are consistently more correlated with regional climate. However, as temperature-driven atmospheric moisture demand has remained above average since ~ 1997 in the study area, the upper-elevation trees are now nearly as responsive to regional climate as lower elevation xeric sites, probably due to increased moisture limitations. Recent warming has thus synchronized tree growth to an unprecedented extent across this large landscape and regionally...|$|R
