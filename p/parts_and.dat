40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a general approach {{and a system}} tool for concurrent metal stamping <b>part</b> <b>and</b> die development. After analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the metal stamping development process and the interaction level among <b>part</b> design <b>and</b> die design activities, the needs for concurrent stamping <b>part</b> <b>and</b> die design are explored in depth, and an activity model for concurrent stamping <b>part</b> <b>and</b> die development is presented. A framework is proposed to support concurrent stamping <b>part</b> <b>and</b> die development by providing computer aided environments for <b>part,</b> process <b>and</b> die design, advisory tools for <b>part</b> stampability evaluation <b>and</b> <b>part</b> cost estimation, as well as process and die evaluation, and knowledge bases incorporated in the advisory tools. According to the framework, a design support strategy for concurrent stamping <b>part</b> <b>and</b> die development is investigated to guide the coordination of design activities including material selection, part stampability evaluation, process planning and die design, as well as cost estimation. Based on the proposed approach and strategy, the system prototype has been developed employing the knowledge-based approach. The results of this research will facilitate the rationalization of stamping <b>part</b> <b>and</b> die development and thus reduce the cost of metal stamping development...|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E
