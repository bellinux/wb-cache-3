40|$|A <b>pig</b> <b>starter</b> ration is {{the most}} {{expensive}} ration in an entire swine feeding program. The baby pig requires both a high quality and quantity of nutrients in the starter ration. In as much as protein and carbohydrates make up the major portion of the starter ration, cost reduction efforts should begin with one or both of these essential ingredients. Lactose has proved to be the carbohydrate of choice in <b>pig</b> <b>starter</b> rations when soybean oil, one of the least expensive commercial sources of protein, is used. Commercial lactose is available from several different sources as well as in several different forms. Since the relative feeding value of three major sources of lactose was unknown, a study involving four different experiments was conducted. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to evaluate dried skimmilk, feed-grade lactose and dried whey as sources of lactose for baby pigs. Four experiments involving two hundred and sixty-four baby pigs were used to evaluate several different commercial sources of lactose for baby <b>pig</b> <b>starter</b> rations. In the initial experiment, four ration treatments were studied, each containing a level of 20 percent lactose. Five ration treatments, each containing 48. 8 percent lactose, were evaluated in the second experiment in this series of study. In a third experiment, dried whey and whey by-products were compared as sources of lactose for baby <b>pig</b> <b>starter</b> rations. In the last experiment of this series of study, ratios of dried skimmilk and whey were compared. From these studies it has been shown that with the sources and types of lactose used in this study there is definitely a variation in the performance of the baby pig in the rate of gain and feed efficiency during the earlier part of his life (first five weeks). In this study the results obtained during the first experimental period (initial test period) did not appear to have any great reflection on the performance of the pig during the subsequent four-week test period.

40|$|In two trials 330 {{crossbred}} pigs averaging 12 pounds {{were used}} to evaluate the effect of starter diet complexity and physical form on average daily gain, feed efficiency, and cost of gain. In a processing efficiency trial, pellet durability, amount fines returned, and power consumption were determined. A diet with milo-soybean meal as a basis (simple) was compared with one containing 3 % tallow and 5 % dried whey in milo-soybean meal (complex). Each was processed into three physical forms: meal, pellet, and crumble. Adding 3 % tallow and 5 % whey to milo-soybean meal diet did not improve performance of the <b>starter</b> <b>pigs</b> but did increase cost of gain. In Trial I, average daily gain of pigs consuming pellets or crumbles was improved over that of meal-fed pigs (P<. 05). In both trials, cost of gain was the greatest for crumble-fed <b>pigs.</b> <b>Starter</b> <b>pig</b> diet complexity and physical form did not affect the number of days to market or weight per day of age. In the processing efficiency trial, pellet durability and fines returned for reprocessing were adversely affected by adding of whey and tallow, but rate and power efficiency were improved by including whey and tallow. These results suggest that <b>starter</b> <b>pigs</b> will perform similarly and that cost of gain will be less for pigs on a simple diet in meal form than on a more complex diet in pellets or crumbles...|$|R

40|$|Some feed {{ingredients}} bind more acid in {{the stomach}} than others {{and for this reason}} may be best omitted from <b>pig</b> <b>starter</b> foods if gastric acidity is to be promoted. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the acid-binding capacity (ABC) of ingredients commonly used in <b>pig</b> <b>starter</b> foods. Ingredients were categorised as follows: (i) milk products (n = 6), (ii) cereals (n = 10), (iii) root and pulp products (n = 5), (iv) vegetable proteins (n = 11), (v) meat and fish meal (n = 2), (vi) medication (n = 3), (vii) amino acids (n = 4), (viii) minerals (n = 16), (ix) acid salts (n = 4), (x) acids (n = 10). A 0. 5 g sample of food was suspended in 50 ml distilled de-ionised water with continuous stirring. This suspension was titrated with 0. 1 mol/L HCl or 0. 1 mol/L NaOH so that approximately 10 additions of titrant was required to reach pH 3. 0. The pH readings after each addition were recorded following equilibration for three minutes. ABC was calculated as the amount of acid in milliequivalents (meq) required to lower the pH of 1 kg food to (a) pH 4. 0 (ABC- 4) and (b) pH 3. 0 (ABC- 3). Categories of food had significantly different (P < 0. 01) ABC values. Mean ABC- 4 and ABC- 3 values of the ten categories were: (i) 623 (s. d. 367. 0) and 936 (s. d. 460. 2), (ii) 142 (s. d. 79. 2) and 324 (s. d. 146. 4), (iii) 368 (s. d. 65. 3) and 804 (s. d. 126. 7), (iv) 381 (s. d. 186. 1) and 746 (s. d. 227. 0), (v) 749 (s. d. 211. 6) and 1508 (s. d. 360. 8), (vi) 120 (s. d. 95. 6) and 261 (s. d. 163. 2), (vii) 177 (s. d. 60. 7) and 1078 (s. d. 359. 0), (viii) 5064 (s. d. 5525. 1) and 7051 (s. d. 5911. 6), (ix) 5057 (s. d. 1336. 6) and 8945 (s. d. 2654. 1) and (x) - 5883 (s. d. 4220. 5) and - 2591 (s. d. 2245. 4) meq HCl per kg, respectively. Within category, ABC- 3 and ABC- 4 values were highly correlated: R 2 values of 0. 80 and greater for food categories i, iv, v, vi, vii and viii. The correlation between predicted and observed ABC values of 34 mixed diets was 0. 83 for ABC- 4 and 0. 71 for ABC- 3. It was concluded that complete diets with low ABC values may be formulated through careful selection of ingredients. The final pH to which ABC is measured should matter little as ABC- 3 and ABC- 4 are highly correlated. </p...|$|E
40|$|One hundred sixty-eight pigs {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of soybean processing on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance and nutrient digestibility. Soybean products tested were commercial soybean meal, full-fat roasted soybeans from either a Roast-A-Tron or Rickles Roaster, extruded soybeans, and steam-flaked soybeans. Pigs fed soybeans from the Rickles Roaster had lower average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and feed efficiency than pigs fed the other soybean products. Rickles soybeans had lower apparent digestibility of nitrogen, dry matter, total fat, and long chain fatty acids than the other treatments. Pigs fed steam-flaked soybeans had the second lowest growth rate.

40|$|Two 35 -day trials {{involving}} 504 pigs {{were conducted}} to determine the efficacy of dietary supplementation of copper sulfate (CuS 04) and/or dried whey to corn-soybean meal <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets (1. 25 % lysine). Pigs were weaned at 21 + 3 days and ranged in average initial weight from 8. 1 to 19. 2 lbs. In trial 1, CuSO 4 addition of either 0 or 250 ppm were made to diets containing 0, 10, and 20 % extra-grade dried whey. At both 2 and 5 weeks, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency (F/G) improved linearly (P<. 05) with increasing whey levels. Also, CuSO 4 additions of 250 ppm increased ADG and ADFI (P<. 05) at 2 and 5 weeks. The six dietary treatments in trial 2 consisted of a negative control (no CuSO 4 or dried whey), and five other diets containing 250 ppm CuS 04 : with graded levels of dried whey (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 %). Dried whey additions linearly increased ADG and ADFI at both 2 and 5 weeks (P<. 05), whereas F/G at 2 and 5 weeks was optimized at the 5 % dried whey level. Copper sulfate supplementation improved ADG and F/G at 5 weeks (P<. 05). These results suggest that CuS 04 additions are beneficial for <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance, and the 5 % dried whey addition gave <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance equal to that with 20 % dried whey addition, when CuSO 4 was present in both diets...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the effect of supplementation of either L-methionine (L-Met) or DL-methionine (DL-Met) to diets of <b>starter</b> <b>pigs</b> on nitrogen (N) balance, metabolism, and serum amino acid profile. Eighteen crossbred (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire) barrows weighing 15. 45 ± 0. 88 kg were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets with 6 pigs per treatment. The diets included a basal diet (Met-deficient diet) containing 0. 24 % standardized ileal digestibility Met with all other essential nutrients meeting the pig’s requirements. The other two diets were produced by supplementing the basal diet with 0. 12 % DL-Met or L-Met. The experiment lasted for 18 days, consisting of a 13 -day adaptation period to the diets followed by a 5 -day experimental period. Pigs were fed ad libitum and free access to water throughout the experiment. Results showed that the supplementation of either L-Met or DL-Met improved N retention, and serum methionine concentration, and decreased N excretion compared with basal diet (p 0. 05). In conclusion, on equimolar basis DL-Met and L-Met are equally bioavailable as Met sources for <b>starter</b> <b>pigs...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 384 <b>starter</b> <b>pigs</b> {{were used to}} examine the {{application}} of exogenous phytase in high-moisture corn (HMC) -based liquid diets. Pigs were randomly assigned to 24 pens in six blocks. Pens were randomly assigned one of four HMC-based diets formulated to vary in total phosphorus (P) content (Low, Medium and High), with phytase added to only the Low P diet (Phy). Body weight gain and feed intake were monitored until body weight exceeded 20 kg. Apparent total tract digestibility of crude protein and P were measured on day 21 (Phase II) and day 42 (Phase III). At the end of the trial, two pigs from each pen were sacrificed for analysis of carcass composition and evaluation of metacarpals. Pigs fed the Phy treatment had increased digestibility of crude protein (P 0. 05). In conclusion, performance of <b>starter</b> <b>pigs</b> fed liquid HMC-based diets was maintained at dietary P levels below established requirements, but addition of phytase improved bone strength and mineralization. This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of phytase, and that P requirement for maximum rate of weight gain in pigs is not sufficient for maximum skeletal development...|$|R

40|$|Two 5 -wk trials {{utilizing}} {{a total of}} 324 weanling pigs (21 ± 3 d) were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of different fat sources and combinations on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. Treatments consisted of a control (CONT) with no added fat and fat additions of either soybean oil (SOY), coconut oil (COCO), choice white grease (CWG), 1 / 2 SOY: 1 / 2 COCO (SOCO), or 1 / 2 CWG: 1 / 2 COCO (CWCO). Diets were supplemented with 10 % fat for the first two wk of the study, and 5 % fat for the next three wk. Daily feed intake (ADFI) was decreased for the first 2 wk when fat was added, but gains (ADG) and feed efficiency (F/G) were unaffected by dietary treatment. During the last 3 wk of the study, fat additions improved ADG and F/G. Also, pigs utilized CWCO diets more efficiently than CWG diets. For the overall 5 wk study, ADG and F/G were improved by fat additions. Within fat treatments, pigs gained faster on SOCO diets than on COCO diets and consumed more of the SOCO diets than either of the COCO or CWCO diets.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate Fish Protein Hydrolysate (FPH) as a protein source in <b>starter</b> diets for <b>pigs.</b> A total of 552 weaned pigs were used in three growth trials and one digestion study. All three growth trials were designed {{to determine the effect}} of FPH with and without dried whey on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. The digestion study was designed to determine the effect of FPH with and without dried whey on nutrient digestibility. Adding 3 % FPH to <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets resulted in an improvement (8 - 17 %) in average daily gain (ADG) over a corn-soybean meal basal diet. Feed efficiency and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were not affected by the addition of FPH. Dried whey additions with or without FPH resulted in no improvement over performance observed with the 3 % FPH diet in either Trial 1 or Trial 3. In Trial 4, 20 % dried whey added to a corn-soybean meal diet improved performance for all criteria measured to a level equal to that with 3 % FPH alone. Growth responses to the addition of dried whey were inconsistent from trial to trial, possibly because whey utilization may have been impaired by heat damage to the dried whey. Therefore, conclusions regarding dried whey additions with or without FPH may be confounded with dried whey quality...|$|R
40|$|Two trials {{involving}} 420 weanling pigs (21 + 3 d) {{were conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of additions of soybean oil (SO) on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. Soybean oil additions of either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 % were made to the 1. 25 % lysine corn-soybean meal-dried whey basaI diet. In each trial, there were 7 pigs/pen and 5 replications. Data from the two trials were pooled except for feed efficiency (F/G) at 2 -weeks, where a trial x treatment interaction existed. Average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were not affected by SO additions at 2 weeks but gains were numerically higher when 3 % SO was added to starter diets. Feed efficiency in Trial 1 improved linearly (P<. 001), whereas a cubic response (P<. 05) in F/G with added levels of SO was observed in Trial 2. At 35 days, SO additions caused a linear improvement in ADG (P<. 01), ADFI (P<. 05) and F/G (P<. 0001), with the highest numerical response in gain and feed intake at the 3 % SO level. Metabolizable energy (ME) intake was not affected by dietary treatment, but was optimized at the 3 % SO inclusion level. Based on these data, it appears that 21 -d old pigs can utilize fat, and soy oil additions of between 3 and 5 % are beneficial to <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance...|$|R

Pigs were blockedby weight and allotted to one of four dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. Three spray-dried plasma sources were tested: bovine, porcine, and plasma collected from only sows. Plasma sources and lactose replaced skim milk in the control diet to form the experimental diets. Experimental diets were fed during Phase I (d 0 to 14 postweaning), and all pigs were fed a common Phase II (d 14 to 28 postweaning) diet. Phase I diets were formulated to 1. 5 % lysine and. 42 % methionine. Phase II diets were formulated to 1. 25 % lysine and. 36 % methionine. Phase I diets were fed in a pellet form and Phase II in a meal form, and all diets were formulated to. 9 % Ca and. 8 % P. During Phase I, pigs fed diets containing porcine and sow plasma grew faster than the pigs fed the control and bovine plasma diets. Pigs fed either swine plasma source were more efficient than pigs fed the control diet. During Phase II, when pigs were fed a common diet, pigs that were fed diets containing sow and bovine plasma diets in Phase I had higher feed intakes than pigs that were fed the control diet. Overall (d 0 to 28), pigs fed the porcine plasma diet grew faster and pigs fed the sow plasma diet grew more efficiently than pigs fed the control diet.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of supplementing <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets with zinc oxide and (or) copper sulfate on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. In experiment 1, two hundred forty pigs were used in a 28 -day growth assay. Four dietary treatments were used: 1) control (165 ppm zinc and 16. 5 ppm copper), 2) 3, 000 ppm zinc, 3) 250 ppm copper, and 4) 3, 000 ppm zinc + 250 ppm copper. The pigs were blocked by weight and allotted to each of the four dietary treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design with 9, 10, or 11 pigs per pen and 6 replicate pens per treatment. Diets were formulated in two phases: Phase I (d 0 to 14 postweaning) and Phase II (d 14 to 28 postweaning) with 1. 6 and 1. 25 % lysine, respectively. Pigs were fed the same experimental mineral level during the entire 28 -d growth assay. During Phase I, feeding 3, 000 ppm zinc from zinc oxide, with or without 250 ppm copper, improved average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (F/G) compared with pigs fed the control or added-copper diets. Surprisingly, no improvement occurred in ADG or F/G for pigs fed the diet with 250 ppm copper from copper sulfate as compared with pigs fed the control diet. In Phase II, a zinc x copper interaction occurred. Pigs fed the diet with only added zinc grew faster, ate more, and were more efficient than pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed diets with added copper had intermediate ADG and average daily feed intake (ADFI). Pigs fed diets with added zinc and (or) copper had similar F/G. For the entire 28 -day trial, pigs fed the diets with added zinc had improved ADG, ADFI, and F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. In the second experiment, pigs were fed a common Phase I diet supplemented with zinc oxide (3000 ppm zinc). On d 14, pigs were switched to the diets containing experimental mineral levels. Phase II experimental diets were identical to those of the first experiment. Similar to Phase II in Exp. 1, a zinc x copper interaction occurred for ADG. Zinc oxide improved ADG when added to the control diet, but not when added to the copper diet. Feeding high levels of zinc oxide in the Phase I diets may have had a carryover effect in Phase II, because we found no improvement in pig performance when high levels of copper were added to the Phase II diet. The results from these experiments indicate that feeding 3, 000 ppm of zinc from zinc oxide is a viable means of increasing <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance, but optimum response occurs when the diet does not contain supplemental copper from copper sulfate...|$|R

Addition of fat to a corn-soybean meal diet improved (P<. 05) feed efficiency but addition of lecithin did not affect performance. When lecithin and fat were added in combination, average daily gain was less (P<. 05) than for diets without added fat. This may be due to a high level of undigestible fat having a limiting effect on intake and consequently decreasing gains. A low level of lecithin (1. 5 %) in diets without whey gave approximately the same response as a 4 % fat diet without thus making lecithin a possible fat substitute should, it be economically feasible...|$|R

The diets were formulated to contain 1. 4 % lysine and 24. 4 % lactose. Soybean meal (with or without extrusion processing) replaced milk protein on an equal lysine basis. Experimental diets were fed for the entire 28 d experiment. On d 14, fecal samples were collected to determine apparent DM and N digestibilities by feeding chromic oxide as an undigestible marker. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency (FIG) were improved (P<. 05) in pigs fed the predominately milk diet from d 0 to 14 postweaning compared to pigs fed soybean meal with or without extrusion processing. For the entire trial (d 0 to 28), ADG was increased in pigs fed the milk based diet compared to pigs fed a soybean meal-based diet. Pigs fed moist extruded soybean meal had a similar ADG to pigs fed the milk diet and had an increased ADG compared to pigs fed dry extruded soybean meal. Average daily feed intake (d 0 to 28) was increased in pigs fed soybean meal (with or without moist extrusion) compared to pigs fed the milk based diet. Pigs fed the milk based diet had improved feed efficiency compared to pigs fed soybean meal with or without extrusion processing. Dry matter and N digestibilities were similar between dietary treatments. These data suggest that extrusion processing can be used to improve soybean meal quality for use in <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets. Moist extrusion produces a superior product compared to dry extrusion for <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets as indicated by increased ADG and improved feed efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A 25 d growth trial {{utilizing}} 198 pigs {{was conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} fumaric acid and calcium formate on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. At weaning (19 d of age and 11. 9 lb), pigs were blocked by weight and allotted to one of three dietary treatments: a control diet without acid addition or diets containing 1. 5 % fumaric acid or 1. 5 % calcium formate. Adding calcium formate to the diet had no influence on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), or feed efficiency (F/G). Pigs fed the diet containing fumaric acid had improved feed efficiency during the first 2 weeks postweaning compared to pigs fed the other two diets. These results do not support the addition of calcium formate to the starter diet. However, results warrant additional research to determine the efficacy of fumaric acid in high nutrient density starter diets...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 144 {{weanling}} pigs (initially 14. 1 lb and 24 d of age) {{was used to}} compare three different blood meal sources in starter diets. The three sources included spray-dried porcine, spray-dried bovine, and flash-dried bovine blood meal. Each diet contained 10 % dried whey and 2. 5 % of one of the three blood meal sources. Diets were formulated to contain 1. 25 %lysine and. 31 % methionine. Pigs receiving diets containing either source of spray-dried blood meal had improved average daily gain and feed efficiency during the first 2 weeks of the experiment and the overall trial compared to pigs receiving diets containing the flash-dried source. No differences occurred in pig performance between the two spray-dried sources. Therefore, no apparent effects were due to species differences, but the blood meal must be spray-dried in order to optimize <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 318 pigs {{was used in}} a 25 -d growth trial to {{determine}} the influence of high levels of B-vitamins on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. At weaning (l 6 -d of age), pigs were blocked by weight to one of six dietary treatments based on B-vitamin level. The negative control diet contained the standard KSU B-vitamin additions. The next four diets contained vitamin B 12, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, or niacin at lOx the level recommended by NRC (1988). The positive control diet contained all four vitamins at 10 x the levels suggested by NRC (1988). B-vitamin inclusion rate did not influence average daily gain or feed intake. High levels of riboflavin resulted in a slight improvement in feed efficiency compared to pigs fed the control diets. These results do not support including B-vitamins in the starter diet at levels higher than currently recommended by KSU...|$|R
40|$|A growth {{study and}} a {{preference}} study {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effect of a}} commercially available flavoring agent on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. A total of 192, 3 -wk old, weaned pigs were utilized. A 2 -phase starter program was used in the growth study. Half the pigs received creep feed with added flavor and half without, beginning at 10 days of age. Pigs receiving flavored feed at 10 days of age had significantly better gains and feed intake the first 2 wk postweaning than pigs on nonflavored feed. The pigs in the preference study demonstrated a clear preference for flavored vs nonflavored feed. These results indicate addition of flavor to a creep diet beginning at 10 days of age will increase feed intake and gains in the nursery. However, when a creep feed is fed, addition of flavor to a nursery diet did not result in improved performance...|$|R
40|$|Two growth {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to compare Norse LT- 94 to other protein sources in <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets. In trial 1, 270 weanling pigs (initially 13. 7 lb and 20 d of age) were used to compare Norse LT- 94 (herring meal), select menhaden fish meal, and spraydried blood meal as protein sources in the Phase II diet. Pigs were blocked by weight with six replications of three treatments and 15 pigs per pen. During Phase I (d 0 to 7 postweaning), all pigs were fed the same high nutrient density diet. During Phase II (7 to 28 d postweaning), pigs were fed one of three experimental diets. All Phase II diets contained 10 % dried whey and were formulated to 1. 25 % lysine and. 34 % methionine. The positive control diet contained 2. 5 % spray-dried blood meal. Norse LT- 94 (herring meal, 4. 06 %) and select menhaden fish meal (4. 87 %) replaced blood meal on an equal lysine basis to form the other experimental diets. No differences occurred in pig performance during Phase II, indicating that Norse LT- 94, spray-dried blood meal, and select menhaden fish meal are interchangeable as protein sources when substituted on an equal lysine basis. In trial 2, 230 pigs (initially 18 d of age and 11. 0 lb) were {{used to examine the}} influence of various combinations of spray-dried porcine plasma and Norse LT- 94 on <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance. Pigs were allotted by weight to six replicates of five treatments with six to 10 pigs per pen. Pigs were assigned to one of five dietary treatments with no replacement or 25, 50, 75, or 100 % of the spray-dried porcine plasma replaced with Norse LT- 94 (herring meal) on an equal lysine basis. Therefore, diets contained 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 % spray-dried porcine plasma and 0, 2. 14, 4. 29, 6. 43, or 8. 58 % Norse LT- 94, respectively. All Phase 1 diets were formulated to contain 20 % dried whey, 1. 5 % lysine, and. 44 % methionine. These diets were fed from d 0 to 14 postweaning. From d 14 to 28 (Phase II), all pigs were fed a common diet. Replacing spray-dried porcine plasma with Norse LT- 94 resulted in a linear decrease in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) during Phase I and for the overall trial. This response became magnified when greater than 25 % of the plasma was replaced with Norse LT- 94. Feed efficiency responded in a quadratic manner for the first week of Phase I and for the overall trial, with pigs fed the diet containing 6 % spray-dried porcine plasma and 2. 14 % Norse LT 94 having the best feed efficiency. These trials indicate that Norse LT- 94 (herring meal) can replace spray-dried blood meal and select menhaden fish meal in Phase II <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets. However, Norse LT- 94 (herring meal) cannot be used as a replacement for spray-dried plasma protein in the Phase I diet...|$|R
40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the influence of diet composition and type of medication on pigs weaned at approximately 5 weeks of age (average initial weight of 15 pounds). A commercial feeding program containing extruded full fat soybeans was compared with a milo-soybean meal diet (19. 2 % protein and 1. 25 % lysine) containing neomycin (150 grams per ton) or neoterramycin (150 grams of neomycin and terramycin each per ton). Pigs were fed the treatments for 6 weeks while in the nursery. Performance was monitored continuously to market weight to evaluate {{the influence of the}} nursery treatments on the overall growth and carcass yield. The {{results of this study suggest}} that neoterramycin is superior (P<. 05) to neomycin in <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> diets. Pigs consuming the commercial feed had improved (P<. 05) gain, feed efficiency, and number of days to market. But in this herd, the commercial feed increased mortality rate due to gut edema and increased feed cost per pound of gain (P<. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 350 pigs {{was used in}} three growth trials to {{determine}} the influence of weaning weight and average daily gain during the first week postweaning on subsequent growth performance. Average initial weight and age were 13. 7 lb and 21 d, respectively. Pigs were weighed on d 0, 7, 28, and 56 postweaning in all three trials. Pigs were also weighed at market in trial 1. Weaning weight influenced postweaning growth performance such that each additional pound at weaning translated into approximately 2 lb by d 56 postweaning and 4 lb at market. These results indicate the importance of maximizing milk production during lactation to increase litter weaning weights. Average daily gain during the first week postweaning also had a major impact on subsequent growth performance. Pigs that gained greater than. 5 Ibid during the first week postweaning were 17 Ib heavier at market than pigs that lost weight during the first week postweaning. These results provide further evidence that nutritional programs designed to increase <b>starter</b> <b>pig</b> performance also influence performance during the subsequent grower and finisher phases...|$|R
