40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} systemic <b>pathologies</b> in patients aged 65 years or more, who require oral care and possibly oral surgery. Study Design: We carried out a cross-sectional descriptive study reviewing 3, 388 medical histories for patients from the Department of Medicine and Oral Surgery of the School of Dentistry at the Complutense University of Madrid, who had requested surgical treatment. Those selected were at least 65 {{years of age or}} more, and were grouped according to their medical histories into categories of <b>pathologies,</b> which include: systemic, cardiovascular, digestive, respiratory, endocrine-metabolic, genitourinary, osteoarticular, nervous system and the sensory organs. Results: Patients over the age of 65 most commonly present cardiovascular and digestive <b>pathologies,</b> which represent values of 30. 8 % and 13. 75 %, respectively. The rest of the systemic <b>pathologies</b> analyzed were categorized according to frequency, as follows: endocrino-metabolic <b>pathologies</b> 6. 66 %, respiratory <b>pathologies</b> 6. 25 %, genitourinary <b>pathologies</b> 3. 75 %, osteoarticular <b>pathologies</b> 2. 91 %, and <b>pathologies</b> of the nervous system and sensory organs 2. 08 %. Conclusions: The demand for surgical treatments by third age patients was relatively low, representing 2. 18 %. However, the presence of systemic <b>pathologies</b> was constant, and therefore, the anamnesis and patient medical history are fundamental for any surgical treatment...|$|R

5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a <b>pathology.</b> The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible <b>pathology.</b> The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a <b>pathology,</b> even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{phenomenon}} of inter-organizational cooperation in networks {{is becoming increasingly}} important, and as such there are numerous companies which participate in various networks. This {{is due to the}} advantages offered by participation in such networks, e. g. access to the resources of partners, the opportunity to learn from partners, reduction of risk, etc. Even the negative aspects of functioning within the network do nothing to reduce the attractiveness of this concept. It should be noted, however, that any inter-organizational cooperation is combined with the likelihood that certain negative phenomena may arise, i. e. <b>pathologies</b> which reduce the attractiveness of this type of activity. Some of these <b>pathologies</b> are similar to those occurring in any organization, while the others are a specific feature of network organizations. The aim of the paper is to analyse the <b>pathologies</b> most frequently observed in inter-organizational networks. In contrast to <b>pathologies</b> resulting from a specific network structure (hereinafter referred to as structural <b>pathologies)</b> we have labelled such phenomena simple <b>pathologies.</b> Our analysis begins with a presentation of the importance of network organizations in contemporary business. We then present the major <b>pathologies</b> in networks and the varieties thereof. Subsequently, a comparison is made between <b>pathologies</b> in the organization vs. the <b>pathologies</b> in the networks. Finally, we have described the ways to avoid <b>pathologies</b> in networks, as well as summarised the potential solutions. The paper utilises the publications available in the literature, as well as the authors’ experience in creating network organizations. Although it is impossible to identify a universal solution to the issue of <b>pathologies</b> in the networks (because their sources are complex and systemic in nature), knowledge of such phenomena can reduce the risk of their re-occurrence...|$|R

5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the <b>pathology</b> of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the <b>pathology</b> could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E

Objectives: 1. To determine the diagnostic yield of rigid sigmoidoscopy as an investigative tool with special emphasis on neoplastic lesions, and 2. To deter-mine yearly trends in various <b>pathologies.</b> Design: Retrospective study of data from the records of a sigmoidoscopy center at SMHS Hospital, Kashmir, India, from April 2002 to April 2006. Main outcome measures: Number of sigmoidoscopy procedures performed, various <b>pathologies</b> picked up, sex distribution of <b>pathologies,</b> emphasis on rectosigmoid carcinoma cases and hemorrhoids. Results: During the study period, 6125 examinations were done on 5244 patients. A total of 3522 abnormalities were picked up, giving a diagnostic yield of 67. 2 %. The most common lesion found was hemorrhoids (2418 cases, 46. 1 %). Other <b>pathologies</b> included neoplasms (660 cases, 12. 6 %), anal fissures (227 cases, 4. 3 %), fistula in ano (91 cases, 1. 7 %), and others (126 cases, 2. 4 %).
