For example, first there is a tiny minority of judges with ’lifelong’ appointments (ie, {{to the age of}} 70 or 72 years); who are appointed by the government in power; who work in offices which look like traditional ’courtrooms’; and whose decision-making processes are usually publicised by observers and the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> and reasoning; and who, importantly, are constitutionally protected from political interference...|$|E

Podrobnije se obrađuje financiranje (proračun) ustavnih sudova, plaćanje pristojbi u ustavnosudskim postupcima, ovlasti ustavnih sudova s aspekta utvrđivanja njihove neovisnosti, imunitet, inkompatibilitet, razrješenje, materijalna neovisnost i protokolarni položaj ustavnih sudaca, sastav ustavnih sudova i način izbora sudaca i predsjednika ustavnih sudova, javna narav i javna kontrola djelovanja ustavnih sudova te neovisnost i autonomija njihova unutarnjeg ustrojstva. Along with legislative, {{executive}} and judicial government, the Constitution had established the Constitutional {{court of the}} Republic of Croatia (hereinafter: Constitutional court) as kind of ‘fourth state government’ or ‘inter-government’. The real position of the Constitutional court {{is seen in the}} authorities given to it by the Constitution, i. e. in legal impacts of constitutional-judicial decisions that directly act in areas of legislative, executive, and judicial government. Constitutional autonomy of the Constitutional court is shown through the so called constitutional guarantees of the independence of the Constitutional court, that are expression and consequence of its position as the ‘fourth state government’ or ‘inter-government’ in the Republic of Croatia. Harutyunyan and Mavčič state the following guarantees of the independence of the constitutional court: 1. financing (budget) of constitutional courts as basis of their independence, 2. payment of fees in constitutional-judicial proceedings as source of financing of the constitutional court, 3. authorities of the constitutional courts as proof of their independence, 4. immunity, incompatibility, material independence and protocol position of constitutional judges, 5. appointment / choosing of constitutional judges, 6. public control / public form of actions of constitutional courts, especially: a) public discussions, b) <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> of the constitutional courts in official gazettes and legal magazines, c) flow of information about constitutional-judicial decisions through individual computer information systems, and 7. constitutional autonomy of the internal organisation of the constitutional courts. By comparing the general guarantees that are valid in most European countries with those valid in Croatian legal system we {{come to the conclusion that}} there still exist problems in that area that demand better or more advanced solution. It seems that three problems demand immediate solution. In the area of financing of the Constitutional court, as basis of its independence, changes are necessary in two directions: first, the Constitutional court should get the authority to propose its own annual budget to the Croatian Parliament without the mediation of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (which does not necessarily mean its separation from the total state budget), and, secondly, despite the proclaimed independence in allocating its own means from the budget, as guaranteed by article 2, paragraph 2 of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional court of the Republic of Croatia, it is necessary to change the administrative practice in that area, since that constitutional guarantee is not implemented in practice, or is not implemented in full measure. Furthermore, it seems that the guarantees of independence of the constitutional court connected with the material independence of the constitutional judges are regulated the least in the legal system of the Republic of Croatia. They are not the subject of regulations neither of the Constitution nor the Constitutional Act. There is therefore the need for a separate regulation of the material position of constitutional judges in the Constitutional Act, separated from those of state officials in legislative, {{executive and}} judicial government. Finally, in difference to the structure of the Croatian Constitutional court that satisfies the European standards, the current model of choosing the judges for the Constitutional court is being criticised in the part that relates to the process of proposing the candidates for the duty. Neben der gesetzgebenden, vollziehenden und rechtsprechenden Gewalt hat die Verfassung auch das Verfassungsgericht der Republik Kroatien (in der Folge: das Verfassungsgericht) als eine Art „vierte Staatsgewalt“ oder „Zwischengewalt“ eingerichtet. Die reale Position des Verfassungsgerichtes spiegelt sich in den Zuständigkeiten wieder, die ihm kraft Verfassung gegeben sind, beziehungsweise in den unmittelbaren Rechtswirkungen der verfassungsgerichtlichen Entscheidungen auf dem Gebiet der Legislative, Exekutive und Judikative. Die Verfassungsautonomie des Verfassungsgerichtes schlägt sich auch in den sogenannten Verfassungsgarantien der Unabhängigkeit des Verfassungsgerichtes nieder, die Ausdruck und Folge seiner Position als „vierte Staatsgewalt“ oder „Zwischengewalt“ in der Republik Kroatien sind. Harutyunyan und Mavčič nennen folgende Garantien der Unabhängigkeit der Verfassungsgerichtsbarkeit: 1. die Finanzierung (Haushalt) der Verfassungsgerichte als Grundlage ihrer Unabhängigkeit, 2. die Entrichtung von Gebühren in verfassungsgerichtlichen Verfahren als Finanzquelle der Verfassungsgerichtsbarkeit, 3. die Befugnisse der Verfassungsgerichte als Nachweis ihrer Unabhängigkeit, 4. Immunität, Inkompatibilität, materielle Unabhängigkeit und protokollarische Position der Verfassungsrichter, 5. Ernennung/Wahl der Verfassungsrichter, 6. öffentliche Kontrolle/Öffentlichkeit der Tätigkeit der Verfassungsgerichte, insbesondere a) öffentliche Verhandlung, b) Verkündung der Entscheidungen der Verfassungsgerichte in Amtsblättern und juristischen Zeitschriften, c) Verbreitung von Informationen über verfassungsgerichtliche Entscheidungen durch bestimmte elektronische Informationssysteme sowie 7. Verfassungsautonomie des internen Aufbaus der Verfassungsgerichte. Anhand des Vergleichs der allgemeinen Garantien, die in der kroatischen Rechtsordnung gelten, mit jenen in den meisten europäischen Staaten wird der Schluss gezogen, dass es auf diesem Gebiet immer noch Probleme gibt, die bessere oder fortschrittlichere Regelungen erfordern. Drei Probleme verlangen unverzügliche Abhilfe. Im Bereich der Finanzierung des Verfassungsgerichts als Grundlage seiner Unabhängigkeit sind Veränderungen in zweierlei Richtung erforderlich: Als Erstes muss dem Verfassungsgericht die Befugnis eingeräumt werden, seinen Jahreshaushalt eigenständig ohne Vermittlung der Regierung der Republik Kroatien dem Kroatischen Parlament zur Bewilligung zu unterbreiten (was nicht zwangsläufig seinen Ausschluss aus dem Gesamtstaatshaushalt bedeutet), und zweitens muss die administrative Praxis, in der die Verfassungsgarantie der proklamierten Selbstständigkeit bei der Verwendung der eigenen Haushaltsmittel nach Art. 2. Abs. 2 des Verfassungsgesetzes über das Verfassungsgericht der Republik Kroatien nicht oder nicht in vollem Umfang umgesetzt wird, geändert werden. Außerdem scheint die Gewährleistung der Unabhängigkeit der Verfassungsgerichtsbarkeit im Zusammenhang mit der materiellen Unabhängigkeit der Verfassungsrichter in der kroatischen Rechtsordnung die ungeeignetste Regelung zu haben. Weder die Verfassung noch das Verfassungsgesetz befassen sich damit. Demnach ist es erforderlich, die materielle Lage der Verfassungsrichter im Verfassungsgesetz zu regeln, also getrennt von der der staatlichen Amtsträger in der Legislative, Exekutive und Administration. Abschließend ist zu sagen, dass die Besetzung des kroatischen Verfassungsgerichts den europäischen Standards entspricht, während das derzeitige Auswahlverfahren für Verfassungsrichter im Bereich des Kandidierungsverfahrens kritisiert wird...|$|E
