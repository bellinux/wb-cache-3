They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the pijpzak (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in The <b>Peasant</b> Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.|$|E

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of fugitive <b>peasants</b> (also runaway <b>peasants,</b> or flight of <b>peasants)</b> refers to <b>peasants</b> who left their land without permission, violating serfdom laws.

30|$|In {{the course}} of {{establishing}} advanced agricultural cooperatives, withdrawing from communes became a nationwide phenomenon (Du 2005, 84). Many counties in Zhejiang forced <b>peasants</b> to join communes and implemented the policy of “grasping two sides and mobilizing the middle” (抓两头,带中间) relying on poor <b>peasants,</b> fighting against rich <b>peasants,</b> and mobilizing middle <b>peasants,</b> and many <b>peasants</b> joined communes in an uneasy frame of mind (Bo 1991, 331). Meanwhile, a series of production and distribution problems brought by advanced communes jeopardized the interests of <b>peasants.</b> In many areas, <b>peasants</b> protested and called for leaving their communes (闹退社). In 1957, as many as 200, 000 households withdrew from communes in Zhejiang province, accounting for 4.3  % of <b>peasants</b> in communes; 1400 cooperative communes subsequently collapsed. The rate of quitting communes was relatively high in Ningbo (11.81  %), Wenzhou (5.52  %), and Jinhua (1.85  %) (Ye 2003).|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} view remained ambivalent at best, though. A scene {{devoted to}} the <b>peasant</b> war of 1653 in a theatre production for the Swiss sexacentennial celebrations in 1891, for instance, was cut on {{the demands of the}} organizers. The first statues to honor the peasants of 1653 and their leaders were erected in 1903 {{on the occasion of the}} 250th anniversary of the <b>peasant</b> war. A monument honoring Schybi and Emmenegger was unveiled at Escholzmatt on July 26, 1903, at Rüderswil, a statue in honor of Leuenberger was erected the same year, and at Liestal an obelisk honoring the <b>peasant</b> victims of the war was inaugurated on September 25, 1904. More statues and plaques were installed in various other places at the tricentennial of the war in 1953, for instance a relief showing Schybi in a chapel at Sursee, where the <b>peasant</b> leader had been incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that the <b>peasant</b> families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average <b>peasant</b> lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the <b>peasant,</b> who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the <b>peasant</b> class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5000|$|In 1750, Maria Theresa {{commanded}} a royal commission {{to study the}} decline in tax receipts from Bohemia. They found out that landlords had seized lands from <b>peasants.</b> Since only the <b>peasants</b> paid taxes, the royal revenues decreased. As a response, she issued a series of ordinances to protect the <b>peasants</b> from oppressiv obligations to the landlords. Fees paid by <b>peasants</b> to landlords were regulated from Vienna; rules preventing <b>peasants</b> from selling in the free market were repealed; the lord's authority over justice were diminished, and <b>peasants</b> were allowed to complain against the lords before imperial officers.|$|R

5|$|During the 15th {{century in}} Japan, <b>peasant</b> revolts, known as ikki, {{became much more}} commonplace. During the turmoil of the Ōnin War (1467–1477) and {{subsequent}} years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as Ikkō-ikki, a collection of <b>peasant</b> farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. Rennyo, the Hongan-ji abbot who led the Jōdo Shinshū movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province, but distanced himself from the political goals of the ikki, advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of the <b>peasant</b> war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the <b>peasant</b> war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the <b>peasant</b> war in such allegoric ways.|$|E

Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan.

Under the Agrarian Reform Law, which redistributed {{about half of}} Albania's arable land, the government confiscated property belonging to absentee landlords and people not dependent on agriculture for a living. The few <b>peasants</b> with agricultural machinery were permitted to keep up to forty hectares of land; the landholdings of religious institutions and <b>peasants</b> without agricultural machinery were limited to twenty hectares; and landless <b>peasants</b> and <b>peasants</b> with tiny landholdings were given up to five hectares, although they had to pay nominal compensation.|$|R

5|$|<b>Peasant</b> {{society is}} much less {{documented}} than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting <b>peasant</b> life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed {{for a wide variety}} of <b>peasant</b> societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free <b>peasant</b> and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.|$|E

5|$|The combat that <b>peasant</b> men {{had engaged}} in prior to the revolt was {{restricted}} to the vicinity in which they lived. During armed conflicts, they would often fight for {{a short amount of}} days before returning to cultivate their lands, which remained their main preoccupation. When their service was needed, they were commanded by a local chief who in turn was subordinate to a regional leader. Most armed conflict revolved around the chiefs' bids for local influence and control or protection of villages from Bedouin plundering. There were also instances where <b>peasant</b> fighters would be assembled to back Ottoman authority in the face of local or external challengers, such as during the 1799 Napoleonic invasion, or against Ottoman authority when it interfered in the unofficial local autonomy that was enjoyed in the mountain regions. In most of the conflicts in which the <b>peasant</b> fighters participated, they fought alongside their kinsmen or neighbors.|$|E
