5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles <b>provided</b> <b>on</b> its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been <b>provided</b> <b>on</b> gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was <b>provided</b> <b>on</b> both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was <b>provided</b> <b>on</b> its north side.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was <b>provided</b> <b>on</b> the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E
5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are <b>provided</b> <b>on</b> all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E
