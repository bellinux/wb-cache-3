5|$|After the {{suggestion}} {{by the head}} of the Ministry of War Transport Cyril Hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by an outsider was turned down by the Government due to much greater means being needed, the Government agreed that a <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> should be opened. A <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> into the plans was opened in December 1944, with the hearing lasting for three days. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning appointed Hurcomb as the chairman of the inquiry. The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New. The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society, chaired by Cyril Alington.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The threat to {{the site was}} one of the first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a <b>Public</b> <b>Inquiry</b> in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a <b>Public</b> <b>Inquiry</b> had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E

5|$|Within {{days of the}} crash, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as {{the provincial}} police for British Columbia, began an investigation. The site of the crash was under the {{jurisdiction}} of the RCMP detachment in Prince George, British Columbia, and any charges would be laid there. The CNR suspended all trainmen involved in passing the order to the troop train and held an internal inquiry at Kamloops.

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E

5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full <b>public</b> <b>inquiry.</b> The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings of the report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E
5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a <b>public</b> <b>inquiry.</b> She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E

At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E

5|$|Reports as to {{the size}} of the mosque have varied considerably. Ali Mangera of Mangera Yvars Architects, {{submitted}} a proposal for the design competition, stated that his design would accommodate up to 40,000visitors simultaneously, with the potential for expanding to contain 70,000people. These figures led to much consternation. London Borough of Newham Councillor Alan Craig, of the Christian Peoples Alliance, criticised the development plans on the grounds that they would change the character of the local area, making it predominantly Muslim, and has called for a <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> into the mosque's development. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Newham planning department would refuse the mosque's application, as a project of that size had the potential to cause damage to community relations in the area.|$|E
5|$|The castle is classed as a Grade I listed {{building}} and a Scheduled monument. The site, managed by English Heritage, {{is open to}} the public. Until the 1970s, the pogrom of 1190 was often underplayed by official histories of the castle; early official guides to the castle made no reference to it. In 1978, however, the first memorial tablet to the victims was laid at the base of Clifford's Tower, and in 1990 the 800th anniversary of the killings was commemorated at the tower. Recently, commercial interests have sought to introduce retail development to the area surrounding it. Citizens, visitors, academics, environmentalists, local businesspeople and Jewish groups have opposed the development with some success, winning a lengthy and bitter <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> in 2003.|$|E
5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A <b>public</b> <b>inquiry,</b> headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E

5|$|Britannia {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to turn the}} fire station into a 227-bed 4-star hotel in June 2010. The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion. Manchester City Council decided {{to continue with the}} CPO. The city council issued a CPO on 5 August 2010. Despite the plans being approved 16 September 2010, the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011. Britannia's objection to the CPO led to a <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected. Despite Britannia's guarantee at the inquiry to proceed with the development it reconsidered its plans. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable for the foreseeable future. Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan. English Heritage and the city council expressed disappointment. The city council offered to buy the building at market value.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, the Royal Navy {{conducted}} recovery operations. The first {{pieces of}} wreckage were discovered on 12 February 1954 {{and the search}} continued until September 1954, by which time 70 percent by weight of the main structure, 80 percent of the power section, and 50 percent of the aircraft's systems and equipment had been recovered. The forensic reconstruction effort had just begun when the Abell Committee reported its findings. No apparent fault in the aircraft was found, and the British government decided against opening a further <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British aerospace industry, and the financial impact of the aircraft's grounding on BOAC's operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation. Comet flights resumed on 23 March 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the British Railways Board, London Transport Executive, Greater London Council and the Department of the Environment {{produced}} a report examining the modernisation of London transport. It recommended high priority given to reconstructing Liverpool Street and Broad Street stations and recommended financing this through property {{development on the}} site. Liverpool Street {{had a number of}} design and access issues, many of which derived from the 1890 extension which had effectively created two stations on one site, with two concourses linked by walkways, multiple booking halls, and inefficient traffic flows within the station. Additionally the rail infrastructure presented limitations; only seven of the platforms could accommodate 12-carriage trains, and the track exit layout was a bottleneck. In 1975 British Railways announced plans to demolish and redevelop both stations. The proposed demolition met considerable public opposition and prompted a campaign led by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, leading to a <b>public</b> <b>inquiry</b> from November 1976 to February 1977.|$|E

40|$|P ublic {{inquiries}} and {{hearings are}} investigations conducted by govern-mentally mandated bodies to assess important social issues or technologies (Salter & Slaco, 1981). <b>Public</b> hearings and <b>inquiries</b> are {{important aspects of}} the life history of many organizationally based crises, and sensemaking about technological risks and crises is an important feature of inquiry discourse and documents. The purpose of this chapter is to provide insights into the central role that sensemaking plays during <b>public</b> <b>inquiries</b> and hearings into crises. The chapter also discusses the important role that <b>public</b> <b>inquiries</b> play in the crisis-management process. To accomplish these objectives, the chapter reviews key features of <b>public</b> <b>inquiries</b> that have been documented in the scholarly literature. Next, the chapter discusses the different perspectives or approaches that have been used to study crisis sensemaking during <b>public</b> <b>inquiries.</b> The chapter also describes the findings that this research has produced.
