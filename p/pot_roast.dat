500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as <b>pot</b> <b>roast</b> marinade.|$|E

60|$|Katy {{would meet}} {{him at the door}} with a kiss flavored with cold cream and butter-scotch. He would remove his coat, sit upon a macadamized lounge and read, in the evening paper, of Russians and Japs {{slaughtered}} by the deadly linotype. For dinner there would be <b>pot</b> <b>roast,</b> a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather, stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label. After dinner Katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four-in-hand. At half-past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises. Exactly at eight Hickey & Mooney, of the vaudeville team (unbooked) in the flat across the hall, would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that Hammerstein was pursuing them with a five-hundred-dollar-a-week contract. Then the gent at the window across the air-shaft would get out his flute; the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways; the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley; the janitor would drive Mrs. Zanowitski's five children once more across the Yalu, the lady with the champagne shoes and the Skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her Thursday name over her bell and letter-box--and the evening routine of the Frogmore flats would be under way.|$|E

[...] The {{difference between a}} <b>pot</b> <b>roast</b> and a cross-rib <b>pot</b> <b>roast</b> is the vertical line of fat separating {{the two types of}} chuck meat; the cross-rib <b>pot</b> <b>roast</b> contains the line of fat.

5000|$|Cooking at high {{temperatures}} is beneficial if the cut is tender enough—as in filet mignon or strip loin—to be finished cooking before the juices escape. A reason for high temperature roasting is to brown {{the outside of}} the food, similar to browning food in a pan before <b>pot</b> <b>roasting</b> or stewing it. Fast cooking gives more variety of flavor, because the outside is brown while the center is much less done.|$|R

5000|$|Braising (from the French word, [...] "braiser") is a combination-cooking {{method that}} uses both moist and dry heats: typically, {{the food is}} first seared at a high temperature, then {{finished}} in a covered pot at a lower temperature while sitting in some (variable) amount of liquid (which may also add flavor). Braising of meat {{is often referred to}} as <b>pot</b> <b>roasting,</b> though some authors make a distinction between the two methods, based on whether additional liquid is added.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pot</b> <b>roast</b> is a braised beef dish, {{typically}} made by browning a roast-sized {{piece of}} beef {{in order to}} induce a Maillard reaction, then slow-cooking in or over liquid in a covered dish. Tougher cuts such as chuck steak, boneless chuck roast, and 7-bone <b>pot</b> <b>roast</b> are popularly cooked using this technique; while the toughness of their fibers makes them unsuitable for oven roasting, slow cooking tenderizes them, while the liquid exchanges its flavor {{with that of the}} beef. The result is tender, succulent meat and a rich liquid that lends itself to gravy. In North America, where it is also known as [...] "Yankee pot roast", <b>pot</b> <b>roast</b> is often served with vegetables such as carrots, potatoes and sometimes onions simmered in the cooking liquid.|$|E

The techniques of sun curing (drying), smoking and salting were used to preserve various foods for transport, trade or future consumption. Many foods prepared in these ways, such as a smoked dried beef called kitoza (...) and salted dried fish, are still eaten in a similar form in modern-day Madagascar.|$|R

Neither do they realize what happens to a large part of a steer before reaching the locker. Actually a 1000 pound steer will yield approximately 180 pounds of steaks of varied kinds, 180 pounds of <b>roast</b> and <b>pot</b> <b>roasts,</b> and 90 pounds of stew and ground meat making a total of 450 pounds of table meat which is 45 percent of the live weight of the animal.
