One of the main purposes of this technical briefing is to investigate the possible impact of the addition of this information {{in the context of}} the Joint Assessment Framework (JAF) approach, in particular with reference to the benchmark on the employment rate of recent graduates. In this perspective, orientation of study appears to be a natural candidate for inclusion among the additional sub-groups concerning the employment rate of recent graduates within the JAF methodology. The analysis carried out in the briefing shows a labour market advantage, at least in the short run, of young individuals with VET qualifications (compared to their non-VET counterparts), although with important cross-country differences. However, {{in the context of the}} JAF approach, the current data availability would not allow <b>programme</b> <b>orientation</b> to work in the same way as other JAF sub-groups, thus the recommendation is to add the VET/non-VET distinction within one of the sub-groups of the benchmark, i. e. the already existing level of education.

40|$|Let's go outside" {{is where}} I began: I became {{intrigued}} by how often I saw evidence of children's {{enthusiasm for the}} outdoors when I visited centres as a supervisor of early childhood teacher trainees on practicum. Having discovered how little research there was into young children's outdoor play, I wanted to investigate this topic, particularly because I suspected that {{what we do in}} New Zealand {{is very different from the}} outdoor play described in overseas research reports, where the typical scenario is a brief outdoor recess. The belief that outdoor play contributes to young children's development dates back to Rousseau (1712 - 1778) and Froebel (1782 - 1852) and the tradition continued in early kindergartens in the United States (Frost and Wortham, 1988), English nursery schools (Straw, 1990), and also within the New Zealand kindergarten movement (May, 1997). Over time, however, the commitment to outdoor play has been challenged by other pressures - increasing urbanisation with a concomitant reduction in access to the outdoors; increasingly academic <b>programme</b> <b>orientation</b> (Frost, 1992); supervision and safety concerns (Bilton, 1993; Frost and Wortham, 1988); and even staff reluctance (Bilton, 1993; Stine, 1997) ...|$|E

This inquiry examines how selected post-graduate top-level programmes in urban studies are adapting their curricula to promote sustainable urban development. We start by reviewing an extensive literature to identify the principles and practices characterising the UN DESD, and to identify the topics and themes considered essential for teaching aimed at the promotion of sustainable urban development. Based on the extensive literature review we define an analytical framework in five parts, related to various aspects of curricular content and teaching and learning approaches: <b>programme</b> <b>orientation,</b> skills, ethics and critical reasoning, interdisciplinarity and content related to sustainable urban development issues. We then conduct an empirical study of 25 among the best post-graduate level (MA and MSc) programmes in urban studies from Europe, China, the USA and the Global South, {{to see how they}} are adapting their curricula to the requirements of sustainable urban development captured in the analytical framework. While acknowledging the significant context specificities that must be respected, and the multiple challenges that must be reconciled when defining urban studies curricula - we find both strengths and weaknesses in these top programmes, including important differences among the programmes from the four regions. Our data suggests that important steps are being taken towards ‘whole-system’ transformation envisaged by the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, but also that transformative factors depending on cultural and institutional values and practices remain relatively weak...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEdPsych (Educational Psychology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Life {{orientation}} is fundamental in empowering learners to live meaningful lives. Life-skills {{education and training}} forms part of life orientation and helps to address the abovementioned aspect. Life-skills education and training falls under the most recent and powerful approaches in handling psychological problems. It strives to adapt the principles of psychology and social science into teachable skills to ensure intra-personal effectiveness and improve the general quality of peoples' lives. The aim of this pilot study was to alter The Path programme to design and develop an intrapersonal life-skills programme aimed at enhancing the self-concept of youth offenders. The intervention research model of Rothman and Thomas (1994) was employed as foundation for the design and development of The Altered Path programme. The intervention research model was chosen as it aimed at creating a means to address problems experienced by individuals and society. It strives to improve the life, {{health and well-being of}} individuals and society. This purposeful sampling consisted of six Afrikaans-speaking, male youth offenders from the Drakenstein Juvenile Centre. The Altered Path programme was implemented in three stages. The first stage consisted of sessions one to seven. The following topics were covered during this stage: introduction and <b>programme</b> <b>orientation,</b> conceptualisation of mission statements and elements, past personality influences and Cup of Sorrow, the Positive Prophecy and Talent Shield, the mission statement, the vision statement and goal setting. The second stage, which consisted of sessions eight and nine, entailed the training of the participants for service learning. The third stage entailed the implementation of the service learning process. The study found that The Altered Path programme could contribute towards a growth in intra-personal skills with regard to self-awareness, personal goal setting, spirituality, morals and values, self-esteem and self-regulation (both emotional and cognitive). The result of the intra-personal growth was that the interpersonal skills with regard to communication and helping skills of participants improved. In answer to the research question the finding was made that the intra-personal development positively affected the following dimensions of their self-concept: personal, ideal, cognitive, spiritual, social self and psychological self. In the light hereof the statement can be made that The Altered Path programme seems to {{have a positive effect on}} the overall self-concept of the participants. Conscious development of self-knowledge was identified as an element of the programme that could be refined to ensure that all participants develop self-knowledge in the same way during the field study...|$|E

There does seem to be potential for such programmes to assist the integration of students into the institutions and possibly improve retention rates. This study aimed to explore what were the manifest and latent functions of the Ballarat University College <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> in 1993. In the first few weeks of the academic year a number of students were interviewed about the effects of the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> they had participated in. These effects were compared to the aims of the programme as identified by its organisers. Four different functions were identified. These were: the development of pride in being a student; getting to know other students; finding out about the immediately relevant workings of the college; and being influenced by and being able to identify different cultures within the college. The first function was a latent function, not identified by the college or any of the literature on <b>orientation</b> <b>programmes.</b> The second two functions match two of the programmes aims and as such were identified as manifest functions.

They have recently taken a violent dimension, leading damage of property and even loss of life during fires in school. This is an indicator of a relationship gone sour right from orientation, where the learners neither connect nor associate themselves with the school community, facilities and the programmes offered. The researchers used critical analysis research methodology to critically analyse the impact of secondary schools <b>orientation</b> <b>programmes</b> dynamics on the student’s school connectedness in secondary schools in Kenya. Using this method, the researchers assessed the various <b>orientation</b> <b>programmes</b> dynamics and how they impact on the students’ school connectedness {{against the backdrop of the}} induction programmes currently undertaken in secondary schools. The study found out that the <b>orientation</b> <b>programmes</b> offered in secondary schools exclude key stake holders, facilities and educational programmes. They also lack support mechanisms to sustain the momentum of the orientation week. Further, they run in the same way over time and hardly involve any feedback or evaluation processes. The study concluded that secondary schools recognise the importance and carry out a form of orientation for new students. These induction programmes achieve the intended short term goals but lack sustainability. Among the recommendations made is that school administrations should have <b>orientation</b> <b>programmes</b> which include parents and school community, allow feedback and equate the process. The ministry of education should also do budgetary allocations that would cater for <b>orientation</b> <b>programmes</b> and capacity building in schools.

40|$|Background: Postgraduate specialities {{require a}} {{combination}} of knowledge and clinical skills. The internship year is less structured. Clinical and practical skills that are picked up during training are not well regulated and the impact is not assessed. In this study, we assessed knowledge and skills using objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Aim: To evaluate the clinical skills of new first-year surgical residents using <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> and OSCE {{as a tool for}} assessment. Settings and Design: Observational study. Materials and Methods: Twenty new first-year surgical residents (10 each in 2008 and 2009) participated in a detailed structured <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> conducted over a period of 7 days. Clinically important topics and skills expected at this level (e. g., suturing, wound care etc.) were covered. The programme was preceded by an OSCE to test pre-programme knowledge (the "pre-test"). The questions were validated by senior department staff. A post-programme OSCE (the "post-test") helped to evaluate the change in clinical skill level brought about by the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme.</b> Statistical Analysis: Wilcoxson matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Results: Passing performance was achieved by all participants in both pre- and post-tests. Following the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme,</b> significant improvement was seen in tasks testing the psychomotor and cognitive domains. (P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 0401, respectively). Overall reliability of the OSCE was found to be 0. 7026 (Cronbach&#x 2032;s coefficient alpha). Conclusions: This study highlighted the lacunae in current internship training, especially for skill-based tasks. There is a need for universal inclusion of structured <b>orientation</b> <b>programmes</b> in the training of first-year residents.

40|$|M. Cur. The cardiothoracic {{intensive}} care unit is a dynamic environment which is characterised by a high patient turnover, staff shortages, medication, doctor's and nursing protocols and specialised nursing skills are required of the registered nurse. The registered nurse working in this environment is an independent practitioner and is accountable for her acts and omissions. The registered nurse can only accept accountability if she/he has the ability (knowledge, skills and values), the responsibility and authority {{to carry out the}} actions (Bergman, 1982 : 8). The learner enters the cardiothoracic {{intensive care}} unit as part of the clinical teaching she receives at a specific university. Due to staff shortages, the learner is often given the responsibility and authority to carry out actions for which she is accountable, without having the ability (knowledge, skills and values) to act. She may, therefore, not be able to nurse the patient safely and effectively. The unit manager is responsible for creating a learning climate in the unit and utilises an <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> to create this climate. An <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> introduces new staff members to the philosophy, goals and procedures necessary to work in a particular setting (Brookfield, 1986 : 64). The adult learner wants to learn that which is task- and problem-orientated in a selfdirective, independent way ida climate that is conducive to learning.

The study under {{discussion}} followed on {{a request to}} develop a programme which would fill the existing gap between general formative preparatory academic education and general formative preparatory vocational education. The background of the precarious beginnings of education in South Africa was reviewed with specific reference to technical education. A study of the available literature confirmed {{that there is a}} need for more technically trained people, technically trainable people, students who have completed their technical vocational studies, an <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> and lecturers with management skills. The purpose of the study is, therefore, to investigate how lecturers managed the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> at technical colleges. Technical colleges which acted as facilitators of the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme,</b> was introduced. This post-school institution with its general functions of continuing vocational education, must fulfil the needs of the community and the requirements of the industry it wishes to serve. The function and place of technical colleges were discussed as well as the management functions of education institutions, lecturers and students. The development of the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> was also discussed. A suitable programme had to be developed to orientate students at a technical college. After making a few alterations, Jansen's model for curriculum development was used. Curriculum developers firstly, had to determine what the students had already achieved and secondly, what was expected from students at the end of the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme.</b> After this gap between the achieved and the expected had been clearly identified, the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> could be developed. This programme was tested as a pilot programme, declared as general policy; and then implemented at technical colleges and private training institutions on a national level. The successful implementation of such an <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> depends, inter alia, on the classroom management skills of the lecturer. In an attempt to evaluate the success of the lecturers' management skills, a questionnaire was developed as an measuring instrument. The questionnaire was completed by orientation students to determine the management skills of the lecturer. The design of the above questionnaire covered five management aspects, namely, classroom activities, student activities, interpersonal relationships, activities during lesson presentation and administrative duties. Forty four questions were designed and approximately eight questions for each management aspect were included in the questionnaire. An experimental group selected from sixteen technical colleges, was requested to complete the questionnaire voluntarily. These colleges are situated in rural districts, semi-urban and typically urban areas. The students originated from all levels of the community and no preference was given to race, sex, language or background. A total of 177 students participated in this survey. The questionnaire was completed under examination conditions but there was no specific time restriction. All participants were enrolled for all five orientation subjects, namely, engineering technology, engineering drawing, engineering science, industrial communication and mathematics. The performance ability of the students covered the whole spectrum. For admission to the programme, the lowest and highest standard the repondents had obtained, were restricted to Stds 6 to 10 for statistical reasons. To increase the validity and usefulness of the questionnaire, the items in the measuring instrument were checked to ensure that they were based on the managerial competency of the lecturer. The content validity of the measuring instrument was improved in this manner. The Department of Education gave its approval that technical colleges be used for this investigation. On the basis of the empirical investigation, it was discovered that during the first order (PFA) factor analysis, nine factors were identified from the 44 items which appeared in the questionnaire. A second order factor analysis indicated that the 44 items could be reduced to one factor with a reliability coefficient of 0, 948. When only 39 items are considered the reliability increases to 0, 950 and this factor was named "efficient management. " In conclusion, the 39 items can be considered to be one scale and it represents the lecturers' efficient management of the various classroom activities. This factor was also tested by means of multiple statistical techniques in an attempt to find significant differences between the various independent groups. No significant statistical differences were discovered between the scale averages of the various groups. This was an indication that the groups held the same opinion about the management of the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme.</b> With the high average scale marks obtained by the various participating colleges, this investigation proved that lecturers had succeeded to manage the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> successfully. The research results showed that, according to the opinion of the students, no significant statistical differences existed in the lecturers' management of the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> to orientate students towards vocational education. There are however a few deficiencies noticeable in the competency of lecturers in certain management aspects. This research gives an indication of some problems which currently exist with the presentation of the <b>orientation</b> <b>programme.</b> Clear solutions cannot be provided. However the research does indicate that an <b>orientation</b> <b>programme</b> can be successfully presented at technical colleges with the necessary awareness, adaptation, training and positive attitudes as needed by the community, the world of work and the country...|$|R
