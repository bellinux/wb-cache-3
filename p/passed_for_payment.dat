His son William (fl. 1660) says that when James I succeeded to the crown of England, [...] "he sent into France for my father, who was then there, and made him page of the bedchamber and groom of the privy chamber, and keeper of all his majesties' clocks and watches.

Ramesay, Astrologia Restaurata, 1653, Preface to the Reader, p. 28).

40|$|Thesis Abstract The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, which {{was adopted by}} the Regulation No. 1896 / 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (ES) {{creating}} a European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, adopted on 12 December 2006. This thesis describes events preceding the adoption of the Regulation, the procedure of adoption of the Regulation, as well as, development of the content of individual provisions of the Regulation and the content of the actual adopted and binding Regulation. In this thesis, the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure is also compared with nati- onal orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures in the Czech Republic, France and Germany. The selection of these three countries was not unintentional. The Czech Republic was chosen because the thesis was written in the Czech language, in the Czech Republic and shall also be published in the Czech Republic, therefore the author believes the majority of potential readers know the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> better than any other order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure. This aspect was also the main reason why the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> is described {{at the beginning of this}} thesis. The German and French orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures were chosen because the European Commission claims the French " injonction de payer" and the German " [...] ...|$|R
