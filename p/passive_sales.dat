50|$|The {{subjects}} of research conducted by analysts include {{many of the same}} stakeholders that also buy services from analysts. This has caused the integrity of the research to be questioned, which is covered in more detail below. These research subjects include product and service buyers, users, and implementers; the product and service providers themselves, including their key supply chain partners; and sources of investment capital for the vendors, capital for client purchases of vendor products and services, and regulators. Analysts also perform at least <b>passive</b> <b>sales</b> support for their firms, such as contributing to sales meetings, contracts, project profitability, or lead generation programs. This is necessary because the clients are paying for their expertise and must have an opportunity to assess associated capabilities.|$|E

Vice-President Almunia's statement expresses concerns with restraints limiting the <b>passive</b> <b>sales</b> of pay TV services and with the ‘portability’ of subscriptions across borders.

The analysis is motivated by a European Court of Justice Decision in October 2011, which allowed viewers {{to take advantage of}} international price differences and buy access to Premier League TV matches from whichever country they like. We compare complete market segmentation with the new situation where consumers can purchase from abroad (allowing for <b>passive</b> <b>sales).</b> Clearly, such a change is likely to harm Premier League, which at present is sold at different prices to viewers in different countries. More surprisingly, we find that all viewers - including those that switch to purchasing from abroad - might also be harmed. We further show that the two-sidedness of the market may break down in the country that attracts foreign viewers...|$|E
50|$|Helium.com, Inc. {{was founded}} in 2006 as a Yahoo! Answers-style website created from user {{generated}} content paid on a revenue sharing model. Over time the site evolved from short answers to stand-alone articles, and began to offer writers the opportunity to earn from selling articles as well as <b>passive</b> income. The <b>sale</b> of articles to businesses and publishers is now its primary business, and the revenue share arm has closed to new members, effective May 21, 2014. The sites which display revenue share articles will be closed down on December 15, 2014.|$|R
