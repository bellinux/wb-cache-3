5|$|The Ju 87 was a single-engined {{all-metal}} cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage {{and could}} carry a two-person crew. The main construction material was duralumin, and the external coverings {{were made of}} Duralumin sheeting. <b>Parts</b> <b>that</b> were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminum alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.|$|E

5|$|After {{handling}} audio engineering for {{the recording}} of Achtung Baby, Robbie Adams was invited by U2 to manage sound mixing on the Zoo TV Tour. Adams also recorded the group's tour soundchecks. In January 1993, the band asked him to compile these recordings and create loops of interesting <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> they could play to in the studio. After Adams spent a few weeks assembling loops, the group entered The Factory in Dublin that February to begin composing rough demos. Bono and The Edge were most involved during this initial demoing process, which lasted six weeks.|$|E
5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E

Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft soapstone (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate carving, executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on the trees were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E
5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> were to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of element43 was finally confirmed in a December 1936 experiment at the University of Palermo in Sicily by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè. In mid-1936, Segrè visited the United States, first Columbia University in New York {{and then the}} Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He persuaded cyclotron inventor Ernest Lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> had become radioactive. Lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that {{had been part of}} the deflector in the cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} Jetpac with overhauled high-definition graphics and 128 levels. It also features competitive gameplay over Xbox Live, leaderboards, and achievements. Similar to the first instalment, the player assumes control of Jetman and is presented in a horizontal wrap around which consists of six platforms on which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman has to first assemble his rocket, which spawns in separate <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> are scattered around a map, and then fills it with six fuel canisters before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is repeated. In addition, Jetman has to defend himself from each planet's hostile aliens, and collect valuable resources such as gold and platinum, which occasionally fall from the atmosphere, for bonus points.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} a modern looking {{rectangular}} structure with orange brick and clear glass which is adjacent to Glenn Jackson Plaza and Hudson's Bay, with the Mill Race flowing by on the north side. The north and south faces are clear glass, while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> jut out from the primarily rectangular building.|$|E

The band were an instrumental group from Liverpool that had toured with the Beatles in 1964 and comprised Colin Manley (guitar), Tony Ashton (keyboards), Phillip Rogers (bass) and Roy Dyke (drums). Ashton contributed on tack (or jangle) piano and organ, {{and played the}} majority of the Mellotron <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> are prominent on the album.|$|E
5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the <b>parts</b> <b>that</b> would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
