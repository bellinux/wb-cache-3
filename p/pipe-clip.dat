25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the extreme altitudes flown at, the pilot was {{provided}} with a specially-developed two-piece suit. This suit, which was principally composed of rubberised fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of <b>pipe-clip.</b> It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an external tube to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the lower tank and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from standard grade Shell Ethyl aviation gasoline. Of note, this fuel has a high anti-knock value; the high degree of supercharge involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high anti-knock value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E
