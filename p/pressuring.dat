5|$|In December 1958 there {{occurred}} {{an event}} that initially {{had nothing to do}} with Playford, but eventually intensified into a debacle that was regarded as a turning point in his premiership and marked the end of his rule. Dunstan was prominent in <b>pressuring</b> Playford during this time.|$|E
5|$|Linebackers line {{up behind}} the {{defensive}} line but {{in front of the}} defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays. Their diverse roles include defending the run, <b>pressuring</b> the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pressure</b> {{exchanger}} transfers <b>pressure</b> {{energy from}} a high <b>pressure</b> fluid stream to a low <b>pressure</b> fluid stream. Many industrial processes operate at elevated <b>pressures</b> and have high <b>pressure</b> waste streams. One way of providing a high <b>pressure</b> fluid to such a process is to transfer the waste <b>pressure</b> to a low <b>pressure</b> stream using a <b>pressure</b> exchanger.|$|R
5000|$|The Bernoulli {{equation}} {{applicable to}} incompressible flow {{shows that the}} stagnation <b>pressure</b> {{is equal to the}} dynamic <b>pressure</b> plus static <b>pressure.</b> Total <b>pressure</b> is also equal to dynamic <b>pressure</b> plus static <b>pressure</b> so, in incompressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> is equal to total <b>pressure.</b> (In compressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> is also equal to total <b>pressure</b> providing the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Blood <b>pressure</b> is a gauge <b>pressure,</b> {{which means}} it is {{measured}} relative to ambient <b>pressure.</b> To calculate blood <b>pressure,</b> {{it has to be}} summed to ambient <b>pressure</b> for calculating when blood will boil. This is similar to a flat automobile tire: even with zero gauge <b>pressure,</b> a flat tire at altitude of the Armstrong limit would still have an absolute <b>pressure</b> (<b>pressure</b> relative to a perfect vacuum) of , that is, it will have the ambient <b>pressure</b> at the altitude where the 6.3 kPA <b>pressure</b> level occurs (about 18 km), both inside and out of it. If one inflates the tire to non-zero gauge <b>pressure,</b> this internal <b>pressure</b> is in addition to those [...] of ambient <b>pressure.</b> This means that for an individual with a diastolic low blood <b>pressure,</b> typically , the person's blood <b>pressure</b> would be , the sum of the blood <b>pressure</b> and the ambient <b>pressure.</b> This <b>pressure</b> is more than twice the ambient <b>pressure</b> at the Armstrong limit. This extra <b>pressure</b> is more than sufficient to prevent blood from outright boiling at 18 km while the heart is still beating.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, General Dũng advised Hanoi that he {{was turning}} his forces to capture Kon Tum and Pleiku. In Hanoi, Lê Duẩn was <b>pressuring</b> the General Staff to take {{advantage}} of the foothold they gained in the highlands. Two months remained before the monsoon season, when military operations would be forestalled. Further strategic gains appeared possible in light of Saigon's apparent weakness and the level of the U.S. response.|$|E
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in <b>pressuring</b> the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and {{his chief}} counsel, Roy Cohn, of {{improperly}} <b>pressuring</b> the Army to give favorable treatment to G. David Schine, {{a former aide}} to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn's, who was then serving in the Army as a private. McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican Senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.|$|E
30|$|However, {{when the}} {{difference}} (skeleton <b>pressure)</b> between the overburden <b>pressure</b> and fluid <b>pressure</b> (pore <b>pressure,</b> formation <b>pressure)</b> is decreased, the elastic {{parameters of the}} skeleton decrease and their corresponding velocities are decreased as well. In such case, the fluid <b>pressure</b> is increased on {{the expense of the}} skeleton <b>pressure,</b> and abnormal high <b>pressure</b> is generated.|$|R
50|$|In physiology, intrapleural <b>pressure</b> (also called intrathoracic <b>pressure)</b> {{refers to}} the <b>pressure</b> within the pleural cavity. Normally, the <b>pressure</b> within the pleural cavity is {{slightly}} less than the atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> in {{what is known as}} negative <b>pressure.</b> When the pleural cavity is damaged/ruptured and the intrapleural <b>pressure</b> becomes equal to or exceeds the atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> pneumothorax may ensue.|$|R
40|$|Mean {{arterial}} <b>pressure</b> and intracranial <b>pressure</b> {{were measured}} serially in six infants with intracranial hypertension (intracranial <b>pressure</b> greater than 20 mm Hg), and cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> was calculated from their difference. Overall, mean arterial <b>pressure</b> increased with rising intracranial <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 20 mm Hg/mm Hg. This caused a fall in cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> with increasing intracranial <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 80 mm Hg/mm Hg overall, although cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> was well maintained in one infant. Thus {{the rise in}} blood <b>pressure</b> was usually insufficient {{to compensate for the}} increase in intracranial <b>pressure.</b> In infants with acute encephalopathy vigorous blood <b>pressure</b> support is as important as lowering intracranial <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
5|$|From 1991 to 1992, Jashari {{and about}} 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing {{to fight for}} the {{independence}} of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Hamëz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, <b>pressuring</b> the police to withdraw from the village.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court {{ruled that}} the land invasions were illegal; they {{nevertheless}} continued, and Mugabe began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary. After the Supreme Court also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully <b>pressuring</b> chief justice Anthony Gubbay to do so. ZANU-PF member Godfrey Chidyausiku was appointed to replace him, {{while the number of}} Supreme Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-Mugabe figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal. In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in <b>pressuring</b> CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>pressure</b> cookers {{have a lower}} {{or higher}} maximum <b>pressure</b> than 1 bar/15 psi (gauge) or can be {{adjusted}} to different <b>pressures</b> for some recipes; cooking times will increase or decrease accordingly. This is typically done by having different regulator weights or different <b>pressure</b> settings. If the recipe is devised for a higher <b>pressure</b> and the <b>pressure</b> cooker does not reach that <b>pressure,</b> the cooking time can be increased slightly to compensate. Electric <b>pressure</b> cookers operate at lower <b>pressures</b> than stovetop <b>pressure</b> cookers.|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Stroke-related tissue <b>pressure</b> {{increase}} in the core and penumbra determines regional cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> (rCPP) defined as a difference between local inflow <b>pressure</b> and venous or tissue <b>pressure,</b> whichever is higher. We previously showed that venous <b>pressure</b> reduction below the <b>pressure</b> in the core causes blood flow diversion–cerebral venous steal. Now we investigated how transition to collateral circulation after complete arterial occlusion affects rCPP distribution. Methods—We modified parallel Starling resistor model to simulate transition to collateral inflow after complete main stem occlusion. We decreased venous <b>pressure</b> from the arterial <b>pressure</b> to zero and investigated how arterial and venous <b>pressure</b> elevation augments rCPP. Results—When core <b>pressure</b> exceeded venous, rCPPinflow <b>pressure</b> in the core. Venous <b>pressure</b> decrease from arterial <b>pressure</b> to <b>pressure</b> in the core caused smaller inflow <b>pressure</b> to drop augmenting rCPP. Further drop of venous <b>pressure</b> decreased rCPP in the core but augmented rCPP in penumbra. After transition to collateral circulation, lowering venous <b>pressure</b> below <b>pressure</b> in the penumbra further decreased rCPP and collaterals themselves became a pathway for steal. Venous <b>pressure</b> level at which rCPP in the core becomes zero we termed the “point of no reflow. ” Transition from direct to collateral circulation resulted in decreased inflow <b>pressure,</b> decreased rCPP, and a shift of point of no reflow to higher venous loading values. Arterial <b>pressure</b> augmentation increased rCPP, but only after venous <b>pressure</b> exceeded point of n...|$|R

5|$|The 2006 New Jersey state {{government}} shutdown {{was the first}} shutdown {{in the history of}} the U.S. state of New Jersey. The shutdown occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of <b>pressuring</b> the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4.|$|E
5|$|British {{secret service}} agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. <b>Pressuring</b> the two men, he {{eventually}} gets the gangsters to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Michel {{that he is in}} America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in Toronto, as part of his quest to ferret out SPECTRE. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots him.|$|E
5|$|Craig had {{a strong}} Sheffield Shield season in 1960–61. At the time, {{he had become a}} {{production}} manager at his pharmaceutical firm and declared that the season would be his last owing to work commitments. His employers had been <b>pressuring</b> him to commit to a career after cricket. Early in the campaign, Craig scored consecutive centuries against Queensland and Victoria. He then scored 83 as New South Wales defeated the touring West Indians by an innings and 97 runs, but he was overlooked for Test selection. He ended his season with 197 in an innings victory over Western Australia. Overall, he totalled 710 runs at 59.16, as New South Wales won their eighth successive Shield. After a successful campaign, he reversed his decision and made himself available for the 1961 tour of England, but Bill Lawry was selected ahead of him.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated by the {{mobility}} of the Ottoman batteries, which evaded the Allied bombardments and threatened the minesweepers sent to clear the Straits, Churchill began <b>pressuring</b> the naval commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, to increase the fleet's efforts. Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in Constantinople within 14 days. A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition. When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed a main attack would be launched on or around 17 March. It transpired that Carden, suffering from stress, {{was placed on the}} sick list by the medical officer and command was taken over by Admiral John de Robeck.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put {{the ball in the}} net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, <b>pressuring</b> goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 Soegija {{started at}} the Xaverius College in Muntilan, a school for {{aspiring}} teachers, and stayed in the dormitory. He was one of 54 students in his year. The boys followed a strict schedule, attending classes {{in the morning and}} engaging in other activities, such as gardening, discussions, and chess, in the afternoon. The Catholic students had regular prayers. Although the college did not require students to be Catholic, Soegija was pressured by his Catholic classmates, leading to several fights. Feeling dissatisfied, Soegija complained to his teacher that the Dutch priests were like merchants, thinking only of money. The priest replied that the teachers were unpaid and only hoped for the students' good. This led Soegija to better respect the priests, and when van Rijckevorsel told the other students that Soegija {{did not want to be}} Catholic, they stopped <b>pressuring</b> him.|$|E

5|$|Sin Po {{first went}} into print in 1910 and began gaining {{momentum}} {{as the leading}} advocate of Chinese political nationalism in 1917. The ethnic Chinese who followed its stream of thought refused any involvement with local institutions and would only participate in politics relating to mainland China. A second stream was later formed by wealthy ethnic Chinese who received an education at Dutch-run schools. This Dutch-oriented group wished for increased participation in local politics, Dutch education for the ethnic Chinese, and the furthering of ethnic Chinese economic standing within the colonial economy. Championed by the Volksraad's Chinese representatives, such as Hok Hoei Kan, Loa Sek Hie and Phoa Liong Gie, this movement gained momentum and reached its peak with the Chung Hwa Congress of 1927 and the 1928 formation of the Chung Hwa Hui party, which elected Kan as its president. The editor-in-chief of the Madjallah Panorama news magazine criticized Sin Po for misguiding the ethnic Chinese by <b>pressuring</b> them into a Chinese-nationalist stance.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Invincible {{was preceded by}} a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had {{expected}} the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him {{some time in the}} early 2000s, after which {{he would be able to}} promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been <b>pressuring</b> him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.|$|E
5|$|Under pressure, he {{was adamant}} {{that he was}} unaware of the current {{whereabouts}} of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofresí admitted off the record that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of <b>pressuring</b> the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.|$|E
