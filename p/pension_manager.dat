40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{spread of}} pension reform in Latin America in the 1990 s has {{replaced}} unfunded semi-public pension schemes with individual retirement saving plans managed by private <b>pension</b> fund <b>managers</b> (Barrientos 1998; Mesa-Lago and Bertranou 1998; Queisser 1998 b). The {{creation of a}} pension fund management market {{is one of the}} most consequential effects of the reform, with far reaching implications for the evolution of the reform, and its impact upon the economies of the region (Barrientos 1999). <b>Pension</b> fund <b>managers</b> have many important functions. They collect workers' contributions into a pension fund, invest this fund in a range of financial assets, arrange disability and survivor insurance for active contributors, pension benefits for those retired, and provide a range of supporting services. The success or failure of the pension reform will come to depend on whether the <b>pension</b> fund <b>managers</b> are effective as pension providers.

This finding is explained in terms of the predominance of a single investment style (balanced management), the fee structures and incentives operating in the UK pension fund industry to maximise relative rather than absolute performance, the high concentration in the UK pension fund industry and the low turnover of fund managers. Fund size appears to be the only variable that can account for an important fraction of the cross-sectional variation in measured performance...|$|R

The authors explore Ihe actuarial and economic assumptions employed by public <b>pension</b> <b>managers</b> when they set funding targets, using a new survey of state and local pension plans in the United States. The analysis shows that key assumptions under the control of public pension plan lrustees are sensitive to factors in the pension environment. An implication of the paper is that public pension funding patterns may become more sensitive to strategic seiection of interest role and other key assumptions as public sector budgets are subjected to fiscal pressures, and when they are managed by participant-run boards.
