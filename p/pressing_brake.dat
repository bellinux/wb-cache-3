40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by <b>pressing</b> <b>brake</b> blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The {{extensive}} use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, an extensive literature survey has been made with special focus on the braking capacity of wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|E

The influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution on the wheel temperatures has been investigated. A general result is that hot spots only have a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures.

The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. In a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials, the heat partitioning characteristics between wheel and block material at controlled elevated disc temperatures were investigated by a finite element approach where a model was calibrated using measured temperatures. In the final part of the present thesis, a modelling framework was proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential stop braking. A parametric study was done for analysing the influence of various loading levels and other important factors on temperatures, axial flange deflection, residual stresses and the fatigue life of the wheels. The model and the numerical results will be useful for assessing the thermal capacity of wheels and for developing new design rules and standards. It was found that the mechanical and thermal loadings have different influences on the web damage and on the estimated fatigue life depending on load cases and wheel design...|$|E

It was found that after the participants deactivated the ACC by <b>pressing</b> the <b>brake</b> pedal, the gap with the lead vehicle was decreased. Resuming the ACC by activating the system or by releasing the throttle after overruling the system resulted in a larger gap between participant and lead vehicle than an overruled ACC or the ACC turned off.

40|$|A haptic {{gas pedal}} {{feedback}} system is developed that provides car-following information via haptic cues {{from the gas}} pedal. During normal car-following situations, the haptic feedback (HF) cues were sufficient to reduce control activity and improve car-following performance. However, in more critical following situations, drivers use the brake pedal to maintain separation with the lead vehicle. A deceleration control (DC) algorithm is designed that, {{in addition to the}} HF, provided increased deceleration upon release of the gas pedal during car-following situations that required faster deceleration than releasing the gas pedal alone would do. For the design, a driver model for car following in different situations was estimated from driving simulator data. A Monte Carlo analysis with the driver model yielded subjective decision points, where drivers released the gas pedal to start <b>pressing</b> the <b>brakes.</b> This enabled the definition of a reaction field, which determined the needed deceleration input for the DC algorithm. The tuned DC algorithm was tested in a fixed-base driving simulator experiment. It was shown that the active deceleration support improved the car-following performance while reducing the driver brake pedal input magnitude in the conditions tested. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

25|$|Although easy to ride slowly {{because of}} their high center of mass and the {{inverted}} pendulum effect, the penny-farthing is prone to accidents. To stop, the rider presses back on the pedals while applying a spoon-shaped <b>brake</b> <b>pressing</b> the tire. The center of mass being high and not far behind the front wheel means any sudden stop or collision with a pothole or other obstruction can send the rider over the handlebars. On long downhills, some riders hooked their feet over the handlebars. This made for quick descents but left no chance of stopping. A new type of handlebar was introduced, called Whatton bars, that looped behind the legs so that riders could still keep their feet on the pedals and {{also be able to}} leap forward feet-first off the machine.|$|R
5000|$|... {{muscles are}} simply the muscles that produce an {{opposing}} joint torque to the agonist muscles. [...] This torque can aid in controlling a motion. The opposing torque can slow movement down - {{especially if it}} was a ballistic movement. For example, during a very rapid (ballistic) discrete movement of the elbow, such as throwing a dart, the triceps muscles will be activated very briefly and strongly (in a [...] "burst") to rapidly accelerate the extension movement at the elbow, followed almost immediately by a [...] "burst" [...] of activation to the elbow flexor muscles that decelerates the elbow movement to arrive at a quick stop. To use an automotive analogy, this is like pressing your gas pedal rapidly and then immediately <b>pressing</b> the <b>brake.</b> Antagonism is not an intrinsic property of a particular muscle or muscle group; it is a role that a muscle plays depending on which muscle is currently the agonist. During slower joint actions that involve gravity, just as with the agonist muscle (mentioned above), the antagonist muscle can shorten AND lengthen. Using the example above of the triceps brachii during a push-up, the elbow flexor muscles are the antagonists at the elbow during both the up phase and down phase of the movement. And, during the dumbbell curl the elbow extensors are the antagonists for both the lifting and lowering phases.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a test program on cold-formed plain channel columns compressed between fixed ends and pinned ends. Whereas it is well-known that local buckling of pin-ended channel columns induces overall bending, this phenomenon {{does not occur}} in fixed-ended channel columns that remain straight after local buckling and only bend when overall buckling occurs. These fundamentally different effects of local buckling {{on the behavior of}} pin-ended and fixed-ended channel sections lead to inconsistencies in traditional design approaches, which account for full or partial rotational end restraint solely by using effective lengths. A series of tests was performed for different geometries of cross section fabricated by <b>brake</b> <b>pressing</b> from high-strength steel sheet. Tests were performed over a range of lengths such that the column curve could be obtained. Local buckling loads were also obtained from the fixed-ended column tests. Detailed measurements of local and overall geometric imperfections, material properties, and residual stresses were conducted. The {{purpose of this paper is}} first to present and compare the test strengths with existing Australian/New Zealand, American, and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures and, second, to propose recommendations for the design of fixed-ended singly symmetric columns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The Bowden {{mechanism}} {{was invented}} by Irishman Ernest Monnington Bowden (1860 to April 3, 1904) of 35 Bedford Place, London, W.C. The first patent was granted in 1896 (English Patent 25,325 and U.S. Pat. No. 609,570), and the invention {{was reported in the}} Automotor Journal of 1897 where Bowden's address was given as 9 Fopstone Rd, Earls Court. The principal element of this was a flexible tube (made from hard wound wire and fixed at each end) containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements on the wire rope {{from one end to the}} other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes, although it had the potential for other applications. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press in 1896. It consisted of a stirrup, pulled up by the cable from a handlebar mounted lever, with rubber pads acting against the rear wheel rim. At this date bicycles were fixed wheel, additional braking being offered by a 'plunger' <b>brake</b> <b>pressing</b> on the front tyre. The Bowden offered extra braking power still, and was novel enough to appeal to riders who scorned the plunger arrangement, which was heavy and potentially damaging to the (expensive) pneumatic tyre. The problem for Bowden was his failure to develop effective distribution networks and the brake was often incorrectly, or inappropriately fitted, resulting in a good number of complaints being aired in the press. Its most effective application was on those machines fitted with Westwood pattern steel rims which offered flat bearing surfaces for the brake pads.|$|R
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first <b>pressing</b> the foot <b>brake</b> pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|R
