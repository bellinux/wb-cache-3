5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in <b>pregnancy</b> and childbirth, <b>pregnancy</b> {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic <b>pregnancy,</b> preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of <b>pregnancy</b> vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of <b>pregnancy</b> may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of <b>pregnancy</b> or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
25|$|About 213 million <b>pregnancies</b> {{occurred}} in 2012 of which 190 million {{were in the}} developing world and 23 million were in the developed world. This is about 133 <b>pregnancies</b> per 1,000 {{women between the ages of}} 15 and 44. About 10% to 15% of recognized <b>pregnancies</b> end in miscarriage.

40|$|Background Twin <b>pregnancies</b> are at {{increased}} risk for perinatal morbidity and death because of many factors that include a high incidence of preterm delivery. Compared with singleton <b>pregnancies,</b> overall perinatal risk of death is higher in twin pregnancies; however, for the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate has been reported to be lower in twins. Objective The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare perinatal mortality rates in relation to gestational age at birth between singleton and twin <b>pregnancies,</b> taking into account socioeconomic status, fetal sex, and parity. Study Design We studied perinatal mortality rates according to gestational age at birth in 1, 502, 120 singletons <b>pregnancies</b> and 51, 658 twin <b>pregnancies</b> without congenital malformations who were delivered between 2002 and 2010 after 28 weeks of gestation. Data were collected from the nationwide Netherlands Perinatal Registry. Results Overall the perinatal mortality rate in twin <b>pregnancies</b> (6. 6 / 1000 infants) was higher than in singleton <b>pregnancies</b> (4. 1 / 1000 infants). However, in the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate in twin <b>pregnancies</b> was substantially lower than in singleton <b>pregnancies</b> (10. 4 per 1000 infants as compared with 34. 5 per 1000 infants, respectively) for infants who were born at < 37 weeks of gestation; this held especially for antepartum deaths. After 39 weeks of gestation, the perinatal mortality rate was higher in twin <b>pregnancies.</b> Differences in parity, fetal sex, and socioeconomic status did not explain the observed differences in outcome. Conclusion Overall the perinatal mortality rate was higher in twin <b>pregnancies</b> than in singleton <b>pregnancies,</b> which is most likely caused by the high preterm birth rate in twins and not by a higher mortality rate for gestation, apart from term <b>pregnancies.</b> During the preterm period, the antepartum mortality rate was much lower in twin <b>pregnancies</b> than in singleton <b>pregnancies.</b> We suggest that this might be partially due to a closer monitoring of twin <b>pregnancies,</b> which indirectly suggests a need for closer surveillance of singleton <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Toxemia of <b>pregnancy</b> {{is common}} and kills many {{pregnant}} females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. <b>Pregnancy</b> toxemia {{appears to be}} most common in hot climates.

40|$|Background: In recent decades, {{there has}} been a {{dramatic}} increase in the prevalence of multiple <b>pregnancies.</b> An important reason is the increased use of assisted reproductive techniques for conception. Despite the advances in prenatal care, maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality caused by multiple <b>pregnancies</b> are still high. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the fetomaternal complications in higher order multiple <b>pregnancies.</b> Design: The design is a retrospective study. Setting: Triplet and quadruplet <b>pregnancies</b> were investigated in this study. Methods: This study investigated the outcome of triplet and quadruplet <b>pregnancies</b> born alive at the Mahdiyeh hospital, Tehran, Iran from 2006 to 2015.

40|$|Objectives: Levels of {{maternal}} serum markers of fetal Down syndrome in <b>pregnancies</b> conceived after assisted reproduction {{are different from}} those of normal spontaneous <b>pregnancies.</b> The present study examined the effects of conventional in-vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo cryopreservation on nuchal translucency (NT) thickness. Methods: A retrospective analysis on 16 673 spontaneous <b>pregnancies,</b> 119 <b>pregnancies</b> with fresh embryos from IVF, 62 <b>pregnancies</b> with frozen-thawed embryos from IVF, 81 <b>pregnancies</b> with fresh embryos from ICSI and 39 frozen-thawed embryos from ICSI was performed. All were singletons with known normal outcomes. Multiples of the median (MoM) of NT were compared. Results: The median NT MoM of spontaneous <b>pregnancies</b> was 1. 01. In the assisted reproduction <b>pregnancies,</b> the median NT MoM were significantly increased to 1. 07 (P = 0. 003), 1. 09 (P = 0. 009) and 1. 09 (P = 0. 001) in <b>pregnancies</b> conceived with fresh embryos from IVF, frozen-thawed embryos from IVF and fresh embryos from ICSI, respectively. A non-significant increase in median NT MoM (1. 04; P = 0. 489) was also observed in <b>pregnancies</b> with frozen-thawed embryos from ICSI. Conclusions: Increased NT in assisted reproduction <b>pregnancies</b> is postulated to be due to some delay in fetal development. Another possible reason might be related to adverse antenatal course in these <b>pregnancies.</b> Copyright © 2005 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|Worldwide, 38% of <b>pregnancies</b> were {{unintended}} in 1999 (some 80 million unintended <b>pregnancies</b> in 1999). [...] In {{developed world}} an estimated 49% of <b>pregnancies</b> were unintended, 36% {{in the developing}} world.|$|R
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in <b>pregnancy</b> {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During <b>pregnancy,</b> high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in <b>pregnancy.</b> A kidney infection during <b>pregnancy</b> may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during <b>pregnancy</b> that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in <b>pregnancy</b> and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage <b>pregnancy.</b> Teen <b>pregnancy</b> rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>pregnancy</b> can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of <b>pregnancy</b> are {{associated}} {{with an increase in}} sebaceous gland activity in the skin, <b>pregnancy</b> has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during <b>pregnancy,</b> as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during <b>pregnancy.</b> In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during <b>pregnancy,</b> fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during <b>pregnancy</b> include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during <b>pregnancy</b> due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{alteration}} in the second-trimester maternal serum levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in <b>pregnancies</b> conceived after assisted reproduction. Methods: We compared the amniotic fluid hCG and AFP concentrations of 45 <b>pregnancies</b> with fresh embryo transfer and 25 <b>pregnancies</b> with frozen-thawed embryo transfer with 269 spontaneous <b>pregnancies.</b> Wilcoxon rank-sum {{test was used}} for analysis. Results: The median amniotic fluid hCG MoM in <b>pregnancies</b> conceived after frozen-thawed embryo transfer was significantly increased to 1. 41 compared to 1. 00 (p = 0. 01) in naturally occurring <b>pregnancies</b> and 0. 96 (p = 0. 049) in <b>pregnancies</b> after fresh embryo transfer. Further analysis showed that this was only observed in frozen embryos fertilized by conventional insemination with MoM of 1. 59. The AFP MoMs were similar among the groups. Conclusions: The observed raised amniotic fluid hCG level in IVF-FET <b>pregnancies</b> may reflect the elevated maternal serum level in these <b>pregnancies.</b> Further studies should be directed towards exploring the underlying pathophysiology.

5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{uterine artery}} {{resistance}} index values in twin and singleton <b>pregnancies,</b> to examine eventual modifications of these values in twin <b>pregnancies</b> complicated by gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, {{and to determine}} whether resistance index values in twin <b>pregnancies</b> could predict the development of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, reference limits for gestation were constructed for the uterine artery resistance index (higher, lower, and mean values) in 96 uncomplicated twin <b>pregnancies</b> and compared to the reference limits constructed from 315 normal singleton <b>pregnancies.</b> Uterine artery resistance indexes obtained in 53 twin <b>pregnancies</b> complicated by either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia were compared with the newly established nomograms. The clinical efficacy of the uterine artery resistance index to predict hypertensive complications was evaluated prospectively in 64 twin <b>pregnancies</b> studied at 20 - 24 weeks' gestation. Results: In both singleton and twin <b>pregnancies,</b> uterine artery resistance indexes decreased linearly with advancing gestation. However, twin <b>pregnancies</b> showed significantly different slopes and constant values, resulting in lower resistance indexes at all gestational ages examined. No {{significant differences were found}} when comparing resistance indexes in all patients with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia to the reference limits. Statistically significant differences were obtained for the higher (P less-than-or-equal-to. 05) and mean (P less-tha-or-equal-to. 01) resistance indexes when the comparison was restricted to preeclamptic patients. In the twin <b>pregnancies</b> studied at 20 - 24 weeks' gestation, the diagnostic efficacy of the uterine artery resistance index for predicting the development of gestational hypertension and/or preeclampsia was disappointingly low (k < 0. 10). Conclusions: Resistance index values in the uterine artery are lower in twin <b>pregnancies</b> than in singleton <b>pregnancies.</b> Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia may occur in twin <b>pregnancies</b> despite normal uterine artery velocity waveforms, suggesting a limited role of this measurement in the management and prediction of hypertensive complications in twin <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe during <b>pregnancy</b> include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) {{are other}} topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for <b>pregnancy</b> (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during <b>pregnancy</b> as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel.
