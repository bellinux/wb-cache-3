25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} VC Commodore of March 1980 was the engine upgrading to [...] "XT5" [...] specification. Now painted blue and thus known as the Blue straight-sixes and Holden V8s, these replaced the Red units fitted to the VB and earlier cars. Changes included a new twelve-port cylinder head, re-designed combustion chambers, inlet and exhaust manifolds, a new two-barrel carburettor and a Bosch electronic ignition system for the inline sixes. Tweaks and changes to the V8s surrounded the implementation of electronic ignition, revised cylinder head and inlet manifold design and the fitment of a four-barrel carburettor on the 4.2-litre variant. These changes brought improved efficiency, increased outputs and aided driveability. In response to increasing oil prices, a four-cylinder variant was spawned in June 1980. Displacing 1.9-litres, this powerplant known as Starfire was effectively Holden's existing straight-six with two cylinders removed. The four's <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of [...] and torque rated at [...] meant its performance was compromised. Reports indicate that the need to push the engine hard to extract performance led to real-world fuel consumption similar to the straight-sixes.|$|E

Developing a proper bike fit requires conducting many biomechanical assessments due to the need to match a myriad of bike geometries and human anthropometric variables. One of the primary bike-rider system measurement parameters for power and pedal efficiencies is the cleat placement and alignment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of moving the cleats towards the heel on <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> and pedal efficiencies using a Computrainer (CT) and 2 D video analysis. Ten competitive male cyclists participated in the study consisting of tests for <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> (PP) <b>outputs</b> and pedaling efficiencies among two positions of cleats; toe (TP) and heel (HP). No significant differences in <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were reported between TP and HP (p =. 827).

500|$|In an {{era when}} the NAD's rated power output of 20 watts per channel {{continuous}} into 8 ohms was considered anaemic, the manufacturer claimed it could deliver much stronger power output into lower impedances under dynamic conditions (music or <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> <b>output).</b> Indeed, {{it is capable of}} delivering 40 watts into 8 ohm, 58 watts into 4 ohm, and 72 watts into 2 ohm loads for a limited time if pushed.

Launching the product in the US at the Consumer Electronics Show, the company wired up a battery of loudspeakers in a way which presented an impedance of 1.1 ohm, and the amplifier experienced no problems. Similarly, at its London launch, NAD successfully demonstrated it driving the Linn Isobarik, whose impedance characteristics are known to be very challenging for amplifiers.

Access is free, and some telescopes are provided. Utility company employees and volunteers from the Connecticut Audubon Society and other groups are at the observation area to assist visitors. Advanced reservations are required. Eagles are attracted to the spot because the water churning through the dam's hydroelectric turbine keeps the surface from icing over, allowing the birds to fish. Red-tailed hawks, goshawks, great blue herons and other waterfowl are also attracted to the spot. [...] The dam flooded an area now known as Lake Lillinonah.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of activator Ca 2 + on loaded shortening and <b>power</b> <b>output</b> in skinned rat cardiac myocyte preparations, and fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres at 12 °C.

In cardiac myocyte preparations, even <b>peak</b> relative <b>power</b> <b>output</b> progressively fell when Ca 2 + activation levels were lowered to ≈ 70, 50 and 30 %P 4. 5. <b>Peak</b> relative <b>power</b> <b>output</b> also progressively fell in fast-twitch fibres as Ca 2 + activation levels were lowered from maximal down to 50 %P 4. 5. However, in slow-twitch fibres, <b>peak</b> relative <b>power</b> <b>output</b> decreased only at 70 %P 4. 5 and then remained unchanged with further reductions in Ca 2 + activation levels. The greater Ca 2 + dependence of <b>peak</b> relative <b>power</b> <b>output</b> in cardiac myocytes and fast-twitch fibres may arise from a shared mechanism such as cooperative inactivation of the thin filament, which is likely to be slowest in less cooperative slow-twitch fibres. During submaximal Ca 2 + activations, the time course of shortening became markedly curvilinear during isotonic shortening in all three muscle types. The progressive slowdown in shortening velocity during isotonic contractions was greatest in fast-twitch fibres, consistent with the higher degree of cooperativity of Ca 2 + activation in fast-twitch fibres. Additionally, fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibre stiffness decreased in concert with the curvature of length traces during loaded shortening. These results are consistent with the idea that cooperative inactivation of the thin filament occurs during loaded shortening and such a mechanism may contribute to the progressive slowing and overall Ca 2 + dependence of loaded shortening velocity...|$|R

A {{substantial}} amount of research on pre-exercise nutrition suggests that carbohydrate ingestion prior to exercise and sport activity increases performance due to various factors like blood glucose maintenance, better-facilitated carbohydrate breakdown, and higher glycogen turnover. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if a high-carbohydrate pre-exercise meal allowed sedentary and recreationally active people to produce higher <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> in watts than if they consumed a high-fat or high-protein meal. METHODS: Five male and four female college students at the University of Central Missouri, who identified as sedentary or recreationally active, were recruited to consume a high-fat, high-carbohydrate, or high-protein meal at three different sessions. Participants were instructed after feedings to return to the lab approximately 180 minutes later to perform a 30 -second maximal <b>power</b> <b>output</b> test known as the Wingate Anaerobic Test. RESULTS: The results showed <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were highest for the fat trials at a mean of 847. 78 ± 278. 52 W, followed by a mean 832. 22 ± 224. 39 W for the carbohydrate trials, and a mean of 801. 67 ± 245. 41 W for the protein trials. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that <b>peak</b> anaerobic <b>power</b> <b>output</b> in watts would be higher following the consumption of a high-carbohydrate meal compared to a high-fat or high-protein meal was not supported by the data.
