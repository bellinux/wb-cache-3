50|$|A {{photoelectric}} sensor, or <b>photo</b> <b>eye,</b> is {{an equipment}} used {{to discover the}} distance, absence, or presence of an object by using a light transmitter, often infrared, and a photoelectric receiver. They are largely used in industrial manufacturing. There are three different useful types: opposed (through beam), retro-reflective, and proximity-sensing (diffused).|$|E

50|$|Double Loop's support {{structure}} was originally painted white but {{would later be}} painted dark to match the track. The attraction debuted with two trains, one red and the other yellow. In 1993, the coaster underwent refurbishment adding some modernization to the control system. The outdated relay and <b>photo</b> <b>eye</b> controls were replaced with newer PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and proximity switches to help improve reliability and to reduce downtime. Following Geauga Lake's acquisition by Six Flags, Double Loop was given a makeover in 2000, with a new paint scheme featuring a yellow track and purple supports. The yellow train was repainted a darker shade of yellow, while the red train was converted to purple.|$|E

The incidence of STDR, progression of maculopathy and risk factors were evaluated by log Rank test (Kaplan-Meier method).

30|$|The {{revised version}} of the R-MET {{consists}} of 36 <b>photos</b> presenting the <b>eyes</b> and their adjacent areas. All the pictures show exactly the same region of the face—from {{the middle of the}} nose to the area above the brows. The subject being studied is asked to choose one of the four terms which best describes what the person on the picture is thinking or feeling. This test assesses the ability to identify both cognitive and affective mental states because, for inferring what the person on the picture is thinking or feeling it includes, among others, such terms as suspicious (cognitive component) and fearful (affective component) (Baron-Cohen et al. (2001)).|$|R
40|$|Manually {{selecting}} subsets {{of photos}} from large collections {{in order to}} present them to friends or colleagues or to print them as photo books can be a tedious task. Today, fully automatic approaches are at hand for supporting users. They make use of pixel information extracted from the images, analyze con-textual information such as capture time and focal aperture, or use both to determine a proper subset of photos. How-ever, these approaches miss {{the most important factor}} in the photo selection process: the user. The goal of our approach is to consider individual interests. By recording and analyz-ing gaze information from the user’s viewing photo collec-tions, we obtain information on user’s interests and use this information in the creation of personal photo selections. In a controlled experiment with 33 participants, we show that the selections can be significantly improved over a baseline approach by up to 22 % when taking individual viewing be-havior into account. We also obtained significantly better re-sults for photos taken at an event participants were involved in compared with photos from another event.

30|$|The first {{published}} OMR work {{was conducted by}} Pruslin [7] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pruslin's system recognized a subset of Western Music Notation (WMN), primarily musical notes. Before the 1990 s, many studies were performed [8, 9], and research had begun to focus on handwritten formats [9 – 11] and ancient (or folk) music, including medieval music [12], white mensural notation [13, 14], early music prints [15], Orthodox Hellenic Byzantine Music notation [16], and Greek traditional music [17]. During the same period, several commercial OMR software packages, such as Capella-scan, Optical Music easy Reader, <b>Photo</b> Score, Sharp <b>Eye,</b> Smart Score, and Vivaldi Scan, were developed. These reached the market for WMN, and their recognition rate exceeded 90 % for commonly printed musical scores [18].|$|R
