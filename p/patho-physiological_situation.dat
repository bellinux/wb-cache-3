Although CTLs exhibit strong cytolytic activity against target cells in vitro, {{a number of}} studies have demonstrated that their function is often impaired within tumors. Nevertheless, CTLs can regain their cytotoxic ability after escaping from the tumor environment, suggesting that the milieu created by tumors may affect the function of CTLs. As for the tumor environment, the <b>patho-physiological</b> <b>situation</b> present in vivo has been shown to differ from in vitro experimental conditions. In particular, low pH and hypoxia are the most important microenvironmental factors within growing tumors. In the present study, to determine the effect of these factors on CTL function in vivo, we examined the cytolytic activity of CTLs against their targets using murine CTL lines and the induction of these cells from memory cells under low pH or hypoxic conditions using antigen-primed spleen cells. The results indicated that both cytotoxic activity and the induction of functional CTLs were markedly inhibited under low pH. In contrast, in hypoxic conditions, although cytotoxic activity was almost unchanged, the induction of CTLs in vitro showed a slight enhancement, which was completely abrogated in low pH conditions. Therefore, antigen-specific CTL functions may be more vulnerable to low pH than to the oxygen concentration in vivo. The findings shown here provide new therapeutic approaches for controlling tumor growth by retaining CTL cytotoxicity through the maintenance of higher pH conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the roles of {{individual}} BAs and due to limited blood sample volumes available from experimental animals, improved methods for the simultaneous quantification of multiple BAs are needed. We developed and validated an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of 24 BAs, including 11 unconjugated, 6 glycine-conjugated and 7 taurine-conjugated BAs, in 50 μL of rat serum or plasma. The UPLC-MS/MS method, operated in negative and positive ion mode, allows quantification of BAs using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM), with specific fragmentation of BAs. The method showed acceptable intra- and inter-day accuracy, precision, extraction recovery and high sensitivity, with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in the pM range for several taurine-conjugated BAs. We applied the established method to investigate potential time-dependent changes of BAs in plasma from sham-operated and uninephrectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats. The levels of several primary and secondary BAs were transiently elevated one week after uninephrectomy, followed by normalization thereafter. In contrast, several conjugated BAs were slightly increased after the second week post-surgery. The established UPLC-MS/MS method, employing specific fragmentation of free and conjugated BAs by MRM, allows the simultaneous quantification of multiple BAs in 50 μL serum or plasma samples, {{and can be used}} to assess BA profiles in <b>patho-physiological</b> <b>situations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis is a {{key process}} {{involved}} in vascular devel-opment and wound repair, {{as well as in}} various <b>patho-physiological</b> <b>situations,</b> such as ischemic circulatory disease and carcinogenesis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes neovascularization of the retina in patients with diabetic reti-nopathy and has an important role in angiogenesis 1, 2 because it controls the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of vascular cells, 3 – 5 as well as the expression of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8). 6 – 9 Canonical Wnt/β-catenin sig-naling regulates gene transcription by enabling transloca-tion of β-catenin from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin forms a complex with TCF 4 /LEF- 1, which recruits the transcription factors Brg 1 and CREB-binding protein to initiate Wnt-targeted gene expression. 10 The bind-ing of β-catenin also displaces transcriptional corepressors, such as C-terminal binding protein, 11 histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1), 12 and Groucho/TLE 13 from TCF 4, 14 and recruits transcriptional coactivators, such as p 300 /CBP. 15 BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach 1) is a basic leucine zip-per transcription factor 16 that forms a heterodimer with small Maf oncoproteins and binds to Maf recognition elements on the genome, thereby inhibiting the transcription of heme oxy-genase- 1 (HO- 1) and other genes involved in the oxidativ...|$|R
40|$|Anomalies in {{glutamate}} homeostasis {{may contribute}} to the pathological processes involved in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD). Glutamate released from neurons or glial cells is normally rapidly cleared by glutamate transporters, most of which are expressed at the protein level by glial cells. However, in some <b>patho-physiological</b> <b>situations,</b> expression of glutamate transporters that are normally considered to be glial types, appears to be evoked in populations of distressed neurons. This study analysed the expression of exon-skipping forms of the three predominant excitatory amino acid (glutamate) transporters (EAATs 1 - 3) in brains afflicted with AD. We demonstrate by immunocytochemistry in temporal cortex, the expression of these proteins particularly in limited subsets of neurons, some of which appeared to be dys-morphic. Whilst the neuronal expression of the "glial" glutamate transporters EAAT 1 and EAAT 2 is frequently considered to represent the abnormal and ectopic expression of such transporters, we suggest this may be a misinterpretation, since neurons such as cortical pyramidal cells normally express abundant mRNA for these EAATs (but little if any EAAT protein expression). We hypothesize instead that distressed neurons in the AD brain can turn on the translation of pre-existent mRNA pools, or suppress the degradation of alternately spliced glutamate transporter protein, leading to the "unmasking" of, rather than evoked expression of "glial" glutamate transporters in stressed neurons...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Adenosine {{has been}} {{considered}} as a fine-tuner of the neurotransmitters in the nervesystem. Adaptive changes in the brain adenosine system occur in some <b>patho-physiological</b> <b>situations</b> suchas chronic exposure to morphine. In this study, the adaptive changes in the adenosine deaminase activity asa key enzyme in the adenosine metabolism that converts adenosine to inosine and ammonia, irreversibly,due to morphine dependence and tolerance to anti-nociceptive effects of sodium-salicylate wereinvestigated. Materials and Methods: Morphine dependence was induced by morphine administration in tap water(0. 4 mg/ml for 24 days). Tolerance to sodium-salicylate was induced by 6 i. p. injection (1 injection/day) ofsodium-salicylate. Tolerance to antinociceptive effects of sodium-salicylate was measured by tail flick (TF) and hot plate (HP) tests. Right hippocampus was dissected, homogenized at phosphate buffer, centrifugedand then the supernatant fraction was isolated. Protein content of the samples was measured by theBradford method. Hippocampus adenosine deaminase activity was measured by a calorimetric method ofenzyme assay {{which is based on}} the direct measurement of the produced ammonia from excessiveadenosine degradation by adenosine deaminase. Results: Daily injection of Sodium-salicylate produced antinociception in early days by latency increaserather than saline injection (P 0. 05). Injection of morphine(5 mg/Kg) at the day 7 showed more increase in the latency of saline injected rather than sadium-salicylateinjected (P 0. 05). Conclusion: This decline in the adenosine deaminase activity may be related with adaptation in brainadenosine system subsequent of dependent to morphine or tolerance to sodium-salicylate...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{we present}} a new {{designed}} experimental setup for study of characteristics of pulsatile flow in elastic tubes, aiming to simulate arterial blood flow. This system includes four major components: (1) a pulsatile pump producing original arterial flow, (2) an elastic element to simulate coupling of the heart with the arterial system, (3) an elastic tube with mechanical characteristics of the arterial wall and assembly of pressure transducers to monitor inlet and outlet pulsatile pressures and the resultant pulsatile pressure gradient and (4) a resistant element to simulate peripheral resistant distal the artery. The system is capable of performing under different mechanical conditions, including tubes with different elastic moduli and fluids with different viscosities. Experimental results showed a precise ability of producing original blood flow waves and recording pressure pulses and pressure gradient waves under different mechanical conditions. The resultant pressure pulses were compatible with the diastolic-systolic pressure pulses of typical arteries. The system showed an accurate sensitivity to variations of fluid viscosity and elasticity of tube wall. Experimental results showed that stiffening of the wall resulted in decrease of mean pressure gradient pulse. Results also showed that an elevated fluid viscosity led to a higher mean value of pressure gradient and less fluctuation of pressure gradient pulse. Results are in good agreement with theoretical considerations of higher energy dissipation and consequent pressure drop by increased fluid viscosity. The designed experimental setup might be used in evaluation of hemodynamic parameters in <b>patho-physiological</b> <b>situations</b> such as stenotic arteries and age related stiffening...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α) is {{a master}} {{regulator}} to sense decreased oxygen partial pressure. HIF- 1 α stability regulation initiates a complex biological response that allows cells to act appropriately to meet <b>patho-physiological</b> <b>situations</b> of decreased oxygen availability. Recently, nitric oxide emerged as a messenger {{with the ability to}} stabilize HIF- 1 α and to transactivate HIF- 1 under normoxia. Considering that reactive nitrogen species are recognized for post-translation protein modifications, among others S-nitrosation, we asked whether HIF- 1 α is a target for S-nitrosation. In vitro NO+ donating NO donors such as GSNO and SNAP provoked massive S-nitrosation of purified HIF- 1 α. All 15 free thiol groups found in human HIF- 1 α are subjected to S-nitrosation. Thiol modification is not shared by spermine-NONOate, a NO radical donating compound. However, spermine-NONOate in the presence of O 2 −, generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase, regained S-nitrosation, most likely via formation of a N 2 O 3 -like species. In vitro, S-nitrosation of HIF- 1 α was attenuated by the addition of GSH or ascorbate. In RCC 4 and HEK 293 cells GSNO or SNAP reproduced S-nitrosation of HIF- 1 α, however with a significantly reduced potency that amounted to modification of three to four thiols, only. Importantly, endogenous formation of NO in RCC 4 cells via inducible NO synthase elicited S-nitrosation of HIF- 1 α that was sensitive to inhibition of inducible NO synthase activity with N-monomethyl-L-arginine. NO-stabilized HIF- 1 α was susceptible to the addition of N-acetyl-cysteine that destabilized HIF- 1 α in close correlation to the disappearance of S-nitrosated HIF- 1 α. In conclusion, HIF- 1 α is a target for S-nitrosation by exogenously and endogenously produced NO...|$|R
