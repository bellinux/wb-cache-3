The <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 1 gene {{from the soil}} bacteria Streptomyces griseolus encodes CYP 105 A 1 which acts on various substrates including sulfonylurea herbicides, vitamin D, coumarins, {{and based on the}} work presented here, brassinosteroids. <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 1 is used as a negative-selection marker in plants because CYP 105 A 1 converts the relatively benign sulfonyl urea pro-herbicide R 7402 into a highly phytotoxic product. Consistent with its use for negative selection, transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated with <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 1 situated between recognition sequences for FLP recombinase from yeast to select for recombinase-mediated excision. However, unexpected and prominent developmental aberrations resembling those described for mutants defective in brassinosteroid signaling were observed in many of the lines. Results The phenotypes of the most affected lines included severe stunting, leaf curling, darkened leaves characteristic of anthocyanin accumulation, delayed transition to flowering, low pollen and seed yields, and delayed senescence. Phenotype severity correlated with <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 1 transcript abundance, but not with transcript abundance of other experimental genes, strongly implicating CYP 105 A 1 as responsible for the defects. Germination and seedling growth of transgenic and control lines in the presence and absence of 24 -epibrassinolide indicated that CYP 105 A 1 disrupts brassinosteroid signaling, most likely by inactivating brassinosteroids. Conclusions Despite prior use of this gene as a genetic tool, deleterious growth in the absence of R 7402 has not been elaborated. We show that this gene can cause aberrant growth by disrupting brassinosteroid signaling and affecting homeostasis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Oxidative {{biocatalysts}} have a vast {{industrial and}} biotechnological potential {{in areas such}} as fine chemical and antibiotic synthesis. They offer an environmentally compatible and sustainable route to catalysis, often simpler and more specific than chemical alternatives. However, the routine use of biocatalysts in biopharmaceutical manufacture has been hindered by biocatalyst complexity and the experimental burden necessary for implementation. This thesis aims to investigate, using automated microscale technologies, how oxidative biocatalytic bioprocesses can be designed and developed at a reduced cost and timeframe compared to conventional laboratory scale experimentation. A robotic platform was used with 96 -Deep square well microtiter plates to develop an effective bioprocess for investigating cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO). E. coli cultivations for CHMO production, bioconversion, liquid-liquid metabolite extraction and analytic techniques were conducted using the developed microscale automated approach. Each step allowed rapid and reproducible collection of quantitative kinetic data over multiples runs achieving ‘walk away operation’. Whole bioprocess evaluation was achieved, whereby linking multiple unit operations enabled rapid assessment of process interactions. Factors influencing CHMO activity and bioconversion yields were investigated along with alternative bioconversion substrates. From identified limitations of the CHMO system an optimised process was developed where the processing time was almost halved and CHMO activity increased 5 -fold. Two novel self-sufficient cytochrome P 450 systems, <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 1 and <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 2 were investigated using an automated approach where factors limiting bioconversion were identified. Implementation of the required improvements resulted in a 5 -fold improvement in enzymatic expression and 5 -fold and 1. 5 -fold increase in product formation from cytochrome <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 1 and <b>P</b> 450 <b>SU</b> 2, respectively. A matched oxygen transfer coefficient approach was used for predictive scale-up. The optimised microscale CHMO and P 450 processes were scaled to 75 L and 7. 5 L bioreactor scale, respectively. Growth and bioconversion kinetics were found to be identical between scales for the CHMO system whereas differences were observed for the P 450 systems. Results described in this thesis have demonstrated the benefits of microscale automated methodologies for the creation, investigation and predictive scale-up of oxidative biocatalytic bioprocesses.

Therefore, serum levels of antibody to 12 periodontopathic bacteria together with other atherosclerotic risk markers were compared among 51 patients with CHD, 55 patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis and 37 healthy individuals.

40|$|Fucoidans, the {{bioactive}} and structurally diverse polysaccharides from brown algae, {{have potential}} {{applications in the}} health industry, but development has been hampered by difficulties in controlling the structure, purity, and consistency of the product. Importantly, the extraction technique affects {{the nature of the}} product by preferentially extracting differing fucoidan compounds, whilst simultaneously altering their structure. Extractions are typically performed using hot, dilute acid, but the kinetics of extraction are poorly understood, especially with regard to trade-offs between yield, purity and structural integrity. Here, the extraction kinetics of fucoidan from the brown alga Ecklonia radiata under classical conditions, hydrochloric acid at, C, pH, have been investigated, using both convective and microwave heating in open vessels for up to, h. The yield, purity and key structural characteristics of the fucoidan extracts were assessed. Only modest gains in yield were achieved beyond, min of extraction. Extended extraction was accompanied by undesirable declines in fucose and sulphate content, a substantial increase in the co-extraction of the contaminant laminarin, and significant reductions in the molecular weight of fucoidans. The results demonstrate that maximising fucoidan yield often comes at the cost of purity and structural integrity. It is important to tailor an extraction technique to best suit the desired applications of the final products. Open-vessel microwaves offer a highly efficient and controllable alternative to convective heating and merit further investigation, but techniques that better disrupt the cell wall complex whilst preserving fucoidan structure must also be pursued.

Material and Methods Two bonding agents were tested: a two-step total-etch system [Adper™ Single Bond 2, 3 M ESPE (SB) ] and a universal system [Adper™ Single Bond Universal, 3 M ESPE (SU) ]. Square-shaped specimens were prepared and assigned into 4 groups (n= 5) : SB and SU (control groups – no laser irradiation) and SB-L and SU-L [SB and SU laser (L) – irradiated groups]. DC was assessed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance. Additional uncured resin samples (≈ 3. 0 µL, n= 5) of each adhesive were also scanned for final DC calculation. For WS/WSB tests, similar specimens (n= 10) were prepared and measured by monitoring the mass changes after dehydration/water storage cycles. For both tests, adhesive fluids were dropped into standardized Teflon molds (6. 0 × 6. 0 × 1. 0 mm), irradiated with a 970 -nm laser diode, and then polymerized with an LED-curing unit (1 W/cm 2). Results Laser irradiation immediately before photopolymerization increased the DC (%) of the tested adhesives: SB-L>SB>SU-L>SU. For WS/WSB (μg/mm 3), only the dentin bonding system (DBS) was a significant factor (<b>p</b> <b>SU.</b> Conclusion Irradiation with a laser diode improved the degree of conversion of all tested simplified dentin bonding systems, with no impact on water sorption and solubility...|$|R
