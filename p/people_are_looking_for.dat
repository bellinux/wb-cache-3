2500|$|Visconti, who {{accepted}} an interviewer's {{suggestion that he}} was Bowie's [...] "voice on earth", commented on the album to the international press and provided insights into the individual tracks. The songs cover {{a wide spread of}} subjects and are largely observational: most probe the mind-sets of different individuals. [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] is about a high school shooter. [...] "I'd Rather Be High" [...] related the story of a Second World War soldier. Visconti described the material as [...] "extremely strong and beautiful". He added [...] "if <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> classic Bowie they'll find it on this album, if they're looking for innovative Bowie, new directions, they're going to find that on this album too." [...] Visconti commented that 29 tracks were recorded for the album and suggested that some of the material left out of The Next Day could appear on a subsequent record. Visconti speculated that Bowie could return to the studio to produce a new album later in 2013, but this did not happen.|$|E

[...] And in the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: [...] "I could not go on with being a Catholic... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation." [...] Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: [...] "The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him." ...|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} a price floor is minimum wage laws; in this case, {{employees}} are the suppliers of labor {{and the company is}} the consumer.

A minimum wage above the equilibrium wage would induce employers to hire fewer workers as well as allow more people to enter the labor market; the result is a surplus in the amount of labor available.
