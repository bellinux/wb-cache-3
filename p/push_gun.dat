40|$|In {{response}} to doctors <b>pushing</b> <b>gun</b> control agendas on patients, Florida enacted the Firearm Owners Privacy Act. The law, {{upheld by the}} Eleventh Circuit in Wollschlaeger v. Governor of Florida, protects patients from intrusive lines of inquiry unrelated to their treatment and from discrimination due to firearm ownership. While patients in Florida benefit greatly from the Firearm Owners Privacy Act, this note argues for more specific language in the law, which would parallel language in the Florida Mental Health Act (“Baker Act”). The proposed changes would limit inquiries into firearm ownership to instances {{where there is a}} substantial likelihood of serious bodily harm to the patient or others...|$|R

2500|$|Kucinich <b>pushed</b> for <b>gun</b> control, in the U.S. Congress as well {{as during}} his time as a city councilman.

What {{seemed to be a}} minor injury turned gangrenous, and seven weeks later, on May 9, 1880, Brown died from the wound. Brown was buried at Toronto Necropolis. Bennett was hanged for the crime.|$|R
50|$|Strung {{out along}} the coulée’s edge, silhouetted against the sky, the militia fired {{a vast amount of}} {{ammunition}} at their enemies, succeeding mostly in showering tree branches across the ravine, but when the artillerymen <b>pushed</b> their <b>guns</b> to the coulée’s edge to try to fire down at the concealed enemy, they suffered heavy casualties.The only targets the militia could clearly see were the enemy’s tethered horses. They slaughtered about fifty of these.|$|R
6000|$|At last I saw a chance, {{and crowded}} {{in for the}} hole; {{and in order to}} be {{beforehand}} with a big man who just then came in, I <b>pushed</b> my <b>gun</b> violently through the hole; upon which the hook-nosed man cried out, thinking I was going to shoot him. But at last he took the gun, turned it end for end, clicked the trigger three times, and then said, [...] "one dollar." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1885 the New Zealand Government bought ten Armstrong BL 8-inch and {{thirteen}} Armstrong BL 6-inch guns on disappearing carriages. The disappearing gun was {{the very}} latest in military technology in the 1880s. It was [...] "disappearing" [...] because as it fired, the recoil <b>pushed</b> the <b>gun</b> back underground where it could be reloaded under cover. The total costs of this artillery plus the costs of installation including land, emplacements, magazines and barracks was about £160,000.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Second Division has a war {{memorial}} on {{the road}} from Bapaume to Péronne. It {{is the only one}} of the five Australian division memorials initiated by members of the division. The base was erected in 1925.

It had on its top an Australian soldier thrusting his bayonet through a German eagle. The sculptor was Charles Web Gilbert.|$|R
5000|$|... 10:30 pm, 3100 W. Vineyard Rd, Phoenix. While {{walking home}} from a Phoenix city park at night, two sisters (one of whom was clearly pregnant), were {{approached}} by Goudeau who was armed with a gun. He sexually assaulted one of the sisters while <b>pushing</b> the <b>gun</b> into the other sister's pregnant belly. He was arrested, one year later, when DNA evidence found on the women matched his profile. This was the breakthrough {{that led to the}} arrest in the Baseline Killer investigation.|$|R
60|$|With which Mother--who {{was rapidly}} {{becoming}} almost impolite in her indignation over this uninvited visit {{from a person}} whom she couldn't find it in her heart to like--seized the muzzle of the <b>gun,</b> <b>pushed</b> it down, and stood glowering at the sheriff, her arms akimbo.|$|R

50|$|Some {{conspiracy}} theories have {{alleged that the}} shooting was a hoax and a false flag operation staged by the United States government. Others claim the attack is being used by politicians to <b>push</b> through new <b>gun</b> control legislation, or to otherwise persecute gun owners and survivalists.|$|R
6000|$|... "Horse {{and foot}} fell {{back before the}} attack. Then they turned the cannon on the ramparts, and thus secured {{possession}} of the Po gate, and, <b>pushing</b> on, the <b>guns</b> helping them, drove the Austrians from the houses they occupied, and so opened communications with the French cavalry.|$|R
50|$|The killer {{attempts}} to shoot Eve {{while she is}} on stage, but Jimmy spots the pistol and <b>pushes</b> the <b>gun</b> away just in time. Dr. Zodiac is revealed to be Fred Rhadini. While all eyes were on Eve, he sneaked into the wings, ran below the stage, and used the elevator in the sphinx to re-emerg on stage and attempt to kill Eve. Charlie reveals that Rhadini used a wand with a spring trigger to fire the arrow that killed Abdul. He then stabbed himself {{to divert attention from}} himself as a suspect.|$|R
5000|$|In an August 2012 Singapore {{performance}} on the tour to support the band's then-new album Thirteen, Mustaine expressed his views of President Obama and recent gun violence in the United States, making an accusation that Obama had staged the mass shooting in Aurora, CO and the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting in order to <b>push</b> a <b>gun</b> control agenda, while engaging the audience during onstage banter in between songs. Mustaine also criticized the 'Fast and Furious' arms scandal {{and said that the}} country looked like it was turning into [...] "Nazi America." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Nevada Daily Mail reports Matthew was at {{the cash}} {{register}} that night but [...] "the proprietor dove into the kitchen and lay on the tile floor with his hands over his eyes as soon as Sonny Pinto and two out-of-town torpedoes known only as Cisco and Benny came in the side door blasting. The next thing he knew, Pete [...] "The Greek" [...] Diopoulis, a Gallo bodyguard, was <b>pushing</b> a <b>gun</b> in his face and pulling the trigger but only clicks came out because it had been emptied trying to save Joey." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{distance}} {{being too}} great for a shot, and the bushes beyond the spot {{which he had}} reached being too thin to conceal him, Robin lay flat down, and began to advance through the long grass after the fashion of a snake, <b>pushing</b> his <b>gun</b> before him. It was a slow and tedious process, but Robin's spirit was patient and persevering. He screwed himself, as it were, to within sixty yards of the flock, and then fired both barrels almost simultaneously. Seven dead birds remained behind when the affrighted flock took wing.|$|R
50|$|A {{surface-to-air missile}} (SAM), or ground-to-air missile (GTAM), is a missile {{designed}} to be launched from the ground to destroy aircraft or other missiles. It is one type of antiaircraft system; in modern armed forces, missiles have replaced most other forms of dedicated antiaircraft weapons, with anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> <b>pushed</b> into specialized roles.|$|R
50|$|The US {{attitude}} to guns generally perplexes {{those in other}} developed countries, who cannot understand why the American public have not <b>pushed</b> for harsher <b>gun</b> control measures {{in the face of}} mass shootings. Critics contrast the US reaction to terrorism given how few deaths it causes, with their high death rates from non-terror related gun crime.|$|R
2500|$|At 17:30 that evening, the {{remaining}} {{troops of the}} 393rd and 394th Infantry Regiments of the 99th Infantry Division withdrew from their positions around the Baracken crossroads, {{just north of the}} twin towns of Krinkelt and Rocherath, and retreated along a boggy trail about [...] toward Elsenborn Ridge. American lines collapsed {{on either side of the}} Regiment. [...] "We were sticking out like a finger there", Butler said. Increasingly isolated, the unit was running low on ammunition. A resourceful platoon leader found an abandoned German ammo dump. [...] "We stopped the tail end of that <b>push</b> with <b>guns</b> and ammunition taken off the German dead", Butler said.|$|R
5000|$|As White {{pretended to}} look, Mackenzie reached a {{junction}} in the road. Turning {{the steering wheel}} violently one way then the other, he asked,"which way, left or right"? causing the gunman to look toward the road ahead. White saw the gun drop a few inches and realised this was his chance; he <b>pushed</b> the <b>gun</b> forwards and Mackenzie stamped on the brake. They screeched to a halt outside The Junction Chip Shop in Rainworth. The gun went off, grazing White's hand. MacKenzie {{fell out of the}} driver's seat, banging his head on the road. He staggered to his feet and ran towards the fish and chip shop screaming for help.|$|R
50|$|Oz is {{no longer}} suspected, as Mr. Platt was killed during the day. He meets up with Debbie and notices her black eye. Buffy and Willow seek out Debbie, and try in vain to talk sense into her. Meanwhile, Angel breaks free from his shackles, and Pete finds Oz in the library. Pete turns into a monster and starts to beat up Oz for talking to Debbie. The sun sets and the tables are turned when Oz becomes a werewolf. Buffy tries to tranquilize Oz, but Debbie <b>pushes</b> the <b>gun</b> away and Buffy ends up {{shooting}} Giles. Buffy chases after Pete while Willow and Faith pursue Oz.|$|R
5000|$|At 17:30 that evening, the {{remaining}} {{troops of the}} 393rd and 394th Infantry Regiments of the 99th Infantry Division withdrew from their positions around the Baracken crossroads, {{just north of the}} twin towns of Krinkelt and Rocherath, and retreated along a boggy trail about 4 km toward Elsenborn Ridge. American lines collapsed {{on either side of the}} Regiment. [...] "We were sticking out like a finger there", Butler said. Increasingly isolated, the unit was running low on ammunition. A resourceful platoon leader found an abandoned German ammo dump. [...] "We stopped the tail end of that <b>push</b> with <b>guns</b> and ammunition taken off the German dead", Butler said.|$|R
50|$|Newman {{took part}} in the Million Mom March in 2000, <b>pushing</b> for {{stronger}} <b>gun</b> control. She was appointed to the Missouri House in 2009 after Steve Brown pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges and resigned his seat. In 2015, Newman introduced a bill in the Missouri House to regulate firearms as strictly as the state regulates abortion, by adding a 72-hour waiting period.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of June 18, 1954, Patterson was working in his law office in the Coulter Building in Phenix City. As he left at about 9 p.m., he walked to his car, which was parked in an alley off Fifth Avenue next to the Elite Cafe. An {{unidentified}} assailant walked up to him, <b>pushed</b> a <b>gun</b> {{in his mouth and}} shot him three times. One cartridge was found wedged in an opening where two or three front teeth had been knocked out. Patterson was well aware that his life was in danger, commenting just one night earlier to a church group, [...] "I have only a 100-to-1 chance of ever being sworn in as attorney general." ...|$|R
5000|$|Matthew was at {{the cash}} {{register}} that night but fled to the kitchen and missed the entire attack; he later claimed no prior knowledge of the attack and was not charged in relation to it. As The Nevada Daily Mail reports: [...] "the proprietor dove into the kitchen and lay on the tile floor with his hands over his eyes as soon as Sonny Pinto and two out-of-town torpedoes known only as Cisco and Benny came in the side door blasting. The next thing he knew, Pete [...] "The Greek" [...] Diopoulis, a Gallo bodyguard, was <b>pushing</b> a <b>gun</b> in his face and pulling the trigger but only clicks came out because it had been emptied trying to save Joey." ...|$|R
5000|$|On July 28, 1932, President Hoover {{ordered the}} Secretary of War to {{disperse}} the protesters.

[...] When the veterans moved back into it, police drew their revolvers and shot at the veterans, two of whom, William Hushka and Eric Carlson, died later.|$|R
25|$|On {{the north}} flank, Rüdiger {{deployed}} nine squadrons {{in the first}} line and five squadrons in the second line. Against the Russian horsemen, Milhaud had Piré's division (minus Subervie's brigade) in the first line, Gabriel Gaspard Montelégier's brigade {{in the second and}} Denis Éloi Ludot's in the third. Successive charges by Piré and Montelégier broke Rüdiger's squadrons and chased them off the battlefield with the French light cavalry in pursuit. Milhaud directed Montelégier to deal with the Russian infantry while sending Ludot on a sweep to block Pahlen's escape route. Without its supporting cavalry, Pahlen's infantry battalions were compelled to form into square formation to defend against cavalry. Antoine Drouot aggressively <b>pushed</b> 36 <b>guns</b> from the French Guard artillery into the front line where they pummeled the Russians.|$|R
50|$|Following the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., Johnson signed {{two major}} gun control laws. In {{addition}} to the assassinations, Johnson's <b>push</b> for <b>gun</b> control was also motivated by mass shootings {{such as the one}} perpetrated by Charles Whitman. Johnson signed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 shortly after Robert Kennedy's death. On October 22, 1968, Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, {{one of the largest and}} farthest-reaching federal gun control laws in American history. The measure prohibited convicted felons, drug users, and the mentally ill from purchasing handguns and raised record-keeping and licensing requirements. Johnson had sought to require the licensing of gun owners and the registration of all firearms, but could not convince Congress to pass a stronger bill.|$|R

6000|$|On {{this day}} another long {{exercise}} {{at the gun}} was had, and Walter learned more thoroughly than ever how the charge was raised from the ammunition hoists to the <b>gun,</b> <b>pushed</b> into place by the mechanical rammer, and how the gun was moved up, down, or sideways by merely touching this button or that wheel or lever. [...] "It's wonderful!" [...] he observed. [...] "I suppose it would be next to impossible to move such a big gun by hand." ...|$|R
50|$|When Police Officer Diaz (Adriana Pascual) {{knocks on}} the door, Taylor tries to stop her from {{entering}} the house. When she does, she begins to search the ground floor and, on finding nothing, goes to search upstairs. Taylor again attempts to convince her {{that there is no}} issue, and is forced to remain downstairs whilst Diaz searches the upper floor. Diaz does not enter the bathroom, and therefore does not discover Jenny's body, but Taylor stabs her in the neck as she turns to leave. The two struggle silently, with Taylor <b>pushing</b> Diaz's <b>gun</b> down into its holster to protect himself. He is interrupted by an apparition of Jenny standing at the door, giving Diaz time to draw her weapon and shoot him. The two separate, and fall against opposite sides of the room, where they sit against the walls, dying.|$|R
5000|$|The Lenape had {{previously}} traded with Simon Girty the Elder, and they recognized {{his wife and}} children. One tradition says the Lenape sincerely believed that John Turner {{was the man who}} had killed Simon Girty the Elder in order to take his house, land, and family. Other traditions say that the Lenape recognized him as Girty's avenger and killer of [...] "The Fish", or that they thought that John Turner had badly beaten an Indian. For whichever reason, Chief Jacobs (Toweah) of the Lenape and his council condemned John Turner to be burned at the stake. The Muncey Lenape <b>pushed</b> red-hot <b>gun</b> barrels into, and through, John Turner's body. John Turner endured three hours of ritualistic torture before he was scalped, and a young Lenape struck a tomahawk into his brain, killing him, all in front of his wife, stepchildren, and newborn baby.|$|R
