40|$|<b>Protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> is {{routinely}} used after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) {{to restore the}} patient's baseline coagulatory state. However, adverse reactions are encountered, and alternative means to neutralize heparin are, therefore, necessary. The Heparin Removal Device (HRD) constitutes an extracorporeal circuit that allows ex vivo deheparinization by mean of a polycationic ligand that binds heparin molecules. This paper presents the setup of the HRD circuit. It {{is illustrated by the}} report of a 68 -year-old man with a known severe crustacean allergy. The patient (78 kg, 170 cm) was admitted for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It was decided that the HRD would be used as a precaution {{in order to avoid the}} risks of using <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The CPB time and aortic crossclamp time were 70 and 40 min, respectively. At the end of CPB, the device was inserted and processing started. Activated coagulation time values were monitored over a 130 min period and diminished from 480 to 300 s after 45 min, 220 s after 90 min, and settled at 150 s. Haemostasis was acceptable and processing stopped. The operation was terminated and the patient transferred to the intensive care unit. Clinical evolution was excellent, with minimal postoperative bleeding.

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{fabrication}} of bio-stimuli responsive micro- and nano-carriers for drug delivery applications. In particular, {{the objective of this}} work is to investigate the possibility of using polypeptide drug protamine and glycosaminoglycan drug, chondroitin sulphate as stimuli responsive components in the design of bioresponsive carriers. These biopolymers are biocompatible, biodegradable and clinically used for various applications. Two designs that incorporate these stimuli responsive components have been studied in this thesis. The first design involves hollow micro and nanocapsules that have been fabricated by incorporating the stimuli responsive biopolymers as wall components. Upon exposure to biological triggers, these hollow capsules disintegrate releasing the encapsulated drug. The second design consists of mesoporous silica nanoparticles-biopolymer hybrids. The mesoporous silica nanoparticles act as a gated scaffold that carries the drug molecules. The mesopores of these drug loaded nanoparticles are then blocked with the bioresponsive polymers. Upon exposure to the bio-triggers which consist of enzymes over-expressed in conditions such as cancer and inflammation, these “molecular gates” disintegrate allowing the drug trapped in the mesoporous silica nanoparticles to escape into the surroundings. The thesis has been divided into five chapters: Chapter	 1 is an	introduction to	bio-responsive drug	delivery. The broad classification of stimuli used in responsive drug delivery systems are visited. A brief discussion on the various types of bio-stimuli that can be utilized in designing bio-responsive systems is also included in this chapter. Chapter 2 defines the aims and scope of the thesis which is followed by an overview of the various design parameters involved in the fabrication of systems presented in this work. The major stimuli responsive components and the architectures incorporating these elements are discussed in detail here. A literature review of the various carrier designs involved in the study is provided, with special emphasis on stimuli responsive drug delivery. Chapter 3 gives an overview of the various materials and methods involved in this work. A summary of the various characterisation techniques used in the thesis is also included along with the details of the experiments that has been carried out. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the results and discussions of the thesis. The chapter has been divided into six sections: Chapter 4. 1 deals with the fabrication of a hollow microcapsule system incorporated with protamine as the stimuli responsive element for bio-responsive drug delivery. The hollow microcapsules that were fabricated by Layer by Layer assembly of protamine and heparin display pH responsive variations in permeability and disintegrate {{in the presence of the}} enzyme trypsin that degrades protamine. The biologically triggered enzyme responsive drug release from these microcapsules is also demonstrated using enzymes secreted by colorectal cancer cells. Chapter 4. 2 presents nanocapsules fabricated from protamine and heparin. The pH and enzyme responsive drug release of this systems is evaluated in vitro. A wall crosslinking strategy has been tested to control the rate of drug release under physiological pH conditions in the absence of the trigger. The cellular interactions of these nanocapsules loaded with an anticancer drug, doxorubicin was studied using cancer cell lines. Bioavailability studies of doxorubicin encapsulated in these nanocapsules were performed using a BALB/c mice model. Chapter 4. 3 discusses the fabrication of a hollow microcapsule system that can disintegrate in response to dual biological stimuli. These carriers have been fabricated by incorporating <b>protamine</b> and chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> as the wall components. Due to the incorporation of two separate stimuli responsive components in the walls, these capsules are expected to be sensitive to the enzymes trypsin or hyaluronidase I. Chapter 4. 4 deals with the fabrication of dual enzyme responsive hollow nanocapsule which can be targeted to deliver anticancer agents specifically inside cancer cells. The enzyme responsive elements integrated in the hollow nanocapsule walls can undergo degradation in presence of either of the enzymes trypsin or hyaluronidase I leading to the release of encapsulated drug molecules. The drug release from these nanocapsules which were crosslinked and functionalised with folic acid, is evaluated under varying conditions. The cellular uptake and intracellular drug delivery by these nanocapsules were evaluated in cervical cancer cell lines. Chapter 4. 5 introduces a mesoporous silica nanoparticle − protamine hybrid system. The system consists of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle support whose mesopores are capped with protamine which effectively blocks the outward diffusion of the drug molecules from the mesopores of the mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Upon exposure to the enzyme trigger, the protamine cap disintegrates opening up the molecular gates and releasing the entrapped drug molecules. The drug release from this system is evaluated in different release conditions in the presence and absence of the enzyme trigger. The ability of these particles to deliver hydrophobic anticancer drugs and induce cell death in colorectal cancer cells has also been demonstrated. Chapter 4. 6 discusses the fabrication of another mesoporous silica nanoparticles based bio-responsive drug delivery system consisting of mesoporous silica and chondroitin sulphate hybrid nanoparticles. The ability of the system to modulate drug release in response to hyaluronidase I is demonstrated. By utilizing a cervical cancer cell line, we have demonstrated the cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of hydrophobic drugs encapsulated in these particles. Interestingly, the system showed ability to enhance the anticancer activity of hydrophobic drug curcumin in these cancer cells. Chapter 5 gives a summary of the general conclusions drawn from the thesis work...|$|R

40|$|When citrate plasma and serum of {{the same}} {{individual}} were tested simultaneously in the C 1 q-binding assay (C 1 qBA), binding levels in plasma {{were found to be}} 90 - 400 % higher than in serum. The difference in 125 I-Clq binding was due to the presence of fibrinogen in plasma. It was shown that complex formation between fibrinogen and 125 I-Clq occurs and that this complex precipitates in the presence of polyethylene glycol, leading to the false positive results in the ClqBA. When heparin plasma was used to the assay, heparin itself also induced an increase in 125 I-C 1 q binding that was not based on the presence of immune complexes. The effect of both fibrinogen and heparin could be inhibited by addition of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Therefore, pretreatment of plasma with <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> makes it possible to use plasma samples for a reliable determination of C 1 q-binding levels.

40|$|IT {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that malignant tumours depend on a labile coagulative factor for their invasive growth (O'Meara and Jackson, 1958; O'Meara, 1958). This factor, which is elaborated by the malignant cells, diffuses out into the tissue spaces {{in advance of the}} tumour and converts the fibrinogen of the interstitial fluid to fibrin. Fibrinolysis does not take place and the unresolved fibrin undergoes organisation. In this way a vascular stroma is prepared for the tumour which enables it to establish, and maintain, its autonomous growth. <b>Protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> was found to inhibit the coagulative factor in vitro (Thornes and O'Meara, 1961) and it was considered that protamine might be of value in the treatment of malignant disease.

We {{have examined}} the evolution of bacterial resistance to <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> and the resulting effects on fitness and physiology, {{with the objective of}} increasing knowledge about mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Methods: Spontaneous, protamine-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (i. e. Salmonella Typhimurium) LT 2 mutants were isolated on agarose plates containing <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Resistance mutations were identified using transposon insertions and DNA sequencing. Peptide susceptibility was determined by broth dilution tests and antibiotic susceptibility using Etests. Fitness was determined as log-phase growth rates. Growth-compensated strains were isolated by serial passage through population bottlenecks followed by visual screening for large colonies. Results: Protamine-resistant mutants appeared at a rate of 2. 31027 /cell/generation. These mutants were 2 – 20 times more resistant to protamine than the parental strain and less susceptible to several other antimi-crobials, including colistin, gentamicin, lactoferricin and human defensin HNP- 1. The resistance mutations were mapped to genes involved in haem biosynthesis and respiration, and were associated with a reduction in bac-terial fitness. Some mutants could, in the absence of protamine, be evolved to higher fitness by acquiring second-site compensatory mutations...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Protamine sulphate-induced {{aggregation}} of soluble fibrin causes {{an increase}} of turbidity in the plasma sample, which can be measured by means of kinetic turbidimetry. A method was developed which is sufficiently sensitive for the determination of soluble fibrin in plasma without iüterfering with the sensitivity for fibrinogen. The performance of the assay was studied by analysing plasma samples with high concentrations of fibrinogen and soluble fibrin at different pH values, at different concentrations of plasma and <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate,</b> and using different wavelengths and analysis times. Measurement of thrombin-induced fibrinogen-fibrin-transformation by the developed turbidimetric method, gave results that correlated well {{with the release of}} fibrinopeptide A. The new <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> method for turbidimetric dclcrmination of soluble fibrin is charactcrizcd by its practicability, rapid availability of reproducible, quantitative results, and ils economy ofreagenls and time in single and serial analysis.

40|$|In the {{activated}} complement system, vitronectin (complement S-protein) {{occupies the}} metastable membrane binding {{site of the}} nascent precursor complex C 5 b- 7, so that the newly formed SC 5 b- 7 is unable to insert into cell membranes. Some evidence also indicates that vitronectin limits on-going membrane-associated pore formation by inhibiting C 9 polymerization. It has been assumed that these two stages of terminal complement complex (TCC) inhibition take place through charge interactions between the heparin-binding region of vitronectin and homologous cysteine-rich sequences of the late complement proteins C 6, C 7, C 8 and C 9. We examined SC 5 b- 7 formation and inhibition of C 9 binding in the TCC using separate haemolytic assays. The mode of action of vitronectin in these assays was compared with two 15 mer peptides which span residues 348 - 379 of the heparin-binding region, and a heparin-affinity polypeptide, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The results showed that vitronectin acts predominantly through SC 5 b- 7 production with a lesser effect on the inhibition of C 9 lytic pore formation. In contrast, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> did not prevent C 5 b- 7 membrane attachment, but was a potent inhibitor of C 9 -mediated lysis. The peptides did not inhibit C 5 b- 7 membrane insertion and only one affected C 9 binding.

The present study investigated controlled-release implants for prevention of the calcification of glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium in a rat subdermal model. Either Al 3 + and Fe 3 + (inhibitors of the growth and dissolution rate of hydroxyapatite crystals), levamisole (alkaline phosphatase inhibitor) or <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (charge modifier) were individually incorporated into various polymeric carriers (either silicone rubber. Polyurethane or silicone rubber-polyurethane copolymer). Polymeric implants were evaluated for in vitro release kinetics, which revealed that sustained drug release was obtained from 21 d to more than 90 d from various drug matrices. In vivo efficacy was studied by co-implanting the polymeric delivery systems with glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium for 21 d using a subdermal rat model; glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium calcium levels were quantitated by atomic absorption spectroscopy in the explanted tissues. Fe 3 + and Al 3 + polymeric implants were the most effective for inhibiting deposition of calcium mineral. Al 3 + demonstrated 82 % inhibition of calcification compared to controls and Fe 3 + resulted in 80 % inhibition of calcification. Specific histologie staining methods showed that Fe 3 + and Al 3 + were localized within the devitalized cells of the explanted glutaraldehyde pretreated bovine pericardium. No adverse effects on somatic growth or recipient bone morphology were noted following controlled-release drug administration.

40|$|Basic {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (bFGF) and its specific receptors have diverse roles {{on a variety}} of cell types, such as the induction of vascular smooth-muscle cell proliferation which contributes to restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty. bFGF is also known to interact with heparan sulphate proteoglycans present on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. In this study, the binding of 125 I-bFGF to human aortic smooth-muscle cells was investigated. 125 I-bFGF binding to these cells was reversible and saturable. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of two distinct binding sites: a high-affinity receptor (Kd= 38 +/- 7 pM; 1480 +/- 220 sites/cell) and a low-affinity non-saturable binding site (Kd= 8. 0 +/- 2. 0 nM). Pretreatment of the cells with heparinase resulted in a large reduction of 125 I-bFGF binding to its low-affinity receptors, suggesting that they are heparin-like molecules. The specificity of the low- and high-affinity binding sites for bFGF was determined with acidic FGF, platelet-derived growth factor-BB and epidermal growth factor, which did not compete for 125 I-bFGF binding. Expression of FGF receptor isoforms analysed by reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed the presence of only the type- 1 receptor. Binding to low-affinity binding sites was antagonized by heparin, suramin, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> and platelet factor 4. Unexpectedly, these molecules also reduced the binding of 125 I-bFGF to its high-affinity sites. Consistent with these results, heparin, suramin, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> and platelet factor 4 inhibited bFGF-induced proliferation of human aortic smooth-muscle cells. Heparin abrogated bFGF-induced release of tissue-type plasminogen activator by these cells. These observations suggest that the interaction of bFGF with human aortic smooth-muscle cells is different from that described for other cells such as endothelial cells, in which heparin acts as a potentiating factor of the mitogenic activity of bFGF...|$|E

During a clinical trial of these protamine derivatives another side effect became evident, namely tetany. This paper reports our findings of the effect of prolothan G and prolothan A on calcium metabolism. METHODS We have used two forms of prolothan: Prolothan G (Evans) is an aqueous solution of protamine standardised to contain nitrogen 2 - 5 % weight in volume with dextrose 40 % weight in volume...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} adverse effect of antithrombotic treatment is {{the occurrence of}} bleeding. In the case of severe bleeding in a patient who uses anticoagulant agents or when a patient on anticoagulants needs to undergo an urgent invasive procedure, {{it may be useful}} to reverse anticoagulant treatment. Conventional anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists may be neutralized by administration of vitamin K or prothrombin complex concentrates, whereas heparin and heparin derivatives can be counteracted by <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The anti-hemostatic effect of aspirin and other antiplatelet strategies can be corrected by the administration of platelet concentrate and/or desmopressin, if needed. Recently, a new generation of anticoagulants with a greater specificity towards activated coagulation factors as well as new antiplatelet agents have been introduced and these drugs show promising results in clinical studies. A limitation of these new agents may be the lack of an appropriate strategy to reverse the effect if a bleeding event occurs, although experimental studies show hopeful results for some of these agent...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{experimental}} model of inducing interstitial cystitis through intravesical instillation of a polymeric solution containing the NO donor S-nitrousglutathione (GSNO) and to compare it to the experimental interstitial cystitis induced by vesical instillation of protamine and potassium chloride. Methods: A total of 40 female Wistar rats were used and divided into four groups: 1 – ten rats treated with saline solution + GSNO; 2 – ten rats treated with saline solution + polymeric solution (without GNSO); 3 – ten rats treated with <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> + KCl; 4 – ten rats treated with <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> + GSNO. The rats received one application (five animals in each group) or three applications (five animals in each group) of the corresponding substance through intravesical instillation, and after six days (five animals in each group) or nine days (five animals in each group) they were euthanized and their bladders were removed for macroscopic evaluation and histological study. Results: In the macroscopic evaluation edema and hyperemia of the mucosa were observed in 2 (22 %) animals in Group 1, in no (0 %) animal in Group 2, in 10 (100 %) animals in Group 3, and in 5 (50 %) animals in Group 4. In the protamine + KCl group and in saline + GSNO, similar effects were observed in the bladder wall. The animals in Group 2 (saline + polymeric solution) showed significantly less vascular congestion compared to the other groups after 9 days of the instillation (p = 0. 0035). Significant fibrosis was observed in Groups 3 and 4, 6 days (p = 0. 3781) and 9 days (p = 0. 0459) after instillations, when compared to controls (Group 2). All groups presented neutrophilic infiltrate of variable intensity, 6 days after instillations (p = 0. 7277). After 9 days, there was a regression of the infiltrate, with no evidence of accentuated neutrophilic reaction in all the groups (p = 0. 2301). Conclusions: The inflammatory response to bladder instillation with an aqueous solution of S-nitrousglutathione was very similar to that induced by bladder instillation of protamine and KCl. Instillation of an aqueous solution of S-nitrousglutathione can be considered a new model for experimental induction of interstitial cystitis...|$|E
40|$|A micropreparative {{electrophoresis}} {{system for}} purifying the major staphylocidal fractions of cationic proteins from rabbit polymorphonuclear leucocytes is described. The most staphylocidal fraction prepared {{is also the}} most cationic and contains two bands migrating immediately behind <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> on analytical acid gel electrophoresis. SDS gel electrophoresis indicates that these proteins have low molecular weights between 3, 500 and 14, 400. The staphylocidal activity of the fraction is affected {{in the same manner as}} a crude extract of rabbit PMN granules by iron compounds, respiratory inhibitors, and compounds affecting energy transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. It is stable to heating up to 80 degrees and amino acid analysis shows that it contains 24 % arginine. Electron microscopy of staphylococcal spheroplasts treated with the purified fraction or with the crude extract shows that they both have a very marked "blebbing" and distorting action on the double membrane. Comparisons are made between the action of the purified fraction and protamine, and it is concluded that they have very similar, although not identical, properties and actions on staphylococci...|$|E
40|$|Magnetically {{labelled}} {{cells are}} used for in vivo cell tracking by MRI, used for the clinical translation of cell-base therapies. Studies involving magnetic labelled cells may include separation of labelled cells, targeted delivery and controlled release of drugs, contrast enhanced MRI and magnetic hyperthermia for the in situ ablation of tumours. Dextran-coated super-paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) ferumoxides are used clinically as an MR contrast agents primarily for hepatic imaging. The material is also widely used for in vitro cell labelling, as are other SPIO-based particles. Our results on the uptake by human cancer cell lines of ferumoxides indicate that electroporation {{in the presence of}} <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (PS) results in rapid high uptake of SPIO nanoparticles (SPIONs) by parenchymal tumour cells without significant impairment of cell viability. Quantitative determination of cellular iron uptake performed by colorimetric assay is in agreement with data from the literature. These results on intracellular iron content together with the intracellular distribution of SPIONs by magnetic force microscopy (MFM) following in vitro uptake by parenchymal tumour cells confirm the potential of this technique for clinical tumour cell detection and destruction...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{parvovirus}} readily produced plaques when inoculated into 60 ~ confluent, actively growing bovine embryonic lung ceils. Incorporation ofDEAE-dextran, MgC 12 and DMSO in the agarose {{overlay medium}} {{was found to}} improve plaque production, especially with the latter chemical. In contrast, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulphate</b> inhibited plaque development. It was found that plaque titration and plaque inhibition tests could be conveniently carried out in 24 -well cell culture plates, using an agarose overlay containing DMSO, DEAE-dextran and foetal calf serum. The procedures were highly sensitive, when compared with other established techniques; Plaque titration and inhibition tests provide accurate and sensitive tools for quantifying cytopathic viruses and their antibodies. Bovine parvovirus (BPV), however, shows little ability to produce plaques in confluent cell cultures, as the cells do not provide adequate levels of the DNA-ass~ciated helper functions which are essential for parvovirus replication (Siegl, 1976). Such functions are only found in actively multiplying cultures. Although plaque production by BPV has been reported by Bates et al. (1974) and Lubeck & Johnson (1976), these authors gave only brief details of the procedures used. The present pape...|$|E
