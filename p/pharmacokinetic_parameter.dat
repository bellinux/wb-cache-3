5000|$|Cmax is {{the maximum}} (or peak) serum {{concentration}} that a drug achieves in a specified compartment or test {{area of the}} body after the drug has been administrated and before the administration of a second dose. [...] It is a standard measurement in pharmacokinetics. Cmax {{is the opposite of}} Cmin, which is the minimum (or trough) concentration that a drug achieves after dosing.

40|$|Uncertainty {{exists as}} to the most {{suitable}} <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> sets for propofol target-controlled infusions (TCI). The <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> sets currently employed are clearly not universally applicable, particularly when patient attributes {{differ from those of}} the subjects who participated in the original research from which the models were derived. Increasing evidence indicates that the pharmacokinetic parameters of propofol can be scaled allometrically as well as in direct proportion to lean body mass (LBM). Appraisal of hitherto published studies suggests that an allometrically scaled <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> set may be applicable {{to a wide range of}} patients ranging from children to obese adults. On the other hand, there is evidence that propofol pharmacokinetic parameters, scaled linearly to LBM, provide improved dosing in normal and obese adults. The 'Schnider' <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> set that has been programmed into commercially available TCI pumps cannot be employed at present for morbidly obese patients (body mass index > 40 kg/m 2), because of anomalous behaviour of the equation used to calculate LBM, resulting in administration of excessive amounts of propofol. Simulations of TCI using improved equations to calculate LBM indicate that the Schnider model delivers similar amounts of propofol to morbidly obese patients as do the allometrically scaled <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> sets. These hypotheses deserve further investigation.

40|$|We {{implemented}} a pharmacokinetics-based mathematical modeling technique using algebra to assist prescribers with point-of-care opioid dosing. We call this technique computational opioid prescribing (COP). Because population <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> values {{are needed to}} estimate drug dosing regimen designs for individual patients using COP, and those values are not readily available to prescribers because they exist scattered in the vast pharmacology literature, we estimated the population <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> values for 12 commonly prescribed opioids from various sources using the bootstrap resampling technique. Our results show that opioid dosing regimen design, evaluation, and modification is feasible using COP. We conclude that COP is a new technique for the quantitative assessment of opioid dosing regimen design evaluation and adjustment, which may help prescribers to manage acute and chronic pain at the point-of-care. Potential benefits include opioid dose optimization and minimization of adverse opioid drug events, leading to potential improvement in patient treatment outcomes and safety...|$|E
40|$|Meropenem {{is a new}} {{carbapenem}} antibiotic which {{possesses a}} broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against many of the pathogens responsible for pediatric bacterial infections. In order to define meropenem dosing guidelines for children, an escalating, single-dose, pharmacokinetic study at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg of body weight was performed. A total of 73 infants and children in four age groups were enrolled in the study: 2 to 5 months, 6 to 23 months, 2 to 5 years, and 6 to 12 years. The first patients enrolled were those in the oldest age group, who received the lowest dose. Subsequent enrollment was determined by decreasing age and increasing dose. Complete studies were performed on 63 patients. No age- or dose-dependent effects on <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates were noted. Mean <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates were as follows: half-life, 1. 13 +/- 0. 15 h; volume of distribution at steady state, 0. 43 +/- 0. 06 liters/kg; mean residence time, 1. 57 +/- 0. 11 h; clearance, 5. 63 +/- 0. 75 ml/min/kg; and renal clearance, 2. 53 +/- 0. 50 ml/min/liters kg. Approximately 55 % of the administered dose was recovered as unchanged drug in the urine during the 12 h after dosing. No significant side effects were reported in any patients. By using the derived <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates, a dose of 20 mg/kg given every 8 h will maintain plasma meropenem concentrations above the MIC that inhibits 90 % of strains tested for virtually all potentially susceptible bacterial pathogens...|$|E

40|$|Maximum a posteriori Bayesian (MAPB) <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> {{estimation}} is {{an accurate}} and flexible method of estimating individual pharmacokinetic parameters using individual blood concentrations and prior information. In the past decade, many studies have developed optimal sampling strategies to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters as accurately as possible using either multiple regression analysis or MAPB estimation. This has been done for many drugs, especially immunosuppressants and anticancer agents. Methods of development for optimal sampling strategies (OSS) are diverse and heterogeneous. This review provides a comprehensive overview of OSS development methodology using MAPB <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation, determines the transferability of published OSSs, and compares sampling strategies determined by MAPB estimation and multiple regression analysis. OSS development has the following components: 1) prior distributions; 2) reference value determination; 3) optimal sampling time identification; and 4) validation of the OSS. Published OSSs often lack all data necessary for the OSS to be clinically transferable. MAPB estimation is similar to multiple regression analysis in terms of predictive performance but superior in flexibility...|$|E

40|$|Pharmacokinetic {{studies are}} {{commonly}} analyzed using a two-stage approach {{where the first}} stage involves estimation of <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> for each subject separately and the second stage uses the individual parameter estimates for statistical inference. This two-stage approach is not applicable in sparse sampling situations where only one sample is available per subject. Nonlinear models are often applied to analyze pharmacokinetic data assessed in such serial sampling designs. Modelling approaches are suitable provided that {{the form of the}} true model is known, which is rarely the case in early stages of drug development. This paper presents an alternative approach to estimate <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> based on non-compartmental and asymptotic theory in the case of serial sampling when a drug is given as an intravenous bolus.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters of cephalosporine antibiotic ceftiofur in mammals and the respective body weight (W), using reported data from different authors. The parameters of interest: clearance (ClB), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) and elimination half-life were correlated across mammal species, as a function of W using the conventional allometric equation Y=aWb, where Y is the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter,</b> W is the body weight, a is the allometric coefficient (intercept) and b is the exponent that describes the relationship between the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> and W. Our estimates Cl= 0. 155 W 0. 82; Vss= 1. 01 W 1. 03, indicated that the increase in these parameters with W approximates a linear power relationship with slopes being specific for the investigated substance.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{determined}} the pharmacokinetic profile of vancomycin in premature Malaysian infants. A one-compartment infusion model with first-order elimination was fitted to serum vancomycin concentration data (n = 835 points) obtained retrospectively {{from the drug}} monitoring records of 116 premature newborn infants. Vancomycin concentrations were estimated by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Population and individual estimates of clearance and distribution volume and the factors which affected the variability observed for the values of these parameters were obtained using a population pharmacokinetic modeling approach. The predictive performance of the population model was evaluated by visual inspections of diagnostic plots and nonparametric bootstrapping with replacement. Dosing guidelines targeting a value of > 400 for the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (AUC 24 /MIC ratio) were explored using Monte Carlo simulation. Body size (weight), postmenstrual age, and smallfor- gestational-age status are important factors explaining the between-subject variability of vancomycin <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> values for premature neonates. The typical population parameter estimates of clearance and distribution volume for a 1 -kg premature appropriate-for-gestational-age neonate with a postmenstrual age of 30 weeks were 0. 0426 liters/h and 0. 523 liters, respectively. There was a 20 % reduction in clearance for small-for-gestational-age infants compared to the level for the appropriate-for-gestational-age control. Dosage regimens based on a priori target response values were formulated. In conclusion, the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> values for vancomycin in premature Malaysian neonates were estimated. Improved dosage regimens based on a priori target response values were formulated by incorporating body size, postmenstrual age, and small-for-gestational-age status, using Monte Carlo simulations with the modelestimated <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameter</b> values...|$|E

Methods: <b>Pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) / 5 -fluoro- 5, 6 -dihydrouracil (5 -FDHU) were examined in 133 cancer patients given a test dose of 5 -FU (250 mg/m 2) 2 weeks before starting capecitabine treatment. 5 -FU and 5 -FDHU plasma levels were measured, and related <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> were calculated. Toxicities were graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) criteria. Results: Some significant relationships between 5 -FU and 5 -FDHU <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>parameters</b> and capecitabine toxicities were found. Higher values of 5 -FU AUC 0 -∞ and t½β were found in patients who experienced grade ≥ 2 dermatitis, stomatitis and nausea during capecitabine chemotherapy. Moreover tmax higher than the threshold limit of 15 minutes were predictive for the risk of developing severe diarrhea after the first cycle of capecitabine therapy.
