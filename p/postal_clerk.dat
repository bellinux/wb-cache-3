2500|$|Workers {{in federal}} {{agencies}} had formed craft-based unions {{on the local}} level beginning in the early 1880s.

Mehmed Talaat had a powerful build and a dark complexion. His manners were gruff, which caused him to leave the civil preparatory school without a certificate after a conflict with his teacher. Without earning a degree, he joined the staff of the telegraph company as a <b>postal</b> <b>clerk</b> in Edirne. His salary was not high, so he worked after hours as a Turkish language teacher in the Alliance Israelite School which served the Jewish community of Edirne.|$|E

25|$|Wright and {{his family}} moved to Chicago in 1927.

When he was fired from the post office during the Great Depression, Wright was forced to go on relief in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the John Reed Club. As the club was dominated by the Communist Party, Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems ("We of the Red Leaves of Red Books", for example), for The New Masses and other left-wing periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.|$|E

500|$|Julian {{attended}} DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated {{nature of}} the town forced social humiliations.

25|$|A few {{theories}} {{have been offered}} for the hyphens and capitalization.
