Several Latin American countries have announced their intention to challenge the new EU trade policy by initiating a new WTO complaint. In this paper, we first propose an analysis of the two WTO arbitration awards that ruled against the initial EU tariff proposals. We show that the arbitrators’ awards are incomplete notably because they do not explain why CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) import unit values in the EU- 15 from MFN suppliers are much higher than FOB (Free on Board) export unit values in corresponding MFN countries adjusted by all relevant costs that should theoretically be added to transform FOB into CIF prices. One plausible explanation to this apparent paradox is that reported CIF prices include at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> rents generated by the tariff-rate quota policy. On this basis, we analyse the impacts of different MFN tariff levels on EU banana imports under contrasting hypotheses regarding, first whether the price gap between CIF and FOB unit values does include at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> rents, second whether banana exports to the EU from Western African ACP countries were constrained under the previous regime where a specific import quota were reserved to ACP countries.

Following that, the potential effects of TFCs on the achievement process of the goal of MSY harvesting conditions are explained. This paper shows that the implementation of TFCs, under the major principles defined by the European Commission, has an impact on both the total biomass growth and the time to reach the goal of MSY. The paper concludes that the level <b>of</b> reserved <b>quotas</b> for small scale fishermen does matter since reserving more quotas for small-scale fishermen reduces the time needed to achieve MSY...|$|R

The present paper attempts to review the course of muskox utilization in the Canadian Arctic and to tentatively assess its present as weIl as its future economic importance. Starting with the pre-European status of muskoxen in Canada, the drastic reduction in numbers resulting from the combined efforts of hide traders, whalers and expedition parties in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries, the impact of the legal protection and the recovery since 1917 are being described. Establishing muskox farms with semi-domesticated herds failed in Canada in the 1970 's.

These thousands of fishermen represent {{nearly half of}} the fishing sector in Chile (about 45%) but they struggle against the increasing industrial presence, especially in Valparaiso and other small cities like Bio-Bio, Chiloe, and Pelhullue. An increase in licensing checks in the region have severely impacted {{the men and women who}} have for decades used this industry to provide for their families and pass down their skills to the next generation. Licenses require that fishermen register their catch and never venture outside of their registered zone. Artisanal fishermen once had exclusive fishing rights to five nautical miles of the coastline—industrial-fishing boats could only trawl more than five miles out. However, this also created trouble as certain fish can only be caught farther out. Artisanal fishermen do not have access to this catch.
