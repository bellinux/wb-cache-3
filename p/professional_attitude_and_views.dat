In India so many different cultured peoples are living so it affects much more rather than other effects. Any large construction work involves many professions workers as Architects, Engineers, Construction Management Consultants, and labours. In addition, materials and equipment suppliers and vendors and other support groups are involved. Considering the <b>professional</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>views,</b> loss in productivity may result due to of failure of commitment from the groups.

40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the process of socialisation of teachers in the teaching profession. Drawing on socialisation theory the study sees the process of secondary socialisation in teacher preparation as building skills and enabling personal development. It was predicted that in the transition from the training institution to the first years of teaching, the degree of job satisfaction and commitment to teaching would be related to the degree of conflict experienced and that job satisfaction and commitment would be less for beginning teachers compared with that anticipated by trainees. Conflict was seen as appropriately measured by the difference between personal <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational values one the one hand <b>and</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational values perceived to be held by senior teachers on the other. Seventy-three final year trainee teachers at the Canberra College of Advanced Education and 47 beginning teachers in their first two years of teaching in Canberra primary and secondary schools, were selected as the sample. Previously validated instruments were used in a questionnaire. The findings clearly showed the existence of conflict between personal <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational values <b>and</b> the perceived <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational values of senior teachers. The difference in conflict between trainees and beginning teachers was small and tended to decrease. However, there was a marked increase in variance of conflict scores for women conpared to men. For women also, conflict was highly related to job satisfaction. Thc findings suggested that men tend to be more homogeneous in their adaptation to teaching and are more inclined to be satisfied and committed despite holding <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational values which conflict with those of senior teachers. The study discusses some of the imlications of the findings for the training institution and the importance, particularly for women teachers, of coping with conflict in the teaching situation...|$|R

In this study, we investigated {{the relations between}} attitudes regarding disclosure of bad news <b>and</b> global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> regarding medical care {{in a sample of}} medical students (n= 88). The Attitudes towards Breaking Bad News Questionnaire was developed and factor analysed to provide a valid and reliable instrument to measure attitudes regarding disclosure of bad news.

Regarding the global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes,</b> female students appear more humane-oriented than male students. Second, the relationship between global <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> regarding breaking bad news was examined by means of correlational and cluster analysis.

40|$|Women are {{underrepresented}} in leadership positions in Turkish work {{life as well}} as in other countries. There are some social and personal barriers preventing women from managerial positions. One of the area in which women are underrepresented is school leadership. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>views</b> of the primary teachers and primary pre-service teachers related to the barriers preventing female teachers from attaining leadership positions in schools. In accordance with the main purpose of the study it was investigated whether there were any differences between the <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>views</b> of the primary teacher and the primary pre-service teachers. The <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>views</b> about the barriers facing female teachers in school leadership were also compared according to gender and the grades of the primary pre-service teachers. Data were collected from 114 primary teachers working in primary schools in Çayeli district and 192 primary pre-service teachers attending primary school teacher training program in the Faculty of Education in Rize University. The <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>views</b> of the primary teachers and primary pre-service teachers related to the barriers preventing female teachers from attaining leadership positions were described in two dimensions, personal <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>views,</b> <b>and</b> social <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>views.</b> Study results revealed that the <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>views</b> differentiated significantly due to gender and position (teacher or pre-service teacher) in both dimensions. Moreover, it was indicated that gender and the position of the primary teachers and the primary pre-service teachers have significant joint effects on the personal <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>views</b> whereas joint effects of the gender and positions on the social <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>views</b> were not observed at statistically significant level. As a conclusion, study results indicated that female primary teachers and female primary pre-service teachers have not negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>views</b> for female promoting to school leadership as much as their male counterparts. However, female primary teachers and female primary pre-service teachers seemed to accept voluntarily the social female roles more than male primary teachers and male primary pre-service teachers. In accordance with the study results some suggestions were developed. First of all, it was proposed that traditional gender roles should be redefined in Turkish Educational System. Secondly, gender discrimination subject might take place in teacher training programs.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} medical <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> behaviors in China {{and explore the}} influencing factors {{with a focus on}} hospital internal management, we developed a 13 -item <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> 11 -item behaviors inventory. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 390 physicians mainly in four specialties in two tertiary Chinese hospitals in 2011. 306 completed questionnaires were collected. More than 90 % of respondents agreed with at least nine of the 13 specific statements about principles. However, responses on behaviors were not necessarily consistent with those on attitudes. 80. 3 % of respondents reported that they usually or always participated in quality improvement activities and 48. 2 % reported that they usually or always participated in peer evaluations of colleagues' quality of care. Some 47. 8 % had encountered incompetent colleagues and 17. 7 % had encountered significant medical errors caused by colleagues. Among those who had encountered incompetence or significant medical errors, almost two thirds had never reported their concerns to the hospital or other relevant authorities. Half of the physicians did not obtain enough continuing medical education credits. Physicians' professional reported behaviors were influenced by their personal <b>and</b> <b>professional</b> characteristics, <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes,</b> <b>and</b> assessment of hospital internal management constitutions. For example, participation in decision-making had a significant role in professional reported behaviors of protecting patient confidentiality, improving quality of care, and self-regulation, with those sometimes or often participating in decision-making indicating higher levels of reported behaviors than those who seldom participated (odds ratios: 1. 84; 4. 31, 2. 44; 3. 31). The results showed Chinese physicians demonstrated positive attitudes to professionalism principles. However, their reported behaviors were at times inconsistent with their attitudes, especially in the areas of competence, quality improvement, and self-regulation. One of effective strategies to facilitate Chinese physicians' professionalism may be to improving hospital management...|$|R

We formally investigated the relationship between doctors' and medical students' personal illness experiences, their examination results, preparedness for clinical practice, learning <b>and</b> <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> behaviour towards patients. Methods Newly-qualified UK doctors in 2005 (n = 2062 / 4784), and two cohorts of students at one London medical school (n = 640 / 749) participated in the quantitative arm of the study. 37 Consultants, 1 Specialist Registrar, 2 Clinical Skills Tutors and 25 newly-qualified doctors participated in the qualitative arm. Newly-qualified doctors and medical students reported their personal illness experiences in a questionnaire. Doctors' experiences were correlated with self-reported preparedness for their new clinical jobs. Students' experiences were correlated with their examination results, and self-reported anxiety and depression. Interviews with clinical teachers, newly-qualified doctors and senior doctors qualitatively investigated how personal illness experiences affect learning, <b>professional</b> <b>attitudes,</b> <b>and</b> behaviour.
