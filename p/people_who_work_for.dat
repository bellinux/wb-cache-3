5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E

Unlike the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the bank, Erica will be available 24/7. Digital banking head Michelle Moore said the technology was designed to help customers do a better job of managing money.|$|E
25|$|Bicycle {{messengers}} (also {{known as}} bike or cycle couriers) are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> courier companies (also known as messenger companies) carrying and delivering items by bicycle. Bicycle messengers {{are most often}} found in the central business districts of metropolitan areas. Courier companies use bike messengers because bicycle travel is less subject to unexpected holdups in city traffic jams, and is not deterred by parking limitations, fees or fines in high density development that can hinder or prevent delivery by motor vehicle, thereby offering a predictable delivery time.|$|E

25|$|In {{the book}} How Social Security Picks Your Pocket other factors {{affecting}} Social Security net benefits are identified: Generally, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> more than 35 years get a lower net benefit – all other factors being equal. People {{who do not}} live long after retirement age get a much lower net benefit. Finally, people who derive {{a high percentage of}} income from non-wage sources get high Social Security net benefits because they appear to be poor, when they are not. The progressive benefit formula for Social Security is blind to the income a worker may have from non-wage sources, such as spousal support, dividends and interest, or rental income.|$|E
25|$|McNulty {{waits for}} Bodie {{as he is}} {{released}} from jail and offers to buy him lunch. As they leave, Monk arrives with the bondsman and notices Bodie getting into McNulty's car. McNulty takes Bodie to Cylburn Arboretum. Bodie tells him {{that he is not}} an informant but admits his frustration with his life as a drug dealer and Marlo's leadership. He states that Marlo expects his people to stand behind him, yet he himself does not stand behind <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that he feels like a pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he will not give any information on any former Barksdale associate. McNulty, out of genuine respect, tells Bodie that he is a soldier.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, a {{confidential}} memo {{written by the}} consul general of Israel in Boston, Nadav Tamir, was leaked to the Israeli media. In the memo, Tamir said that Israel's dealings with the Obama administration on differences over settlements were eroding US support. After Tamir was reprimanded by the Israeli government, Frank defended Tamir in a letter sent to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which Frank wrote: [...] "I was sorry to learn that he (Tamir) is being criticized because of his accurate reporting of significant (negative) sentiment in the United States... If the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> me did not give me the kind of straightforward, thoughtful analysis that the consul is providing, even if it wasn't the most welcome news, that failure - not the information - would cause me unhappiness." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{surprising}} part of {{the project}} has been that the elderly tend to prefer the services provided by people paid in Fureai Kippu over those paid in yen. This {{may be due to the}} personal connection. When they surveyed the elderly, it was clear they preferred the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> Fureai kippu over the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> yen because of the nature of the relationship. To convert this community service to yen would seem to dilute the community ethic.|$|R

2500|$|Speaking to BBC News in November 2016, Leyonhjelm {{questioned}} the motives {{and integrity of}} anti-poverty charity workers, {{particularly with regard to}} a conflict of interest in the continuation of their own employment as opposed to their elimination of poverty and thus their obsolescence: [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> those charities have their careers tied up in the continuation of that charitable work. If they were too successful and poverty was eliminated, they wouldn't have jobs anymore. They have a very long history in Australia of talking up poverty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mir Qazi (or Mir Aimal Kasi) {{was born}} in Quetta, Pakistan, either on February 10, 1964, or January 1, 1967. He entered the United States in 1991, taking a {{substantial}} sum of cash he had inherited {{on the death of}} his father in 1989. He travelled on forged papers he had purchased in Karachi, Pakistan, altering his last name to [...] "Kansi", and later bought a fake green card in Miami. He stayed with a Kashmiri friend, Zahed Mir, in his Reston, Virginia, apartment, and invested in a courier firm for which he also worked as a driver. This work would be decisive in his choice of target: [...] "I used to pass this area almost every day and knew these two left-turning lanes [...] mostly <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> CIA." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She said with a choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know {{he has a lot of}} issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{morality}} is all sympathy, just what morality should be. If {{the only thing}} that he ever said had been, 'Her sins are forgiven her because she loved much,' it would have been worth while dying to have said it. His justice is all poetical justice, exactly what justice should be. The beggar goes to heaven because he has been unhappy. I cannot conceive a better reason for his being sent there. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> an hour in the vineyard in the cool of the evening receive just as much reward as those who have toiled there all day long in the hot sun. Why shouldn't they? Probably no one deserved anything. Or perhaps they were a different kind of people. Christ had no patience with the dull lifeless mechanical systems that treat people as if they were things, and so treat everybody alike: for him there were no laws: there were exceptions merely, as if anybody, or anything, for that matter, was like aught else in the world! ...|$|E
