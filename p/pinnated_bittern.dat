5000|$|<b>Pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> or South American bittern, Botaurus pinnatus ...|$|E
50|$|If flushed, the <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> gives a rough rawk-rawk-rawk call. During the {{breeding}} season, the male booms at dusk {{and into the}} night; his call is a deep poonk or poonkoo.|$|E
50|$|German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler, {{who first}} {{described}} the <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> in 1829, {{placed it in}} the genus Ardea at that time. It is sometimes included in a superspecies with the American bittern (B. lentiginosus), while other authors consider the entire genus Botaurus to consist of a single superspecies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> {{is largely}} nocturnal. Though {{generally}} solitary, it will gather in small loose groups at favored feeding areas. When frightened, {{it tends to}} freeze with its body crouched low and its head raised vertically just high enough to see. It typically flushes only at close range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> {{is a large}} heron, {{measuring}} between 25 - 30 in with {{a weight}} that ranges from 554 to 1157 g; males typically weigh considerably more than females. Sexes are similarly plumaged, but females tend to be smaller than males and have brown instead of black on the tail.|$|E
50|$|Its diet is varied, {{consisting}} of fish (including eels), reptiles, amphibians, chicks, arthropods and small mammals (even including young common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus), {{all of which}} are typically taken in ambush. The <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> is a patient hunter, often standing motionless for long periods while waiting for prey to move within range.|$|E
50|$|As {{typical for}} Botaurinae (but unlike most herons), the <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> is a solitary breeder. Its nest, a {{platform}} or shallow cup of rush stems or other plant material, is typically built among thick vegetation not {{far above the}} water surface. The female lays two to three olive-brown eggs, and is thought {{to do all of}} the incubation. Pinnated bitterns are almost exclusively wet season breeders.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> (Botaurus pinnatus), {{also known}} as the South American bittern, is a large member of the heron family (Ardeidae) found in the New World tropics. Like the other Botaurus bitterns, its plumage is mostly buffy-brown and cryptically patterned. Though it is a {{widespread}} species, it is rarely seen [...] - [...] presumably due to its skulking habits [...] - [...] and much about its life history remains little known.|$|E
50|$|The American bittern {{was first}} {{described}} in 1813 by the English clergyman Thomas Rackett from a vagrant individual he examined in Dorset, England. No subspecies are accepted today, however, fossils {{found in the}} Ichetucknee River, Florida, and originally described as {{a new form of}} heron (Palaeophoyx columbiana; McCoy, 1963) were later recognized to be a smaller, prehistoric subspecies of the American bittern which lived during the Late Pleistocene (Olson, 1974) and would thus be called B. l. columbianus. Its closest living relative is the <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> (Botaurus pinnatus) from Central and South America.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1758 as Ardea stellaris by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae. In 1819, the English naturalist James Francis Stephens, coined the genus Botaurus for the bitterns to distinguish them from Ardea, the great herons. It {{is placed in}} the subfamily Botaurinae, and its closest relatives are the American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), the <b>pinnated</b> <b>bittern</b> (Botaurus pinnatus) and the Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus). Two races of Eurasian bittern are recognised; the nominate subspecies B. s. stellaris has a palearctic distribution and occurs across a broad swathe of Europe, North Africa and Asia, while the other subspecies, B. s. capensis, occurs only in southern Africa. The name capensis was used for species found in the Afrotropics for which no exact range was known.|$|E
