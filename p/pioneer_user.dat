30|$|The first benefit can be {{attributed}} to only paying for the resources when you use them. When you do not use them, the provider can allocate them to other users. Being able to host multiple users or tenants on the same infrastructure allows the provider to utilize the resources more efficiently and thereby increase the return on investment (ROI). This win-win relationship between users and providers is the reason why most companies switch to Cloud architectures. The growth and sudden popularity of Cloud computing was, however, not fueled by traditional, established companies. Start-ups were the <b>pioneering</b> <b>users</b> of Cloud technology as it reduced their time-to-market and provided them with less up-front risk to stand up a demo or beta version. If the users did not flock, not much harm was done, you just stopped paying for the resources. If there was an unexpected flash crowd of people bombarding the service, you would just pay for more resources. This type of usage {{is often referred to as}} the elasticity of the Cloud.

40|$|Many Chinese {{companies}} rely on externally acquired innovations {{rather than}} developing their own. The {{best way to}} rapidly commercialize externally acquired innovations in a Chinese company, however, is still a rather new research topic. This paper reports research towards development of an integrated model for commercialization of acquired innovations. Development of the preliminary model was based upon {{a review of the}} literature. The preliminary model covers four main factors, namely, technological collaboration, organizational collaboration, customer collaboration and resource collaboration. Managers from four entrepreneurial Chinese companies evaluated the model. Each of the four case companies had acquired innovations from external sources. Our empirical results indicate that the factors of partner matches/relationships, product champions, <b>pioneer</b> <b>users</b> and financial alliances tend to be more important than other factors. The managers also added two more factors, namely, government regulations and university support. This paper provides initial empirical evidence that demonstrates the multifaceted determinants of rapid commercialization of acquired innovations in the context of Chinese manufacturing. Our findings suggest that the innovative firms operating in China integrate technological collaboration, government policies and university research activities in order to facilitate commercialization of their acquired innovations. In summary, collaborations both inside and outside of companies are critical for successful commercialization. Rapid commercialization, acquired innovation, collaboration, Chinese companies...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to address the puzzle of why states in the developing world with similar concerns and conditions have been slow to adopt transgenic (recombinant DNA, genetically modified/engineered) crop technologies, while others were <b>pioneer</b> <b>users</b> and developers of this technology. The central hypothesis tested here is that the type of involvement, defined as different strategies and access to institutional structures as well as varying organizational resources, of non-state actors (NSAs), both non-profit (non-governmental organizations, NGOs) and for-profit (industry), accounts for these differences. A second hypothesis is that variation in institutional context accounts for the differences in policies towards rDNA crops. Differences in institutional context include which level of government and type of institutions are responsible for policies for rDNA crops.; Both hypotheses are tested in three case study countries (Brazil, India and Argentina) at three levels of analysis: international, national/federal and sub-national (state and local). For each case country, the policy areas related to transgenic crops [...] intellectual property rights, trade, biosafety, food safety and consumer choice, and public research [...] are examined for the years 1996 - 2002.; The study reveals that in India and Brazil, NGO strategies were key, while in Argentina, industry actor access to the institutional structure was most important. This work also highlights the importance of the institutional context, which played a role in the policy differences in all three case studies. Centralization of policy-making tended to lead to more promotional policies for genetically modified crops, while the inclusion and counter-balancing of a wider set of actors (whether governmental or non-state actors) resulted in more precautionary policies...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{expectation}} that university teachers have {{a good understanding of}} the value of educational technologies in learning and teaching as well as be able to incorporate them effectively into their teaching (Carter et al, 2011, Higher Education Academy, 2011; Sharples et al, 2016). However, according to key literature (Conole, 2004; Kennedy et al, 2011; Laurillard, 2007; Selwyn, 2007; Walker et al, 2016) the extent to which educational technologies have impacted on teaching and learning practices is considered to be minimal. While universities have invested heavily in educational technologies for teaching purposes, institutional virtual learning environments are predominately being used as a vehicle for information transmission and document repository (Armellini et al, 2012; Walker et al, 2016). The research I report here investigated the thinking and conceptions behind how Bryn, a university teacher, used educational technologies to optimise the quality of his students’ learning. I also report on the thinking and decision making behind how 15 of his students used educational technologies to optimise the quality of their university learning. The analysis of the data collected suggests that there is an evolution occurring in how university teaching staff are thoughtfully integrating educational technology into programmes and satisfying the majority of students with this development. It was also identified that influences of educational technology on student learning are mediated by students’ disposition towards learning and the task and social contexts of their learning. It is recommended that those students who are <b>pioneer</b> <b>users</b> of educational technology and ahead of the university teacher’s curve be incorporated into the planning and evaluating of experiences of learning and teaching in educational technology-mediated classroom contexts and be appointed as learning coaches to those students who are somewhat bewildered and frustrated by educational technology use...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{of information and}} communication technology (ICT) for adoption among the elderly faces the issue of reluctant to adopt and use the technology. Unlike {{some of the other}} categories of users, individuals in this category show little interest to use ICT. Reasons for not using ICT among the elderly are fear of the technology, {{do not know how to}} use, do not need the computer, and cannot afford to buy computer and fee for Internet connection. As the elderly are perceived to be low ICT literate and fear to technology, their desire to use the technology need to be develop through provision of simple and easy to use technology. A simple gadget called Jendela Informasi Anda (literally translate as your window of information) or in short JENii was developed and introduced to this segment of the population as a strategic step to bridge the age digital divide. JENii contains easy applications and steps to teach the elderly on how to operate the gadget, how to access the content and how to overcome minor technical problems. This paper reports on the findings from the impact study on the use of JENii among the 26 <b>pioneer</b> <b>users</b> in Kota Kinabalu areas in East Malaysia. The focus of the discussion is on perception and experiences of users in using JENii. The study employed survey and focus group discussion. The findings indicate that the users’ interest to use JENii depend on the knowledge to operate JENii i. e. to on and off, use the icons, and seek the information. Some users report that they don’t use JENii often because they forget how to operate it and the content is not updated. Thus, the users feel frustrated and their motivation and interest level to use JENii will definitely decrease. The paper concludes that the introduction of JENii is a right step by the government to encourage wider usage of ICT and to address the issue of digital divide among the society, especially the marginalized group such as the adults and elderly...|$|R

Themain themes for EDM in building design are therefore how tomanage the change of information and the exchange or sharing ofinformation between the different organisations. The thesis contains a state-of-the-art description ofdocument management in building design, including reviews ofcommercial applications, standards and current best practice. Basic techniques on a scale from file-hierarchy-based toproduct-model-based systems are classified and analysed from abuilding design perspective. Five cases of document management in practice have beenstudied. The companies studied are active within differentdesign disciplines and have chosen to introduce and use EDM indifferent ways, with respect to technology as well as theinformation content that is managed. It is concluded that thedifferent requirements can not be met by uniform methods fordocument management, but that the exchange of documents andtheir meta-data has to be supported by information standardswhich need to cover a number of levels from hardware toconstruction-specific classification. As a starting-point forfurther development a conceptual schema for document meta-datasuited for building design is discussed.
