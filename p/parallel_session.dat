Having noticed with some surprise in May 1976 that [...] "heritage of July 18 is no longer protected by state", in the diet {{he did his best}} first to obstruct works on a new law on political parties voting against its final version, and to water-down the draft on Ley Para la Reforma Política; in November 1976 he was among those who refused to commit [...] "political suicide of the Francoist Cortes" [...] and cast a [...] "no" [...] ballot during the plenary session; indeed he was already speaking openly about a suicidal governmental policy.In gear-up to the elections in late 1976 UNE joined the Alianza Popular coalition and Zamanillo signed it founding manifesto. In parallel, apparently somewhat skeptical about the UNE format and definitely disillusioned about Juan Carlos, in February 1977 he co-founded a strictly Carlist organization, Comunión Tradicionalista, and entered its executive; dynastic leader of the party turned out to be Sixto, Traditionalist younger brother of Carlos Hugo. In the June 1977 elections Zamanillo ran for the senate on the UNE/AP list from Santander, but suffered heavy defeat. UNE was getting increasingly divided about the general strategy; its November 1977 General Assembly turned into a mayhem. Zamanillo and his supporters demanded leaving AP; in the ensuing chaos, they staged a <b>parallel</b> <b>session</b> and elected a new party executive. The opposing faction of Fernández de la Mora appealed in court and won; in December 1977 Zamanillo was expulsed from UNE. He then focused on Comunión, which prior to 1979 elections joined the Unión Nacional alliance; this time Zamanillo did not run.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling a conference to achieve the benefits in timecompression of <b>parallel</b> <b>sessions,</b> but without the associated high degree of conflict between talks. We describe a randomized construction meeting these goals that we analyze based on an expansion property of an associated graph.

Finally, we present simulation results for typical conference sizes. 1 Introduction Single <b>sessions</b> or <b>parallel</b> <b>sessions?</b> It is a continuing debate in the scheduling of our premier research conferences. On the one hand, <b>parallel</b> <b>sessions</b> allow for more talks to be presented in a given time period. On the other hand, <b>parallel</b> <b>sessions</b> result in many attendees being frustrated by conflicts. For instance, if an attendee is interested in a constant fraction of the talks, then on average (say the schedule is determined randomly) this attend [...] ...|$|R

ISBT congresses discuss a wide range of state of the art topics in the field of transfusion medicine, with invited speakers for plenary and <b>parallel</b> <b>sessions.</b> Congresses typically start with a local or regional day on Saturday, followed by a day organised by the ISBT Academy on Sunday. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are dedicated to <b>parallel</b> <b>sessions,</b> plenary sessions, workshops, and specialised group sessions. International congresses are typically one day longer and include Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning in the scientific programming. All ISBT Congresses are complemented by a scientific exhibition with companies relevant to transfusion medicine.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the summary}} of the <b>parallel</b> <b>session</b> {{entitled}} "White Dwarf Pulsars and Rotating White Dwarf Theory", chaired by Yukikatsu Terada in Thirteenth Marcel Grossmann Meeting. The origin of cosmic rays remains a mystery, even over 100 years since their discovery. Neutron stars (NSs) are considered textbook cases of particle acceleration sites in our Galaxy, but many unresolved numerical problems remain. Searches for new acceleration sites are crucial for astrophysics. The magnetized white dwarfs (MWDs) {{have the same kind}} of rotating magnetosphere as NSs, and may be the source of up to 10 % of galactic cosmic ray electrons. In the <b>parallel</b> <b>session</b> of the "white dwarf pulsars and rotating white dwarf theory", we focus on the current observational results on white dwarf pulsars, related theories of the radiation process both in white dwarfs and neutron stars, and the origin and rule of white dwarf pulsars, as well as surveying on the current theories of the internal structure and the equation of state of white dwarfs.
