40|$|The {{rational}} prodigality argument, {{which often}} serves to justify social security, is considered in a second-best tax framework with endogenous labor supply. Rational prodigality renders the familiar policies time inconsistent. We analyze time consistent policies {{and show that}} a wage tax suffices to rule out prodigality as a rational strategy. However, using savings subsidies, the solution can be improved upon. The subsidies are shown to be decreasing in income.

The {{results of the study}} indicate that social support for the elderly through <b>pension</b> and <b>subsidy</b> is improving, particularly in suburban villages where there is greater level of economic development and there are increasingly more industrial enterprises. The current <b>pension</b> or <b>subsidy</b> status is mainly a function of the presence of well-developed economy (as represented by our proxy variables RURALITY, and PRIORJOB). In terms of family support, our study shows it serves largely as a substitute for social support.

Demonstrations in some poor communities remain rare, partially {{out of fear}} of armed colectivos acting as community enforcers and distrust of opposition leaders. An Associated Press investigation that followed two students encouraging anti-government support in poor districts found much discontent among the lower classes, but those Venezuelans were generally more worried about possibly losing <b>pensions,</b> <b>subsidies,</b> education, and healthcare if the opposition were to gain power, and many stated they felt leaders on both sides were only concerned with their own interests and ambitions. The Guardian has also sought out viewpoints from the Venezuelan public. Respondents reiterated many of the core protest themes for their protester support: struggles with shortages in basic goods; crime; mismanagement of oil revenue; international travel struggles caused by difficulties in buying airline tickets and the [...] "bureaucratic nightmare" [...] of buying foreign currency; and frustration over the government's rhetoric regarding the alleged [...] "far-right" [...] nature of the opposition. Others offered a variety of reasons for not joining the protests, including: support for the government due to improvements in education, healthcare, and public transportation; pessimism over whether Maduro's ouster would lead to meaningful changes; and the belief that a capitalist model would be no more effective than a socialist model in a corrupt government system.|$|R

40|$|The PSG {{models are}} used to project future pension {{benefits}} and social security benefits for the 1990 birth cohort. The projection shows wide variation in future pension benefits, both across macroeconomic scenarios for the whole cohort and across different individual life histories in the same macroeconomic scenario. Viewing this variation as risk to a cohort individual at birth, the risk-adjusted pension benefit is substantially smaller than the risk-adjusted social security benefit, even though the average (non-risk-adjusted) pension benefit is roughly {{the same as the}} average social security benefit. This is true because the individual will receive stable social security benefits in almost all life histories, while the real value of the pension benefit received will vary widely across life histories depending on the details of the individual’s realized job history {{and the nature of the}} macroeconomic environment within which that job history plays out. As a result, a 1990 cohort individual would have a larger risk-adjusted pension plus social security benefit if some of the tax subsidy currently provided to pension benefits was reduced and the resulting tax revenue was used to finance scheduled social security benefits, rather than leaving the <b>pension</b> tax <b>subsidy</b> in place and receiving the lower social security benefits that are payable given current trust-fund revenue sources...|$|R

It is analyzed the role of returns, participation rates, occupational choices, schooling endowments, <b>subsidies,</b> <b>pensions</b> and household size. The inertia shown by inequality reflects the interplay of factors that cancel each other out, others that operate slowly over time, and the emergence of new developments that affect distribution. Furthermore, there are no clear indications that this situation will change over the next few years. Progress in this area will require a more active public policy than in the past...|$|R
25|$|Healey became Chancellor of the Exchequer in March 1974 after Labour {{returned}} to {{power as a}} minority government. His tenure is sometimes divided into Healey Mark I and Healey Mark II. The divide is marked by his decision, taken with Prime Minister James Callaghan, to seek an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan and submit the British economy to IMF supervision. The loan was negotiated and agreed in November and December 1976, and announced in Parliament on 15 December 1976. Within {{some parts of the}} Labour Party the transition from Healey Mark I (which had seen a proposal for a wealth tax) to Healey Mark II (associated with government-specified wage control) was regarded as a betrayal. Healey's policy of increasing benefits for the poor meant those earning over £4,000 per year would be taxed more heavily.

40|$|Abstract How can {{increased}} spending on priority social and infrastructure sectors be financed in India? While increased tax revenue {{is part of}} the answer, as is increased private sector financing of infrastructure, expenditure restructuring will also be important. But how much can be saved by expenditure restructuring? We examine salaries, including <b>pensions,</b> and <b>subsidies</b> in turn. We argue that there are significant savings which can feasibly be extracted from the salary bill, via both wage and hiring restraint, without sacrifice of expenditure quality. We argue that if real wage increases are avoided, the combined state-central government salary bill could fall by two percentage points of GDP over the next decade. While the pension bill cannot be expected to decline as a percentage of GDP, it can be contained by both structural and, with more immediate effect, parametric reforms. India’s subsidy bill is large, and large cuts would certainly be desirable, but the scope for savings is limited by reasons of political economy. We examine the agricultural power subsidy as a case study, and situate India’s growing subsidy bill {{within the context of a}} trend towards agricultural protectionism. While there are ways to reduce India’s subsidies through a combination of efficiency improvements and tough decisions, progress in this direction to date has been disappointingly small, if not negative. There is no assured path forward, and sustained reduction in the subsidy bill will require institutional experimentation. Thus, in summary, while subsidies are the usual suspect for expenditure savings, the argument of this paper is that the salary bill should receive a lot more attention from policy makers...|$|R
30|$|The {{attraction}} of large firms {{with an international}} background is however insufficient in itself to increase formal employment. As Levy (2008) explains, there are several incentives not to register and simply continue to work informally. One is the high price for social security coverage which amounts to about 30 % of a worker’s wage in the lowest three deciles of the wage distribution. Furthermore, social security benefits have to be bought as a bundle even if the worker does not want or need all components. Other incentives are the various social protection benefits (health insurance, housing <b>subsidies,</b> <b>pension</b> schemes, access to day care centers and life insurance) which can be bought independently and are almost free for poor workers {{when they are not}} registered with IMSS. Importantly, non-registration goes hand-in-hand with the avoidance of payroll taxes. These are reasons why the Social Security Law is violated in a widespread manner, leading to a persisting large share of informal employment. 13 Hence, policies need to address the incentives to work formally, for example by changing the social insurance schemes.|$|R

We build an overlapping generations model in which government collects money from the households through a proportional tax on wages and distributes the resources {{in the form of}} <b>pensions</b> and a <b>subsidy</b> to education. The individual votes for the level of public assistance to receive in order to maximize her utility. We find that the solution of the model depends on the preferences of the median voter and that as population ages, more pensions are demanded in the economy relative to the subsidy to education, which makes the individuals invest less in the human capital formation of their children and lead economy to be less productive. We also demonstrate that government inefficiency plays {{a crucial role in the}} redistribution of resources and that the solution of such an inefficiency gap may slow down the negative e¤ects of population aging...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} belief among may European policymakers that the current debt problem in some Eurozone {{countries}} {{is caused by the}} unsustainable levels of governmental spending required to maintain overly generous welfare state programs, a bloated public sector, overly generous <b>pension</b> levels, state <b>subsidies,</b> and low user fees for services. Their proposed solution lies in implementing stringent austerity measures designed to discipline debt-ridden governments by cutting public budgets, reducing the number of public sector workers, curbing social benefits, and sharply narrowing the scope of the welfare state. Based on a belief in ‘expansionary austerity,’ this approach repudiates a key Keynesian principle for dealing with a recession—namely, the use of government spending to pursue full employment. This paper will examine the austerity measures forced upon several heavily indebted European nations by the ‘Troika’— the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

40|$|In this paper, by {{adopting}} an OLG neoclassical growth model {{we show that}} intergenerational transfers may trigger the take off of an economy entrapped into poverty in a twofold way: 1) by eliminating the zero equilibrium -which, under technology with low factor substitutability, is always a "catching" point- so that the economy might start converging to a positive equilibrium. In this case the appropriate instrument {{turns out to be}} a transfer from the old to the young, while there is no room for policies redistributing in the opposite direction (i. e. a pay-as you-go-pension scheme); 2) when the rich equilibrium is unstable -which can be the case under high intertemporal substitution of individuals- the introduction of transfers may stabilize such an equilibrium, so that the economy starts converging to it. In the latter case both policy programs such as pay-as-you-go <b>pension</b> schemes or <b>subsidies</b> to the young may help escaping from poverty. However, we point out that in either circumstances, the "size" of transfers should be sufficiently large (and, as for pensions not even too large), in order to avoid ineffective and useless burden on the taxpayers without triggering the take off. poverty traps, intergenerational transfers, OLG...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of Natal, 1991. Claims {{of gender}} {{discrimination}} by women educators in South Africa were investigated through {{an examination of}} specific issues surrounding the employment of women educators of Indian descent. These include maternity leave, housing <b>subsidy,</b> <b>pension</b> scheme, medical aid, salaries, merit awards and promotions. The study is located {{within the context of}} the general oppression of all women in society. The analysis used the sexual division of labour as its central focus. Since the subjects under investigation were members of a minority ethnic group, factors such as their cultural heritage, race, and class difference were considered an integral part of the analysis. The study assessed the validity of each of the claims of discrimination through an examination of official documentation such as the Principal's Handbook and staff circulars relating to teachers' conditions of service, regulations and occupational incentives. Wherever possible, the claims were empirically examined through an analysis of the responses obtained from a sample of educators. Cross-tabulations and Chi-square analyses were used to test the claims statistically. Participation in a union as a possible organising strategy for women educators in their challenge of gender discrimination is suggested. A list of recommendations for the amelioration of gender discrimination against women educators is presented at the end of the study...|$|R
40|$|The pension {{structures}} of the Nordic countries are often described as statist structures. Generous public pensions are supposedly crowding out private pension alternatives (including occupational pensions). It is argued that these systems unite the pension-political interests of workers and marginal groups resulting in stable "pension regimes". This paper questions these statements. It argues that old political tensions are "built into" the institutional designs of the Nordic pension systems. There is a general tendency away from flat-rate "universal" pension arrangements toward dual systems in which the working population receives earnings-related pensions and the non-working (marginal groups) receive means-tested benefits. This development fits in with Gordons (1988) hypothesis that a convergence process {{is taking place in}} industrialized countries toward "two-tier" systems. High tax levels, gloomy demographic forecasts and increased competition at the world market have led the Nordic countries to consider cutbacks in their public <b>pension</b> systems. Tax <b>subsidies</b> to occupational and individual pension plans have also been cut back, partly to increase government revenue and partly to create increased competition in the markets for different types of financial assets. Recent changes in regulation policies also aims at creating increased competition in the private pension sector. If this trend prevails, a larger and more diversified private pension sector is likely to emerge in the Nordic countries in the future...|$|R
50|$|Denmark has a broad-reaching welfare system, which {{ensures that}} all Danes receive tax-funded health care. Expenses to {{medicine}} is only partially funded and some non-vital medical treatments are not funded at all. Denmark has an unemployment insurance system called the A-kasse (arbejdsløshedskasse). This system requires a paying membership {{of a state}} recognized unemployment fund. Most of these funds are managed by trade unions, and {{a high percentage of}} their expenses are financed through the state tax-system. Members of an A-kasse are not obliged to be members of a trade union. Not every Danish citizen or employee qualifies for a membership of an unemployment fund and membership benefits will be terminated after 2 or more years of unemployment. A person that is not member of an A-kasse, can not receive unemployment benefits. Unemployment funds does not pay benefits to sick members, they will be transferred to a municipal social support system instead. Denmark has a countrywide, but municipal administered social support system against poverty, securing that qualified citizens has a minimum income of living. All Danish citizens above 18 years of age can apply for some financial support, if they cannot sustain themselves or their family. Approval is by no means automatic and the extent of this system has generally been diminished over the last 30 years. After a newly implemented reform by 5. January 2015, sick people can receive some financial support throughout the extent of their illness and not just for the maximum of 1 year as previously. Their ability to work will be re-evaluated by the municipality after 5 months of illness. Denmark ranked the first in the European pensions barometer survey for the past two years. The lowest-income group before retirement from the age of 65 receive 120% of their pre-retirement income in <b>pension</b> and miscellaneous <b>subsidies.</b>|$|R
40|$|The four {{papers that}} make up my thesis take {{different}} approaches to portfolio choice. The first paper, Expertise Bias, is an empirical paper investigating individuals' portfolio choice. The main finding is that individual investors have an excess weight (according to standard portfolio theory) in stocks related to their expertise. The investigation of this research question is possible due to a unique Norwegian data set that follows all Norwegian citizens. For each individual, the data set contains information that can connect his expertise (e. g. history of employment, experience, education, and wage) with his stock holding (all individual stocks). In addition, the data set includes many socioeconomic and portfolio variables. The next two papers, Optimal Pension Insurance Design and Intergenerational Effects of Guaranteed Pension Contracts, focuson how financial institutions such as life insurance companies, manage individuals' pension savings. Optimal Pension Insurance Design documents that within a standard expected utility framework traditional pension contracts {{are not part of}} the optimal portfolio. However, the demand for the pension products may be explained through behavioral models (e. g. Cumulative Prospect Theory). The third paper documents an intergenerational cross-subsidization effect in guaranteed interest rate life and <b>pension</b> contracts. The <b>subsidy</b> may be large enough to explain why late generations hold guaranteed interest rate products as part of their optimal portfolio allocation. In the last paper I investigate portfolio choice on an even more aggregate level, a country. In Strategic Asset Allocation for a Country, I offer advice on an investment strategy that captures the long-term relationship between the non-tradable assets and liabilities and the financial assets of a country. Instead of using contemporaneous correlation, I apply cointegration and duration matching to identify the long-term relationship between the non-tradable assets and liabilities and the financial assets...|$|R
