5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg {{served a}} three-place grid penalty {{following}} qualifying after being deemed at-fault for {{a collision with}} Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both of their cars with new turning vanes for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E

5|$|Abdül Kadir {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople in October 1892. By 1895, the steel frames for her hull had been erected, but work {{proceeded}} very slowly and frequently stopped, primarily due to the chronically tight Ottoman budget. In 1897, for instance, work had been halted for some time, and the contemporary journal Navy and Army Illustrated predicted that the ship would not be finished. Similar large-scale building projects during this period also fell apart {{due to lack of}} funds; a major construction program launched {{in the aftermath of the}} Ottoman Navy's <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 stalled after funds could not be appropriated for the new ships. By 1906, when work on Abdül Kadir stopped for the last time, the hull had been only partially plated. By this time, the blocks that supported the hull during construction had shifted, which destroyed the keel. As a result, the unfinished ship was broken up on the slipway in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In September, Kaitlyn was {{attacked}} by an unknown assailant prior to her championship match at Night of Champions. Upon her return, she announced her assailant had blonde hair, and Assistant SmackDown General Manager Eve Torres accused Phoenix before attacking her. On the September 28 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix was suspended by Torres, but the suspension was later reversed by SmackDown General manager Booker T. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Phoenix lost to Torres. Phoenix reverted to her villainous persona on the October 18 episode of Superstars, when she berated Kaitlyn for thinking that Phoenix attacked her and demanded respect from Kaitlyn, before losing {{to her in a}} singles match. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Phoenix was defeated by AJ Lee in a singles match, but the match was restarted by Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero, allowing Phoenix to win. After the match, in storyline, Guerrero fired Phoenix for her <b>poor</b> <b>performance.</b> <b>In</b> reality, Phoenix had given her notice to WWE in September and left the company for family reasons.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{his wife}} had moved to Somerset. In 1940, {{she gave birth to}} a son, Euan, who had many medical problems, and in 1943 she bore a third daughter, Iona. The {{pressure}} of running the household and caring for Euan led Isla to have a nervous breakdown after Iona's birth. When Jardine returned from the war, the family moved to Radlett to be closer to London. Isla recovered and Jardine found a job with paper manufacturers Wiggins Teape. In 1946, Jardine was chosen to play for Old England in a popular and successful fund raising match against Surrey. He displayed much of his old batting skill but did not show much involvement with his team-mates. By 1948, Jardine was more accepted in the cricket world. This was partly due to English perception of the short-pitched fast bowling of Australian pairing Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller as being hostile. England's <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> the 1946–47 and 1948 Ashes also caused writers to remember Jardine more fondly as an icon of past English success.|$|E

5|$|Lameness in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due to pain in {{any part of}} the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. Lameness can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop lameness, trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments. The camera also includes optical image stabilization, and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 image processor.|$|E
5|$|ToeJam & Earl and its sequel ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkatron {{together}} formed {{one of the}} Mega Drive's main series. However, creator Greg Johnson {{said that}} installments for the console's Mega-CD or 32X add-ons were never planned, and though rumors of a new game persisted throughout the commercial life of the Sega Saturn console, that system's <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> North America prevented development of a sequel. Johnson and programmer Mark Voorsanger regained the rights to ToeJam and Earl in 1995, and in November 1998 made an agreement with GT Interactive to publish a new game in the franchise for the Nintendo 64. Johnson and Voorsanger conducted research to determine whether series fans preferred the original ToeJam & Earl or its sequel; the former emerged as the clear favorite. In April 1999, however, {{it was reported that}} the deal with GT Interactive had fallen through; the publisher had decided that the series' previous game was not an encouraging success commercially, particularly in Europe. GT Interactive's restructuring and the Nintendo 64's declining commercial performance were also believed to be factors by commentators.|$|E

5|$|From 1993 {{to early}} 1996, {{although}} Sega's revenue declined {{as part of}} an industry-wide slowdown, the company retained control of 38% of the U.S. video game market (compared to Nintendo's 30% and Sony's 24%). 800,000 PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995, compared to 400,000 Saturn units. In part due to an aggressive price war, the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two-to-one in 1996, while Sega's 16-bit sales declined markedly. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., more than twice the 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and Sega's 32-bit software were sharply reduced, while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three-to-one in the U.S. market in 1997. The 1997 release of Final Fantasy VII significantly increased the PlayStation's popularity in Japan. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47% of the console market, Nintendo controlled 40%, and Sega controlled only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases were proving helpful to the Saturn's success. Reflecting decreased demand for the system, worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2.35 million to 600,000 versus the same period in 1996; shipments in North America declined from 800,000 to 50,000. Due to the Saturn's <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> North America, 60 of Sega of America's 200 employees were laid off in the fall of 1997.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{have won}} the World Cup three times, the only team to have done so. They beat France in {{the final of the}} 1987 inaugural {{competition}} held in New Zealand and Australia, defeated France again in the final of the 2011 tournament, also hosted in New Zealand, and most recently defeated Australia in England in 2015, making them the first and only team to win the World Cup in consecutive tournaments. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they reached the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa. They finished in fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003, New Zealand were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. The 2007 World Cup saw their worst tournament, being knocked out in the quarterfinals by the host nation France; until this they were the only team to have reached the semifinals of every tournament. As a result of the <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> the 2007 World Cup the NZRU commissioned a 47-page report to detail the causes of the failure. The All Blacks have never lost a World Cup pool match, and have finished top of their pool in all seven tournaments.|$|E
5|$|When Dean Solomon {{suffered}} a season-ending knee injury in late March, Hall {{was one of}} three players in contention to be promoted to the senior list in place of Solomon. After approximately one month of assessment Hall was deemed the most impressive of Essendon's three rookies and was elevated to the senior list. In early June, Hall played particularly well in defence for the reserves against the Murray Kangaroos, and was subsequently in consideration to play for Essendon's senior team. Essendon had been plagued by injury throughout 2002 and this, coupled with Hall's good form in the VFL, resulted in him making his AFL debut in round 12 against Hawthorn. After a <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> his debut match, in which he did not record a statistic and spent most of the match on the bench, Hall was dropped backed to the VFL side the following round. Despite showing good form in the VFL for the remainder of 2002, Hall was unable to break back into the senior Bombers line-up. Although Hall failed to have an impact at AFL level, he played well at VFL level and was third in the reserves' best and fairest award.|$|E

5|$|During Stalin's Great Purge in the late-1930s, {{which had}} not ended {{by the time of}} the German {{invasion}} on 22 June 1941, much of the officer corps of the Red Army was decimated and their replacements, appointed by Stalin for political reasons, often lacked military competence. Of the five Marshals of the Soviet Union appointed in 1935, only Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny survived Stalin's purge. Tukachevsky was killed in 1937. Fifteen of 16 army commanders, 50 of the 57 corps commanders, 154 of the 186 divisional commanders, and 401 of 456 colonels were killed, and many other officers were dismissed. In total, about 30,000 Red Army personnel were executed. Stalin further underscored his control by reasserting the role of political commissars at the divisional level and below to oversee the political loyalty of the army to the regime. The commissars held a position equal to that of the commander of the unit they were overseeing. But in spite of efforts to ensure the political subservience of the armed forces, in the wake of Red Army's <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> Poland and in the Winter War, about 80 percent of the officers dismissed during the Great Purge were reinstated by 1941. Also, between January 1939 and May 1941, 161 new divisions were activated. Therefore, although about 75 percent of all the officers had been in their position for less than one year at the start of the German invasion of 1941, many of the short tenures can be attributed not only to the purge, but also to the rapid increase in creation of military units.|$|E
