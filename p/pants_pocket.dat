25|$|A badly {{decomposed}} body {{recovered from}} the Chartres Street Wharf in New Orleans on December 28 was identified on January 4, 2006, as Barry. He had {{a piece of paper}} with his name and phone number in his <b>pants</b> <b>pocket.</b> The official cause of death is believed to be drowning as the New Orleans coroner found no signs of foul play.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of Bennett {{fracture}} are {{instability of}} the CMC joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and {{weakness of the}} pinch grasp. Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and ecchymosis {{around the base of}} the thumb and thenar eminence, and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb. The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a <b>pants</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
500|$|Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan {{had seen}} Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp {{and before the}} gunfight, none of the Earps had any {{way of knowing that}} Tom had left his {{revolver}} at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert [...] "Chris" [...] Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand <b>pants</b> <b>pocket</b> was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's <b>pants</b> <b>pocket</b> may have been the nearly $3,300 in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher.|$|E

2500|$|A train {{compartment}} holds a family: a small daughter, her mother, and grandma. A fourth passenger is a Georgian (See {{jokes about}} Georgians). The mother starts feeding a soft-boiled egg to the daughter {{with a silver}} spoon. / Grandma: [...] "Don't you know that eggs can spoil silver?" [...] / [...] "Who would have known!", thinks the Georgian, and he hastily moves his silver cigarette case from his front <b>pants</b> <b>pocket</b> to the back one.|$|E
2500|$|Sergeant Dennis Caputo of the Clark County Sheriff's Department {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{officers}} on the scene. Caputo found a quarter-ounce of heroin in a balloon in the kitchen and a half-ounce of marijuana in Liston's <b>pants</b> <b>pocket,</b> but no syringes or needles. Some found it suspicious that authorities could not locate any drug paraphernalia that Liston presumably would have needed to inject the fatal dose, such as a spoon to cook the heroin or a tourniquet to wrap around his arm. However, former Las Vegas police sergeant Gary Beckwith said, [...] "It wasn't uncommon for family members in these cases to go through and tidy up...to save family embarrassment." ...|$|E
5000|$|In April 2013, Doug Conklyn, vice {{president}} of global design for Dockers told Fox News that the company reworked {{the size of its}} <b>pants</b> <b>pockets</b> [...] "to accommodate the growing size of smartphones".

25|$|News {{stories in}} 1999 {{did not mention}} {{anything}} about cipher messages, which were not announced until 12 years later when the FBI listed the death as a murder, and posted a notice for help on the main page of their website. Investigators believe the notes in McCormickâ€™s <b>pants</b> <b>pockets</b> were written within the three days before his death.|$|R
2500|$|A {{decline in}} male sperm quality has been {{observed}} over several decades. Studies {{on the impact of}} mobile radiation on male fertility are conflicting, and the effects of the radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) emitted by these devices on the reproductive systems are currently under active debate. A 2012 review concluded that [...] "together, the results of these studies have shown that RF-EMR decreases sperm count and motility and increases oxidative stress". A 2017 study of 153 men that attended an academic fertility clinic in Boston, Massachusetts found that self-reported mobile phone use was not related to semen quality, and that carrying a mobile phone in the <b>pants</b> <b>pocket</b> was not related to semen quality.|$|E
2500|$|One officer exclaimed, [...] "He's got a gun! Gun!" [...] One of the {{officers}} yelled, [...] "If you fucking move, I swear to God!" [...] Then Salamoni was heard on the video saying, [...] "Lake, he's going for the gun!" [...] One of {{the officers}} aimed his gun at Sterling's body, then three gunshots were heard. The camera panned away just before the camera panned back and three more gunshots were heard. The police officer sitting on Sterling's chest {{was not in the}} picture and the other officer who drew the gun, was about [...] away. His gun was pointed on Sterling, who had a gunshot wound in his chest. The officers retrieved a loaded [...]38 caliber revolver from Sterling's front <b>pants</b> <b>pocket.</b> The officers then radioed for Emergency Medical Services.|$|E
2500|$|A {{garbage bag}} {{was used to}} suffocate her, as it was found around her head. She had also been {{physically}} abused and raped. Creek had been bitten on the neck and was beaten and slashed in the facial area. The bite had caused compression to her neck, which {{played a role in}} her death. The word [...] "hi" [...] was written on the girl's palm, which was raised in an upward position. A price tag from a bookstore was observed to have been present on one of her arms. She wore few clothes, as some were likely removed in the process of the assault, including her jacket and backpack containing personal items. Her underwear was later discovered inside of her <b>pants</b> <b>pocket.</b> A possible explanation to why some of her belongings were not found at the scene is that the murderer may have taken souvenirs. Authorities surmise that Creek may have been murdered by someone that may have received prostitution services from her.|$|E

50|$|Marshall {{suffered}} from his war injury {{for the rest}} of his life, both from phantom pain common to amputees and from the prosthesis. One friend remembered that he kept holes in his <b>pants</b> <b>pockets</b> so that he could inconspicuously loosen a strap on his prosthetic leg in order to ease his discomfort. The pain in his leg became more pronounced later in life, including bothering him on film shoots in ways noticeable to others and exacerbating his usually very slight limp.|$|R
2500|$|The {{case was}} built upon both Duane Peak's {{testimony}} and ATF laboratory {{analysis of a}} piece of wire and pliers found in David Rice's house. [...] Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau witness Roland Wilder admitted there were 25 points of dissimilarity, and only 15 points of similarity, between a piece of sheet lead cut with Rice's pliers and a piece of wire found in a house next door to the blast sight. The type of dynamite the police claimed to have found in David Rice's basement was similar to residue from the bomb. [...] An ATF chemist testified that chunks of dynamite, visible to the naked eye, were found in Poindexter's jacket pocket and Rice's <b>pants</b> <b>pocket.</b> [...] The chemist, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms lab tech Kenneth Snow, conceded at the trial to defense attorneys that these traces could have come from matches. None of the attorneys asked him if the particles could have been planted, due to the volume of material found in the pockets. To establish the characters of the pair, the prosecutor presented the court with newsletter articles in which Rice and Poindexter publicly advocated violence toward police.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon entering, the {{officers}} found Hudson {{sitting on a}} chair in the living room while numerous other individuals were running about the house.
