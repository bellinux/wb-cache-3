5|$|Malvern {{water is}} a natural spring water from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly <b>permeates</b> through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute and the flow has never been known to cease.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates pervaporation, a {{membrane}} separation {{process for the}} removal of sulfur-containing components from jet fuel. To this end, one type of commercial membrane from PolyAn GmbH was applied. The influence of the crucial reaction parameters of the pervaporation process, such as feed temperature, <b>permeate</b> pressure, and <b>permeate</b> temperature, on the characteristic pervaporation measures such as <b>permeate</b> flux and enrichment factor was tested experimentally. Fuels with different sulfur mass fractions were applied and the long-term stability of the membranes used was studied. Different spectroscopic methods were applied to investigate correlations between membrane performance and material properties of the membrane. It was found that an increased feed temperature had a positive effect on the <b>permeate</b> flux while it had a negative effect on the enrichment factor. At 100 degrees C, the <b>permeate</b> flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 1. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at a feed temperature of 80 degrees C. At a feed temperature of 80 degrees C, the enrichment factor was 0. 47, while it amounted to 0. 64 at a feed temperature of 100 degrees C. In the case of the <b>permeate</b> pressure, the trends were also antagonistic. Low <b>permeate</b> pressure enhanced the <b>permeate</b> flux but deteriorated the enrichment factor. At a value of 20 mbar, the <b>permeate</b> flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 0. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at 100 mbar. The enrichment factor was 0. 64 at 20 mbar and decreased to 0. 35 at 100 mbar. Different <b>permeate</b> temperatures and sulfur mass proportions had only a minor effect on the <b>permeate</b> flux and the enrichment factor. Experiments on the long-term stability of the membranes used showed that fortunately the pervaporation process could be run for more than 500 h using membranes from PolyAn GmbH while still showing a measurable <b>permeate</b> flux and a remarkable reduction of the sulfur mass fraction in the <b>permeate.</b> However, a significant deactivation with time on stream was observed. The <b>permeate</b> flux continuously decreased from 3. 5 kg/(h m(2)) to 0. 5 kg/(h m(2)) after 532 h of time on stream. The enrichment factor increased from 0. 5 to 0. 6. Long-term experiments with pretreated membranes revealed that interaction between the hydrocarbon matrix in kerosene Jet A- 1 and the membrane material itself was not responsible for the observed degradation of performance. Spectroscopic investigations were used to show that the reduction of the <b>permeate</b> flux was probably caused by an irreversible inclusion of polar - mostly aromatic - molecules in the polymeric separation layer of the membrane. The probable influence of unknown additives on the <b>permeate</b> flux could not be proven but should be considered. No degradation of the membrane material itself was found. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water <b>permeates</b> through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

40|$|Fouling {{behaviour}} and {{its impact}} on the rejection of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) by forward osmosis (FO) were investigated. Membrane fouling was simulated using humic acid and colloidal particles asmodel foulants at different initial permeatewater fluxes. Water flux declinewas insignificant at an initial <b>permeate</b> flux of 9 L/m 2 h and the fouling layerwas loose and fluid-like. By contrast, thewater flux declinewas substantial at an initial <b>permeate</b> flux of 20 L/m 2 h, resulting in the formation of a compact fouling layer. Water flux recovery after physical cleaning for both humic acid and colloidal particle fouledmembraneswas consistently higher at an initial <b>permeate</b> flux of 9 L/m 2 h compared to 20 L/m 2 h. The results suggest that the fouling layer structure varied froma fluidlike loose layer at lowinitial <b>permeate</b> flux to amore cohesive and compact layer at high initial <b>permeate</b> flux. We surmise that the fluid-like loose layer formed at low initial <b>permeate</b> flux contributed to pore blockage and thus enhanced steric hindrance, thereby leading to an increase in TrOC rejection. By contrast, the cohesive and compact fouling layer formed at high initial <b>permeate</b> flux exacerbated cake-enhanced concentration polarisation, resulting in a decrease in TrOC rejection...|$|R
