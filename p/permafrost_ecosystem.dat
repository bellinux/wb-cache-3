40|$|We {{investigate}} {{changes in}} total water equivalent mass, land-surface temperature and atmospheric CO 2 by satellite-based measurements from August 2002 through December 2008. Our {{region of interest}} spans 75 to 165 °E and 50 to 80 oN centered on the Lena River watershed as a physical reference frame. We find energy and mass changes on the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones indicating: 1) Arctic uplands such as the Siberian Plateau show strongly positive water equivalent mass and strongly negative land-surface temperature gradients during May months. 2) Arctic lowlands such as the thaw-lake regions of Kolyma, Lena Delta, and Taymyr show strongly negative water equivalent mass and strongly positive land-surface temperature gradients during September months. 3) Areas with strongly positive water equivalent mass and negative land-surface temperature gradients during May months have weakly positive CO 2 gradients 4) Areas with strongly negative water equivalent mass and strongly positive land-surface temperature gradients during September months have strongly positive CO 2 gradients. This indicates that continuous and discontinuous <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystem</b> responses are correlated in phase with energy and mass changes over the period. The Laptev and East Siberia Sea have increasing trends of CO 2 atmosphere concentration 2. 23 ± 0. 15 ppm/yr and 2. 40 ± 0. 21 ppm/yr, respectively. Increasing trends and strong positive gradients of CO 2 atmosphere concentration during Aprils-Mays are evidence that the Arctic Ocean is a strong emitter of CO 2 during springtime lead formation. We hypnotize that the increasing CO 2 from land and ocean regions is from permafrost thawing and degradation and ecosystem microbial activity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{quantifying}} potential {{negative effects of}} instrument heating to improve eddy covariance flux data quality in cold environments. Our overarching objective was to minimize heating-related bias in annual CO 2 budgets from an Arctic permafrost system. We used continuous eddy-covariance measurements covering three full years within an Arctic <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystem</b> with parallel sonic anemometers operation with activated heating and without heating as well as parallel operation of open- and closed-path gas analyzers, the latter serving as a reference. Our results demonstrate that the sonic anemometer heating has a direct effect on temperature measurements while the turbulent wind field is not affected. As a consequence, fluxes of sensible heat are increased by an average 5 W m- 2 with activated heating, while no direct effect on other scalar fluxes was observed. However, the biased measurements in sensible heat fluxes can have an indirect effect on the CO 2 fluxes in case they are used as input for a density-flux WPL correction of an open-path gas analyzer. Evaluating the self-heating effect of the open-path gas analyzer by comparing CO 2 flux measurements between open- and closed-path gas analyzers we found systematically higher CO 2 uptake recorded with the open-path sensor, leading to a cumulative annual offset of 96 gC m- 2, which {{was not only the}} result of the cold winter season but also due to substantial self-heating effects during summer. With an inclined sensor mounting, {{only a fraction of the}} self-heating correction for vertically mounted instruments is required...|$|E
40|$|Hydrologic {{conditions}} {{are a major}} controlling factor for carbon exchange processes in high-latitude ecosystems. The {{presence or absence of}} water-logged conditions can lead to significant shifts in ecosystem structure and carbon cycle processes. In this study, we compared growing season CO 2 fluxes of a wet tussock tundra ecosystem from an area affected by decadal drainage to an undisturbed area on the Kolyma floodplain in northeastern Siberia. For this comparison we found the sink strength for CO 2 in recent years (2013 – 2015) to be systematically reduced within the drained area, with a minor increase in photosynthetic uptake due to a higher abundance of shrubs outweighed by a more pronounced increase in respiration due to warmer near-surface soil layers. Still, in comparison to the strong reduction of fluxes immediately following the drainage disturbance in 2005, recent CO 2 exchange with the atmosphere over this disturbed part of the tundra indicate a higher carbon turnover, and a seasonal amplitude that is comparable again to that within the control section. This indicates that the local <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystem</b> is capable of adapting to significantly different hydrologic conditions without losing its capacity to act as a net sink for CO 2 over the growing season. The comparison of undisturbed CO 2 flux rates from 2013 – 2015 to the period of 2002 – 2004 indicates that CO 2 exchange with the atmosphere was intensified, with increased component fluxes (ecosystem respiration and gross primary production) over the past decade. Net changes in CO 2 fluxes are dominated by a major increase in photosynthetic uptake, resulting in a stronger CO 2 sink in 2013 – 2015. Application of a MODIS-based classification scheme to separate the growing season into four sub-seasons improved the interpretation of interannual variability by illustrating the systematic shifts in CO 2 uptake patterns that have occurred in this ecosystem over the past 10  years and highlighting the important role of the late growing season for net CO 2 flux budgets...|$|E

40|$|Permafrost is stated as an {{essential}} climate variable by the World Meteorological Organization and is an important physical landscape component of high-latitude environments. The variability of the <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystem</b> parameters soil moisture (SM) as well as freeze-thaw (FT) has a strong impact on rapid permafrost degradation, on surface energy and water fluxes {{as well as on}} biogeochemical processes. Thus information about the mentioned parameters in high temporal and spatial resolution is important for the understanding of processes in permafrost landscapes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operates independently of cloud coverage and polar night and today’s SAR satellite systems provide imagery with high temporal and spatial resolution. Existing operational satellite SAR data products of SM and FT are available only in coarse-scale resolution. We are investigating high-spatial resolution SAR of TerraSAR-X (TSX), and in future ALOS- 2, Sentinel- 1, as well as optical very high resolution satellite imagery in combination with in-situ experimental monitoring data to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of permafrost disturbances, SM and FT on the watershed scale. Our study site for rapid permafrost degradation is an actively eroding ice- and organic-rich permafrost riverbank from the so called Ice-Complex within the central Lena Delta, Siberia. Our studies on SM and FT focus on a small scale watershed on Herschel Island along the western Yukon Coast, Canada and can potentially be transferred to the Ice-Complex permafrost landscape in the Lena Delta. Automated micro-stations with near to surface soil moisture and temperature sensors were installed in the Lena Delta (since 2013) and on Herschel Island (since 2015). Field work on Herschel Island and the Lena Delta included handheld soil moisture measurements as well as extensive soil sampling. In spring 2015 we conducted a GPS survey in the Lena Delta along the test site and installed a time-lapse camera as well as wooden poles with 50 cm distance perpendicular to a rapidly eroding cliff top sequence. Time-lapse images were acquired from late June to late August. We used TSX backscatter time-series from the years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 to analyze rapidly eroding cliff tops along the riverbank within the central Lena Delta. Pre-processing was performed using the Next ESA SAR toolbox (NEST) and included radiometric calibration and conversion to backscatter coefficient sigma nought, multilooking and an ellipsoid corrected geocoding. We then used a threshold approach to visualize the transition line between undisturbed tundra surface and actively eroding cliff prior to mapping. Very high resolution orthorectified optical satellite images acquired in August 2010 and August 2014 were used as validation datasets for the TSX-derived results. The TSX extracted annual retreat rates are in the same range as the ones from the optical reference dataset. The intra-annual TSX-derived cliff top retreat lines from 2014 at the test site showed rates of 2 to 3 m per month. The time-lapse field data at the same place showed similar results in summer 2015. The TSX backscatter time-series show a high potential for the monitoring of rapid permafrost degradation with high spatial and temporal resolution. The results are valuable for the understanding of intra-seasonal permafrost degradation dynamics. Future work on Herschel Island and the Lena Delta will focus on soil moisture and freeze/thaw dynamics on the watershed scale. ALOS- 2, Sentinel- 1 and TSX datasets are planned to be used and cross-validated with the field datasets. The presented project is embedded in the German Helmholtz Alliance Earth System Dynamics (EDA) network and builds on existing datasets from the FP 7 within the PAGE 21 project.

40|$|Thermokarst lakes are {{important}} factors for permafrost landscape dynamics and carbon cycling. Thermokarst lake cover is especially high in Arctic lowlands with ice-rich permafrost. In {{most of these}} regions, multiple lake generations have been identified that overlap each other in space and time, giving rise to the hypothesis of thermokarst lake cycling and its association with complex cryostratigraphical conditions where multiple lacustrine and palustrine sequences may follow {{on top of each}} other and talik and carbon cycle histories are complicated. In northwestern Alaska on the northern Seward Peninsula, ice-rich permafrost lowlands have strongly been affected by thermokarst during the Holocene and up to six generations of lake basins overlap spatially (Jones et al., 2012). Modern thermokarst lakes are also abundant in this region and expand gradually by thermo-erosion along shores (Jones et al., 2011). We here report on the analysis of multi-temporal remote sensing data for a 12, 200 km 2 lowland area in the relatively warm continuous permafrost zone of the northern Seward Peninsula, demonstrating that thermokarst lake drainage in this region was occurring on a massive scale from 1949 - 2015. Contrary to most previous studies that suggest an increase in thermokarst lake area in continuous permafrost, we observed a significant net decrease in thermokarst lake area largely due to catastrophic lake drainage. Lateral lake expansion by thermo-erosion continued but did not offset the net area loss. Climate data analysis revealed a potential correlation with increased winter precipitation that may have resulted in a combination of high lake water levels, increased spring runoff with higher potential for drainage channel formation, and near-surface permafrost degradation, ultimately enhancing lake drainage. The observed magnitude of lake drainage implicates strong and lasting impacts on regional hydrology, biogeochemical cycling, surface energy budgets, state of the <b>permafrost,</b> <b>ecosystem</b> character, waterfowl and fish habitats, and subsistence lifestyles in the study region, portions of which belong to the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. The datasets used in this analysis include a wide range of remote sensing images and topographic data available for this region, such as aerial photography, historic topographic maps, high resolution satellite images (Corona, Spot, Ikonos, Quickbird, Worldview, GeoEye), and the full Landsat archive. Field studies included reconnaissance flights targeting freshly drained lakes and ground based data collection such as lake basin coring. Our findings suggest that a significant portion of lakes in this region has drained over the last decades and that in particular large lakes are vulnerable to disappearance. Initial analyses of relationships of lake drainages with permafrost distribution in the region suggest positive correlations between lake loss and permafrost degradation in much of the region. Our findings highlight that permafrost and lake-rich landscapes in Alaska are already changing rapidly and permanently in a warming world. This set of studies was supported by funding from NASA Carbon Cycle Sciences, NSF Arctic System Sciences, the European Research Council, and the Western Alaska Landscape Conservation Cooperative.

(2014) we consider "deep" soil carbon pools as those found below 3 meter from the land surface. Though all permafrost can be affected by degradation, thawing and erosion of thick permafrost deposits containing ice and carbon may cause particularly strong feedbacks to <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems</b> by surface subsidence and to the carbon cycle by releasing substantial amounts of carbon previously frozen for millennia.

40|$|Soil {{carbon in}} <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems</b> has the {{potential}} to become a major positive feedback to climate change if permafrost thaw increases heterotrophic decomposition. However, warming can also stimulate autotrophic production leading to increased ecosystem carbon storage-a negative climate change feedback. Few studies partitioning ecosystem respiration examine decadal warming effects or compare responses among ecosystems. Here, we first examined how 11 years of warming during different seasons affected autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in a bryophyte-dominated peatland in Abisko, Sweden. We used natural abundance radiocarbon to partition ecosystem respiration into autotrophic respiration, associated with production, and heterotrophic decomposition. Summertime warming decreased the age of carbon respired by the ecosystem due to increased proportional contributions from autotrophic and young soil respiration and decreased proportional contributions from old soil. Summertime warming's large effect was due to not only warmer air temperatures during the growing season, but also to warmer deep soils year-round. Second, we compared ecosystem respiration responses between two contrasting ecosystems, the Abisko peatland and a tussock-dominated tundra in Healy, Alaska. Each ecosystem had two different timescales of warming (< 5 years and over a decade). Despite the Abisko peatland having greater ecosystem respiration and larger contributions from heterotrophic respiration than the Healy tundra, both systems responded consistently to short- and long-term warming with increased respiration, increased autotrophic contributions to ecosystem respiration, and increased ratios of autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration. We did not detect an increase in old soil carbon losses with warming at either site. If increased autotrophic respiration is balanced by increased primary production, {{as is the case in}} the Healy tundra, warming will not cause these ecosystems to become growing season carbon sources. Warming instead causes a persistent shift from heterotrophic to more autotrophic control of the growing season carbon cycle in these carbon-rich <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thaw {{lakes in}} {{permafrost}} areas are {{sources of the}} strong greenhouse gas methane(1 - 5). They develop mostly in sedimentary lowlands with permafrost and a high excess ground ice volume, resulting in large areas covered with lakes and drained thaw-lake basins (DTLBs; refs 6, 7). Their expansion is enhanced by climate warming, which boosts methane emission and contributes a positive feedback to future climate change(3, 4, 8). Modelling of thaw-lake growth is necessary to quantify this feedback. Here, we present a two-dimensional landscape-scale model that includes the entire life cycle of thaw lakes; initiation, expansion, drainage and eventual re-initiation. Application of our model to past and future lake expansion in northern Siberia shows that lake drainage strongly limits lake expansion, even under conditions of continuous permafrost.

Soil and microbial spatial heterogeneity {{has been studied}} in various tropical and temperate ecosystems yet no information is available from Arctic <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> These ecosystems represent {{a significant proportion of}} global land mass and contain about one fourth of total soil carbon pool. Soil microbial N transformations such as nitrification and denitrification have significant implications for N availability and N loss in nutrient-limited Arctic ecosystems. This study aims to elucidate 1) the {{spatial variability}} of soil attributes and the overall microbial communities 2) the spatial structure of ammonia oxidizer and denitrifier abundance and their activities, and 3) relationships among microbial communities, functional processes, and soil attributes in three Arctic Cryosolic ecosystems. The results show that despite challenging climatic conditions and the regular occurrence of cryopedogenic processes, soil properties and microbial abundance are highly spatially dependent and their spatial autocorrelation is consistent within and between the ecohabitats. Despite similar abundances, the zone of spatial autocorrelation is substantially smaller than other ecosystems. The correlations between moisture content and other soil attributes in Arctic are considerably higher than temperate agricultural and tropical grassland soils, suggesting the critical role of moisture in Arctic soil ecosystems. Ammonia-oxidizing archaeal and bacterial communities and aerobic ammonia oxidation were spatially dependent. Functional groups were spatially structured within 4 m whereas biochemical processes were structured within 40 m. Ammonia oxidation was driven at small scales (< 1 m) by moisture and total organic carbon content whereas gene abundance and other edaphic factors drove ammonia oxidation at medium (1 - 10 m) and large (10 - 100 m) scales. Denitrifier functional groups and potential denitrification were spatially autocorrelated within a scale of 5 m. Soil moisture, organic carbon and nitrogen content were the predominant driving factors with nirK abundance also correlated to potential denitrification.

The particular lake modeled within this study {{is located in the}} Lena river delta (Siberia) and embedded in the predominant lake-rich permafrost landscape which is significantly influenced by thermokarst processes. Meteorological and lake temperature data spanning several years were used for model setup and validation. The resulting model parameters were analyzed by Monte Carlo simulations. The winter thermal regime is characterized by an ice cover up to 2 m thick that lasts for about 7 months per year. Lake bottom temperatures increase {{at the start of the}} ice-covered period due to upward-directed heat flux from the sediment at a rate of less than 1 W m- 2. Ice breaks up in June with maximum downward fluxes over the summer months of about 5 W m- 2.

Agreement between the FLake model output and lake temperature measurements is good during the ice-free months in summer while there are larger deviations during the ice-covered period.

We sampled organic horizons from feather mossYdominated and Sphagnumdominated stands and divided horizons into live moss and fibrous and amorphous organic matter. Thermal conductivity measurements were made across a range of moisture contents using the transient line heat source method. Our findings indicate a strong positive and linear relationship between thawed thermal conductivity (K t) and volumetric water content. We observed similar regression parameters (A or slope) across moss types and organic horizons types and small differences in A 0 (y intercept) across organic horizon types. Live Sphagnum spp. had a higher range of Kt than did live feather moss because of the field capacity (laboratory based) of live Sphagnum spp. In northern regions, the thermal properties of organic soil horizons {{play a critical role in}} mediating the effects of climate warming on permafrost conditions.

As a consequence, geochemical and hydrological fluxes within boreal areas {{are expected to be}} significantly affected in the future. Understanding the relationship between environmental changes and permafrost modifications is then a major challenge. This work aims to evaluate in a Siberian watershed the dynamics of the permafrost active layer and their recent modifications by combining a classic study of long-lived nuclides to the study of short-lived nuclides of U and Th decay series in two soil profiles. These profiles, located on opposite slopes (north- and south-facing slopes) of the Kulingdakan watershed (Putorana Plateau, Central Siberia), were sampled at several depths within the active layer and (238 U), (230 Th), (232 Th), (226 Ra), (228 Ra), (228 Th), (210 Pb) were measured on bulk soil samples by TIMS or gamma spectrometry. Our results show that south-facing and north-facing soil profiles are significantly different in terms of evolution of chemical concentrations and nuclide activities; north-facing soil profile is strongly affected by atmospheric inputs whereas long-lived nuclide dynamics within south-facing soil profile are dominated by weathering and exhibit more complex patterns. The amount of above-ground biomass being the single varying parameter between the two slopes of the watershed, we suggest that the structuring of permafrost active layer is very sensitive to vegetation activity and that the functioning of boreal soils will be significantly modified by its development due to more favorable climatic conditions. Moreover, the coupling of long and short-lived nuclides highlights the superimposition of a recent mobilization of chemical elements within soils (8000 years), which can be observed for both soil profiles. The shallowest layer of north-facing soil profile presents a recent increase of Th leaching that we link to the development of vegetation activity and/or organic matter degradation...|$|R

For this reason we analysed, through a data set collected over a complete year, the thermal regime of the active layer at four sites with different vegetation (bare ground, lichen vegetation with Usnea aurantiaco-atra, moss vegetation with Sanionia uncinata, grass vegetation with Deschampsia antarctica) but with similar topographic and geomorphological conditions at Signy Island (Maritime Antarctica). Except for the Deschampsia site, the other three sites are the same formerly studied by Chambers in the 1960 s. The three sites show significant differences of the mean annual ground surface temperature (MAGST), ranging from − 1. 9 (Usnea) to − 2. 6 °C (Sanionia). Despite the clear differences in MAGST at the investigated sites, the mean annual ground temperature at 30 cm is virtually identical. Our results confirm that mosses play an important role in cooling the ground. The results of our study allow us to suggest also that the thawing degree days should be used instead of the growing degree days as a more suitable measure of the favourable conditions for the growth of the Antarctic cryptogam vegetation.

British Antarctic Survey Bulletin, 10 : 71 - 83. ], we can stress that the thermal conditions favourable to the frost heave is actually even more limited in depth (30 cm vs 40 cm in Chambers). Moreover, the freeze-thaw days near the surface appeared to be more frequent in the vegetated sites than in the bare ground...|$|R
40|$|Frozen <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are {{particularly}} sensitive to climate warming, which notably induces a deepening {{of the active}} layer (the maximum thawing depth during summer time). As a consequence, geochemical and hydrological fluxes within boreal areas {{are expected to be}} significantly affected in the future. Understanding the relationship between environmental changes and permafrost modifications is then a major challenge. This work aims to evaluate in a Siberian watershed the dynamics of the permafrost active layer and their recent modifications by combining a classic study of long-lived nuclides to the study of short-lived nuclides of U and Th decay series. Two soil profiles, located on opposite slopes (north- and south-facing slopes) of the Kulingdakan watershed (Putorana Plateau, Central Siberia), were sampled at several depths within the active layer and (238 U), (234 U), (232 Th), (230 Th), (226 Ra), (228 Ra), (228 Th) and (210 Pb) were measured on bulk soil samples by TIMS or gamma spectrometry. Our results show that south-facing and north-facing soil profiles are significantly different in terms of evolution of chemical concentrations and nuclide activities; north-facing soil profile is strongly affected by atmospheric inputs whereas long-lived nuclide dynamics within south-facing soil profile are dominated by weathering and exhibit more complex patterns. The amount of above-ground biomass being the single varying parameter between the two slopes of the watershed, we suggest that the structuring of permafrost active layer is very sensitive to vegetation activity and that the functioning of boreal soils will be significantly modified by its development due to more favorable climatic conditions. Moreover, the coupling of long and short-lived nuclides highlights the superimposition of a recent mobilization of chemical elements within soils (8000 years), which can be observed for both soil profiles. The shallowest layer of the north-facing soil profile presents a recent increase of Th leaching that we link to the development of vegetation activity and/or organic matter degradation. In contrast, recent changes within south-facing soil profile affect the deepest part of the active layer, suggesting its deepening {{as a result of a}} global warming of Siberian soils...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{organic matter}} (OM) stored in {{permafrost}} {{is an important}} subject in climate research. Such OM represents a huge reservoir of carbon (C). Multiple studies suggest its source potential for C release into the active C cycle through permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial turnover in a warming Arctic. However, net ecosystem OM balance in the permafrost region depends on more than just carbon. The abundance and availability of nitrogen (N) following permafrost thaw will influence plant growth, nutrient delivery to aquatic and estuarine ecosystems, and N oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Despite its central importance to predicting permafrost impacts and feedbacks to climate change, relatively {{little is known about}} permafrost N stocks and composition. In this study, we present the most extensive dataset to date of permafrost N in the Siberian and Alaskan Yedoma domain. The Yedoma domain comprises decameter thick ice-rich silts intersected by syngenetic ice wedges, which formed in late Pleistocene tundra-steppe environments, as well as other deposits resulting from permafrost degradation during the Holocene. Together, the deposits in this region constitute a large C inventory storing several hundred Gt C, but are also known to be nutrient-rich due to rapid burial and freezing of plant remains. Hitherto, the total organic C pool of the Yedoma region was quantified, while the total N inventory is lacking so far. Based on the most comprehensive data set of N content in permafrost to date, our study aims to estimate the present pool of N stored in the different stratigraphic units of the Yedoma domain: 1) late Pleistocene Yedoma deposits, 2) in-situ thawed and diagenetically altered Yedoma deposits (taberite), 3) Holocene thermokarst deposits, 4) Holocene cover deposits on top of Yedoma, and 5) the modern active layer of soils. To quantify measurement uncertainty, we estimated nitrogen stocks with bootstrapping techniques. We show that the deposits of the Yedoma region store a substantial pool of N that is expected to get mobilized after thaw and, at least partially, affecting biogeochemical budgets of thawing warming <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lakes {{and ponds}} {{play a key}} role in the carbon cycle of <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> where they are {{considered}} to be hotspots of carbon dioxide CO 2 and methane CH 4 emission. The strength of these emissions is, however, controlled by a variety of physical and biogeochemical processes whose responses to a warming climate are complex and only poorly understood. Small waterbodies have been attracting an increasing amount of attention since recent studies demonstrated that ponds can make a significant contribution to the CO 2 and CH 4 emissions of tundra ecosystems. Waterbodies also have a marked effect on the thermal state of the surrounding permafrost; during the freezing period they prolong the period of time during which thawed soil material is available for microbial decomposition. This study presents net CH 4 production rates during the freezing period from ponds within a typical lowland tundra landscape in northern Siberia. Rate estimations were based on CH 4 concentrations measured in surface lake ice from a variety of waterbody types. Vertical profiles along ice blocks showed an exponential increase in CH 4 concentration with depth. These CH 4 profiles were reproduced by a 1 -D mass balance model and the net CH 4 production rates were then inferred through inverse modeling. Results revealed marked differences in early winter net CH 4 production among various ponds. Ponds situated within intact polygonal ground structures yielded low net production rates, of the order of 10 - 11 to 10 - 10 mol m - 2 s - 1 (0. 01 to 0. 14 mg CH 4 m - 2 day - 1). In contrast, ponds exhibiting clear signs of erosion yielded net CH 4 production rates of the order of 10 - 7 mol m - 2 s - 1 (140 mg CH 4 m - 2 day - 1). Our results therefore indicate that once a particular threshold in thermal erosion has been crossed, ponds can develop into major CH 4 sources. This implies that any future warming of the climate may result in nonlinear CH 4 emission behavior in tundra ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Background The Arctic plays a {{key role}} in the Earths climate system, because global warming is {{predicted}} to be most pronounced at high latitudes, and one third of the global carbon pool is stored in ecosystems of the northern latitudes. The degradation of permafrost and the associated release of climate-relevant trace gases from intensified microbial turnover of organic carbon and from destabilized gas hydrates represent a potential environmental hazard. Microbial processes and methane fluxesThe mean flux rate from polygon depressions was 53. 2 ± 8. 7 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1, whereas the mean flux rate of the dryer rim part of the polygon was 4. 7 ± 2. 5 CH 4 m- 2 d- 1. The CH 4 production in the upper soil horizon of the polygon depression was about 10 times higher (38. 9 ± 2. 9 nmol CH 4 m- 2 d- 1) in July than in August (4. 7 ± 1. 3 nmol CH 4 m- 2 d- 1). The CH 4 oxidation behaved exactly in reverse: the oxidation rate of the upper soil horizon was low in July (1. 9 ± 0. 3 nmol CH 4 m- 2 d- 1) compared to the activity in August (max. 7. 0 ± 1. 3 nmol CH 4 m- 2 d- 1). The findings demonstrate the close relationship between apparent methane fluxes and the modes and intensities of microbiological processes of methane production and oxidation in the polygonal tundra soils. Research needs Despite increasing studies on microbial processes and communities in permafrost envirnments [1, and ref. within there], their function, population structure and reaction to environmental changes is largely unknown, which means that also an important part of the process knowledge on methane fluxes in <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems</b> is far from completely understanding. This hampers prediction of the effects of climate warming on arctic methane fluxes, in particular when these predictions are based on models that do not take into account the specific nature of microbial populations in permafrost soils and sediments. Understanding these microbial populations is therefore highly important for understanding the global climatic effects of a warming Arctic.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 High-latitude {{ecosystems}} store {{large amounts}} of carbon in soil organic matter and {{are among the most}} vulnerable to climate change. In particular, fire severity and frequency are increasing in boreal ecosystems, and these events are likely to have direct and indirect effects on climate feedbacks via increased emission of carbon (C) from soil and changes in vegetation composition, respectively. In this study we created experimental burns of three severities in the northeastern Siberian arctic, near Cherskiy, RU, and quantified dissolved C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), and microbial respiration and extracellular enzyme activities at 1 -day, 8 -days, and 1 -year post-fire. Our objective was to determine how fire affects C, N, and P pools, soil microbial processes, and how these effects scale across severity and time since fire. We found labile C and nutrients increased immediately post-fire, but appeared similar to unburned controls within a week. Phosphorus alone remained elevated through 1 -year post-fire. Leucine aminopeptidase activities initially increased with fire severity, but by 1 -year, activities decreased with fire severity at a rate an order of magnitude faster. Fire severity suppressed phosphatase and β-glucosidase activities at all time points. Soil respiration was reduced by half in high severity plots 1 -year post-fire, while net rates of N mineralization increased by an order of magnitude. We found that changes in soil C and nutrient pools, soil respiration, and net N mineralization rates responded in a threshold-fashion to fire severity, although P was uncoupled from C and N by changing at a distinct severity threshold. Extracellular enzyme activities and edaphic variables scaled linearly with fire severity. The interaction of threshold and linear response curves to fire severity may help explain the variability across studies in soil microbial community responses to fire. Microbial communities recovering from more severe fires have the possibility to decrease future ecosystem C losses through reduced respiration. The changing fire regime in <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems</b> has the potential to alter soil microbial community dynamics, the retention of nutrients, and the stoichiometry of C, N, and P availability...|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the physical and biogeochem- ical processes at play in permafrost areas has been greatly inadequate and significant gaps have existed in our current knowledge, hindering any accurate as- sessment of the vulnerability of Arctic permafrost to climate change, or {{of the implications of}} future climate change for global greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions. The PAGE 21 project was designed to broaden our knowledge base by assessing the vulnerability of Arctic permafrost to climate change and by reducing the uncertainties in permafrost-related feedbacks to the global climate. In particular, the PAGE 21 project has sought to answer the following questions: • What are the key processes and parameters in- fluencing and controlling the vulnerability of the carbon and nitrogen pools in Arctic permafrost to future climate change? • How large an effect will Arctic climate change feedback (due to changes in the carbon and ni- trogen pools contained in permafrost) have on anthropogenic global warming? The concept of PAGE 21 was to address these ques- tions through a close interaction between monitoring activities, process studies and modeling on the per- tinent temporal and spatial scales. Field sites were selected to cover a wide range of environmental condi- tions for the validation of large scale models, the de- velopment of permafrost monitoring capabilities, the study of permafrost processes, and for overlap with existing monitoring programs. Interaction between site-scale studies and large-scale modeling was de- signed to establish and maintain a direct link between these two areas for developing and evaluating, on all spatial scales, the land-surface modules of lead- ing European global climate models taking part in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5), designed to inform the IPCC process. The PAGE 21 results to date have highlighted that the amount of carbon released from permafrost over the 21 st century may not be as large as previously claimed. The project has found an average loss of about 50 Gt C by 2100, which is {{at the lower end of}} the IPCC estimate of 50 to 250 Gt C.

The focus of this work was {{to find out if}} permafrost soils in the Swiss Alps differ in their medium- and long-term erosion rates from non-permafrost soils and if rates have accelerated during the last few decades. Materials and methods: Using cosmogenic (meteoric ¹⁰Be) and anthropogenic radionuclides (¹³⁷Cs, ²³⁹[*]⁺[*]²⁴⁰Pu), a time-split approach was achieved by determining erosion activities on the long (millennia; ¹⁰Be) and medium term (decades; ¹³⁷Cs, ²³⁹[*]⁺[*]²⁴⁰Pu). Additionally, the stable isotope δ¹³C signature in soil organic matter was used as a qualitative indicator for soil disturbance patterns. We compared soil erosion processes in permafrost soils and nearby unfrozen soils in the alpine (sites at 2, 700 m asl, alpine tundra) and the subalpine (sites 1, 800 m asl, natural forest) range of the Swiss Alps (Upper Engadine). ¹³⁷Cs, ²³⁹[*]⁺[*]²⁴⁰Pu and δ¹³C measurements were performed at the alpine sites only. Results and discussion: Depending on the calculation procedure (profile distribution model or inventory method), the ¹³⁷Cs measurements revealed soil accumulation rates of 1 – 3 t/km²/year in permafrost soils and 34 – 52 t/km²/year in non-permafrost soils. However, due to snow cover and subsequent melt-water runoff during ¹³⁷Cs deposition after the Chernobyl accident, caesium {{does not seem to be}} an appropriate soil erosion tracer on the investigated alpine sites. With ²³⁹[*]⁺[*]²⁴⁰Pu, more reliable results were achieved. ²³⁹[*]⁺[*]²⁴⁰Pu measurements provided erosion rates of 31 – 186 t/km²/year in permafrost soils and accumulation rates of 87 – 218 t/km²/year in non-permafrost soils. Erosion and accumulation were relatively low and related to the vegetation community. The long-term (¹⁰Be) soil redistribution rates (erosion rates up to 49 t/km²/year and accumulation rates up to 4 t/km²/ year) were low with no significant differences between permafrost and non-permafrost sites. The δ¹³C signature indicated soil disturbances in permafrost and non-permafrost soils compared to the reference site. Conclusions: Our results highlight that soil redistribution rates have increased during the last few decades. However, whether the higher medium-term erosion rates obtained for the last decades are the result of the ongoing climate warming and related accelerated soil erosion or if other factors (e. g. measurement uncertainties) have been responsible for such an increase could not fully be clarified...|$|R
40|$|Northern peatlands in {{permafrost}} regions {{contain a}} large amount of organic carbon (C) in the soil. Climate warming and associated permafrost degradation are expected to have significant impacts on the C balance of these ecosystems, but the magnitude is uncertain. We incorporated a <b>permafrost</b> model, Northern <b>Ecosystem</b> Soil Temperature (NEST), into a biogeochemical model, DeNitrificationDeComposition (DNDC), to model C dynamics in highlatitude peatland ecosystems. The enhanced model was applied to assess effects of permafrost thaw on C fluxes of a subarctic peatland at Stordalen, Sweden. DNDC simulated soil freeze–thaw dynamics, net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 (NEE), and CH 4 fluxes across three typical land cover types, which represent a gradient in the process of ongoing permafrost thaw at Stordalen. Model results were compared with multiyear field measurements, and the validation indicates that DNDC was able to simulate observed differences in seasonal soil thaw, NEE, and CH 4 fluxes across the three land cover types. Consistent with the results from field studies, the modeled C fluxes across the permafrost thaw gradient demonstrate that permafrost thaw and the associated changes in soil hydrology and vegetation not only increase net uptake of C from the atmosphere but also increase the annual to decadal radiative forcing impacts on climate due to increased CH 4 emissions. This study indicates the potential of utilizing biogeochemical models, such as DNDC, to predict the soil thermal regime in permafrost areas and to investigate impacts of <b>permafrost</b> thaw on <b>ecosystem</b> C fluxes after incorporating a permafrost component into the model framework...|$|R

40|$|In {{connection}} with a planned CO 2 storage pilot project in the Arctic, a 60 m long permafrost core was drilled in Adventdalen, Svalbard, representing the poorly studied deep <b>permafrost</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> The on-shore drilling was performed through deltaic, marine and glacial sediments, ending at the bedrock at 60 m. Here, seven different depths in the 3 - 60 m interval of the permafrost core were subjected to culture-independent methods such as 16 S rRNA amplicon 454 pyrosequencing and functional and ribosomal gene quantifications to characterise the microbial community composition and abundance. Additionally, geochemical analyses of extracted pore water have been performed, as well as measurements of carbon content, major elements and grain size distributions. The enumeration of bacterial and archaeal 16 S rRNA genes showed high copy numbers in top sample at 3 m, a decrease at 4. 5 m, and a further decrease from 54 to 60 m. Estimated prokaryotic cell numbers ranged between 3 x 10 ^ 5 and 1 x 10 ^ 8 cells g^- 1 sediment. Detection and quantification of selected functional marker genes indicated that microbial sulphate reduction is more pronounced than methanogenic and methanotrophic processes. A 16 S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing library made with universal prokaryotic primers, revealed a dominance of poorly characterised microbial groups, such as Candidate division TM 7, OP 9, Chloroflexi Subdivision 11, Deep Sea Archaeal Group (DSAG), Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group and Thermoplasmata. The bacterial and archaeal communities at 3 m were {{different from the other}} depths, dominated by Candidate division TM 7 and Halobacteria, respectively. Low salt concentrations, high organic carbon content, high cell numbers and different community structure at 3 m suggested influence of surface-related processes such as migration of carbon and meteoric water at this depth. Microbial community composition and geochemistry suggested an anaerobic habitat throughout the core. From 16. 5 m to 57 m, the uncharacterised DSAG made up 40 - 99 % of the archaeal community, increasing their relative abundance with depth. This dominance was confirmed by DSAG specific qPCR. The primers used for amplicon pyrosequencing caused bias in the amplicon library, most likely due to preferential primer-template annealing of the degenerate forward primer. Both the geochemistry and microbial community composition had a marine signature from 16. 5 m to 57 m, indicating that the marine depositional environment is the main factor determining microbial community structure, rather than the permafrost environment itself.
