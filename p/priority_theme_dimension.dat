40|$|Abstract Background 'Evidence-based policy making' for {{immigrants}} {{is a complicated}} undertaking. In striving toward this goal, federal Canadian partners created the Metropolis Project in 1995 to optimize a two-way transfer of knowledge (researchers – policy makers) within five Canadian Centres of Excellence focused on migrants newly arrived in Canada. Most recently, Metropolis federal partners, including the Public Health Agency of Canada, defined one of six research priority areas as, immigrant 'families, children, and youth'. In order to build on previous work in the partnership, we sought to determine what has been studied within this research-policy partnership about immigrant 'families, children, and youth' since its inception. Methods Annual reports and working papers produced in the five Centres of Excellence between 1996 – 2006 were culled. Data on academic works were extracted, results coded according to eleven stated federal policy <b>priority</b> <b>themes,</b> and analyzed descriptively. Results 139 academic works were reviewed. All federal <b>priority</b> <b>themes,</b> but few specific policy questions were addressed. The greatest volume of policy relevant works were identified for Services (n = 42) and Education and Cultural Identity (n = 39) <b>priority</b> <b>themes.</b> Conclusion Research conducted within the last 10 years is available to inform certain, not all, federal policy questions. Greater specificity in federal priorities {{can be expected to}} more clearly direct future research within this policy-research partnership. </p...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to conduct a needs assessment among health professionals on the themes and skills to be taught during interprofessional education programs in the context of Swiss primary care. A three round Delphi electronic survey was carried out in order to identify <b>priority</b> <b>themes</b> and skills to be included in such a program. Participants comprised 12 categories of health professionals. Seventy-two participated in the first, 41 in the second and 43 in the third round. Patient communication, case management of chronic conditions, therapeutic patient education, health promotion and prevention, ethics and medication were the most important themes identified.

The report was presented by Task Force Chair Rudy Rabbinge at the CGIAR Mid Term Meeting in Nairobi, May 1995. This task force was twinned with the Task Force on Ecoregional Approaches to Research which also reported at MTM 95. Four key {{conclusions of the}} report were {{that there is no}} single remedy to problems of sustainability; that CGIAR centers must adjust the way they conduct research toward more collaboration with others; that centers must recognize the individual characteristics of different ecoregions; and that sufficient financial resources should be available to ensure the success of sustainability oriented research. Possible gaps in the CGIAR research agenda were listed. The approach needed to integrate production, environment, and sustainability concerns. Annexes deal with the evolution of CGIAR research, the CGIAR response to Agenda 21, the concept of production ecology, and <b>priority</b> <b>themes</b> for sustainability research.

40|$|Dr Guy Rocheteau {{proposed}} that <b>priority</b> information <b>themes,</b> {{based on a}} study of the constraints to agricultural development in the ACP countries, could be grouped under six major headings: conquering markets; production intensification and optimization; improvement of natural resource management; mobilization of the civil society; strengthening national agricultural systems; and poverty alleviation in rural areas. With no order of priority implied, these six headings nevertheless gave a common point of reference for the six regional working groups: Pacific, Caribbean and four regions of Africa West, Central, East and Southern Africa. The working groups of ten or twelve people were asked to list the constraints to rural development from a regional perspective. Retaining on this list only those constraints which could be directly linked to a lack of information, each workshop then identified <b>priority</b> information <b>themes</b> for its region.
