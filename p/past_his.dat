5|$|Bradman {{initially}} {{struggled against}} the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Coxon and inside edged it <b>past</b> <b>his</b> leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling {{from the other}} end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first 20 minutes and Australia had scored only 14 after the first 30 minutes. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell's {{most notable}} service {{came during the}} Adriatic {{campaign}} of 1807–1814.
