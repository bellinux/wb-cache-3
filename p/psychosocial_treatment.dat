25|$|When {{compared}} to psychotropic medications, review {{studies have found}} CBT-alone to be as effective for treating less severe forms of depression and anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), tics, substance abuse (with the exception of opioid use disorder), eating disorders, and borderline personality disorder, and it is often recommended in combination with medications for treating other conditions, such as severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder, opioid addiction, bipolar, and psychotic disorders. In addition, CBT is recommended as {{the first line of}} treatment for the majority of psychological disorders in children and adolescents, including aggression and conduct disorder. Researchers have found that other bona fide therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults, but CBT was found to be superior in treating most disorders. Along with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), CBT is recommended in treatment guidelines as a <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatment</b> of choice, and CBT and IPT are the only psychosocial interventions that psychiatry residents are mandated to be trained in.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{published}} <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatment</b> for recurrent isolated sleep paralysis was cognitive-behavior therapy for isolated sleep paralysis (CBT-ISP). CBT-ISP is manualized, has an adherence manual for research purposes, and {{is intended to}} both prevent and disrupt ISP episodes. It begins with self-monitoring of symptoms, cognitive restructuring of maladaptive thoughts relevant to ISP (e.g., [...] "the paralysis will be permanent"), and psychoeducation {{about the nature of}} sleep paralysis. Prevention techniques include ISP-specific sleep hygiene and the preparatory use of various relaxation techniques (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation). [...] Episode disruption techniques are first practiced in session and then applied during actual attacks. [...] No controlled trial of CBT-ISP has yet been conducted to prove its effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> for substance use disorders, the relative {{success of these}} approaches has not been well documented. In this meta-analysis, the authors provide effect sizes for various types of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments,</b> as well as abstinence and treatment-retention rates for cannabis, cocaine, opiate, and polysubstance abuse and dependence treatment trials. Method: With a comprehensive series of literature searches, the authors identified a total of 34 well-controlled treatment conditions—five for cannabis, nine for cocaine, seven for opiate, and 13 for polysubstance users—representing the treatment of 2, 340 patients. <b>Psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> evaluated included contingency management, relapse prevention, general cognitive behavior therapy, and treatments combining cognitive behavior therapy and contingency management. Results: Overall, controlled trial data suggest that <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> provide benefits reflecting a moderate effect size according to Cohen’s standards. These interventions were most efficacious for cannabis use and least efficacious for polysubstance use. The strongest effect was found for contingency management interventions. Approximately one-third of participants across all <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> dropped out before treatment completion compared to 44. 6 % for the control conditions. Conclusions: Effect sizes for <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> for illicit drugs ranged from the low-moderate to high-moderate range, depending on the substance disorder and treatment under study. Given the long-term social, emotional, and cognitive impairments associated with substance use disorders, these effect sizes are noteworthy and comparable to those for other efficacious treatments in psychiatry...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{biomedical}} {{products are}} required {{to be tested for}} safety with respect to vulnerable organ systems, <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> are not required to be tested for safety with respect to vulnerable social systems such as the family. This article provides some evidence for the need to document the potential negative effects of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> on family-level outcomes. Three randomized controlled trials are reviewed in which independent ratings or self-reports of family functioning were measured. Each of the 3 studies compared the efficacy of a family and a nonfamily treatment. Totally unexpectedly, the nonfamily treatment in each of the 3 trials demonstrated significant declines in family functioning. The authors suggest that <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> with vulnerable populations have the potential to produce negative side effects on families. Therefore, it is important to conduct further research to determine whether safety studies should be required for <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R

50|$|When {{there is}} a serious lack of and need for {{community-based}} rehabilitation programmes, including behavioural and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatment</b> programmes, (page 5) it is difficult for the client to get medical back-up for the therapy which can makes the treatment less effective.

30|$|The {{participants}} with comorbid anxiety disorders ranked {{more severe than}} those without on several measures.

Although the treatments did not specifically target the anxiety disorder, the participants made significant improvements in anxiety symptoms. Despite greater illness severity, patients with comorbid anxiety disorders can make substantial gains from psychosocial interventions targeting BD. Even in the presence of an anxiety disorder, they are able to attend to the content of the <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments</b> and apply it to better manage their condition. The presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder should not be considered a deterrent to offering BD-focused <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|R

50|$|Interpersonal {{psychotherapy}} (IPT) is a brief, attachment-focused psychotherapy that {{centers on}} resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery. It is an empirically supported treatment (EST) that follows a highly structured and time-limited approach and {{is intended to}} be completed within 12-16 weeks. IPT is based on the principle that relationships and life events impact mood and that the reverse is also true. It was developed by Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman for major depression in the 1970s and has since been adapted for other mental disorders. IPT is an empirically validated intervention for depressive disorders, and is more effective when used in combination with psychiatric medications. Along with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), IPT is recommended in treatment guidelines as a <b>psychosocial</b> <b>treatment</b> of choice, and IPT and CBT are the only psychosocial interventions in which psychiatry residents in the United States are mandated to be trained for professional practice.|$|E
