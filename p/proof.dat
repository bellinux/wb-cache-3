5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable <b>proof</b> system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable <b>proof</b> system, a <b>proof</b> is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid <b>proof</b> {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The <b>proof</b> is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the <b>proof</b> string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the <b>proof,</b> without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid <b>proof</b> must always be accepted. However, an invalid <b>proof</b> may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid <b>proof,</b> the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>proof</b> coins were issued at the {{suggestion}} of Barber and Superintendent Bosbyshell. Ellsworth was enthusiastic, intending the special strikes as gifts, but was forced to share them with Company president Higinbotham, to Ellsworth's dismay. The <b>proof</b> coins for the year 1892 represented the first hundred coins struck, as well as numbers 400, 1492, and 1892. The total number of <b>proof</b> coins struck for 1893 is less certain: R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins states that approximately 100 proofs were struck for 1893, but numismatist Ira Goldberg in a 2011 article gives the number as fewer than ten. The first coin struck in the year 1893, in <b>proof,</b> is in the possession of the Chicago Historical Society. The Mint gave consideration to including the Columbian half dollar in <b>proof</b> sets, but at the time it sold <b>proof</b> coins for only a few cents above face value, and it would have to sell the <b>proof</b> Columbians for more than $1 so as to avoid devaluing the uncirculated commemoratives. Mint authorities decided against a public sale of <b>proof</b> Columbians.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of <b>proof</b> of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of <b>proof</b> could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by {{the production of the}} detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of <b>proof,</b> a burden of <b>proof</b> fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E

The introduction of Soft <b>Proofing</b> Systems [...] {{with the ability to}} quickly produce <b>proofs</b> at each step in the color reproduction process for a lower cost than conventional <b>proofs</b> [...] has been cited as a factor in changing the economies of this market. According to a research project conducted by Print Industries Market Information and Research Organization (PRIMIR, 2005) titled Dynamics and Trends in Color <b>Proofing</b> 2005 - 2010, only 1 % of the final contract <b>proofs</b> made by respondents were color-managed monitor <b>proofs.</b> This percentage was expected to increase 8 % by 2010. A pertinent question as to the future of <b>proofing</b> {{is the extent to which}} soft <b>proofs</b> have replaced other <b>proofing</b> technologies. The purpose of this quantitative research project is to determine the current adoption level of soft <b>proofing</b> systems for producing final contract <b>proofs</b> in general commercial color lithographic printing organizations, as well as the perception of both technical and job- related factors that influence judgments and decision of soft <b>proofs</b> as compare to hard <b>proofs</b> among printing companies in the US...|$|R

The 1999 <b>proof</b> was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other <b>proof</b> Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance.

5|$|To {{transform}} a probabilistically checkable <b>proof</b> system {{of this type}} into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the <b>proof</b> checker. That is, a vertex is defined {{by one of the}} possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the <b>proof.</b> Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) <b>proof</b> string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that <b>proof</b> string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a <b>proof</b> string that many <b>proof</b> checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid <b>proof</b> string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all <b>proof</b> strings are invalid, each <b>proof</b> string has {{only a small number of}} checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P=NP.|$|E

5|$|Also around 1995, Kontsevich {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a quintic threefold, and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, Alexander Givental posted a paper that claimed to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, so there were doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent <b>proof</b> {{in a series of}} papers. Despite controversy over who had published the first <b>proof,</b> these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical <b>proof</b> of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry.
