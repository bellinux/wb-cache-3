Their tensile strength was determined. The {{variation of the}} tensile strength with weight fraction <b>of</b> the <b>rovings</b> was studied. The tensile strength was found to increase with rovings content. The morphology of the cryogenically fractured surfaces indicated good bonding between the matrix and the reinforcement when a coupling agent was used.

50|$|A roving is a {{long and}} narrow bundle <b>of</b> fiber. <b>Rovings</b> are {{produced}} {{during the process of}} making spun yarn from wool fleece, raw cotton, or other fibres.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{characterize}} fiber reinforcements used in the pultrusion process in terms of compressibility and permeability. The compressibility of single and multiple layers of reinforcement are obtained by applying a defined compression load ramp to the material positioned into a tool mounted to a universal testing machine. The results are used to estimate the number <b>of</b> <b>rovings</b> which can be fed to the process for a given die cross section as well as quantity and type of planar reinforcements. A tool with a central injection nozzle is employed for the permeability measurements. The tool allows the monitoring of unsaturated as well as saturated flow through pressure transducers located at different positions within the cavity. The principal permeability parameters in the plane K 1 and K 2 are obtained. The results provide important input data for pultrusion process simulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{interface}} on the mechanical properties of glass fibre/phenolic composites {{is discussed in}} this paper. Standard and silane modified resins are used as matrix, and a yam and two kinds <b>of</b> <b>rovings</b> with different sizing are used as reinforcement. The effect of fibre on wetting is evaluated, and it is shown that sizing specially developed for phenolic resin is quite effective to improve resin impregnation into the fibre bundle. The mechanical properties are evaluated by using the resin impregnated unidirectional fibre bundle composite specimens. The effects of resin and fibre on strength and crack propagation are evaluated by the lateral compression test. The type of the fibre affected the dispersion of fibres in the matrix resin, and the roving developed for phenolic resin gave the best dispersion of the fibre. This led the high mechanical properties and high resistance to the crack initiation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} {{properties}} of glass fibres after thermal conditioning at typical engineering thermoplastic processing temperatures are presented. The mechanical performance <b>of</b> <b>rovings</b> and single fibres of well-defined silane sized and water sized E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to 400 °C. Thermal conditioning for 15 minutes led to strength degradation of greater than 50 % at higher temperatures. The tensile strength of silane coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 °C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. The water sized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution of the water sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three parameter Weibull distribution. The strength distributions of the sized fibres were more complicated and required the use of a bimodal Weibull distribution. The results are discussed in terms of the changes in surface coating and bulk glass structure during heat conditioning...|$|R
40|$|Textile {{reinforced}} concrete (TRC) {{is a composite}} <b>of</b> <b>rovings</b> (multi filament yarns) and fine grained concrete which is used in civil engineering to fabricate new structural elements and to strengthen existing constructions. The proposed multi-scale approach {{is based on a}} hierarchical material description on the micro, the meso and the macro scale. The paper deals with structural models of the macro scale, using the detailed information of the micro- and the mesoscopic models to simulate the behavior of typical structural members made of {{reinforced concrete}}. Due to the textile reinforcement in TRC the crack opening displacements are very small. This leads to the major influence of the post cracking behavior of concrete on the overall response of the structural member. In the case of a steel and textile reinforced concrete plate the simulated crack width of the meso model is used to capture this effect within the framework of a multi-scale analysis. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher The Micro-Meso-Macro-Prediction Model of textile reinforced concrete Textile reinforced concrete is a new kind of a cementitious composite. In contradiction to short fiber reinforced concrete the reinforcement is an open textile structure made of continuous AR-glass or carbon <b>rovings.</b> One <b>of</b> the biggest advantage of TRC is the quasi-ductile behavior after matrix cracking which is important for applications in civil engineering. This is due to the crack bridging <b>of</b> the <b>rovings</b> and the debonding of the roving-matrix-interface. The open reinforcement structure – so called lay-ups – leads to a crack pattern with very small crack openings in conjunction with small crack spacings. Furthermor...|$|R
