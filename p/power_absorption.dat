Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him {{and most of the}} other Conduits. The United States government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world's remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative [...] "Bio-Terrorists". [...] The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of <b>Power</b> <b>Absorption,</b> allowing him to use other Conduits' powers. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail [...] "Fetch" [...] Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex- who uses her Neon powers to hunt down the illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video gamer who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.|$|E

[...] Even a small Tesla coil {{produces}} many times the electrical energy necessary to stop the heart, if the frequency happens to be low enough to cause ventricular fibrillation. [...] A minor misadjustment of the coil could result in electrocution. [...] In addition, the RF current heats the tissues it passes through. Tesla coil currents, applied directly to the skin by electrodes, were used in the early 20th century for deep body tissue heating in the medical field of longwave diathermy. [...] The amount of heating depends on the current density, which depends on the power output of the Tesla coil and the cross-sectional area of the path the current takes through the body to ground. [...] Particularly if it passes through narrow structures such as blood vessels or joints it may raise the local tissue temperature to hyperthermic levels, [...] "cooking" [...] internal organs or causing other injuries. [...] International ICNIRP safety standards for RF current in the body in the Tesla coil frequency range of 0.1 - 1MHz specify a maximum current density of 0.2mA per square centimeter and a maximum <b>power</b> <b>absorption</b> rate (SAR) in tissue of 4W/kg in limbs and 0.8W/kg average over the body. [...] Even low power Tesla coils could exceed these limits, and it is generally impossible to determine the threshold current where bodily injury begins.
