50|$|General {{bacterial}} <b>porins</b> are {{a family}} of proteins from the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. The <b>porins</b> act as molecular filters for hydrophilic compounds. They {{are responsible for the}} 'molecular sieve' properties of the outer membrane. <b>Porins</b> form large water-filled channels which allow the diffusion of hydrophilic molecules into the periplasmic space. Some <b>porins</b> form general diffusion channels that allow any solute up to a certain size (that size is known as the exclusion limit) to cross the membrane, while other <b>porins</b> are specific for one particular solute and contain a binding site for that solute inside the pores (these are known as selective <b>porins).</b> As <b>porins</b> are the major outer membrane proteins, they also serve as receptor sites for the binding of phages and bacteriocins.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>porins</b> {{purified}} from Salmonella typhimurium on the complement system was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of <b>porins</b> with either human or guinea pig serum {{resulted in the}} consumption of the total complement activity when an amount of <b>porins</b> ranging from 8 to 10 micrograms per 100 microliters of serum was used. The activation of the complement system was temperature dependent, suggesting an active process rather than passive adsorption of the complement components by <b>porins.</b> In addition, the activation had a fast kinetic and proceeded mainly through the classical pathway. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} consumption of C 1 s and C 4 in normal human serum treated with <b>porins</b> and also by the depletion of C 3 activity in the C 1 s-deficient serum which was marked only when purified C 1 s was added to the serum before incubation with <b>porins.</b> Injection of 100 micrograms of <b>porins</b> into guinea pigs induced profound complement consumption at 6 h postinjection that persisted up to 12 h. We conclude from this study that <b>porins</b> can effectively contribute to complement activation and to subsequent biological events induced by gram-negative bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{activity of}} <b>porins</b> purified from Salmonella typhimurium has been investigated. <b>Porins</b> (0. 3 to 30 micrograms) {{injected into the}} rat paw induced a dose-related edema that was not due to lipopolysaccharide contamination and {{did not appear to}} be dependent on the activation of the complement system. The edema induced by 30 micrograms of <b>porins</b> was comparable to that caused by 1 mg of carrageenin and was inhibited by indomethacin (5 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0. 1 mg/kg). <b>Porins</b> (1 to 10 micrograms/ml) induced a concentration-related release of histamine from rat peritoneal cells.

40|$|Bacterial <b>porins</b> {{enhance the}} {{thrombin}} activity upon chromogen substrate chromozym. Should porin-dependent enhancement of thrombin activity take place also upon fibrinogen in vivo, this might greatly increase the fibrin production which, in turn, {{might lead to}} blood vessel obstruction. In this study, we demonstrate fibrin hyperproduction in a simplified coagulative system, consisting of fibrinogen and thrombin-pure molecules, {{in the presence of}} bacterial <b>porins.</b> In particular, bacterial <b>porins,</b> in the presence of thrombin, significantly increased the fibrin production compared with thrombin alone. Also, fibrin hyperproduction took place even {{in the presence of the}} thrombin inhibitors antithrombin III (AT III) or α 2 macroglobulin (α 2 M). However, the thrombin–fibrinogen reaction in the presence of AT III or α 2 M did not generate fibrin, unless <b>porins</b> were present. In conclusion, <b>porins</b> not only enhance thrombin activity but also inhibit the antithrombin activity exerted by AT III or α 2 M. We hypothesize that, because of <b>porins</b> activity, fibrin is largely generated due to thrombin hyperactivation. Moreover, further fibrin is produced by thrombin, which is not blocked by two serpins for the presence of <b>porins.</b> These results might be relevant as to the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation in sepsis by gram-negative bacteria, which are known to produce <b>porins...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{coefficients}} ci {{were determined}} empirically for a 1 M KCl solution, using MD simulations to benchmark the ion radial distribution functions against Equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations. The effect of hydration shells {{was found to}} be important in simulations at higher salt concentrations where the conductance of many ion channels, <b>porin</b> among them, is observed to saturate as the salt concentration in the electrolyte baths is further increased. Earlier simulations that did not include a model of hydration shells did not reproduce the conductance saturation behavior. This suggests an additional repulsive potential acting to prevent ion crowding, and hence limiting the concentration of ions and current density in the confined space of the pore even at high bath salt concentration. When the repulsive potential was included moderate channel conductance was observed.|$|E

In this study we analyzed the role of several inhibitors of the MEK/ERK signal pathway on the induction of proinflammatory and immunological cytokines in U 937 cell line stimulated by Salmonella typhimurium <b>porins</b> and compared it to the cytokine induction after LPS stimulation.

We also compared their effect with that elicited by P. haemolytica, P, multocida and S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) whose biological activity is well known.

Incubation of macrophages with IFN-gamma in the presence of <b>porins</b> increased NO release, whereas incubation in the presence of the arginine analog N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA) inhibited NO release. The greatest NO release was obtained using <b>porins</b> at a concentration of 5 mu g/mL. <b>Porins,</b> together with IFN-gamma, were also able to upregulate the mRNA expression of iNOS.

40|$|<b>Porins</b> are trimeric {{proteins}} that constitute water-filled pores that allow transmembrane diffusion of small solutes through the outer membrane layer of gram-negative bacteria. The <b>porins</b> {{are capable of}} inserting into the membranes of eucaryotic cells, and {{in the present study}} we have examined the in vitro effects on neutrophil functions of the following purified porins: meningococcal outer membrane protein classes 1 and 3 and gonococcal outer membrane protein 1 B (P 1 B). The neisserial <b>porins</b> inhibited human neutrophil chemoattractant-induced actin polymerization and degranulation of both primary and secondary granules. The neutrophil expression of immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptors II (Fc gamma RII; CDw 32) and III (Fc gamma RIII; CD 16), as well as the activation-dependent downregulation of Fc gamma RIII, were reduced by the meningococcal and gonococcal <b>porins.</b> The neisserial <b>porins</b> impaired the upregulation of complement receptors 1 (CD 35) and 3 (CD 11 b) and inhibited the phagocytic capacity of neutrophils, as evaluated by the uptake of meningococci (strain 44 / 76) in the presence of patient serum containing known amounts of IgG against meningococcal <b>porins.</b> The <b>porins</b> also primed neutrophils to increase their intracellular hydrogen peroxide production in response to FMLP, whereas no such priming was observed if the neutrophil protein kinase C was stimulated directly with phorbol myristate acetate. The neisserial <b>porins</b> influenced neutrophil functions in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The meningococcal class 1 outer membrane protein and the gonococcal P 1 B tended to alter neutrophil functions more than the meningococcal class 3 protein. Thus, the neisserial <b>porins</b> inhibited human neutrophil actin polymerization, degranulation, opsonin receptor expression, and phagocytosis but primed the neutrophils to increase their oxidative burst.
