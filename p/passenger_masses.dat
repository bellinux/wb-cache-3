Road and railway systems, respectively, support passenger flows of 3. 57 E 9 p-km (passengers per km) per year and 0. 17 E 9 p-km per year and commodity flows of 2. 5 E 9 t-km (tonnes per km) per year and 0. 35 E 9 t-km per year, generating a total energy consumption equal to 1. 84 E 5 tonnes of oil equivalent per year. The <b>passenger</b> <b>mass</b> transport on road (buses) shows globally the best performance among the patterns investigated, while railway ranks higher for commodity transport, according to most of the calculated intensity indicators. Several improvement options are also evaluated {{on the basis of the}} first- and second-order exergy efficiency. Some of the suggested improvements, even showing high theoretical possibility, do not match the transport needs of the investigated area, as indicated by their huge material and emergy intensities (measures of ecological footprints) even if it cannot be excluded that they may appear more appropriate to nationwide transportation patterns. In conclusion, although data and indicators refer to a well identified region under specific geographic and socio-economic conditions, results suggest that a complex system such as transport is very unlikely to be described by a linear relation between input resource and output service delivered. Even when thermodynamically based approaches are properly used to describe the system behavior, findings very often do not converge, and require that different indicators are compared to yield a comprehensive picture of the system dynamics. An integrated approach is therefore suggested to support decision making in the presence of diverging results...|$|R

50|$|In 1994 and 1995, British Rail {{was split}} into infrastructure, maintenance, rolling stock, {{passenger}} and freight companies, which were privatised from 1996 to 1997. The privatisation has delivered very mixed results with healthy <b>passenger</b> growth, <b>mass</b> refurbishment of infrastructure, investment in new rolling stock, and safety improvements being offset by concerns over network capacity {{and the overall}} cost to the taxpayer, which has increased due to growth in passenger numbers. It has also led to some confusion as to who looks after {{different aspects of the}} rail service among the general public. This is because, for example, different companies run the tracks to those that run the trains and locomotives. Since privatisation, passenger levels have more than doubled and have surpassed the level they had been at in the late 1940s. However, while the price of anytime and off-peak tickets has increased, the price of Advance tickets has dramatically decreased in real terms: the average Advance ticket in 1995 cost £9.14 (in 2014 prices) compared to £5.17 in 2014. Subsidies to the rail industry have slightly increased from £3.7bn in 1992-93 to £3.9bn in 2012-13 (in 2013 prices) but more than halved in terms of subsidy per journey from £4.98 to £2.46.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to analyse}} the impact of exogenous factors on efficiency of airlines based in the Asia Pacific using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. In measuring the efficiency of different airlines, {{the effects of the}} environment (exogenous factors) and the effects of productive efficiency are isolated. Exogenous factors refer to essentials outside the control of the firms while productive efficiency signifies the individual airline’s profitability state of affairs through a lengthy period of time. The focal point of this study revolves around the epidemic period of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the widespread which put the global airline industry and especially the Asia Pacific, into turmoil from February 2003, and lasted almost 6 months into the year. In June 2003, the height of the SARS pandemic saw passenger boardings at major hubs dwindled significantly, threatening even the most profitable airlines to file for bankruptcy. Because SARS mostly affected travel hubs such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Bangkok, Singapore and outside of Asia Pacific, Canada, airlines included in this study are concentrated on these few airport hubs. Representing the airline industry within the Northeast Asia (NEA) region are Cathay Pacific Airways (CX) of Hong Kong and China Airlines (CI) of Taiwan. In Southeast Asia (SEA), airlines involved in this study are Singapore Airlines (SQ) and Thai Airways International (TG). Also, the basis {{of this study is to}} ascertain of these four most affected airlines, which counter the impact of SARS more efficiently and how long the lagging effect SARS has on these airlines. According to Yu (1998), there are two approaches to account for the effects of exogenous factors: 1) Stochastic Frontier Method: a one-step procedure which includes exogenous variables directly in estimating the efficiency measures; 2) Data Envelopment Analysis: a two-step approach which firstly estimates the relative gross efficiencies using both inputs and outputs and then, analyses the effects of exogenous variables on the gross efficiency. In this study, however, the Data Envelopment Analysis technique will be employed in ascertaining the efficiency of these selected airlines in Asia Pacific during turbulent times. A comparison will be carried out between these four major carriers to establish their relative efficiency to rebound from the unprecedented impact of SARS. It will be seen how the fastest growing region, the Asia Pacific, can counter adverse effect of exogenous factors and continue with the upward trends in both <b>passenger</b> <b>mass</b> and cargo traffic while most established airlines in America and Europe spiraled downwards in times of crisis. The Malmquist DEA methods are subsequently adopted to calculated indices of total factor productivity (TFP) change, scale efficiency change,technological change, technical efficiency change and pure technical efficiency change...|$|R

In the inertial frame, {{this is the}} only force on the car and passenger. Center panel: an exploded view in the inertial frame. The passenger is subject to the accelerating force ma. The seat (assumed of negligible mass) is compressed between the reaction force -ma and the applied force from the car ma. The car is subject to the net acceleration force Ma that is the difference between the applied force (m + M)a from the axle and the reaction from the seat −ma. Bottom panel: an exploded view in the non-inertial frame. In the non-inertial frame where the car is not accelerating, the force from the axle is balanced by a fictitious backward force −(m + M)a, a portion −Ma applied to the car, and −ma to the passenger. The car is subject to the fictitious force −Ma and the force (m + M)a from the axle. The difference between these forces ma is applied to the seat, which exerts a reaction −ma upon the car, so zero net force is applied to the car. The seat (assumed massless) transmits the force ma to the passenger, who is subject also to the fictitious force −ma, resulting in zero net force on the passenger. The passenger exerts a reaction force −ma upon the seat, which is therefore compressed. In all frames the compression of the seat is the same, and the force delivered by the axle is the same.|$|R
