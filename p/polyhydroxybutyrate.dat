Synthetic biological engineering approaches biology from an engineering perspective to make biology easier to engineer. The potential to engineer microorganisms for novel applications can have far-reaching implications and benefits for society. Some of the potential applications range from biosensors, biofuels, therapeutics, and biomaterials. In this study two biomaterials were produced in genetically engineered Escherichia coli: <b>polyhydroxybutyrates</b> (PHBs) and spider silk. PHBs are bioplastics that have similar properties to petrochemical-derived plastics. Synthetic biological engineering can be used to optimize PHB extraction from E. coli by secretion of the PHB polymer outside of the cell.

However, major problems in commercializing PHB is the high production cost due to expensive carbon substrates and tedious production procedures using pure cultures. Therefore, the applications of mixed cultures and cheap carbon sources have been explored. In this study, the biopolymer fermentor has to scale up from shake flask to 10 L of stirred tank fermentor. This is to increase the mass production of PHB that produced by Cupriavidus necator.

Wautersia eutropha can transiently accumulate PHB {{when it is}} grown in a nutrient-rich medium (up to 23 % of the cell dry weight in dextrose-free tryptic soy broth [TSB]). PHB homeostasis under these growth conditions was examined by quantitative Western analysis to monitor the proteins present, their levels, and changes in their levels over a 48 -h growth period. The proteins examined include PhaC (the synthase), PhaP (a phasin), PhaR (a transcription factor), and PhaZ 1 a, PhaZ 1 b, and PhaZ 1 c (putative intracellular depolymerases), as well as PhaZ 2 (a hydroxybutyrate oligomer hydrolase).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of ChemistryPing LiBiodegradable <b>polyhydroxybutyrates</b> (PHBs) {{produced}} by {{a wide range of}} bacteria have been considered as an ideal alternative to petroleum-based plastics. Two types of mechanistic probes have been synthesized {{in order to understand the}} mechanism of PHB synthases (PhaCs). The first type is oxo analogs in which the sulfur in the coenzyme A (CoA) thioester has been replaced with an oxygen atom. A series of 3 -R-hydroxybutyryl oxo CoA analogs, (HB) [subscript]nOCoA (n = 1, 2 and 3), were synthesized chemoenzymatically in good yields. Two models involving covalent catalysis with Cys have been proposed for the chain elongation catalyzed by PhaCs. The first involves an active site composed of two monomers in which the growing hydroxybutyrate (HB) chain alternates between Cys on each monomer. The second involves noncovalent intermediates (HB) [subscript]nCoA (n ≥ 2). Here the substrate analog HBOCoA was successfully employed to trap the noncovalent intermediates in the reactions catalyzed by class III PhaC from Allochromatium Vinosum, which supports our preferred second mechanistic model. Furthermore, it is also the first time that a wild-type (wt) synthase was used to investigate the chain elongation models. The other type of mechanistic probes is 3 -R-hydroxyalkyl CoA that was used to investigate the substrate specificity of PhaCs from different classes. Substrate availability has been a challenge to study PHB synthases in vitro. Starting with commercially available dimethyl S-malate, the intermediate S-ethyl 2 -(oxiran- 2 -yl) acetate 23 was synthesized via a ring-opening reaction involving lactone 21 and trimethylsilyl iodide followed by an oxidation reaction involving silver oxide. The regiospecific ring-opening reaction of epoxide 23 with different organometallic reagents afforded a straightforward access to ethyl 3 -R-hydroxybutanoates attached with a variety of side chains. The final CoA compounds were obtained through the thiotransesterification reaction between corresponding benzenethioesters and the thiol group in CoA. This synthetic approach provides a new avenue to modifications of alkyl groups in 3 -R-hydroxyalkyl CoA in an efficient manner...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polyhydroxybutyrates</b> (PHBs) are {{biodegradable}} polymers {{produced by}} {{bacteria in the}} form of insoluble granules for carbon storage. Insights into the mechanisms of granule formation are important for improving commercial PHB production and engineering new alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. Using both biochemical and imaging methods, we examined PHB granule formation in the model gram-negative bacterium, Ralstonia eutropha H 16. In order to examine initiation and elongation of PHB polymerization in vivo, an N-terminally Strep 2 -tagged PHB synthase was isolated from R. eutropha using a strain in which the native phaC gene was replaced with the affinity tagged gene. Activity assays of the Strep 2 -PhaCRe revealed no lag phase in CoA release, indicating the presence of PHB primed synthase in vivo. Further analysis showed that the primed synthase was associated with soluble, large molecular weight PHB and the phasin protein PhaP 1 in a high molecular weight (HMW) complex. Based on the composition and activity of the HMW complex, we propose that we have isolated soluble granule precursors, supporting a cytoplasmic model for granule formation. The stoichiometric relationships between PhaC, PhaPI, and PHB in vivo were next examined in wt R. eutropha as a function growth time in nitrogen limited PHBHigh medium. Studies demonstrated that the ratio of PHB/PhaP 1 remained constant throughout growth, between 1 and 2, while the PHB/PhaC ratio increased with time, suggesting increasing re-initiation events. These relationships were further measured in PhaP 1 deletion and overexpression strains. The structural and kinetic effects of PhaP 1 on in vitro reactions with PhaC and [1 - C]-HBCoA were also examined. The results suggest a model for granule self-assembly by PhaC, PhaP 1, and HBCoA alone, in which PhaP 1 helps to "fold" the PHB chains and the PhaP 1 /PhaC ratio controls the degree of polymer reinitiation. Finally, PHB granule localization during formation was examined in live R. eutropha cells using PhaP 1 labeled with the biarsenical fluorescent dye FlAsH. Fluorescence microscopy showed no specific polar or membrane localization during granule formation in PHBHigh medium. In collaboration with the Jensen lab at Caltech, granule localization was also studied using cryoelectron tomography. Together, the imaging results eliminate a membrane budding model for granule formation. by Mimi Cho. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Chemistry, 2012.
