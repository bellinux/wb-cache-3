5|$|Inside of his chansons, {{he often}} used a cantus firmus, {{sometimes}} a <b>popular</b> <b>song</b> whose origin {{can no longer}} be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion. Other times he used a tune originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a <b>popular</b> <b>song</b> and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent ("The problem with money"), a song sung by a man who wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.|$|E

5|$|Cho {{offered some}} of the {{earliest}} contributions to Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. His most famous work is Mt. Paektu (1947), a lyrical epic praising Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities and promoting him as a suitable leader for the new North Korean state. Other notable works by Cho include , a seemingly non-political love poem which was later adapted as a <b>popular</b> <b>song</b> that is known in both North and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is {{a studio}} album by American R singer-songwriter and {{musician}} Ray Charles. It was recorded by Charles in February 1962 at Capitol Studios in New York City and at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, before being released in April {{of that year}} by ABC-Paramount Records.

It featured country, folk, and Western music standards reworked by Charles in <b>popular</b> <b>song</b> forms of the time, including R, pop, and jazz.|$|E
5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a <b>popular</b> <b>song</b> in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{music in}} Taiwan was {{established}} in the 1930s. Although published records and <b>popular</b> <b>songs</b> already existed in Taiwan before the 1930s, the quality and popularity of most of them was very poor. This was mainly because <b>popular</b> <b>songs</b> at the time differed slightly from traditional music like folk songs and Taiwanese opera. However, because of the rapid development of cinema and broadcasting during the 1930s, new <b>popular</b> <b>songs</b> that stepped away from traditional influences began to appear and become widespread {{in a short period of}} time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Research {{shows that}} studies on {{popular culture and}} media are {{thriving}} and identity formation is the area that has the largest impact on people. Women are represented in popular culture and media in diverse forms and shapes. This study investigates the various facets of Asian female identity as portrayed in Asian <b>popular</b> <b>songs.</b> The call for analysing the notion of female identity in Asian <b>popular</b> <b>songs</b> is of particular importance because songs and music not only reflect culture but are significant in ideologically encoded cultural transmission. This paper attempts to explore {{the ways in which}} the Asian <b>popular</b> <b>songs</b> produce women’s sense of who they are, and map out identity constructs of women as represented in Asian <b>popular</b> <b>songs.</b> The analysis is carried out through an examination of the content and features of images of women and issues related to them in a selection of <b>popular</b> <b>songs</b> from three regions in Asia, namely South-East Asia (Malaysia), South-West Asia (Iran) and East Asia (Lebanon). A fundamental focus of the analysis is to identify the recurring images in the corpus of <b>popular</b> <b>songs</b> in order to determine the consolidated images that represent the social and cultural aspects of Asian women’s identities...|$|R

5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical <b>popular</b> <b>song,</b> was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E
5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a <b>popular</b> <b>song.</b> Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|Polish music, {{including}} orchestras, {{also went}} underground. Top Polish musicians and directors (Adam Didur, Zbigniew Drzewiecki, Jan Ekier, Barbara Kostrzewska, Zygmunt Latoszewski, Jerzy Lefeld, Witold Lutosławski, Andrzej Panufnik, Piotr Perkowski, Edmund Rudnicki, Eugenia Umińska, Jerzy Waldorff, Kazimierz Wiłkomirski, Maria Wiłkomirska, Bolesław Woytowicz, Mira Zimińska) performed in restaurants, cafes, and private homes, {{with the most}} daring singing patriotic ballads on the streets while evading German patrols. Patriotic songs were written, such as Siekiera, motyka, the most <b>popular</b> <b>song</b> of occupied Warsaw. Patriotic puppet shows were staged. Jewish musicians (e.g. Władysław Szpilman) and artists likewise performed in ghettos and even in concentration camps. Although many of them died, some survived abroad, like Alexandre Tansman in the United States, and Eddie Rosner and Henryk Wars in the Soviet Union.|$|E
