40|$|Megaprojects are characterised by complexity, {{uncertainty}} {{and a long}} record of poor delivering. Most of them are delivered with organisational forms called ‘Special Purpose Entities’ (SPEs). Despite the key role <b>played</b> by <b>SPEs</b> {{there is a huge}} gap in the project management literature about SPEs and their links with project performances. This paper paves the way to this research stream by building the ontology of SPEs, which is critical since there is a vast misperception about ‘what are’ and ‘what do’ and ‘why are necessary’ the SPEs. In particular, there are three main domains of studies: Legal, Financial and Management (predominantly project management). In the project management domain the SPEs have the main purposes of establish partnerships and enable the project financing...|$|R
40|$|SummaryReinforcement {{learning}} (RL) uses sequential {{experience with}} situations (“states”) and outcomes to assess actions. Whereas model-free RL uses this experience directly, {{in the form}} of a reward prediction error (RPE), model-based RL uses it indirectly, building a model of the state transition and outcome structure of the environment, and evaluating actions by searching this model. A state prediction error (<b>SPE)</b> <b>plays</b> a central role, reporting discrepancies between the current model and the observed state transitions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans solving a probabilistic Markov decision task, we found the neural signature of an SPE in the intraparietal sulcus and lateral prefrontal cortex, in addition to the previously well-characterized RPE in the ventral striatum. This finding supports the existence of two unique forms of learning signal in humans, which may form the basis of distinct computational strategies for guiding behavior...|$|R
40|$|On demand single photon {{emitters}} (<b>SPEs)</b> <b>play</b> a {{key role}} across {{a broad range of}} quantum technologies, including quantum computation, quantum simulation, quantum metrology and quantum communications. In quantum networks and quantum key distribution protocols, where photons are employed as flying qubits, telecom wavelength operation is preferred due to the reduced fibre loss. However, despite the tremendous efforts to develop various triggered SPE platforms, a robust source of triggered SPEs operating at room temperature and the telecom wavelength is still missing. Here we report a triggered, optically stable, room temperature solid state SPE operating at telecom wavelengths. The emitters exhibit high photon purity (~ 5 % multiphoton events) and a record-high brightness of ~ 1. 5 MHz. The emission is attributed to localized defects in a gallium nitride (GaN) crystal. The high performance SPEs embedded in a technologically mature semiconductor are promising for on-chip quantum simulators and practical quantum communication technologies.

30|$|Finally, {{some models}} have been {{proposed}} to describe {{at a higher level}} the organization of data processing architectures that include stream processing components. In this context, the seminal work by Nathan Marz proposes the well known Lambda architecture to meet the need for low latency, while guaranteeing exact and reliable results on “old” data [36]. The Lambda architecture was conceived when SPEs did not provide full support for distributed, fault-tolerant, and stateful computations and were used as a speed layer that could provide approximate results. The Lambda architecture couples this speed layer with a batch layer that runs periodic batch jobs to generate higher-latency, exact results. When the data is queried, the serving layer encapsulates the complex logic that decides whether to serve the results of the speed layer—recent, but possibly inaccurate—or those of the batch layer—accurate, but possibly outdated. More recent proposals are questioning this type of architecture because of its complexity and high maintenance costs, and foster the development of stream-only architectures, where the <b>SPE</b> <b>plays</b> a more central role. 12 All these models study the integration of SPEs within a data processing architecture, and do not consider the detailed execution semantics of the SPE, as SECRET does.|$|R
40|$|Solid polymer {{electrolyte}} (SPE) {{composed of}} semi-crystalline poly (vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) [P(VdF-HFP) ] copolymer, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethyl sulphonyl) imide [EMI-BTI] and graphene oxide (GO) was prepared and its performance evaluated. The effects of GO nano-filler were investigated {{in terms of}} enhancement in ionic conductivity along with the electrochemical properties of its electrical double layer capacitors (EDLC). The GO-doped SPE shows improvement in ionic conductivity compared to the P(VdF-HFP) -[EMI-BTI] SPE system due {{to the existence of}} the abundant oxygen-containing functional group in GO that assists in the improvement of the ion mobility in the polymer matrix. The complexation of the materials in the SPE is confirmed in X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies. The electrochemical performance of EDLC fabricated with GO-doped SPE is examined using cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge techniques. The maximum specific capacitance obtained is 29. 6 F∙g− 1, which is observed at a scan rate of 3 mV/s in 6 wt % GO-doped, SPE-based EDLC. It also has excellent cyclic retention as it is able keep the performance of the EDLC at 94 % even after 3000 cycles. These results suggest GO doped <b>SPE</b> <b>plays</b> a significant role in energy storage application...|$|R
30|$|Green {{materials}} have emerged has a challenging concept in research {{to satisfy the}} sustainable development and provide future generation to avail their own needs. This motivation among researchers has led to many engineered material in medical field and devices like battery, or supercapacitor in energy field. Only few literatures are available in which either the device as a whole or the materials in it are biodegradable [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The main materials like electrode material and electrolyte especially solid polymer electrolyte (<b>SPE)</b> <b>play</b> {{an important role in}} maintaining leak proof, better energy density, less thickness, less weight and flexible compared to its liquid counterpart [6]. Furthermore, use of liquid electrolytes needs a separator to prevent electrode–electrode contact, which drastically increases the cost. The commonly used amorphous polymers include polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylidene difluoride and polymethyl methacrylate [7, 8]. They exhibit high conductivity due to gel formation, wherein the polymer network entraps the liquid electrolyte. Although desirable properties can be achieved using these petroleum derived polymers, they are harmful for the environment in larger quantities once discarded and they mainly depends on non-renewable sources. Despite of several efforts from the scientific community there is still lack of highly abundant and low cost SPEs which avoids use of toxic chemicals and degrades {{at the end of its}} life period. In comparison to electrolytes with alkali metal salts, proton conductors are characterized by higher dynamics of ionic transport [9].|$|R
40|$|In {{the polar}} atmosphere, {{significant}} chemical and ionization changes occur during solar proton events (SPE). The access of solar protons to this region {{is limited by}} the dynamically changing geomagnetic field. In this study we have used riometer absorption observations to investigate the accuracy of a model to predict Kp-dependent geomagnetic rigidity cutoffs, and hence the changing proton fluxes. The imaging riometer at Halley, Antarctica is ideally situated for such a study, as the rigidity cutoff sweeps {{back and forth across the}} instrument's field of view, providing a severe test of the rigidity cutoff model. Using observations from this riometer during five solar proton events, we have confirmed the basic accuracy of this rigidity model. However, we find that the model can be improved by setting a lower Kp limit (i. e., Kp= 5 instead of 6) at which the rigidity modeling saturates. We also find that for L> 4. 5 the apparent L-shell of the beam moves equatorwards. In addition, the Sodankyla Ion and Neutral Chemistry model is used to determine an empirical relationship between integral proton precipitation fluxes and nighttime ionosphere riometer absorption, in order to allow consideration of winter time SPEs. We find that during the nighttime the proton flux energy threshold is lowered to include protons with energies of > 5 MeV in comparison with > 10 MeV for the daytime empirical relationships. In addition, we provide an indication of the southern and northern geographic regions inside which <b>SPEs</b> <b>play</b> a role in modifying the neutral chemistry of the stratosphere and mesosphere...|$|R
40|$|The streptococcal {{pyrogenic}} exotoxins (<b>Spes)</b> <b>play</b> {{a central}} role in the pathogenesis of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. The majority of recent invasive GAS infections have been caused by an M 1 T 1 strain that harbors the genes for several streptococcal superantigens, including speA, speB, speF, speG, and smeZ. However, considerable variation in the expression of Spe proteins among clonal M 1 isolates has been found, and many of the speA-positive M 1 strains do not produce detectable amounts of SpeA in vitro. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that speA gene expression can be induced in vivo. A mouse infection chamber model that allows sequential sampling of GAS isolates at various time points postinfection was developed and used to monitor the kinetics of Spe production in vivo. Micropore Teflon diffusion chambers were implanted subcutaneously in BALB/c mice, and after 3 weeks the pores became sealed with connective tissue and sterile fluid containing a white blood cell infiltrate accumulated inside the infection chambers. Representative clonal M 1 T 1 isolates expressing no detectable SpeA were inoculated into the implanted chambers, and the expression of SpeA in the aspirated aliquots of the chamber fluid was analyzed on successive days postinfection. Expression of SpeA was detected in the chamber fluid as early as days 3 to 5 postinfection in most animals, with a significant increase in expression by day 7 in all infected mice. Isolates recovered from the chamber and grown in vitro continued to produce SpeA even after 21 passages in vitro, suggesting stable switch on of the speA gene. A temporal relation between the upregulation of SpeA expression and the downregulation of SpeB expression was observed in vivo. These data suggest that in vivo host and/or environmental signals induced speA gene expression and suppressed speB gene expression. This underscores the role of the host-pathogen interaction in regulating the expression of streptococcal virulence factors in vivo. The model described here should facilitate such studies...|$|R
