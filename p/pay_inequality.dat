This analysis of multiple years of pay data, n = 513, 000, from a large UK-based company shows that people with more than one disadvantaged identity suffer a significantly greater pay penalty than those with a single disadvantage. The data also suggest that penalties associated with multiple disadvantage exponentially increase. In other words, disadvantages seem to interact to the detriment of people at ‘intersections'.

5000|$|The {{labor market}} has been {{creating}} much more inequality over the last thirty years, with the very top earners capturing a large fraction of macroeconomic productivity gains. A number of factors may help explain this increase in inequality, not only underlying technological changes but also the retreat of institutions developed during the New Deal and World War II - such as progressive tax policies, powerful unions, corporate provision of health and retirement benefits, and changing social norms regarding <b>pay</b> <b>inequality.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Not {{only did}} {{women have to}} keep [...] "the home fires burning" [...] but they took on {{voluntary}} and paid employment that was diverse in scope and showed that women were capable in diverse fields of endeavour.

500|$|One {{criticism}} of time valuation concerns {{the choice of}} monetary levels. How should unpaid work be valued when more than one activity is being performed or more than one output is produced? Another issue concerns differences in quality between market and household products. Some feminist economists take issue with using the market system to determine values {{for a variety of}} reasons: it may lead {{to the conclusion that the}} market provides perfect substitutes for non-market work; the wage produced in the market for services may not accurately reflect the actual opportunity cost of time spent in household production; and the wages used in valuation methods come from industries where wages are already depressed because of gender inequalities, and so will not accurately value unpaid work. A related argument is that the market [...] "accepts existing sex/gender divisions of labor and <b>pay</b> <b>inequalities</b> as normal and unproblematic. With this basic assumption underlying their calculations, the valuations produced serve to reinforce gender inequalities rather than challenge women's subordination." ...|$|R
30|$|All in all, {{it is fair}} to {{say that}} the German labour market {{underwent}} a major transformation over the last 10 – 15 years. New jobs in service occupations have contributed to a significantly higher level of employment compared to earlier phases, and many of these jobs are in non-standard forms of contracts. A major dividing line lies between regular, permanent part-time and marginal part-time jobs. The secondary segments of the labour market are clearly characterized by sectoral and demographic patterns. This pattern of employment duality seems to become more important over time as the labour market expands, sectoral shifts occur, employers’ room to manoeuver increases, and working conditions also react to industrial relations/organization and labour demand/supply patterns. A parallel development can also be shown with <b>pay</b> <b>inequalities.</b> Clearly, the low pay sector has grown in Germany as has the overall pay dispersion. While it is true that non-standard contracts in general have a higher share of low pay earners than standard employment, the variation of pay amongst employees on full-time open-ended contracts has increased as well. Here, the coverage by collective agreements makes a major difference.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{explanation}} of the gender pay gap in leadership positions by examining the relationship between managerial bonuses and company performance. Drawing on findings of gender studies, agency theory, and the leadership literature, we argue that the gender pay gap is a context-specific phenomenon which results partly {{from the fact that}} company performance has a moderating impact on <b>pay</b> <b>inequalities.</b> Employing a matched sample of 192 female and male executive directors of UK listed firms we corroborate the existence of the gender pay disparities in corporate boardrooms. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that bonuses awarded to men are not only larger than those allocated to women, but also that managerial compensation of male executive directors is much more performance-sensitive than that of female executives. The contribution of attributional and expectancy-related dynamics to these patterns is highlighted in line with previous work on gender stereotypes and implicit leadership theories such as the romance of leadership. Gender differences in risk-taking and confidence are also considered as potential explanations for the observed pay disparities. The implications of organizations’ indifference to women’s performance are examined in relation to issues surrounding the recognition and retention of female talent. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{employers}} in Britain {{have taken up}} equal opportunity policies more widely and structural changes in the economy have generally favored women. Against this, the pursuit of labor market deregulation is generally thought to impact adversely on women. This paper considers the changing British policy framework of the last ten to fifteen years and the effects on women's employment, highlighting differences amongst women. Deregulation and flexibilization are argued to have affected the conditions of part-time employment for women rather than its scale and pattern of expansion. The changing gender wage gap in Britain {{and the growth of}} <b>pay</b> <b>inequalities</b> amongst women are analyzed using a shift-share approach. The limited convergence in earnings between men and women is largely confined to full-time workers and has two distinct aspects. Full-time female employees have made some inroads into higher-paid occupations, but at the bottom end of the market the narrowing of the gender wage gap reflects little more than the deterioration in the position of low-paid men, relative to the median. The British case shows the limitations of an equal opportunities agenda pursued within a wider regime of burgeoning labor market inequalities.

50|$|The gender pay gap {{has been}} {{attributed}} to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological {{differences between men and women}} and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias).

In certain countries such as South Korea, it has also been a long-established practice to lay-off female employees upon marriage.

It aims to summarise the most recent working life developments –particularly in terms of industrial relations and working conditions – at EU level and in the EU Member States and Norway. It focuses on those areas of working life that may have been shaped by EU-level policies. The report starts with three contextual chapters summarising the developments likely to have had an influence on working life debates and policies at national level. economic and labour market developments policy developments at EU level related to working life political developments. A core contribution of this report is its condensed summary of social dialogue developments in 2016 within the EU 28 and Norway, in Chapter 4. Two further thematic chapters: Chapter 6 – ‘Pay inequalities: Evidence, debate and policies’ and Chapter 7 – ‘Promoting work–life balance of working parents and caregivers’ provide more in-depth updates on recent debates at national level and on new policies within the EU. While the review covers primarily 2016, updates on major developments that have occurred during the process of writing have been included. The topical chapters on <b>pay</b> <b>inequalities</b> and on promoting work–life balance also look back over the previous two to three years, to give the reader a more comprehensive picture of recent developments. This review is based on contributions from more than 50 contributors from Eurofound’s Network of Europeand correspondents. They are research experts in the area of industrial relations and working conditions and provide regular updates on major working life developments in their countries to EurWORK, Eurofound’s European observatory of Working Life.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} performance-related pay on wage differentials within firms. Our theoretical framework predicts that, compared to a fixed pay system, pay schemes based on individual effort increase within-firm wage inequality, while group-based bonuses have minor effects on wage dispersion. Theory also predicts an interaction between performance-related pay and union bargaining, where union power reduces the impact of performance pay on wage dispersion. The empirical contribution utilizes two recent Norwegian employer surveys, linked to {{a full set of}} employee records. A longitudinal sub-sample allows for identification based on fixed establishment effects. Introduction of performance-related pay is shown to raise residual wage inequality in nonunion firms, but not in firms with high union density. Our findings suggest that even though performance-related pay appears to be on the rise, the overall impact on wage dispersion is likely to be small, particularly in European countries with strong unions.
