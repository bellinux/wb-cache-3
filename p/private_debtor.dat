40|$|This paper revisits {{theoretical}} models of sovereign borrowing with renegotiation and reviews {{the basis for}} arguments for market-based contractual innovation in sovereign debt markets. It presents a tax-smoothing model of borrowing on international financial markets by a sovereign government that endogenizes the debt limit for the government. Debt repayments can be state contingent, but these are interpreted in terms of renegotiated conventional bond contracts. The main contribution of the model is to show how <b>private</b> <b>debtor</b> information {{can be used to}} motivate the implementation of borrowing through the issuance of conventional bonds that are renegotiated only in adverse states after debt has reached a sufficiently high level. The model is used as a benchmark for considering how opportunistic behavior by individual bondholders can lead to inefficient outcomes. This part of the paper recapitulates how coordination failures arise in {{theoretical models}} of sovereign debt from exogenous enforcement of creditor rights.

40|$|Increasing {{emphasis}} {{has been}} placed on the need for an effective lender of last resort for sovereign states and on procedures for sovereign debt restructuring to help cope with global financial crises. Where private creditors use short-term debt to check sovereign debtor’s moral hazard, there is the risk of self-fulfilling crises. In this context, we conclude that the proposal of the Meltzer Commission—for unconditional financial support, but only to states that pre-qualify—could be the source of increased instability. After discussing analogies with private sector arrangements, we compare the operations of the existing Paris Club with proposed Chapter 11 style procedures.

40|$|At the April 2003 {{meeting of}} the International Monetary and Financial Committees, {{it was decided to}} further {{encourage}} the contractual approach to smoothing the process of sovereign debt restructuring by encouraging the more widespread use of collective action clauses (CACs) in international bonds. This decision was shaped partly by Mexico''s successful launch of a bond subject to New York law but featuring CACs, and by subsequent issues with similar provisions from other emerging market countries. This paper reviews the developments leading up to that event, its implications, and prospects for the future. It asks whether we can expect to see additional issuance by emerging markets of bonds featuring CACs, whether such a trend would in fact help {{to make the world a}} safer financial place, and what additional steps might be taken to further enhance modalities for crisis resolution.

In Spain, <b>private</b> <b>debtors</b> are entitled to debt relief on a maximum of only 50 % of their debt and in other countries long periods of differing lengths are needed until complete exemption from remaining debt is granted.

There are thus no uniform regulations on how private individuals can make a clean financial start in Europe, and debtors and creditors have different opportunities.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a novel {{explanation}} of debt crises in emerging markets. In our model, crises arise {{because of the}} inability to punish <b>private</b> <b>debtors</b> when many of them default at the same time. We construct an optimal contracting model in which a successful entrepreneur repays the domestic lender yet an unsuccessful one defaults and liquidates his assets. However, the inability to liquidate extensive asset quantities generates {{the possibility of a}} second equilibrium with coordinated defaults, in which domestic borrowers find it optimal to default because all other borrowers are also defaulting. During coordinated default crises, the government’s tax collections fall and thus it cannot pay the international lender in full. The model shows that, given tight aggregate constraints on liquidation, joint debt crises are an inevitable part of an optimal response to informational problems in privatesector lending. ∗We thank Katya Kartashova and Jacek Rothert for research assistance, and participants at seminars at the Federal Reserve Banks of New York City and Philadelphia and the International Economics Workshop at Torcuato Di Tella for their comments.

We examine this link using data for advanced and emerging economies {{over the past decade}} and conclude that the sovereign ratings have a significant and robust effect on private ratings even after controlling for country specific macroeconomic conditions and firm-level performance indicators.

The process of renegotiation between <b>private</b> creditors and <b>debtor</b> governments can create further inefficiencies in the world allocation of capital. In this paper, two potential sources of social cost in the private renegotiation of debt repayments and new loans are discussed. First, legal privileges accorded to existing creditors by their collective governments can render time-consistent the efficient allocation of capital constrained by sovereign immunity when there is ex post bargaining over net transfers. The absence of possibilities for full commitment by creditors implies that the outcomes achievable with ex post bargaining of simple debt contracts differ from those achievable with state-contingent contracts, as conceived in the literature. Second, the use of offers in a renegotiation to elicit <b>private</b> information about <b>debtor</b> characteristics is socially costly.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the consequences of}} international financial market integration for national fiscal and monetary policies that derive from {{the absence of an}} international sovereign authority to define and enforce contractual obligations across borders. The sovereign immunity of national governments serves as a fundamental constraint on international finance and is used to derive intertemporal budget constraints for sovereign nations and their governments. It is shown that the appropriate debt limit for a country allows for state-contingent repayment. With noncontingent debt instruments, debt renegotiation occurs in equilibrium with positive probability. A model of tax smoothing is adopted to show how information imperfections lead to conventional bond contracts that are renegotiated when a critical level of indebtedness is reached. Renegotiation is interpreted in terms of nominal and real denominated bonds, and implications are drawn about the intertemporal borrowing constraint for monetary policies, the accumulation of reserve assets, and current account sustainability.

40|$|Financing {{trade between}} {{economic}} agents located {{in different countries}} is affected by many types of risks, resulting from incomplete information about the debtor, the problems of enforcing international contracts, or the prevalence of political and financial crises. Trade is important for economic development {{and the availability of}} trade finance is essential, especially for developing countries. Relatively few studies treat the topic of political risk, particularly in the context of international lending. This thesis explores new ground to identify links between political risk and international debt defaults. The core hypothesis of the study is that the default probability of debt increases with increasing political risk in the country of the borrower. The thesis consists of three essays that support the hypothesis from different angles of the credit evaluation process. The first essay takes {{the point of view of}} an international lender assessing the credit risk of a public borrower. The second investigates creditworthiness assessment of companies. The obtained results are substantiated in the third essay that deals with an extensive political risk survey among finance professionals in developing countries. The financial instruments of core interest are export credit guaranteed debt initiated between the Export Credit Agency of Finland and buyers in 145 countries between 1975 and 2006. Default events of the foreign credit counterparts are conditioned on country-specific macroeconomic variables, corporate-specific accounting information as well as political risk indicators from various international sources. Essay 1 examines debt issued to government controlled institutions and conditions public default events on traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, in addition to selected political and institutional risk factors. Confirming previous research, the study finds country indebtedness and the GDP growth rate to be significant indicators of public default. Further, it is shown that public defaults respond to various political risk factors. However, the impact of the risk varies between countries at different stages of economic development. Essay 2 proceeds by investigating political risk factors as conveivable drivers of corporate default and uses traditional accounting variables together with new political risk indicators in the credit evaluation of <b>private</b> <b>debtors.</b> The study finds links between corporate default and leverage, as well as between corporate default and the general investment climate and measeures of conflict in the debtor country. Essay 3 concludes the thesis by offering survey evidence on the impact of political risk on debt default, as perceived and experienced by 103 finance professionals in 38 developing countries. Taken together, the results of the thesis suggest that various forms of political risk are associated with international debt defaults and continue to pose great concerns for both international creditors and borrowers in developing countries. The study provides new insights on the importance of variable selection in country risk analysis, and shows how political risk is actually perceived and experienced in the riskier, often lower income countries of the global economy...|$|R

Th e Confucian traditions and the Leninist party power structure are identifi ed {{as the main}} specifi c traits of the social formation in contemporary China. In the capitalist mode of pro-duction, money sets the stage, and the interplay between <b>private</b> creditors and <b>debtors</b> is bundled into a coherent, dynamic whole by the central bank in the economic sphere and by more or less democratic institutions in the political are-na. Combining the reproductive, care-taking traits of socialism with the entre-preneurial dynamism of private property and, above all, with the design and enforcement of overall social and economic coherence through the »vanguard« Communist Party makes an unique and ingenious institutional Chinese set-up.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{global and}} regional fluctuations in international private debt flows to emerging {{and developing countries}} using data on cross border loans and international bond issuance over 1993 - 2009. We estimate the effects of individual borrower characteristics as well as macroeconomic conditions {{on the cost of}} foreign borrowing and test whether these effects differ across phases of the lending cycle. We find that public and financial institutions benefit from lower spreads compared to private and nonfinancial firms and that lenders may differentiate the risk associated with the borrower’s industrial sector between good and bad times. The loan (bond) rating has an equally robust spread reduction effect across credit cycle phases. The results also suggest that international reserve holdings and investment ratios {{have a significant effect on}} reducing credit spreads for loans, while higher reserve holdings and longer maturities matter more for bond spreads.

40|$|The present {{lack of a}} {{comprehensive}} framework for sovereign debt restructuring not only generates significant costs but also endangers {{the stability of the}} international financial system. In addition, collective action problems involved in the restructuring of sovereign bonds place an obstacle to an orderly and rapid restructuring. The case of Argentina presents a good example for difficulties of a sovereign - but also private-sector stakeholders - may face {{in the absence of an}} orderly debt-restructuring mechanism. This paper outlines a possible approach for a new International Debt Framework (IDF) that represents a middle ground between a legally binding insolvency procedure and a voluntary code of conduct. A comprehensive restructuring mechanism could be successful only if it were certain that it would meet with intergovernemental support and leadership on the part of both developed and developing countries. Since the Group of 20 (G 20) meetings of finance ministers from developed and developing countries have proved to be a successful forum for analyzing and dealing with instabilities of the international financial system, we propose the G 20 as the forum to initiate the establishment of the IDF. With a view to ensuring predictability for international creditors, our proposal also includes a general set of principles similar to those contained in the recent proposal for a code of conduct made by leading sovereign issuers of international bonds and leading private creditors. The IDF should have two functions: crisis prevention and crisis resolution. Permanent debtor-creditor dialogues and transparency and information on emerging-market debt markets are necessary to prevent crises. Under the new IDF this would be ensured throug the creation of a permanent IDF secretariat. All stakeholders would be entitled to nominate members for the secretariat. What is needed to resolve the situation of a financially distressed sovereign is faciliation of an orderly debt-restructuring mechanism. An IDF-Commission (IDFC) would assume this function; it would be made up of representatives from the sovereign <b>debtor,</b> <b>private</b> creditors, multilateral lenders, and sovereign creditors. In contrast to the International Monetary Fund's proposal for Sovereign Debt Resturucturing Mechanism (SDRM), the underlying framework for the IDF would not be statutory. According to the proposal, the IDF Commission would aim for a coherent and comprehensive debt restructuring, propose the amount of financial support required, and outline the economic adjustment path that could guarantee long-term debt sustainability.
