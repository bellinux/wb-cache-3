40|$|There {{is little}} new {{about the idea}} of using {{vegetable}} oil as engine fuel, but for a long time technical problems and the low price of petroleum-based fuels have meant that the idea has not been pursued in practice. However, a German project in Mali has recently been advocating the use of physic nut oil in diesel engines. Such a scheme would bring benefits in the fields of ecology, economics and energy. The <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> <b>tree</b> (Jatropha curcas) grows abundantly throughout the Sahel. The inhabitants of the region use its seeds and leaves medicinally and plant it as hedges and windbreaks around their gardens and fields. The <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> <b>tree,</b> which {{is a member of the}} Euphorbiaceae family, thrives on poor soil even in times of drought because of the water-retaining fibres in its roots, trunk and branches. Since 1987 the Agricultural Machinery Service in Mali and the Special Energy Programmes of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) have been researching the possible use of the physic nut's oil rich seeds as diesel engine fuel. The multi-use physic nut The physic nut is adaptable and does well on marginal land where other crops are not viable, and it can be used in reafforestation schemes As well as being used as a windshied, it is also a protection against rainwater erosion mainly because its shallow roots slow the surface run-off and aid the infiltration of the water into the soil. In areas inhabited by nomadic herdsmen, the <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> <b>tree</b> is used to make enclosures. The smell and taste of the toxin (curcin), which is present in the leaves, deters animals. Hedges therefore stay intact and cattle are prevented from getting out and grazing on crops. This reduces the frequency of clashes between farmers and pastoralists. Electric fencing is too expensive for small-scale farmers, but the <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> <b>tree</b> is a more shall adequate solution. In the southern region of Mali which is managed by the Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (CMDT), around 5000 km of physic nut hedges were planted in 1992 and an increase of 4000 km per annum is envisaged. The hedges protect the leguminous crops planted on fallow land to improve impoverished soil. Peasant farmers are in favour of schemes which promote the physic nut. The slump in agricultural prices on world markets has meant that cotton and groundnut growers are taking a keen interest in whatever might widen their income base. The women who harvest the seeds are strongly in favour, since profits are two or three times higher than for sheabutter and the harvest takes place after the rainy season, when other work in the fields is over. Put a physic nut in your tank! Over and above all these advantages, the physic nut seeds contain oil which is light enough to be used as motor fuel, and which has an energy value only 3 % less than diesel. It was used in Europe during World War 11, but was soon forgotten in the general euphoria over the subsequent cheap petrol prices. In developing countries physic nut oil has much to recommend it, especially in rural areas. It means local people can be independent of power stations for energy for their mills, generators or motorpumps; and if imported petroleum products are not being bought, valuable foreign exchange is saved for other purposes. The machinery needed to extract the oil from the seed is neither sophisticated nor expensive. Small and simple turnscrew presses for semi-industrial use can be made locally which will extract eight litres per hour; hydraulic manual presses for small scale operations produce five to ten litres per day. Already engines designed to run on vegetable oil are in use. Is it viable? In African countries which do not produce petrol, and in rural areas away from main transport routes, feasibility studies have demonstrated that physic nut oil is cheaper than diesel. In Mali, after deducting capital repayments for the motor and the press and the costs of maintenance, seed and labour, physic nut oil is fetching 163. 4 FCFA per litre in the areas where it is produced, against 300 FCFA per litre of diesel. Summing up the benefits, Reinhard Henning of GTZ says: 'This project will create a new economic activity which will eventually change not only the face of the countryside, but also social practices and energy consumption.

40|$|The oil-producing {{trees of}} the Sahel was the theme which drew 30 specialists to Bamako, Mali, in duly 1992 for a meeting {{organized}} by the French Ministry of Cooperation and Development. The aim was to decide which species could be marketed, and what research remained to be done. The shea butter tree, the <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> <b>tree,</b> balanites, argan, neem, moringa are all Sahelian trees which produce a top-quality oil and flourish on poor, stony soil in areas of minimal rainfall. Africans have long {{been aware of the}} properties of these oils, from which the women make butter, cosmetic creams, cooking oils, insecticides and medicines. Across the Sahel the women gather in the nuts, roast or dry them in the sun, then pound and mix them for hours. Part of the oil extracted is for family consumption, and the rest is sold for cash. Multi-use species New uses for these tropical trees are being constantly discovered. Shea butter is used in the treatment of bronchitis and heals sprains and burns; neem kills insect pests; moringa seeds have properties which clarify muddy or cloudy water; balanites oil has amazing cosmetic properties; and oil from the physic nut can be used as engine fuel. The plants, however, are irregular in their growing and fruiting cycles: for example, the shea butter tree fruits only every two to three years, and the argan tree will grow only in the wild. In order to see which of the products of these plants could be marketed and what further research was called for, the French Ministry of Cooperation and Development organized a gathering of 30 experts on oil seed trees in the Sahelian regions. The meeting, called Oleasylva, was held in Bamako Mali in July 1992. At this meeting the delegates explored the concept of marketing, which was new to most of them. The organizer, Arthur Riedacker, sees signs of a new direction 'We have to adopt an entirely new approach at this meeting. Previously, we geared our research to one particular tree and then looked at how we might increase production, but now we must first find out whether it is marketable or not. If the answer is 'yes', then research can get under way. ' The gathering was attended by 30 delegates among whom 15 were African from 1 countries. Technicians, manufacturers, dealers, chemists and end-users were present One problem which occupied much of the time was that of processing kernels. '`The reason we are here is to decide on the action we are going to take, and to find the an swers to our questions from the facts at our disposal,' said Professor Dan Dicker, Director of the CRES (a regional centre for solar energy), who was hosting the work shop. Various views were exchanged among delegates: for example, Hieke Osterman, a neem specialist, suggested that leaving some of the neem shell mixed with the kernel in the press increases the pressure and allows more oil to be extracted. Many problems remain unsolved The processing is a mammoth task, requiring eight hours of manual labour to extract one litre of shea butter oil, and ten hours for one litre of argan oil. These domestic production techniques cannot keep up with current requirements and neither can the productivity of the trees themselves. Balanites and neem only bear fruit after rainfall and the unpredictability of the weather makes it extremely hard to have any confidence in the ability to supply a market. Furthermore, if processing is not carried out correctly the oils quickly go rancid and smell disgusting. There are also difficulties at pressing because some seeds contain a substance which blocks the filters, or because the shell does not come away from the kernel. Unhelpful legislation On the international market, especially in Europe, legislation causes difficulties. `'At present shea butter is banned in the manufacture of chocolate in most European countries,' explains Jean-Jacques Pesquet of APROMA (a French association for the promotion of raw materials). 'It can be used only for coating, and cocoa is used in preference because of its quality. Up till now this ban has been violated by many manufacturers because shea butter is much cheaper than cocoa. But that is no longer the case, and it is pointless continuing the fraud. ' Today 97 % of shea butter exports are used in the food manufacturing industry. The question now is whether legislation will change in the near future, or whether the brokers will direct these products towards the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries instead. 'We have to act quickly,' urges Arthur Riedacker; 'the chemical industry can substitute synthetic products for these natural ones, and it is far harder to halt the use of a substance once in production than to get it adopted. ' But neither the market nor the desert can wait for long. The organizer of the workshop, which was held as part of the 'Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel' projects, reminded those present; 'the only way to stop desertification is to protect the vegetation.

Treatments were arranged in a Completely Randomized Design with three replications. The results showed that at the rates of 50 and 100 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1, there was no difference in soil available P due to the application of SP- 36 and Phosphate Rock, indicating that both types of P fertilizer had the same dissolution values after 8 months of P fertilizer application. At the rate of 50 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1, the application of SP- 36 and Phosphate Rock gave the same leaf P content. This could indicate that up to the first 8 months, the addition of the cheaper Phosphate Rock and the SP- 36 to the soil had similar effectiveness. The response of tree biomass to P fertilization followed a quadratic pattern, in which for the application of Phosphate Rock, the P optimum rate was achieved at the rate which was lower than that for the application of SP- 36. This suggests that the application of Phosphate Rock to <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> was more efficient and effective compared to the application of SP- 36.

In the first trial, <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> seeds were exposed to seven levels of salinity (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 dS m- 1) with eight repetitions, using a substrate of paper soaked with solutions of CaCl 2 and KCl. The treatments were evaluated based on the initial germination, total percentage of germination, and time necessary to germination of 50 % of the seeds. Increased salinity reduced the first germination count and delayed the time to 50 % germination. From 10 dS m- 1, there was a reduction in germination percentage.

40|$|The NAC {{proteins}} (NAM, ATAF 1 / 2 and CUC 2) are plant-specific transcriptional regulators {{that have}} a conserved NAM domain in the N-terminus. They are involved in various biological processes, including both biotic and abiotic stress responses. In the present study, a total of 100 NAC genes (JcNAC) were identified in <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> (Jatropha curcas L.).

This sensibility should be due the leaf Na+ and Cl- high accumulation, associated a strong reduction in the K+ concentration, induced by high Na+ content. On the other hand, <b>physic</b> <b>nuts</b> plants were able osmotic adjust to salinity due a severe decrease on the osmotic potential and increase of leaf water state, principally in the higher NaCl levels. Of the solutes studied, was observed that salt ions (Na+ and Cl-) contributed with the most of the osmotic adjustment, while that the K+ contribution was decreased strongly by NaCl.

The changes caused on photochemistry activity and leaf gas exchange were evaluate by Na+ and Cl- accumulation and decrease of K+/Na+ ratio in the leaves. After 7 -d of treatment was observed a major action of osmotic effects. However, after 14 -d of treatment, the ionic effects caused by Na+ and Cl- excessive accumulation and by K+/Na+ ratio strong reduction in the leaves, caused permanent damages on the photosynthesis of <b>physic</b> <b>nuts</b> plants due as the stomatal limitations as non-stomatal ones.

The water stress effects induced for PEG in the leaf growth, electrolyte leakage and leaf gas exchange were more deleterious than by NaCl ones.

Of the solutes studied, the K+ and soluble sugar were the most involved in the osmotic adjustment as in the leaves as in roots.
