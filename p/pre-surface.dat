40|$|We have {{constructed}} two {{simian virus}} 40 early replacement recombinants {{that have the}} coding sequences for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). One construction, LSV-HBsAg, has the coding region for HBsAg but not the portion encoding the putative <b>pre-surface</b> antigen leader. Transformed monkey kidney cells (COS) infected with this recombinant express large quantities of the characteristic partially glycosylated HBsAg molecule, which are assembled into 22 -nm particles that appear similar to those produced by human liver cells infected with hepatitis B virus. This result indicates that the <b>pre-surface</b> antigen sequences are not required for the synthesis of HBsAg or its assembly into particulate structures. The second recombinant, LSV-HBpresAg, has the entire surface antigen gene, including the putative promoter and <b>pre-surface</b> antigen region. COS cells infected with this recombinant plasmid produce 40 - to 50 -fold less HBsAg than those infected with the LSV-HBsAg recombinant plasmid. RNA mapping {{studies suggest that the}} transcription of the HBsAg gene is initiated at more than one site, or alternatively, that RNA splicing of transcripts occurs in the <b>pre-surface</b> antigen region...|$|E

"Thermal {{spray coating}} was studied {{as one of}} the {{techniques}} used for coating graphite reinforced polymer composites, which are extensively used in the aviation industry. These coatings were studied for improvement of surface properties such as erosion resistance, UV protection, hardness and electro magnetic shielding. NiAl (65 %Ni, 35 %Al) intermetallic, NiAl (95 %Ni, 5 %Al), Aluminum and Zinc coating were thermal-spray deposited using different procedures (plasma, flame, electric wire arc) onto polymer composite substrate. Two categories of coating were evaluated: Coatings with bond coat and coatings without bond coat. Different levels of <b>pre-surface</b> preparation for thermal spray coatings were also studied. The microstructures, micro-hardness and electrical conductivity of these coatings were determined.

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of surface treatment of FRC-Post on bonding strength to resin cements. Materials and Methods <b>Pre-surface</b> treated LuxaPost (DMG), Rely-X Fiber Post (3 M ESPE) and self adhesive resin cement Rely-X Unicem (3 M ESPE), conventional resin cement Rely-X ARC (3 M ESPE), and Rely-X Ceramic Primer (3 M ESPE) were used. After completing the surface treatments of the posts, posts and resin cement were placed in clear molds and photo-activation was performed.

The phase composition {{was found to}} vary significantly on iron loading. For the samples calcined at 500 or 600 °C, at x≤ 0. 01, the formed ZrO 2 {{is a mixture of}} monoclinic and tetragonal structures. Only tetragonal structure is revealed at x≥ 0. 05 with the exception of Fe 0. 2 /ZrO 2, calcined at 500 °C, where new non-typically short Zr-Zr distances (3. 29, 3. 43 Å) were observed.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{results of}} investigations pertaining to an influence of plasma jet parameters (current, spraying distance, consumption of plasma formation gas (nitrogen)), fractional composition of initial powder {{and degree of}} cooling with compressed air on anti-meteoric coating characteristics. Optimum modes (arc current 600 A; spray distance of 110 mm; consumption of plasma formation gas (nitrogen) – 50 l/min; fractional composition of zirconium dioxide powder < 50 μm; compressed air consumption for cooling – 1 m 3 /min; p = 4 bar) {{make it possible to}} obtain anti-meteoric coatings based on zirconium dioxide with material utilization rate of 62 %, total ceramic layer porosity of 6 %. After exposure of compression plasma flows on a coating in the nitrogen atmosphere a cubic modification of zirconium oxide is considered as the main phase being present in the coating. The lattice parameter of cubic zirconium oxide modification is equal to 0. 5174 nm. Taking into consideration usage of nitrogen as plasma formation substance its interaction with zirconium coating atoms occurs and zirconium nitride (ZrN) is formed with a cubic crystal lattice (lattice parameter 0. 4580 nm). Melting of <b>pre-surface</b> layer takes place and a depth of the melted layer is about 8 μm according to the results of a scanning electron microscopy. <b>Pre-surface</b> layer being crystallized after exposure to compression plasma flows is characterized by a homogeneous distribution of ele-ments and absence of pores formed in the process of coating formation. The coating structure is represented by a set of lar- ge (5 – 7 μm) and small (1 – 2 μm) zirconium oxide particles sintered against each other. Melting of coating surface layer and speed crystallization occur after the impact of compression plasma flows on the formed coating. Cracking of the surface layer arises due to origination of internal mechanical stresses in the crystallized part. While using a scanning electron microscopy a detailed analysis of the surface structure has permitted to reveal a formation of a cellular structure with an average cell size of less than 1 μm in the crystallized portion and formation of the cells can be caused by speed crystallization of the melted layer. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 on {{the natural history of}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, sera from Central Africans with and without antibodies to HIV were examined for HBV markers of ongoing replication, recovery from infection, and reactivation or reinfection. The prevalence ofHBV infection and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was similar for HIV-positiveand-negativepersons. AIDS patients weremore likelyto be HBsAg positive and have markers of viral replication. Unlike <b>pre-surface</b> (pre-s) 1 antigen (Ag), which did not differ significantlywith respect to HIV infection, pre-s 2 Ag was more common among HIV-positive persons than among HIV-negative ones and was more common among AIDS patients than among HIV-positive asymptomatic carriers. HIV-positive persons had more markers consistent with HBV reactivation and lower levels of antibody to HBsAg. Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major etiologic agent ofhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a disease ofsignifi-cant public health interest in sub-Saharan Africa [I].

40|$|AbstractPhotovoltaic {{effect on}} single-crystalline silicon treated by {{compression}} plasma flows is studied. A {{number of samples}} (1 1 cm) of single-crystalline silicon with n- and p-types of conductivity and different dopant concentrations (p-type silicon doped by B: 0. 3, 4. 5, 10, 12 Ω cm; n-type silicon doped by P: 0. 5, 4. 5, 20 Ω cm) were treated by nitrogen, hydrogen and helium compression plasma flows with energy density 5 - 12 J/cm 2. Open-circuit voltage (AM 1. 5 spectrum of solar irradiation) dependence on plasma-forming gas, type of conductivity and dopant concentration was studied. It was established that photovoltaic effect takes place only in p-type silicon. The effect is maximal for boron concentration 4. 5 Ω cm. Nitrogen plasma treatment causes appearance of photovoltaic effect {{for all types of}} p-silicon. At the same time after helium and hydrogen plasma treatment the effect is observable only for 4. 5, 10 and 12 Ω cm samples and is absent for 0. 3 Ω cm silicon. Thermo-EMF sign measurements show that the present effect is connected with appearance of new additional donors under plasma action in <b>pre-surface</b> layer. Possible reasons of donor appearance are silicon doping by nitrogen and appearance of thermo-donors. Compression plasma flows can be considered as perspective cheap method of silicon treatment for silicon based solar cell technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is a 42 nm {{viral particle}} and {{belongs to a}} family of closely related DNA viruses called the hepadnaviruses. All the hepadnaviruses have similar hepatotropism and life cycles in their hosts. It is an enveloped small circular, partially double stranded DNA virus. The viral genome has a length of approximately 3200 base pairs that encodes four open reading frames (ORF). These are the <b>pre-Surface</b> (pre-S) and Surface (S) gene, the pre-Core (pre-C) and Core (C) gene, the X-gene and the Polymerase (P) -gene. The pre-S and pre-C genes are upstream regions of the S and C genes. The viral envelope encoded by the S gene contains three distinct configurations synthesized in all infected persons, termed the large, middle and major envelope proteins, which are produced by beginning transcription at, respectively, the pre-S 1, pre-S 2 or the S gene. The pre-S 1 and pre-S 2 represent two of the more immunogenic portions of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The development of cellular and humoral immunity to HBsAg is protective, and recombinant HBsAg provides {{the basis for the}} HBV vaccines currently available. The hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is the nucleocapsid that encloses the viral DNA. When HBcAg-derived peptides are presented by MHC-molecules present on the surface of hepatocytes, they can initiate a cellular immune response that is important for viral clearance...|$|E
30|$|Nanosized {{mesoporous}} silica particles (MSNs) with high chemical and thermal stability are excellent theranostic agents in drug delivery systems for targeted degenerative diseases {{as well as}} bioimaging devices. In comparison to the porous silica, MSNs are better candidates in drug delivery systems owing to its unique characteristics for their planned arrays of 2 D hexagonal micro- or mesopore structure, uniform particle sizes (80 – 500  nm), high pore volumes (0.5 – 2.5  cm 3 /g), large surface areas (> 1000  m 2 /g), flexible pore diameters (1.3 – 30  nm), tunable particle morphology and both exterior and interior surfaces that could be autonomously modified {{with a variety of}} functional groups [98]. A high density of silanol groups dominates the silica surface which can be functionalized {{with a wide variety of}} organic functional groups [99]. This adaptation allows for targeting biomolecules such as peptides, antibodies or folic acid, or biocompatible polymers to minimize opsonization for rapid clearance of nanoparticles [100]. These flexible surface characteristics of MSNs have high drug-loading capacity. The MSNs are especially useful to mass therapeutic compounds such as enzymes that are easily degraded in the unfriendly biological environment when delivered without encapsulation. These therapeutic agents are either covalently attached, or adsorbed onto such silica nanocarriers that have been <b>pre-surface</b> modified. These approaches can easily defeat poor drug solubility and stability issues, besides having better control over the rate of drugs release [101].|$|E
