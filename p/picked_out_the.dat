5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> chapters by Driessen, Boyer and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for putting together the book. Hooley concluded his review by claiming that the book offered something to those interested in the place of animals in politics, but that much of its contents would be of more interest for those looking to read about environmental political theory.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Coke {{returned}} to Britain, plans were {{already under way}} for him to enter Parliament. When an election was called in 1774, Wenman stood for the seat of Norfolk, with his son asked to stand in his place for Derby. Coke was not particularly enthusiastic about this, and withdrew when his opponent discovered he was under 21, the requisite age to stand for Parliament. With his father elected, Coke travelled with him to London, meeting members of the British high society. His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting, with Dutton's sister Jane, and Coke fell in love with her. Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married, as he had <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> daughter of a baronet for his son, but with the intercession of Wenman's friend Harbord Harbord, he finally consented to their marriage, which occurred on 5 October 1775.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, her {{autobiography}} Som jag är {{was published}} in Swedish (and in English the following year titled As I Am), followed by several compilation CDs of her Swedish and English recordings, including one called My Love, My Life for which Fältskog <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> music herself. Fans welcomed the autobiography. The book was updated in 1998 and released worldwide via Virgin Publishing, selling over 50,000 copies.|$|E
25|$|Earlier studies {{presumed that}} the two Chinese source maps had been {{obtained}} during Kim Sa-hyeong's diplomatic trip to Ming China in 1399 {{although there is no}} literary evidence for his acquisition. It is more plausible that these maps came to Korea in different times since Gwon Geun's preface implies that Korean officials <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> two maps for their excellency from among various sources, maybe including Wu Sidao's combined map.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey was {{convinced}} the Germans were exhausted, and after Hurst scored a controversial and heavily debated goal, the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England {{under the pressure}} of another German attack, the ball broke to Moore {{on the edge of his}} own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Moore to just get rid of the ball, but he calmly <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> feet of Hurst 40yards(40m) upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4–2.|$|E

25|$|Under Muawiyah's {{governance}} the Syrian army {{became a}} major military force. He <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best leaders from various tribes whereas elsewhere in the state the military units were still based along tribal lines. He personally saw to the comfort and the equipment of the troops, increased their pay and paid them {{on a regular basis}} when they were on duty. He kept the troops in training by an annual expedition against the Byzantines and therefore kept the Byzantines {{in a constant state of}} unease and therefore kept his northern border safe. He encouraged innovations in military technology. Muawiyah's armies used “Minjenique” machines to propel large stones onto enemy ramparts. He modernized the army, introducing specialized units for desert combat and snowy terrains. New forts were also built.|$|E
25|$|O'Hehir {{subsequently}} {{became a}} staple of the BBC's coverage of the famous annual Grand National steeplechase. He would invariably pick up the commentary at the Becher's Brook fence and take the race to Valentine's Brook, a vital section of the race where many a favourite fell. Foinavon's famous victory in 1967 will be remembered as one of O'Hehir's finest moments in racing commentaries and won him great respect for the speed and smoothness with which he <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> unconsidered outsider. O'Hehir later confessed {{in an interview that he}} it had been his inability to identify the colours on his card when inspecting the riders silks in the weighing room prior to the race that had led him to question rider John Buckingham who his mount was. Buckingham advised O'Hehir that Foinavon's silks had been changed at the last minute as his regular green colours were considered unlucky. It was because of this chance meeting that he was able to identify the 100/1 outsider and carry the commentary.|$|E
25|$|To {{compose the}} music for Broadchurch, Ólafur read the show's scripts to put himself in the right mood. He also {{researched}} sounds which might be heard in Dorset {{as a means of}} inspiration. As with most of his music, he then improvised at the piano. He composed several themes, some for the series as a whole and some for specific characters. He then shared them with Chibnall, and together they <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> themes they liked best. Using synthesizers or electronic sound generators, Ólafur also composed sounds to be heard when action occurred in certain spaces, such as the cliffs. Once he saw the completed footage for the first episode, he rearranged some themes to fit the imagery, and composed several new themes as well. Because there was so little time between his being hired and the air date, Ólafur composed very quickly and spent extraordinarily long days at work. He had just four months to generate about 30 minutes of sound and music for each episode, spending one-and-a-half to two weeks on each episode. Despite the time crunch, Ólafur credited Chibnall's relaxed attitude as the key to the music's success.|$|E

After testing it out with his initial plans for the story, he found that it worked out, and in hindsight, he realized that shoemakers also assist people with walking.|$|E
500|$|The cast of {{the film}} were praised, with Dowling {{considering}} The Turn of the Screw [...] "a slick production with strong performances", and Cooper saying that the film features [...] "a great supporting cast". Critics particularly commended the performances of Dockery and Johnston. Dowling also <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> performances of Lindsay and Sayer as worthy of note, while Whitelaw praised MacLiam, who was able [...] "to personify pure evil with scarcely a line of dialogue". Segal, by contrast, felt MacLiam was badly cast, which resulted in [...] "one of the story's primary dark forces [...] more like a member of Elbow than {{the very essence of}} evil".|$|E

500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Watt {{arranged}} for a major test of the CH system at Bawdsey with many aircraft involved. Dowding had been promoted to Chief of Fighter Command, and was on hand to watch. Things did not go well; for unknown reasons the radar did not pick up the approaching aircraft until they were far too close to arrange interception. Dowding was watching the screens intently {{for any sign of}} the bombers, failing to find one when he heard them pass overhead. Bowen averted total disaster by quickly arranging a demonstration of his system in the Red Tower, which <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> aircraft as they re-formed [...] away.|$|E
500|$|Although {{interest}} has been expressed in adapting Saga for film or TV, Vaughan and Staples reaffirmed their {{desire not to}} do so in an August 2013 interview, with Vaughan stating that the point of Saga as he conceived it was [...] "to do absolutely everything I couldn't do in a movie or a TV show. I'm really happy with it just being a comic." [...] Vaughan has stated that they are open to the possibility, though it is not a priority for them. However, merchandise based on the series has been produced, including a line of T-shirts featuring Lying Cat, which have become visible in popular media. In [...] "Pac-Man Fever", the April 24, 2013 episode of the American TV series Supernatural, the character Charlie Bradbury (played by Felicia Day) is seen wearing a Lying Cat T-shirt. Day, who has referred to Saga as the [...] "best comic EVER", indicated that show writer Robbie Thompson <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> shirt.|$|E
500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs her fingers through her hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E

500|$|McCartney's {{first serious}} girlfriend in Liverpool was {{seventeen}} year old Dorothy [...] "Dot" [...] Rhone (a bank clerk or a cashier at a chemist's, according to varying accounts), {{whom he had}} met at The Casbah Club in 1959. McCartney <b>picked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clothes he liked Rhone to wear and told her which make up to use, also paying {{for her to have}} her blonde hair done in the style of Brigitte Bardot, whom both he and John Lennon idolised. He disliked Rhone seeing her friends, and stopped her from smoking, even though he did so himself. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with The Beatles he wrote regular letters to Rhone, and she accompanied Lennon's girlfriend, Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when the group played there again in 1962. According to Rhone, McCartney bought her a gold ring in Hamburg, a leather skirt, took her sightseeing, and was very attentive and caring. For the time Rhone was there, the couple lived in a bungalow by the Hamburg docks that belonged to Rosa, a former cleaner at the Indra club. McCartney admitted that he had other girlfriends in Hamburg when Rhone was in Liverpool, admitting that they were usually strippers, who knew a lot more about sex than Liverpool girls.|$|E
