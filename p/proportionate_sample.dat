The research presented in this article aimed to identify whether and how boundaryless careers are manifested in the management of the professional transition of these workers. The methodological approach was quantitative, submitting a closed questionnaire to a random <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample,</b> stratified into two groups: those who remained in the institution following privatization and those who accepted voluntary redundancy in 2001. The assumption raised by hypothesis 3 that the two groups’ responses would differ, was rejected. The results, which led to the acceptance of hypothesis 2, indicated that the way in which one manages one’s career while employed by a stable organization influences the personal management of one’s professional transition, and also influences the manifestation of boundaryless careers. It was impossible to establish a pattern for this manifestation during the professional transition; thus, hypothesis 1 was accepted.

Personal innovative behaviour, unlike measures of consumer innovativeness, amalgamates decisions about product adoption with reports of the product’s actual use. Quantitative methodology was used, and probability proportional stratified sampling technique was used to obtain the <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample.</b> Items to measure personal innovative behaviour for e-book readers were included in a questionnaire distributed to students at a Malaysian university. Of the 386 participants, 79 % used the e-book reader, half of them for academic purposes. Confirmatory factor analysis using Amos tested the concept of personal innovative behaviour for both users and non-users. The results indicated that the underlying dimensions, (intended Adoption Behaviour and actual Use Behaviour), could be measured and combined in a structural model only for users, i. e. innovators. Good model fit confirmed the validity and reliability of the framework. The redefined construct and scale validation will be helpful to researchers to measure the individual personal behaviour in terms of their final decision to adopt and actual usage of the novel product. The personal innovative behaviour scale presented here can be used by researchers and practitioners to measure adoption and use of personal information products and devices. The two dimensional conceptualization of personal innovative behaviour (intended Adoption Behaviour and actual Use Behaviour) reconciles similarities and differences between the decision and action variables in innovation diffusion theory and the technology acceptance model...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{describe}} women's postpartum {{experiences with}} mother-baby togetherness in hospital, and the concordance {{of their experiences}} with the recommendations from Health Canada (2000 a) on family-centred maternity and newborn care (FCMNC). Design. Descriptive study based on secondary analysis of a telephone survey conducted at one week and six weeks postnatally. Five elements reported by women were examined: the timing of first physical contact, physical proximity {{during the first few}} hours, transfer together to postnatal unit, rooming-in, and combined mother-baby care. Setting. Four maternity units in Ottawa (Ontario, Canada) including two level I units, one level II and one level III unit. A <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample</b> was drawn from each unit. The overall response rate to both interviews was 88. 3 %. Participants. Women (N = 552) who returned home with their babies within the first postnatal week, between October 2000 and March 2001. Findings. While in hospital, 95. 8 % of mothers and babies were separated. Combined care was reported by 84. 7 % of women and rooming-in by only 33. 9 % of women. Only 8. 8 % of women experienced all five FCMNC recommended practices. Practices varied between the units (p <. 001). Women who had a caesarean birth {{were more likely to be}} separated from their infants than those who had a vaginal birth. Routine procedures performed in the nursery was the most frequently reported reason (55. 8 %) for the first separation of mothers and babies. Conclusion. Few women reported receiving care based on the FCMNC recommendations about mother-baby togetherness. Hospital practices varied considerably. It is recommended that healthy newborns receive care at their mothers' bedside. Further research is recommended to study the relationship between unit policy, actual practices, nurses' beliefs and women's preferences about the elements of mother-baby togetherness...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess in a nationwide sample of Kuwaiti subjects the reliability and validity of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), a shorter version of the widely used QOL assessment instrument that comprises 26 items in the domains of physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and the environment. Methods: A one-in-three systematic random <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample</b> of consenting Kuwaiti nationals attending large cooperative stores and municipal government offices in the six governorates completed the Arabic translation of the questionnaire. The indices assessed included test-retest reliability, internal consistency, item internal consistency (IIC), item discriminant validity (IDV), known-groups and construct validity. Results: There were 3303 participants (44. 8 &#x 0025; males, 55. 2 &#x 0025; females, mean age 35. 4 years, range 16 to 87 years). The intra-class correlation for the test-retest statistic and the internal consistency values for the full questionnaire and the domains had a Cronbach&#x 2032;s alpha? 0. 7. Of the 24 items that constitute the domains, 21 met the IIC requirement of correlation ? 0. 4 with the corresponding domain, while 16 met the IDV criterion of having a higher correlation with their corresponding domain than other domains. Domain scores discriminated significantly between well and sick groups. In the factor analysis, four strong factors emerged with the same construct as in the WHO report. Conclusion: The Arabic translation of the WHOQOL-BREF has impressive reliability and validity indices. The poor IDV findings are due to the multidimensional nature of the questionnaire. The highly significant validity indices should reassure researchers that the questionnaire represents the same constructs across cultures. Negatively worded items possibly need refinement...|$|E
40|$|While {{the cannon}} of {{objectivity}} {{has recently been}} called into question as the means for evaluating news merit, objectivity continues to harbor public expectation of the news media, especially during times of conflict. Results of past and current objectivity studies of conflict reporting, however, were shown to produce inconsistent and conflicting interpretations of whether the news media is presenting objective coverage of conflicts. To determine objectivity of news coverage, this content analysis examined objectivity differences between three newspapers [...] the Chicago Tribune, the Indianapolis Star, and the Anderson Herald Bulletin [...] and how they collectively presented front-page conflict and mainstream straight news stories. The study evaluated the newspapers' collective presentation of the September 11 h terrorist attack for a two-week period from September 12 through September 26, 2001. Presentation of the conflict was compared to a <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample</b> of mainstream straight news stories randomly selected from the months of January through December of 2001. Because the literature review indicated researchers most commonly evaluate news objectivity {{according to the presence}} of balance, attribution, or gatekeeping bias, the study assessed differences in objectivity level between conflict and straight news based upon the integration of all three objectivity variables The study's findings suggested that reporting of mainstream straight news was more objective than reporting of the September 11 terrorist attack conflict in the combined three newspapers. Reporting of the terrorist attack was found to be less balanced than reporting of straight news stories, as evidenced by a disproportionate amount of quotations afforded in support of United States war efforts. In addition, conflict stories were found to contain a significantly higher use of negative attributes-non-essential adjectives, inferences, collateral language and non-speech quotes [...] than straight news stories. Differences between page placement and revelation of theme were found to have no effect on objectivity differences. Department of JournalismThesis (M. A. ...|$|E

Two principal schemes are applied: the scheme “S” applied on 69. 1 % of the total herds (n= 712) and consisting in one <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample</b> of all daily milkings, and the scheme “T” (21. 6 % of the total herds) which consists in one sample of only one milking (morning or evening milking) (and alternating milking time from month to month). The problematic is that application of different schemes could influence the milk components (protein and fat yield) and the milk fat components (saturated and unsaturated groups of fatty acids) genetic parameters estimation and to prevent all comparisons between dairy population under different {{milk recording}} schemes. A total of 47, 613 and 44, 833 test-day records were obtained, respectively for schemes “S” and “T” from Holstein cows in first lactation in Luxembourg dairy herds. The used model included as fixed effects: herd x date of test, class of age, and month x year. Random effects were permanent environmental, additive genetics, and residual effects. The main objective of this work is to study the effect the choice of milk recording schemes (“S” or “T” schemes) on milk yield and milk components genetic parameters. A solution could be to add a fixed effect taking in account the milking time. The second objective is to study the effect of milking time (morning or evening) on genetic parameters estimated in the case of scheme “T”. According to the results, genetic parameters were statistically different between the schemes “S” and “T” for milk yield (P value < 0. 0001). Further, the classifications of bulls according to their breeding values were very different when values were estimated on basis of scheme “S” or “T” (Spearman correlation value of 0. 51 for milk yield for example).

40|$|Milk {{composition}} in fatty acids (FA) portrays {{a class of}} novel traits of interest for both human health and animal robustness. With the exception of Wallonia, Luxembourg is currently {{the only place in}} the world where, using mid-infrared spectrometry, milk {{composition in}} 29 FA is routinely recorded for dairy cows. Since 2007, spectral data has been recorded so far on 87, 368 cows from 690 different herds, by 2 main control methods (T-method: one sample of only one milking, morning or evening, and S-method: <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample</b> of all daily milkings). Additionally, milk, fat and protein yields are available since 1990. The availability of FA allows many options for management use and animal breeding but requires advanced modeling (e. g., adapted to the testing methods). In the context of animal breeding, genomic selection has been widely developed in dairy cattle, where single-step approach (ssGBLUP) is particularly well suited for small-sized populations, as the dairy cattle population of Luxembourg (365, 892 animals currently in pedigree) and is completely integrated into mixed modeling of phenotypic data. The objectives of this study were: (1) to assess the potential benefits of a single-step genomic evaluation on milk FA composition in a small-sized population and in particular (2) to quantify the impact of genomic information on reliability (REL) of estimated breeding values (EBV) of FA in Luxembourg. In a preliminary study for a single FA, oleic acid (C 18 : 1 cis 9) genetic evaluations were performed on 47, 613 milk records; collected by S-method, from 8, 000 cows in first parity with a random regression test-day model using second order Legendre polynomials.

The researcher and trained interviewers administered a survey to the 16 certified staff members working in the Right Choices Program including the executive director and the program coordinator. A stratified random <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample</b> was used to produce functionally equivalent groups from the NC WISE data for the out-of-school suspension comparison. This study then examined the benefits and limitations of the program based on teacher and staff perceptions and analysis of the suspension data from NC WISE. The four research questions that guided the study along with their findings were: What are the contextual issues that warrant an alternative program? These issues can be summarized as behavioral challenges, emotional issues, drug and violent offenses, number of out-of-school suspensions, and behind academically. What are the capabilities of this school system to provide alternative sources? The large southeastern urban school district was capable and willing to fund alternative programs that could show positive results as long as drug and violent acts, out-of-school suspensions, and dropouts were trending up. Is the Right Choices Program following its design as planned? The focus groups showed strong agreement that the program was expanding and going in the right direction and there was agreement that the program was going as prescribed and should be continued. What is the impact of the Right Choices Program on student behavior and attitudes? The Right Choices test group received 234 out-of-school suspensions after attending the program and the matched pairs control group received 426 out-of-school suspensions for the same period of time; this represented a 45...|$|E
40|$|With {{the passage}} of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, {{vocational}} education programs were established throughout the United States and the vocational movement has been experiencing steady growth ever since. The vocational agricultural program, whose primary aim was “to train present and prospective farmers for proficiency in farming,” has experienced the most growth. Nonetheless, changes in the agricultural industry and their resulting effects on the rural population and the number of schools in Nebraska has raised many questions {{in the minds of the}} state’s agricultural educators as they develop and implement programs that will satisfy the occupational needs of rural farm youth. Several studies have been conducted in Nebraska regarding the occupational status of former high school students. These studies were conducted, however, on a local school basis and did not involve a study of size of high school as it related to occupational status of former graduates. The primary purpose of this investigation was to determine the relationships of size of high school to occupational factors of Nebraska male farm high school graduates who had graduated from nine to 13 years earlier. Lists of all Nebraska high schools who had offered an approved program of vocational agriculture during at least one of the academic years 1954 through 1958 were developed according to size of high school. A <b>proportionate</b> <b>sample</b> of 50 percent (69) of these schools was randomly selected for the study. Lists of all farm-reared male graduates (3192) by year of graduation were obtained from these randomly selected schools, and a 40 percent sample of graduates (1305) in each of the graduating classes was randomly selected to participate in the study. Graduates included in the study were those whose fathers were farming on the day their sons were graduated from high school or who had farmed during most of the time that their sons were in high school. Of the original 1305 graduates, 96 were deleted when they failed to meet the criteria for inclusion in the study. The final sample of respondents numbered 1120; the final response rate was 92. 9 percent. Findings of this study provide valuable information for those engaged in planning useful and meaningful educational programs designed to meet the occupational needs of farm youth. The findings should be of particular value to instructors, state supervisors, and teacher educators of vocational agriculture as well as school administrators and local boards of education.

40|$|Using {{a random}} start, fixed {{interval}} method of population <b>proportionate</b> <b>sampling,</b> the survey teams visited 219 villages in rural Nepal and collected data on height, weight, and age from 6501 preschool children. During training and at specific {{times during the}} survey, systematic standardization methods were utilized {{to improve the quality}} of the collected data. Using 80 % of the reference median weight-for-height as the cut-off point, the prevalence of acute undernutrition was 6. 7 %. Using 90 % of the reference median height-for-age as the cut-off point, the prevalence of chronic undernutrition was 52 %. The prevalence of chronic undernutrition was significantly higher in the hilly areas. Mean haemoglobin values of blood samples collected from one-fifth of the survey population increased with age with no difference between hill and terai areas. A Nepal urban elite population was measured for comparison. The survey method used indicators that are economical in terms of money, time, and personnel and that provide objective data on the extent and distribution of protein/energy undernutrition and of low haemoglobin values in preschool children...|$|R
40|$|Shaping and {{changing}} the attitude of academic staff in private higher education institutions is critical in enhancing their commitment for the overall improvement of organizational performance. This will enable private universities to compete with other institutions {{as well as to}} produce high quality and competitive graduates. The first objective of this research is {{to examine the relationship between}} psychological empowerment and organizational commitment. The second objective is to explore the influence of the four cognitions of psychological empowerment: meaning cognition, competence cognition, self-determination cognition and impact cognition on organizational commitment. The study employed a stratified <b>proportionate</b> <b>sampling</b> design. A total of 247 academicians from four private universities participated in the survey. The result indicated that the overall psychological empowerment is significantly related to organizational commitment. Further analysis also revealed that of the four cognitions of psychological empowerment, only impact cognition significantly contributes to organization commitment. Managers who empower their employees by giving them opportunities to make decisions about their work methods, pace and efforts will subsequently increase their subordinates’ commitment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the relationship between supply chain strategies and performance of large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya by addressing three primary gaps in the literature. The research gaps include the research findings and results on the relationship between supply chain strategies and firm performance that have been contradicting and no attempt to clear the contradictions; biased and unbalanced analysis of the different measures of firm performance, and failure to use weighted scores to measure firm performance. Resource-Based View guided this study. A sample of one hundred and thirty-eight (138) firms was drawn using <b>proportionate</b> <b>sampling</b> from a population of six hundred and twenty-seven (627) large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya. The response rate was seventy-five (75) percent. The correlation analysis and regression analysis models were used to test the hypotheses. The study findings indicate that Supply chain strategies are useful predictors of the firm’s performance as supply chain strategies explain 76. 7 % of the changes in the firm’s performance.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} information resources and services utilization {{for research in}} academic libraries in Niger state, Nigeria. Descriptive survey research method {{was used for the}} study and 292, representing 5 % of a total of 5847 lecturers in the 10 academic institutions in the state were sampled based on certified <b>proportionate</b> <b>sampling</b> technique. Consequently, 292 copies of questionnaire were administered and 280 were returned and found usable. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the data gathered. The results indicated that more of information resources in print format were provided at the expense of those in non-print, conventional services such as loan of books and photocopying etc were adequately provided while selective dissemination of information, indexing and abstracting services were completely abandoned. Certain factors such as inadequate funding of the libraries etc were found to be militating against the provision and utilization of information resources and services. The study recommended among others that academic libraries should be adequately funded and qualified and experienced staff should be employed to provide required resources and services...|$|R
