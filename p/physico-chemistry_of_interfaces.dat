40|$|Abstract. Beta–D-poly-glucopyranose is {{widespread}} {{class of the}} natural semi-crystalline polysaccharide known as cellulose. This polymer has complicated multi-level supermolecular structure. It is built from elementary nano-fibrils and their aggregates; moreover, each nano-fibril contains ordered nanocrystallites and low-ordered amorphous nano-domains. Therefore cellulose can be a pronounced and eminent representative of nano-structured matters. Such nano matter has peculiar physico-chemical properties depending on specific surface of nano-scale constituents. In this paper, <b>physico-chemistry</b> <b>of</b> the nano-structured cellulose is discussed. In particular, the ability of nano-scale crystallites to co-crystallization and aggregation, {{as well as their}} ability to phase transformation through dissolution, alkalization and chemical modification was a subject of the investigation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of highly dispersible silica micropearls by Rhodia {{led to the}} introduction of silica as a reinforcing filler in Green tyres in 1992 by Michelin. However new environmental constraints imply to further improve the silica dispersion process. The objective of the present work was to investigate the role of silica intrinsic parameters on its dispersibility in order to determine key parameters to improve the silica dispersion. The behaviour of different silica grades was thus investigated: two classical silica micropearl grades for tyre applications different in their specific area (silica Z 1165 MP with a high specific area and silica Z 1115 MP with a lower specific area), the same grades chemically modified with a covering agent (silane), and pilot grades (same specific area, same aggregate structure as Z 1165 MP) synthesized by Rhodia where the <b>physico-chemistry</b> <b>of</b> the silica surface was modified during the silica process. The dispersion behaviour was characterized in model conditions: in air (impact on wall) and under shear in a SBR matrix (rheo-optical device). The direct observation of dispersion mechanism in a SBR matrix under shear showed that the Z 1115 MP dispersed via an efficient mechanism of disintegration with the sudden breakage of the micropearl into micron size fragments above a low critical stress whereas the Z 1165 MP ruptured into a few large fragments at a higher stress. The post-chemical modification of the silica surface using silane had no effect on the silica dispersion compared to raw materials. However the modification <b>of</b> the <b>physico-chemistry</b> <b>of</b> the silica surface during the silica process implied changes in the internal organisation of the micropearl and allowed to modify the dispersion mechanism.

Geochemical analyses of coccoliths can be used to unravel climatic fluctuations in the oceanic realm, but such reconstructions are complicated due to the problem of the "vital effect".

For decades, it was thought that the magnitude of the vital effect was species-specific and constant for a given species. Recent studies aiming at a mechanistic understanding of these processes point towards a plastic and environmental-dependent interplay between the physiology of coccolithophores and isotopic composition in coccolith calcite. This "mobilis in mobili" relationship opens the door to the possibility to explore the vital effects as palaeoenvironmental proxies undertaking an interspecies approach. New physiological parameters, such as the quantification of calcification rates, pH, and calcium and carbon pools in the coccolith vesicle would further help geologists to constrain the vital effect. Emerging "non-traditional" isotope systems will also contribute to refine the transfer functions between coccolith geochemistry, vital effect, and palaeoenvironments...|$|R

The aim of this work is to determine the physicochemical properties of safou tree fruits. These fruits, called safou, are consumed less than two days after harvest. The morphologic character vary according to the area and the types.

Results from the pond monitoring showed the rapid response of these small water bodies to alterations in air temperature and pluviometry.

The area has anomalous gas emissions and is affected by seismicity and uplift. The geochemistry of the lake have been systematically investigated since 2003 by measuring physico-chemical parameters along vertical profiles with a multiparametric probe and by collecting water samples for chemical and isotopic analyses. The lake is thermally and chemically stratified, with an anoxic hypolimnion from 270 m to the bottom (2167 m). The isotopic composition of dissolved helium and total carbon {{is similar to that}} of the main gas emissions of Colli Albani and of the phenocryst inclusions of the Alban volcanics, suggesting that an endogenous gas of deep provenance is injected into the lake water. The dissolved CO 2 content is, however, far from saturation, and no Nyos-type hazardous gas cloud emission may presently occur in the lake. Temperature and chemical time variations indicate that water rollover episodes occur in harsh rainy winters when the surface lake temperature cools below 8. 5 8 C.
