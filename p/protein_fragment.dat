5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid <b>protein</b> <b>fragment).</b> Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
25|$|Another {{control is}} created by linking the {{fluorescent}} <b>protein</b> <b>fragment</b> to proteins with mutated interaction faces. So long as the fluorescent fragment is fused to the mutated proteins {{in the same manner}} as the wild-type protein, and the gene expression levels and localisation are unaffected by the mutation, this serves as a strong negative control, as the mutant proteins, and therefore, the fluorescent fragments, should be unable to interact.|$|E
25|$|A linker {{is a short}} {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} that tethers the fluorescent reporter <b>protein</b> <b>fragment</b> to the protein of interest, forming the fusion protein. When designing a linker sequence, one must ensure that the linker is sufficiently soluble and long to provide the fluorescent protein fragments with flexibility and freedom of movement so that the fragment and its partner fragment will collide frequently enough to reconstitute during the interaction of their respective fused proteins. Although it is not documented, {{it is possible that}} the length or the sequence of the linker may influence complementation of some proteins. Reported linker sequences RSIAT and RPACKIPNDLKQKVMNH (single amino acid code) and AAANSSIDLISVPVDSR (Sigma) have been successfully used in BiFC experiments.|$|E
40|$|Phosphatidylinositides are {{important}} signaling molecules that interact with {{a myriad of}} cellular proteins, many of which remain unidentified. We previously screened a yeast surface displayed human proteome library to identify <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> with affinity for the phosphatidylinositides PtdIns(4, 5) and PtdIns(3, 4, 5). Much of the diversity in the screened selection outputs was represented by clones present at low frequencies, suggesting {{that a significant number}} of additional phosphatidylinositide-binding <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> might be present in the selection outputs. In the studies described in this report, we developed a novel cDNA library analysis method and comprehensively analyzed the polyclonal selection outputs from the PtdIns(4, 5) and PtdIns(3, 4, 5) selections using a high density exon microarray. In addition to the nine previously reported phosphatidylinositide-binding <b>protein</b> <b>fragments,</b> we identified 37 new phosphatidylinositide-binding candidates.

This was the first report bZIP protein interaction regulation by regions outside of the bZIP domain, regulation of subnuclear localization of the bZIP domains Fos and Jun by their different interacting partners, and modulation of transcriptional activation of bZIP and Rel proteins through mutual interactions. In addition, this study was the first report of an in vivo technique, now known as the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, to provide insight into the structural basis of protein complex formation through detection of fluorescence caused by the assembly of fluorescent reporter protein fragments tethered to interacting proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{backbone}} fragment libraries {{have been}} used successfully {{in a variety of}} structural biology applications, including homology modeling, de novo structure prediction, possible states of the protein, where n is the number of residues and k is the number of discrete states modeled for each dihedral angle. In order to reduce the conformational space, one can use <b>protein</b> <b>fragment</b> libraries rather than explicitly model every phi-psi angle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first goal}} was {{achieved}} by understanding the structure and function of the virus. [...] Haseltine's laboratory, working in collaboration with two other groups, determined the complete sequence of the viral genome and discovered the genes that specify the virus capsid, polymerase, protease, ribonuclease H, integrase and envelop genes. [...] The first application of this knowledge was to design a fragment of the virus envelope protein {{that could be used}} to accurately detect antibodies to HIV in those infected, forming the basis of an accurate diagnostic test. This <b>protein</b> <b>fragment</b> was used by Cambridge BioSciences (Later named Cambridge BioTech) to develop a rapid test for HIV infection that could be used at home. It was only in 2012, that the US FDA approved a similar home HIV test kit.|$|E
30|$|To {{overcome}} {{the limitations of}} antibodies, both non-antibody binding <b>proteins</b> (<b>protein</b> <b>fragments)</b> and antibody fragments (e.g., single-chain variable fragments (scFv), fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragments, and single-domain antibody fragments (nanobodies)) have been designed and explored as scaffolds for therapeutic applications. Some of these have already {{been approved by the}} FDA for human use, and many are currently being evaluated pre-clinically or in clinical trials. Like antibodies, <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> can exert their therapeutic action through antagonizing receptors by inhibition of their ligand binding site(s), or binding to ligands to prevent their interaction with cognate receptor(s). These molecules can also function as antidotes and neutralize toxins or other harmful/infectious agents. The absence of an Fc may also prove to be beneficial in some cases to avoid the adverse effect associated with complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Unlike mAbs, <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> are generally very small in size (< 20 kDa) and thus may be better able to penetrate tumors. In addition, many <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> exhibit high thermostability, allowing storage at room temperature for extended periods of time without significant loss of activity, and can be easily produced in microorganisms or be completely chemically synthesized, enabling facile functionalization with other drug or imaging agents. The low cost of production, combined with the ability of some molecules to resist protease degradation and/or chemical denaturation, makes it possible for some <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> to be used in oral applications. Further, almost all <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> are engineered completely in vitro, generating binders that are not biased in any way by exposure to other molecules in vivo. Finally, bispecific binders able to crosslink tumors cells with immune effector cells and/or different receptors can be easily generated from <b>protein</b> <b>fragments.</b> These bispecific binders are becoming a promising new class of protein therapeutics. Although it is possible to generate bispecific antibodies, their production is very complex, adding to the already high cost of mAb production. In contrast, multiple <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> can be easily linked, via genetic or chemical linkers, to form bispecific, or even multi-specific, binders.|$|R

2500|$|When {{designing}} plasmid vectors {{to express}} the proteins of interest, the construct {{must be able to}} express proteins that are able to form fusion proteins with fluorescent protein fragments without disrupting the protein's function. In addition, the expected protein complex must be able to accept stabilisation of the fluorescent <b>protein</b> <b>fragment</b> interaction without affecting the protein complex function or the cell being studied. Many fluorescent protein fragments that combine in several ways can be used in BiFC. Generally, YFP is recommended to serve as the reporter protein, cleaved at residue 155 (N-terminal consisting of residues 1–154 and C-terminal consisting of residues 155–238) or residue 173 in particular, as these sets of fragments are highly efficient in their complementation when fused to many interacting proteins and they produce low levels fluorescence when fused to non-interacting proteins. It is suggested that each target protein is fused to both the N- and C-terminal fragments of the fluorescent reporter protein in turn, and that the fragments are fused at each of the N- and C-terminal ends of the target proteins.

2500|$|It {{was found}} that the {{reaction}} of chymotrypsin with its substrate takes place in two stages, an initial “burst” phase {{at the beginning of the}} reaction and a steady-state phase following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and then deacylation in order to return the enzyme to its original state. This occurs via the concerted action of the three amino acid residues in the catalytic triad. [...] Aspartate hydrogen bonds to the N-δ hydrogen of histidine, increasing the pKa of its ε nitrogen and thus making it able to deprotonate serine. It is this deprotonation that allows the serine side chain to act as a nucleophile and bind to the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the protein main chain. Ionization of the carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by formation of two hydrogen bonds to adjacent main chain N-hydrogens. This occurs in the oxyanion hole. This forms a tetrahedral adduct and breakage of the peptide bond. An acyl-enzyme intermediate, bound to the serine, is formed, and the newly formed amino terminus of the cleaved protein can dissociate. In the second reaction step, a water molecule is activated by the basic histidine, and acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen of water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the serine-bound acyl group, resulting in formation of a second tetrahedral adduct, regeneration of the serine -OH group, and release of a proton, as well as the <b>protein</b> <b>fragment</b> with the newly formed carboxyl terminus ...|$|E

40|$|Phosphatidylinositides are {{important}} signaling molecules that interact with {{a myriad of}} cellular proteins, many of which remain unidentified. We previously screened a yeast surface displayed human proteome library to identify <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> with affinity for the phosphatidylinositides, phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate. Much of the diversity in the screened selection outputs was represented by clones present at low frequencies, suggesting {{that a significant number}} of additional phosphatidylinositide-binding <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> might be present in the selection outputs.

We cloned and confirmed phosphatidylinositide binding by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for 17 of these novel candidate <b>protein</b> <b>fragments.</b> Our experiments suggest that phosphatidylinositide binding by these 17 novel <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> is dependent on both the inositol phosphate “headgroup” and the lipid “tail. ” This is in contrast with the PH domain containing fragments we tested, for which the inositol phosphate headgroup was sufficient for binding. The novel PtdIns-binding fragments come {{from a wide variety of}} proteins, including splicing factors, transcription factors, a kinase, and a polymerase. Intriguingly, 11 of the phosphatidylinositide-binding <b>protein</b> <b>fragments</b> are from nuclear proteins, including four containing homeobox domains.

FACS enrichment of target-binding clones in yeast human cDNA display libraries coupled with comprehensive analysis of the selection output by DNA microarray analysis is an effective method for investigating common as well as rare protein interactions.
