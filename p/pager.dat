Lifejackets have evolved from cork, kapok and synthetic foam to today's light and non-cumbersome designs. ALB and ILB crews wear different styles of lifejacket.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{said her}} first contact with WikiLeaks {{took place in}} January 2010, {{when she began to}} {{interact}} with them on IRC and Jabber. She had first noticed them toward the end of November 2009, when they posted 570,000 <b>pager</b> messages from the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and <b>pager</b> clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation.|$|E
5000|$|Two-way: Two-way <b>pagers</b> are {{response}} <b>pagers</b> {{with built-in}} QWERTY keyboards. These <b>pagers</b> allow the user reply to messages, originate messages, and forward messages using free-form text {{as well as}} [...] "canned" [...] responses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pagers</b> {{operate as}} part of a paging system which {{includes}} one or more fixed transmitters (or in the case of response <b>pagers</b> and two-way <b>pagers,</b> one or more base stations), {{as well as a number}} of <b>pagers</b> carried by mobile users. These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low-power transmitter, to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations.|$|R
40|$|In 2004, the Social Sciences & Humanities Library at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) {{implemented}} use of restaurant-style <b>pagers</b> for {{checking out}} Reserves Collection materials. <b>Pagers</b> {{are given to}} patrons when a desired reserves item is already in use. When the item is returned, the next patron is paged to the Circulation Desk to pick it up. The authors describe the UCSD Libraries’ process for initially implementing the <b>pagers,</b> explain the success they have seen with the <b>pagers</b> {{over the past four}} years, outline other libraries using similar <b>pagers,</b> and offer guidance for other institutions who might consider this innovative and user-friendly service enhancement...|$|R
25|$|RIM, {{founded in}} Waterloo, Ontario, first {{developed}} the Inter@ctive <b>Pager</b> 900, announced on September 18, 1996. The Inter@ctive <b>Pager</b> 900 was a clamshell-type device that allowed two-way paging. After {{the success of}} the 900, the Inter@ctive <b>Pager</b> 800 was created for IBM, which bought US$10 million worth of them on February 4, 1998. The next device to be released was the Inter@ctive <b>Pager</b> 950, on August 26, 1998. The very first device to carry the BlackBerry name was the BlackBerry 850, an email <b>pager,</b> released January 19, 1999. Although identical in appearance to the 950, the 850 was the first device to integrate email and the name Inter@ctive <b>Pager</b> was no longer used to brand the device.|$|E
25|$|Ontario police {{sergeant}} Jeff Quon, {{along with other}} officers and those they were exchanging messages with, had sued the city, their superiors and the <b>pager</b> service provider in federal court. They had alleged a violation of not only their constitutional rights but federal telecommunications privacy laws. Their defense was that a superior officer had promised the <b>pager</b> messages themselves would not be audited if the officers reimbursed the city for fees it incurred when they exceeded a monthly character limit.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by <b>pager,</b> issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that <b>pager</b> is detected, the <b>pager</b> will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E
50|$|By 1990, wide-area paging {{had been}} invented and over 22 million <b>pagers</b> were in use. Their number {{exploded}} and by 1994, {{there were over}} 61 million <b>pagers</b> in use.|$|R
50|$|Restaurant <b>pagers</b> are in wide {{use in the}} 2000s. Customers {{are given}} a {{portable}} receiver that usually vibrates, flashes, or beeps when a table becomes free or when their meal is ready. <b>Pagers</b> have been popular with birdwatchers in Britain and Ireland since 1991, with companies Rare Bird Alert and Birdnet Information offering news of rare birds sent to <b>pagers</b> that they sell.|$|R

25|$|According to {{official}} data and reports by the Moroccan media, <b>PAGER</b> increased {{access to water}} in rural areas from 14% in 1995 to 61% in 2004 and 77% in 2006. According to survey data, access to house connections in rural areas increased from 10% in 1995 to 20% in 2004. According to the same survey data access to an improved water source in rural areas remained constant between 1995 and 2004 at 58%. It remains unclear how the survey data and the data of <b>PAGER</b> can be reconciled.|$|E
25|$|Ontario v Quon, 130 S.Ct. 2619, (2010) {{the right}} of privacy did not extend to {{employer}} owned electronic devices so an employee could be dismissed for sending sexually explicit messages from an employer owned <b>pager.</b>|$|E
25|$|While Pager’s {{study is}} greatly informative, it does lack some {{valuable}} information. <b>Pager</b> only studied {{white and black}} males, which leaves out women and people of other races. It also fails {{to account for the}} fact that applying for jobs has largely shifted from applying in person to applying over the Internet. A study done by Scott H. Decker, Cassia Spohn, Natalie R. Ortiz, and Eric Hedberg from Arizona State University in 2014 accounts for this missing information. This study was set up similarly to the <b>Pager</b> study, but with the addition of female job applicants, Hispanic job applicants, and online job applications. Men and women of white, black, and Hispanic ethnicities account for 92% of the US prison population.|$|E
50|$|EMBARC (Electronic Mail Broadcast to A Roaming Computer) was a {{business}} enterprise of the Motorola company that provided wireless broadcast of e-mail and news to mobile subscribers. It was established in 1990 after Motorola purchased Contemporary Communications, a national carrier for <b>pagers</b> in the 900 MHz band. Unfortunately, alphanumeric <b>pagers</b> did not show rapid growth in the market, forming less than 5% of all <b>pagers</b> by 1991.|$|R
5000|$|Beepers or tone-only pagers: Beepers or tone-only <b>pagers</b> are the {{simplest}} and least expensive form of paging. They were named beepers because they originally made a beeping noise, but current <b>pagers</b> in this category use other forms of alert as well. Some use audio signals, others light up and some vibrate, often used in combination. The majority of restaurant <b>pagers</b> fall into this category.|$|R
50|$|The 2005 London bombings {{resulted}} in overload of TETRA systems by the emergency services, {{and showed that}} <b>pagers,</b> with their absence of necessity to transmit an acknowledgement before showing the message, and the related capability to operate on very low signal levels, are not completely outclassed by their successors. Volunteer firefighters, EMS paramedics, and rescue squad members usually carry <b>pagers</b> to alert them of emergency call outs for their department. These <b>pagers</b> receive a special tone from a fire department radio frequency.|$|R
25|$|The first BlackBerry device, the 850, was {{introduced}} in 1999 as a two-way <b>pager</b> in Munich, Germany. The name BlackBerry was coined by the marketing company Lexicon Branding. The name was chosen due to the resemblance of the keyboard's buttons {{to that of the}} drupelets that compose the blackberry fruit.|$|E
25|$|A {{major issue}} {{at all levels}} was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's {{practice}} of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace. If it was the former, Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy for his <b>pager</b> messages. The city and department argued that Duke could not set or amend policy so {{what he said was}} irrelevant. And even if it was, it did not matter since the <b>pager</b> messages could be disclosed under the California Public Records Act. The plaintiffs argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was all that mattered.|$|E
