The analysis performed by the author aims at determining the causes of excessive investment propensity at all levels of the economic hierarchy which are inherent in the socio-economic system. The author distinguishes between bottom-top (enterprises, unions of <b>producers,</b> <b>branch</b> ministries) and top-bottom (central planner) drives to investment when analyzing the causes of their existence in connection with the mechanism of making investment decisions. An important part of the problem of excessive propensity to invest, being also discussed in the article, is impact of the above mentined drives to investon the excessive investment demand within the entire system. When describing the pressure exerted by economic units at lower levels of the management system on entities situated at higher levels the author presents a mechanism of format ion of informal and cover t groups of interests and their role in making in vestment decisions. Although the object of this analysis is not construction of positive propositions referring to the entire system, among conclusions drawn on the basis of the analysis, there can be also found a postulate of "hard" monetary-budgetary constraints for economic units as the only effective impediment to excessive investment propensity.

Among the others representing the producers included Louis B. Mayer, Hal Roach, Jack L. Warner, B. B. Kahane, and Harold Lloyd. By this point, Briskin was considered one of the most important studio executives in the industry, being included a group called by some [...] "the brain trust", which also included Hal B. Wallis, Jack L. Warner, B. B. Kahane, Harold Lloyd, Hal Roach, and Irving Thalberg. In June 1934 Briskin, acting as a representative for 8 major studios, met with representatives from film camera manufacturers, in an attempt to reach an agreement between the two sides to pool their resources in order to develop a silent film camera. In September 1934, Briskin signed a new contract with Columbia, after having been courted by Paramount. Later that month, he was elected to the <b>producers</b> <b>branch</b> of AMPAS, as well as being appointed a member of the executive committee. When the 1932 agreement between studios and freelance screenwriters expired in 1935, Briskin {{was selected}} as one of five producers, the others being Sol Wurtzel, Irving Thalberg, Hal Wallis, and Henry Herzbrun, to represent the studios in the negotiations. In addition to representing the producers in their negotiations with the writers, Briskin was also selected as one of six producers to negotiate the new contract with the actors' guild. In August 1935 Briskin was renegotiating his contract with Columbia. Speculation began that he was being approached by other studios, including MGM.|$|R
40|$|I {{assemble}} a new dataset of global corporate acquisitions and sales {{at the firm}} level to analyze multinational expansion patterns. Four facts emerge: 1) the number of firms making a given number of acquisitions has a Pareto shape; 2) firms expand into industries and countries with a similar Pareto frequency; 3) entrants into unpopular industries or countries are larger, as measured by global sales; and 4) at the firm level, industrial diversification and internationalization are simultaneous. I first present a statistical model of balls falling into bins to understand the mechanics of multiproduct firms. I find that it quantitatively predicts some, but not all, of the observed entry regularities: multinational firms are approximately like a random collection of identical size goods. However, the model fails to explain firm entry by popularity of the destination. In light of this finding, I propose a multi-industry-country model where firms produce in their core competence activities. Heterogeneous <b>producers</b> <b>branch</b> out into new industries if they overcome the fixed costs of entry, and also choose whether to produce abroad. At the firm level, ability pushes companies to enter into new industries and countries, but distance in the physical and product dimension generates resistance to expansion. This theory generates an industry-country gravity equation for aggregate bilateral sales, closely matching the data. ∗I am very grateful to Thomas Chaney, Ralph Ossa and especially to Samuel Kortum for their advice and encouragement.

40|$|Two {{types of}} intact {{branched}} glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) were detected in peat bog samples from Bullenmoor, Northern Germany. Glucuronosyl and glucosyl branched GDGTs comprise on average ca. 4 % of the microbial intact polar lipids in the anoxic, acidic peat layer ca. 20 cm {{below the surface}} of the bog, suggesting an important ecological role for the source microorganisms. No corresponding phospholipids were detected. Notably, glycosidic branched GDGTs are 5 - 10 times less abundant than their intact isoprenoid counterparts derived from Archaea, while branched GDGT core lipids exceed their isoprenoid analogues by about an order of magnitude. These contrasting relationships may reflect lower standing stocks of the biomass of <b>producers</b> of <b>branched</b> GDGTs, combined with higher population growth rates relative to soil Archaea.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, a new proxy for the {{reconstruction}} of continental paleotemperature and past soil pH has been developed based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs). Branched GDGTs are membrane lipids of as of yet unknown bacteria that thrive in peat and soils. Their molecular structure can vary {{in the number of}} methyl branches and cyclopentane moieties that are attached to their tetraether backbone. Their relative distribution in soils is determined by the annual mean air temperature (MAT) and pH of their living environment, and can be quantified using the Methylation of Branched Tetraether (MBT) index, and the Cyclisation of Branched Tetraether (CBT) index. Branched GDGTs are transported with soil organic matter by rivers and deposited in marine coastal regions, where down-core application of the so-called MBT-CBT proxy may yield an integrated paleoclimate record for the river basin. Although the MBT-CBT proxy seems to be a promising tool to obtain information about continental climatic changes in the past, the validity and applicability of the proxy need further testing. The influence of the two main environmental controls on the distribution and abundance of branched GDGTs in soils (MAT and soil pH) was, therefore, tested in a variety of natural settings. Geothermally heated soils surrounding hot springs were used to determine the influence of changes in temperature, whereas the impact of changes in soil pH was tested in long term pH manipulated field plots. Analysis of branched GDGTs in soils from an altitude transect along a mountain slope showed that MAT and soil pH are indeed the two main controls on the distribution of branched GDGTs in a setting with many varying environmental factors. Furthermore, MBT-CBT-based MAT estimates were tested on bias towards a specific season, but no influence of seasonality could be ascertained. When verifying to what extent the branched GDGT distribution in fjord sediment reflects that of the nearby continent it was discovered that branched GDGTs can also be produced in situ in the marine environment. This lead to the recommendation to only use the MBT-CBT proxy at sites that receive substantial amounts of soil organic matter relative to the amount of marine organic matter, i. e. close to river mouths. Information about the possible <b>producers</b> of <b>branched</b> GDGTs was derived from the identification of intact polar (i. e. with head group still attached; IPLs) branched GDGTs in a Swedish peat. Changes in head group distribution and their concentration with depth hint towards Acidobacteria as their likely producers. Based on all available soils, the proxy was revised and subjected to statistical tests to derive the best equation to calculate MAT based on the distribution of branched GDGTs. Finally, the MBT-CBT proxy was applied on a loess-paleosol sequence in China, which resulted in a continental paleotemperature reconstruction covering the last 34 kyr. The trends and timing of temperature changes are in agreement with other continental climate records. The data presented in this thesis show that temperature and pH are indeed the main factors controlling the distribution of branched GDGTs, but that absolute temperatures generated by the MBT-CBT proxy must be interpreted with care...|$|R
40|$|K EYWORDS : Branched GDGTs, proxy, pH, temperature, Acidobacteria, methylotrophy, {{high-throughput}} techniques Bacteria {{present in}} soil and peat bog environments were previously found to produce branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether membrane lipids (GDGTs) {{that are used}} as a paleoenvironmental proxy to estimate historic soil temperature and pH. Based on the composition and abundance of branched GDGTs, two indices were previously defined, of which the degree of Cyclisation of Branched Tetraethers (CBT) is related to soil pH {{and the degree of}} Methylation of Branched Tetraethers (MBT) is related to both soil pH and mean annual air temperature (MAT). It was hypothesized that bacteria produce branched GDGTs as a response to changes in pH and temperature. Members of the phylum Acidobacteria were proposed to produce branched GDGTs based on their abundance in peat environments, rich in GDGTs. Recently, it was shown that two representatives from subdivision 1 and 3, Edaphobacter aggregans Wbg- 1 T and Acidobacteriaceae strain A 2 - 4 c, are able to produce these membrane lipids. However, environmental distribution of branched GDGTs is diverse indicating that members of additional subdivisions of Acidobacteria or yet other phyla might also be able to produce branched GDGTs. TheAcidobacteria constitute a diverse and ubiquitous phylum and its members play an important role especially in terrestrial environments. Information about the Acidobacteria was collected, including their phylogeny and taxonomy, their role in nature, genomic traits and methods applied for their isolation. Soil is a very dynamic and complex ecosystem and soil organisms are major components of the soil. They are crucial for both soil structure and soil processes. The biological activity in the soil mainly occurs in the topsoil, which contains soil organisms and plant roots. Soil microorganisms including bacteria, archaea and fungi are responsible for nutrient cycling and decomposition of organic residues. Microbial activities are strongly influenced by a range of abiotic and biotic factors and by the interaction between different microorganisms. To get insight into the influence of environmental parameters on the bacterial diversity in relation to production of branched GDGTs, soil samples containing variable amounts of these lipids were taken from different locations, namely from two different hot springs  (Surprise Valley, California, USA) and along the watershed of the Têt river (France). Bacterial community composition was characterized by using high-throughput cultivation independent techniques as well as selective cultivation. It was shown that both pH and temperature strongly affected microbial community composition. Data presented in this thesis furthermore suggest that besides Acidobacteria, members of additional phyla might also responsible for the observed production of branched GDGTs. Notably, occurrence and relative abundance of members of the Alpha- and Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were related to the abundance of branched GDGTs. Furthermore, enrichment studies at different pH, temperature and with different substrates suggested that methanol might be a good carbon source to enrich for <b>producers</b> of <b>branched</b> GDGTs. Unfortunately, attempts towards the isolation of branched GDGTs producing bacteria were unsuccessful. However, a novel methylotrophic Azospirillum species, Azospirillum methanolicus, was isolated. In addition to that, novel methylotrophic candidate genera including Acidobacteria subdivision 1 and Pedobacter were identified from initial enrichment studies.   In conclusion, data presented in this thesis showed that temperature and pH have a strong effect on the microbial community composition in all soil studied here. Although branched GDGTs producing bacteria were not isolated, the data described in this thesis may help to design new strategies to isolate and identify target bacteria in the future.  ...|$|R
40|$|Branched {{glycerol}} dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are membrane lipids of {{soil bacteria}} that occur ubiquitously in soils, peats, and marine sediments. The {{structures of the}} branched GDGTs vary {{in the number of}} methyl groups (4 to 6) attached to the alkyl chains and can contain up to two cyclopentane moieties. An empirical study showed that their distribution in over 130 globally distributed soils is mainly controlled by mean annual air temperature (MAT) and soil pH, and can be expressed using the Methylation of Branched Tetraethers (MBT) index and the Cyclisation of Branched Tetraethers (CBT) index. The CBT index relates with soil pH, whereas the MBT index is related to both MAT and, to a lesser extent, soil pH. The combination of the MBT and CBT indices can then be used as a proxy for paleotemperature and past soil pH; the so-called MBT-CBT proxy. Branched GDGTs are transported with soil organic matter by rivers and deposited in marine coastal regions, where down-core analysis of branched GDGTs may yield an integrated MAT record for the river basin. However, before this proxy can be confidently applied, the exact influence of environmental controls on the distribution of branched GDGTs needs to be further investigated and possible constraints on its applicability need to be examined. The influence of MAT and soil pH on the distribution of branched GDGTs, and thus the MBT-CBT proxy, was assessed in different natural settings. The direct effect of temperature changes was determined by analyzing branched GDGTs in soil transects away from two hot springs. The distribution of branched GDGTs in these geothermally heated soils changed substantially; MBT index values decrease with increasing distance from the hot spring and decreasing soil temperature. Although the slope of this relation is similar to that based on the global soil calibration set, the intercept is different. This difference {{can be explained by the}} use of in situ soil temperature in the relation for the geothermally heated soils rather than MAT, which was used in the initial study. The influence of soil pH on the degree of cyclisation and the abundance of branched GDGTs was tested in soils from long term pH manipulated field plots with a pH range of 4. 5 - 7. 5. The distribution of core lipid (CL) and intact polar lipid (i. e. with headgroup still attached; IPL) -derived branched GDGTs was analyzed for each plot. The CBT index values of both CLs and IPL-derived branched GDGTs were significantly related with the actual soil pH, confirming the direct influence of soil pH on the distribution of branched GDGTs. Also, CBT-based pH estimates were similar to actual soil pH. Furthermore, soil pH affected the abundance of branched GDGTs, which showed a decrease with increasing pH. The abundance of Acidobacteria, suggested as a potential source of branched GDGTs, is also known to increase with decreasing pH, providing further support for this suggestion. Analysis of branched GDGTs in soils along an altitude transect on Mount Gongga in China showed that among the many varying environmental factors, MAT and soil pH explain most of the variation in the distribution of branched GDGTs. Despite the relatively large scatter, the temperature lapse rate of MBT-CBT-based MAT estimates resembles the lapse rate caused by adiabatic cooling of air with increasing altitude. Based on this (indirect) relation between branched GDGTs and altitude, the MBT-CBT proxy was suggested as a proxy for paleoelevation, in addition to soil n-alkane dD values. To assess their suitability as proxies for paleoelevation, the relation of altitude of both branched GDGTs and the dD of n-alkanes in soils along the slopes of Mt. Gongga and Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) was studied. The data show that both proxies can be subject to relatively large uncertainties, but that a combination of both proxies likely results in a more reliable paleoelevation reconstruction. Although the MBT-CBT proxy was found to correlate best with annual MAT, several studies suggest a potential seasonal bias in MBT-CBT-derived air temperature estimates, for example caused by a season of optimum growth of the bacteria that produce branched GDGTs. Therefore, the distributions and abundance of CL and IPL-derived branched GDGTs in mid-latitude soils from eight different locations were monitored over an annual cycle. MBT-CBT-reconstructed temperatures remained constant throughout the year and also branched GDGT abundances (both CL and IPL-derived) showed no bias towards a specific season. These results indicate that seasonality does not influence MBT-CBT-derived temperature estimates, and that the turnover time of the branched GDGT pool in soils is in the order of one year or more. Branched GDGTs in Svalbard soils and nearby fjord sediment were analyzed to verify if the MBT-CBT proxy is applicable in high latitude environments, characterized by a low MAT, and to what extent branched GDGT distributions in marine sediments reflect those on land. Although branched GDGT concentrations in the soils were relatively low due to the cold climate and little soil development, MBT-CBT based MAT estimates were similar to the measured MAT (ca. - 4 °C and - 6 °C, respectively). The distribution of branched GDGTs in the fjord sediments was strikingly different from that in the soils, and was dominated by branched GDGTs with one cyclopentane moiety. This resulted in unrealistic MAT estimates, and suggests that at least part of the branched GDGTs in coastal marine environments receiving little soil organic matter may be predominantly produced in situ. The MBT-CBT proxy should therefore only be used for marine coastal sediments at sites receiving a substantial input of soil organic matter relative to the amount of marine organic matter, i. e. close to a river mouth. More information on the possible origin of the branched GDGTs was gained by the analysis of IPL-branched GDGTs. Branched GDGTs with a glucose, glycuronic acid, hexose-glycuronic acid, phospho-hexose, or hexose-phosphoglycerol head group were identified in a Swedish peat, based on mass spectrometry. Changes in distribution of these IPL-branched GDGTs with depth in the Swedish peat bog were monitored using a newly developed Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) method. The response, as a measure for concentration, of all monitored IPLs increased below the water table, suggesting that they are primarily produced in this part of the peat. This is supported by the increase of absolute concentrations of CL and IPL-derived branched GDGTs below the water table. The trends of the individual IPLs with depth are different, but phospholipids show a larger increase in response with depth compared to glycolipids. The relatively large abundance of the less stable phospholipids implies that branched GDGTs are presumably produced by anaerobic bacteria in the anoxic part of the peat. Comparison of the IPL trends with 16 S rRNA data hints toward Acidobacteria as possible <b>producers</b> of the <b>branched</b> GDGTs. Further application of the SRM method on two different soil types showed that most IPL-branched GDGTs were also present in these soils, albeit in different distributions. The soil set on which the MBT-CBT proxy was initially calibrated, was extended to 278 globally distributed surface soils to recalibrate the proxy. As only 26 % of these surface soils contained all nine different branched GDGTs, soils containing the seven most common branched GDGTs were selected for calibration purposes. Regression analysis resulted in new transfer functions for pH and MAT, based on the CBT index and adjusted MBT index (MBT’) : pH= 7. 90 – 1. 97 ×CBT (r 2 = 0. 70, RMSE= 0. 8) and MAT = 0. 81 – 5. 67 ×CBT + 31. 0 ×MBT’ (r 2 = 0. 59, RMSE= 5. 0 °C, n= 176). The correlation coefficient of the new function is substantially lower than that of the original equation. Other statistically derived functions only marginally improved the correlation coefficient, while these functions could not be explained straightforwardly by physiological mechanisms. Local factors or seasonality cannot fully explain the reSummarymaining scatter in the calibration, but reconstructed MATs for soils from arid regions tend to substantially underestimate the actual MAT, which indicates that absolute branched GDGT-derived MAT records should be interpreted with caution. Application of the new transfer functions on previously published MBT-CBT derived paleotemperature records shows that trends remain similar, but that absolute temperature estimates and the amplitude of temperature changes are lower for most records, although in agreement with independent proxy data. Application of the MBT-CBT proxy on a loess-paleosol sequence in China resulted in a paleotemperature record covering the last 34 kyr. The record shows that air temperatures varied in phase with northern hemisphere summer insolation, and that the onset of deglacial atmospheric warming started around 19 kyr BP, parallel in timing with other continental records. Comparison of the branched GDGT-based MAT record with oxygen isotope records of stalagmites from Chinese caves, representing East Asian summer monsoon precipitation, shows that the intensification of the summer monsoon lagged that of deglacial atmospheric warming. The results indicate that the onset of deglacial atmospheric warming and the intensification of the summer monsoon may have been controlled by different factors. In conclusion, the data presented in this thesis show that temperature and soil pH are indeed the main controls the distribution of branched GDGTs in soils, and that the MBT and CBT indices are suitable as paleothermometer and proxy for past soil pH in terrestrial settings as well as coastal marine sites receiving a substantial input of soil organic matter. However, care must be taken in interpreting absolute MAT values generated with this proxy...|$|R
