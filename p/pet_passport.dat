5000|$|The major {{delay in}} obtaining a <b>pet</b> <b>passport</b> {{is the time}} {{requirement}} for the rabies vaccination. The implications are: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pet</b> <b>Passport</b> {{alone can}} be used to enter some {{countries}} if it records all relevant information (e.g. the UK), but it will not suffice to enter many countries. For instance Guatemala, in common with almost every country operating such a scheme, demands that all imported pets have a rabies vaccination, but will not accept the <b>Pet</b> <b>Passport</b> as proof of said vaccination. They require the proof of the rabies vaccination in the animal's records.|$|E
50|$|Currently the EU <b>pet</b> <b>passport</b> scheme only covers cats, {{dogs and}} ferrets {{that have been}} vaccinated against rabies and fitted with {{electronic}} microchips. As of yet, there is no EU wide legislation to cover transportation of other pets, with different member states applying various rules.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, he {{took part}} in a UK Government inquiry that gave {{cautious}} approval to xenotransplantation (the use of animal-to-human transplants), and in 1998, {{was a member of the}} committee that recommended <b>pet</b> <b>passports.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{introducing}} rabies from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an HM Customs and Excise pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as <b>Pet</b> <b>Passports,</b> where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate vaccinations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pet</b> <b>passport</b> itself {{comes in}} {{multiple}} forms, sometimes a pink A4 sheet, sometimes a small blue booklet. It contains the microchip or tattoo {{number of the}} animal, the certification that it has had a rabies vaccination, {{and needs to be}} signed by an officially approved veterinary surgeon.|$|E
50|$|The Pet Travel Scheme ("PETS") is {{a system}} which allows animals to travel easily between member {{countries}} without undergoing quarantine. A <b>Pet</b> <b>Passport</b> is a document that officially records information related to a specific animal, {{as part of that}} procedure. The effect is to drastically speed up and simplify travel with and transport of animals between member countries, compared to previous procedures, if the regulations are followed.|$|E
50|$|Torums Scarf Michael {{was entered}} into the 2000 Crufts dog show at the Birmingham NEC in the UK, as one of over 20,000 dogs competing. He was named Best in Show, while the English Cocker Spaniel Sh Ch. Wiljana Waterfall won reserve place. Mick and his owner were {{presented}} with the Crufts Best in Show trophy by Prince Michael of Kent and the Chairman of the Kennel Club, Peter James. It was the final Crufts competition prior to the relaxation of UK border controls, which would allow animals to more easily cross borders with the British Government's <b>Pet</b> <b>passport</b> scheme.|$|E
5000|$|European Union — As of July 2004, dogs, cats, and ferrets {{can travel}} freely within the European Union under the <b>pet</b> <b>{{passport}}</b> scheme. To cross a border within the EU, ferrets require at minimum an EU PETS passport and an identification microchip (though some countries will accept a tattoo instead). Vaccinations are required; most countries require a rabies vaccine, and some require a distemper vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas 24 to 48 hours before entry. Ferrets occasionally {{need to be}} quarantined before entering the country. PETS travel information is available from any EU veterinarian or on government websites.|$|E
5000|$|A {{correctly}} prepared cat or dog may {{be imported}} without quarantine into the United Kingdom {{from the following}} countries under the <b>Pet</b> <b>passport</b> scheme, but only by an authorised transport company:Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France*, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Vatican, Antigua and Barbuda, Ascension Island, Australia, Barbados, Bahrain, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Falkland Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia*, Guadeloupe, Jamaica*, Japan, Réunion*, Malta, Martinique*, Mauritius, Mayotte*, Montserrat, New Caledonia*, New Zealand, St. Helena, St. Kitts & Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, United States, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeth won the {{qualifying}} {{heat of the}} Champion Stakes at West of England Ladies Kennel Society show in April 2011 under judge Albert Wight. This in turn qualified the dog for the 2011 Eukanuba Champion Stakes near Kenilworth {{along with}} 25 dogs from other shows around the country. The 25 were broken up into five randomly assigned groups of five to be judged against the breed standards for each breed, with the winner from each of those group going forward to the final. She qualified for the final along with the Bichon Frise Ch. Pamplona Bring Me Sunshine, the Bearded Collie Ch. Senglas Indiana Jones, West Highland White Terrier Ch. Lamsmore Fitzwritin and the Pointer Sh Ch. Kiswahili Martin at Kanix. Elizabeth was once more victorious and after her owner confirmed the dog had a <b>pet</b> <b>passport,</b> qualified for the Eukanuba World Challenge in Orlando, Florida in December 2011. Elizabeth first qualified along with eleven other dogs for the final, and finished overall in third place.|$|E
50|$|The first LaPerm in the UK was Champion Uluru BC Omaste Po of Quincunx, a lilac tortie {{and white}} Longhair who was bred in the United States by A. D. Lawrence and Maureen Neidhardt. She was {{imported}} by Anthony Nichols (Quincunx) using a PETS <b>pet</b> <b>passport</b> in May 2002 after a stop-over with LaPerm breeder Corine Judkins in the Netherlands. She arrived pregnant and {{gave birth to}} a litter of five kittens shortly after who were used as the foundation stock for the UK breeding program. A number of other imports followed, including cats from Europe, New Zealand and the USA. Judy Whiteford (Aswani) and Kate Munslow (Canonna) have been involved from that first litter and have both imported new cats themselves and Corine Judkins (Crearwy) moved to Wales bringing her cats with her including the stud who sired the first UK litter. Other key breeding lines found in UK pedigrees include those of Edwina Sipos (Cycada), Penni Cragg (Wakanda), June Gillies (Ballego), Kate Ekanger (Cloudborn), Sue Amor (Amorcatz) and Sue Pyrke (Bane). The breeding program has been characterized by efforts to breed down from outcrosses for generational advancement by combining outcross lines, old lines and import lines. The UK now has an active LaPerm breeding program and is the home of the LaPerm Cat Club. The breed has made solid progress within the GCCF and is often seen at British cat shows. In 2004 the breed gained Preliminary Recognition and the LaPerm Cat Club was formed. In June 2008 the LaPerm gained Provisional Recognition in the GCCF and the first cat to gain an Intermediate Certificate was Aswani Miranna Keys. In June 2012 the LaPerm gained full championship recognition with the GCCF and the first certificate winner was also Aswani Miranna Keys. The first LaPerm to become a GCCF champion was a female, Ballego Happy-Gladys, who went on to also become the first Grand Champion, and the first LaPerm to become a GCCF premier was Pr Wakanda Harriet Potter. The first male champion was Ch Quincunx Umberto Ecurl. The first LaPerm with an Imperial title was also Aswani Miranna Keys, the title being gained at the world's first LaPerm breed show, which was held by the LaPerm Cat Club. The first male LaPerm with an imperial title was Imperial Grand Premier Cloudborn Barb Dwyer, bred by Kate Ekanger and owned by Nicola and Roy Lovell.|$|E
