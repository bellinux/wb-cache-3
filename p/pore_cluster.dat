40|$|Aside from porosity, {{the degree}} of pore {{connectivity}} and tortuosity are important pore structure characteristics of cement-based materials to understand better the effect of microstructure on transport processes that influence the durability of these materials. Synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography is employed {{to provide information about}} the three-dimensional (3 D) pore structure at submicron resolution (0. 5 μm/voxel) using the SPring- 8 facility in Hyogo, Japan. This paper presents a method to characterize the pore space of hardened cement pastes taken from different specimens of various ages (2, 7, and 28 days) of curing. By defining the pore threshold value {{on the basis of the}} transition point in the porosity-threshold dependency curve, the pores were distinguished from the solid matrix in the microtomographic images. Further, <b>pore</b> <b>cluster</b> multiple labeling was performed to gain information on the pore connectivity and the associated effective porosity. 3 D random walk simulation in the largest percolating <b>pore</b> <b>cluster</b> was then conducted to evaluate the diffusion tortuosity.

Anodic galvanostatic polarization is conducted in a microcapillary cell to limit the available current and to restrict the analysis area for subsequent microscopic evaluation. An ability to drive a single pit initiation event is demonstrated using this approach. Subsequent microscopy shows that <b>pore</b> <b>cluster</b> formation on the off-(111) axis facets that are emergent from the grain boundaries is responsible for pit initiation. Early stage, fully formed pits possess oxide membranes that contain pore clusters. Pores evolve from voids that form at the oxide-Al interface, establishing a link between these interfacial voids and pit initiation.

40|$|We {{conducted}} an in-situ X-ray micro-computed tomography heating experiment at the Advanced Photon Source (USA) to dehydrate an unconfined 2. 3 mm diameter cylinder of Volterra Gypsum. We used a purpose-built X-ray transparent furnace {{to heat the}} sample to 388 K {{for a total of}} 310 min to acquire a three-dimensional time-series tomography dataset comprising nine time steps. The voxel size of 2. 2 μm 3 proved sufficient to pinpoint reaction initiation and the organization of drainage architecture in space and time. We observed that dehydration commences across a narrow front, which propagates from the margins to the centre of the sample in more than four hours. The advance of this front can be fitted with a square-root function, implying that the initiation of the reaction in the sample can be described as a diffusion process. Novel parallelized computer codes allow quantifying the geometry of the porosity and the drainage architecture from the very large tomographic datasets (20483 voxels) in unprecedented detail. We determined position, volume, shape and orientation of each resolvable pore and tracked these properties over the duration of the experiment. We found that the pore-size distribution follows a power law. Pores tend to be anisotropic but rarely crack-shaped and have a preferred orientation, likely controlled by a pre-existing fabric in the sample. With on-going dehydration, pores coalesce into a single interconnected <b>pore</b> <b>cluster</b> that is connected {{to the surface of the}} sample cylinder and provides an effective drainage pathway. Our observations can be summarized in a model in which gypsum is stabilized by thermal expansion stresses and locally increased pore fluid pressures until the dehydration front approaches to within about 100 μm. Then, the internal stresses are released and dehydration happens efficiently, resulting in new pore space. Pressure release, the production of pores and the advance of the front are coupled in a feedback loop...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{diffusion}} pathways of porous sandstone {{were examined}} by a three-dimensional (3 -D) imaging technique based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) using the SPring- 8 (Super Photon ring- 8 GeV, Hyogo, Japan) synchrotron radiation facility. The analysis was undertaken to develop {{better understanding of}} the diffusion pathways in natural rock as a key factor in clarifying the detailed mechanism of the diffusion of radionuclides and water molecules through the pore spaces of natural barriers in underground nuclear waste disposal facilities. A cylindrical sample (diameter 4 mm, length 6 mm) of sandstone (porosity 0. 14) was imaged to obtain a 3 -D image set of 4503 voxels= 2. 623 mm 3. Through cluster-labeling analysis of the 3 -D image set, it was revealed that 89 % of the pore space forms a single large pore-cluster responsible for macroscopic diffusive transport, while only 11 % of the pore space is made up of isolated pores that are not involved in long-range diffusive transport. Computer simulations of the 3 -D diffusion of non-sorbing random walkers in the largest <b>pore</b> <b>cluster</b> were performed to calculate the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore, tortuosity (diffusion coefficient in free space divided by that in porous rock). The results showed that (i) the simulated surface-to-volume ratio is about 60 % of the results obtained by conventional pulsed-field-gradient proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) laboratory experiments and (ii) the simulated tortuosity is five to seven times larger than the results of laboratory diffusion experiments using non-sorbing I− and Br−. These discrepancies are probably attributed to the intrinsic sample heterogeneity and limited spatial resolution of the CT system. The permeability was also estimated based on the NMR diffusometry theory using the results of the random walk simulations via the Kozeny–Carman equation. The estimated permeability involved an error of about 20 % compared with the permeability measured by the conventional method, suggesting that the diffusometry-based NMR well logging with gradient coils is applicable to the in-situ permeability measurement of strata. The present study demonstrated that X-ray CT using synchrotron radiation is a powerful tool for obtaining 3 -D pore structure images without the beam-hardening artifacts inevitable in conventional CT using X-ray tubes...|$|E

Nuclear diameter and perimeter were measured on semithin sections, and nuclear surface area and volume were calculated from these data. The proportion of inner nuclear membrane in apposition to condensed chromatin was measured on thin sections. The values of nuclear pore numerical density (number/μm 2) were as follows (mean ± S.

The total number of nuclear pores per nucleus varied from 18, 451 ± 2, 236 (Purkinje cells) to 621 ± 394 (granule cells) among neurons, and from 1, 782 ± 162 (protoplasmic astrocytes), to 402 ± 67 (oligodendrocytes) among glial cells. The number of nuclear pores per unit nuclear volume (number/μm 3), a parameter related to nucleocytoplasmic transport capacity, varied from 15 ± 2 in Purkinje cells to 6 ± 4 in granule cells.

40|$|Hierarchical {{materials}} offer {{great promise}} for high-performance sensors and catalysis carriers. Well-defined hierarchically porous materials are promising candidates {{for a wide}} range of applications relating to biosensors, separations, drug delivery, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), etc. Research on synthetic methodologies is expanding. However, fabrication of hierarchical porous structures with tunable pore dimension and shape, controllable pore distribution and interconnectivity is still a challenging task in materials science. One of the main tasks of this work is to establish a facile and reliable approach of making well-defined hierarchically porous materials. Then, based on those multimodal porous structures, different functions and applications can be realized. This work utilizes a direct hard templating method to obtain hierarchical porous structures with a well-defined bimodal distribution of the pores based on hierarchical templates. The hierarchical templates were prepared by synthetically joining appropriately functionalized commercially available polystyrene (PS) latex spheres together. Two different coupling reactions were used to form the hierarchical templates: carbodiimide-assisted coupling of COOH groups with NH 2 groups and base-assisted coupling of epoxy groups with NH 2 groups. Two different morphologies of templates, 2 ̆ 2 raspberry-like 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 strawberry-like 2 ̆ 2 were made. The template can be defined by the sizes of both the 2 ̆ 2 core 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 satellite 2 ̆ 2 spheres, and altering the coverage of 2 ̆ 2 satellites 2 ̆ 2 on the 2 ̆ 2 core 2 ̆ 2. The main advantage of this strategy is the tailorability of the size and shape of the hierarchical templates, which allows an easy and independent adjustment to the multiporosity of the material structure design. Also, the monodispersed hierarchical templates are constructed of only one material, can be isolated, and can be assembled using standard template packing procedures that have been used for unimodal porous material fabrication described in published literature. Based on the predefined monodispersed hierarchical templates, multimodal porous silica, bimodal porous gold film and porous capsules were fabricated in this work as representative 3 D, 2 D, and 0 D hierarchical porous structures, respectively. Because the template was predefined as one whole body, the connectivity between the big pores and small pores is guaranteed. The way the templates are packed together on a surface also ensures connections between each 2 ̆ 2 template-shaped <b>pore</b> <b>cluster</b> 2 ̆ 2. The uniform interconnectivity and ordered arrangement among the pores allows the different modals of pores to communicate with each other. The different hierarchical porous materials made in this work were characterized with SEM, TEM, AFM, XPS, STEM, gas adsorption, and mercury intrusion porosity. The results indicate that the multimodal porous materials can be successfully fabricated using predefined hierarchical templates. The different arrangement (3 D, 2 D, 0 D) of those templates and the independent tailorability of the pore sizes provide more flexibility and control on the hierarchical porous material fabrication. The main parts of this work are as follows: (1) Fabrication and characterization of morphology controllable hierarchical templates (2) Fabrication and characterization of various multimodal porous structures of different materials based on the obtained templates (3) Study of the application of hierarchical porous gold electrode obtained and (4) The comparison between conventional porous structures and hierarchical porous structures...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{rapid growth}} has {{been seen in the}} use of {{aluminium}} powder metallurgy (PM), largely driven by the automotive industry. However, there are limitations on the use of aluminium PM components, which are due, in part, to their mechanical properties. The fatigue properties are particularly limiting, as they are insufficient for use in many loadbearing applications. Although the mechanisms and fracture mechanics of fatigue in aluminium alloys have been well documented for wrought and cast material, it was not clear whether this research could be directly applied to sintered materials because of their unique microstructural features. Therefore, the primary objective of this research was to investigate and characterise the fatigue behaviour of a sintered 2 xxx series aluminium alloy. Specimens were prepared from a pre-mixed, elemental powder, AMB- 2712 (Al- 3. 8 Cu- 1 Mg- 0. 7 Si- 0. 1 Sn + 1. 5 % Acrawax). The powder was compacted uniaxially in a floating die, with a compaction pressure of 200 MPa. Green parts were then sintered in a dry, high purity nitrogen atmosphere. The standard sintering parameters were 30 minutes at 600 °C. Fatigue testing was carried out in 3 -point bending, under constant cyclic loading conditions and with a stress ratio, R, of 0. 1. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the tensile surface and the fracture surface of fatigued specimens. Sintered aluminium alloy AMB- 2712 (compacted at 200 MPa and sintered for 30 mins at 600 °C) has a 0. 2 % yield strength of 138 MPa and 2 % ductility. The density is 2. 67 g/cm 3, corresponding to a porosity of 4. 4 %, and the average grain size is 93 ± 7 μm. The fatigue endurance strength is ~ 145 MPa (R= 0. 1). Fatigue crack initiation occurs at a pore or <b>pore</b> <b>cluster,</b> located either at or slightly below the tensile surface. SEM analysis showed that the fatigue fracture surface can be divided into three regions, in terms of the dominant crack propagation mechanism in each. Region 1 contains the fatigue initiation site and initial, transgranular crack propagation, whilst propagation in Region 2 is primarily intergranular. The transition from transgranular to intergranular propagation occurs when the size of the plastic zone preceding the crack tip is approximately three times the grain size. At this point, Al 2 Cu particles in the grain boundaries ahead of the crack tip are fractured, creating an easier path for propagation. Region 3 is the fast fracture region, where crack propagation is by ductile overload. A number of distinctive features were observed on the fatigue fracture surfaces, including striations, microvoid coalescence dimples and a wide variety of step-like features. The morphology of the features observed within a transgranularly grain are thought to be determined by the level of mismatch between the plane of crack propagation and the crystallographic orientation of the grain in which they form. Porosity has significant deleterious effects on the fatigue properties of sintered AMB- 2712, primarily due to its role in fatigue initiation. Relationships between the fatigue-initiating pore size and the fatigue life are well described by classical fracture mechanics. The empirical Paris Law constants m and C are 4. 48 and 10 - 10. 7 respectively. These values are in good agreement with those reported for aluminium castings, suggesting that fatigue behaviour of sintered AMB- 2712 is analogous to that of cast Al alloys. Fatigue life was observed to decrease exponentially with decreasing density – i. e. as porosity increases. The experimentally derived relationship between density and fatigue life may have potential use in predicting the approximate fatigue lives of sintered AMB- 2712 components prior to installation. Oxide films, located in the grain boundaries of intergranularly cracked regions, were observed on the fatigue fracture surfaces of sintered aluminium specimens. It is suggested that the films are artefacts of fatigue testing, which occur due to local fretting of mating fracture surfaces during cyclic loading...|$|E

Based on this correspondence, an analytical expression for statistics of maximal stresses in a porous material with arbitrary microstructure is constructed in terms of porosity and statistics of minimal distances between the nearest neighbors.

Apparent inconsistencies between previously published light and electron microscopy studies of nuclear lamin staining were resolved.

Examination at higher, EM resolution reveals that this apparent lamin B network does not correspond to an actual network of widely spaced, discrete bundles of lamin filaments.

Two samples (WIC and HAD) were investigated, both mid-Jurassic organic-rich Posidonia shales from Hils area, central Germany of different maturity (WIC R 0 0. 53  % and HAD R 0 1. 45  %). The method for image collection was focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For image and data analysis Avizo and GeoDict was used. Porosity was calculated from segmented 3 -D FIB based images and permeability was simulated by a Navier Stokes–Brinkman solver in the segmented images. Results show that the quantity and distribution of <b>pore</b> <b>clusters</b> and <b>pores</b> (≥[*]  40  nm) are similar. The largest pores are located within carbonates and clay minerals, whereas the smallest pores are within the matured organic matter. Orientation of the pores calculated as pore paths showed minor directional differences between the samples. Both samples have no continuous connectivity of <b>pore</b> <b>clusters</b> along the axes in the x, y, and z direction on the scale of 10 to 20 of micrometer, but do show connectivity on the micrometer scale. The volume of organic matter in the studied volume is representative of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the samples. Organic matter does show axis connectivity in the x, y, and z directions. With increasing maturity the porosity in organic matter increases from close to 0 to more than 5  %. These pores are small and in the large organic particles have little connection to the mineral matrix. Continuous pore size distributions are compared with mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) data. Differences between both methods are caused by resolution limits of the FIB-SEM and by the development of small pores during the maturation of the organic matter. Calculations show no permeability when only considering visible pores due to the lack of axis connectivity. Adding the organic matter with a background permeability of 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 21  m 2 to the calculations, the total permeability increased by up to 1 order of magnitude for the low mature and decreases slightly for the overmature sample from the gas window. Anisotropy of permeability was observed. Permeability coefficients increase by 1 order of magnitude if simulations are performed parallel to the bedding. Our results compare well with experimental data from the literature suggesting that upscaling may be possible in the future as soon as maturity dependent organic matter permeability coefficients can be determined...|$|R
40|$|The melting {{transition}} of small clusters composed of 13 particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones 6 - 12 potential {{has been investigated}} by means of extensive Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that whereas the cluster evaporates in vacuum, in a confined <b>pore</b> the <b>cluster</b> undergoes a smooth melting transition from an icosahedral microcrystal to an inhomogeneous liquid phase, with a specific heat peak centered at 39 K.

40|$|Temperature-sensitive nucleoporin nup 49 - 316 mutant cells {{accumulate}} poly(A) + RNA {{inside the}} nucleus when shifted to restrictive temperature. We performed a synthetic lethal screen with this mutant allele to identify further {{components of the}} mRNA export machinery. A synthetic lethal mutant slv 21 was isolated, which exhibited a ts phenotype and showed nuclear accumulation of poly(A) + RNA at 37 degrees C. The wild-type gene complementing slv 21 was cloned and sequenced. It encodes a novel protein Nup 133 p which {{is located at the}} nuclear pore complex. NUP 133 is not an essential gene, but cells in which NUP 133 is disrupted grow slowly at permissive temperatures and stop growing at 37 degrees C. Concomitant with the growth inhibition, nup 133 - cells accumulate poly(A) + RNA inside the nucleus whereas nuclear import of a karyophilic reporter protein is not altered. Strikingly, nup 133 - cells display extensive <b>clustering</b> of nuclear <b>pore</b> complexes at a few sites on the nuclear envelope. However, the nuclear <b>pore</b> <b>clustering</b> phenotype and intranuclear accumulation of poly(A) + RNA are not obligatorily linked, since an amino-terminally truncated Nup 133 p allows normal poly(A) + RNA export, but does not complement the clustering phenotype of nup 133 - cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStaphylococcal γ-hemolysin (Hlg) is a pore-forming toxin {{consisting}} of two separate components, LukF (34 kDa) and Hlg 2 (32 kDa). Here we show that Hlg pores aggregate and form clusters on human erythrocyte membranes in association with increasing hemolytic activity. Quantitative analysis using transmission electron microscopy and image processing revealed that the formation of single <b>pores</b> and <b>clusters</b> {{is related to the}} release of potassium ions and of hemoglobin from erythrocytes, respectively. This is the first study to suggest a novel and unique property which can facilitate hemolysis by the cluster formation of Hlg pores...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{perform a}} study of {{three-dimensional}} micro- and nanostructure of porous biocompatible scaffolds and quantitative analysis of nanoscale porosity parameters. Materials and methods. Three-dimensional porous scaffolds made from spidroin rS 1 / 9 (recombinant analog of spider dragline protein) were produced by salt leaching technique. Dimensions of macropores in produced three-imensional scaffolds were in range from  200 to 400 microns. The study of three-dimensional structure of scaffolds {{was carried out by}} scanning probe nanotomography technique with the use of experimental setup combining ultramicrotome and scanning probe microscope. Results. Three-dimensional nanotomographical reconstruction of scaffold macropore wall structure is obtained. The formation of three-dimensional network of interconnected pores and channels with characteristic dimensions in range from 20 to 700 nm in the volume of macropore walls of studied scaffolds is observed. Mean pore diameter is 150 nm. Volume porosity of macropore walls is 22 % while volume fraction of pores interconnected in large <b>pore</b> <b>clusters</b> is about 20 % of all pore volume. Conclusion. Obtained as a result of the study quantitative characteristics of porous micro- and nanostructure of scaffolds show signifi cant degree of nanoscale porosity and percolation of macropore walls what correlates with reported high effi ciency of tissue regeneration on such scaffolds implanted in vivo. Use of scanning probe nanotomography technique for analysis of characteristics and topology of micro- and nanopore systems enables to improve effi ciency of development of novel biocompatible and biodegradable materials with predicted morphological, physical, chemical and biological characteristics. </p...|$|R
40|$|The 3 D {{architecture}} of intermetallics and porosity in two multicomponent cast Al– 7 (0. 7) Si– 4 Cu– 3 Ni–Mg alloys is characterized using conventional microscopy and X-ray microtomography. The two alloys {{are found to}} contain intermetallic phases such as Al 3 Ni, Al 3 (NiCu) 2, Al 9 FeNi, and Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6 that have complex networked morphology in 3 D. The results also show that HIPping does not significantly affect the volume fraction, size, and shape distribution of the intermetallic phases in both alloys. A novel technique similar to serial sectioning that circumvents quantification difficulties associated with interconnected particles is used to quantify the intermetallics. The largest particle size distribution is then correlated to fatigue performance using extreme value analysis to predict the maximum particle size {{in a sample of}} S-N fatigue specimens and subsequently, the lower bound fatigue life. The predictions are found to correlate well with fatigue data. The effect of HIPping on porosity characteristics is also characterized. Large <b>pore</b> <b>clusters</b> with complex morphology are observed in the unHIPped versions of both alloys, but more significant in the low Si (Al– 0. 7 Si– 4 Cu– 3 Ni–Mg) alloy. However, these are significantly reduced after HIPping. The differences between 2 D and 3 D pore morphology and size distribution is discussed in terms of the appropriate pore size parameter for fatigue life prediction...|$|R
