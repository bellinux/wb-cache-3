25|$|The oldest playing {{style is}} the {{stand-up}} style. In this style, goaltenders are {{to stop the}} puck from a standing position, not going down. The goalies may bend over to stop the puck with their upper body or may kick the puck. Such saves made by kicking are known as kick saves or skate saves. They may also simply use their stick to stop it, known as a stick save. This was the style seen in the early NHL and was most commonly used up until the early 60s. One of the more notable goalies who was last seen using stand up was Bill Ranford, {{but most of the}} goalies from earlier decades such as Jacques Plante were considered <b>pure</b> <b>stand</b> up goalies.|$|E
25|$|During the night, nectar is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the cup of the flower. This is commonly associated with flowers specialising in pollination by bats. Common brown lemurs Eulemur fulvus were seen fouraging from Brexia flowers in the early morning. These primates took the inflorescences with their hands and bent these to lick the nectar from the flower cups. This was repeated in other nearby specimens of Brexia immediately after. Flowers were not damaged, {{and it is likely}} the lemurs assisted the pollination. B. madagascariensis grows in coastal vegetations on a range of soil types such as coral, sand, loam or coarse rocky ground, in places like the edges of saline water swamp forest, mangrove swamps, evergreen shrubland and other forest types near the sea. In Tanzania it has been found in an almost <b>pure</b> <b>stand</b> of Maesopsis eminii. The fruit can float in sea water for many months and the numerous dark seeds within remain viable.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cultivar}} mixture cropping on yield, biomass, and water use efficiency (WUE) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were investigated under non-irrigation (W 0, no irrigation during growth stage), one time irrigation (W 1, irrigation applied at stem elongation) and two times irrigation (W 2, irrigation applied at stem elongation and anthesis) conditions. Nearly 90 % of cultivar mixture cropping treatments experienced {{an increase in}} grain yield {{as compared with the}} mean of the <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> under W 0, those for W 1 and W 2 were 80 % and 85 %, respectively. Over 75 % of cultivar mixture cropping treatments got greater biomass than the mean of the <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> under the three irrigation conditions.

40|$|Abstract- A {{factorial}} greenhouse {{experiment was}} conducted to examine the overall impact of slug herbivory, plant density and neighbour iden-tity on the yield and allocation pattern of the short-lived grass Pea cmnua. The effects of slug herbivory were compared in experimental plants at two densities in two types of culture: pure and mixed with Arabidopsi. ~ thalianu. All the plant parts of P annua showed significantly greater bio-mass in mixed than in <b>pure</b> <b>stands,</b> and in low compared to high density stands. Slug herbivory consistently reduced the biomass of reproductive organs {{and the percentage of}} total biomass allocated to reproduction, whereas density had no effect on allocation. In mixed stands, the proportion of biomass allocated to reproductive organs and leaves was greater and lesser, respectively, than in <b>pure</b> <b>stands.</b> There were significant interactions between herbivory and culture for root biomass and for the percentage of biomass allocated to root and shoots, and between herbivory, culture and density for shoot, stem, leaf and total biomass. Slug herbivory reduced root biomass in <b>pure</b> <b>stands,</b> whereas it did the opposite in mixed stands. The root:shoot ratio did not vary between mixed and <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> in the absence of slugs, while when slugs were present <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> had lower root/shoot ratio than mixed stands. Except for reproductive structures, all the plant parts showed greater biomass in grazed than in ungrazed low density mixed stands, whereas the general trend in high and low density <b>pure</b> <b>stands,</b> and in high density mixed stands was that herbivory decreased biomass.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is described for automatic discrimination between grasses and broad-leaved weeds, {{based on their}} heights. An ultrasonic sensor was mounted {{on the front of}} a tractor, pointing vertically down in the inter-row area, with a control system georeferencing and registering the echoes reflected by the ground or by the various leaf layers. Static measurements were taken at locations with different densities of grasses (Sorghum halepense) and broad-leaved weeds (Xanthium strumarium and Datura spp.). The sensor readings permitted the discrimination of <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> of grasses (up to 81 % success) and <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> of broad-leaved weeds (up to 99 % success). Moreover, canonical discriminant analysis revealed that the ultrasonic data could separate three groups of assemblages: <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> of broad-leaved weeds (lower height), <b>pure</b> <b>stands</b> of grasses (higher height) and mixed stands of broad-leaved and grass weeds (medium height). Dynamic measurements confirmed the potential of this system to detect weed infestations.

50|$|Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) {{and annual}} bluegrasses (Poa annua) are {{the makeup of}} most putting greens, {{as well as the}} {{preferred}} hosts of this pathogen. Specifically, Toronto (C-15), Seaside, and Nemisilla are the cultivars of creeping bentgrass most commonly affected. The bacteria enter the plant host and interfere with water and nutrient flow, causing the plant to look drought stressed and to take on a blueish-purple color. Additionally, symptoms of bacterial wilt of turf grass include yellow leaf spots, tan or brown spots, water soaked lesions, elongated yellow leaves and shriveling of aforementioned blue or dark green leaves.Since putting greens are not a <b>pure</b> <b>stand</b> of turf, some grass blades may be resistant to the bacterium and thus remain unharmed while the surrounding turf dies, rendering the putting surface inconsistent and unsightly, especially at high-end golf courses.|$|E
