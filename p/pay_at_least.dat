5|$|The 1220 carucage, {{which was}} imposed on both laymen and clergy, was {{collected}} {{by a special}} commission, and was paid not into the Exchequer, but to the Templar Order church in London, the New Temple. The Templars through their international organization functioned as bankers in and between countries. The three men appointed to the commission—William de Halliwell, a friar, William FitzBenedict, a London resident, and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth, an Exchequer clerk—were responsible for accounting for the money received, which amounted to £3,000. The time frame of the 1220 carucage collection was quite short; the orders for the assessments to be made were issued in August, but required the tax to be collected by Michaelmas in late September. The 1220 tax attempted to allow for variation in land values, exempting barren land from taxation. The system for the 1220 assessments was simpler than the 1217 levy, as plough-teams were counted to determine the land size rather than requiring oaths from taxpayers. This tax gathered around £5,500. There was some difficulty in its collection however, as some counties did not pay, {{and a number of}} barons refused to <b>pay,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> at first. The 1220 carucage was levied to pay for the defence of Henry's lands in Poitou, southern France.|$|E

25|$|As of 2017, the museum's {{endowment}} as {{administered by}} the museum's new investment officer Lauren Meserve is $3.1 billion USD which provides much of the income for operations while admissions account for only 13 percent of revenue as of fiscal 2016. The 2009–10 operating budget was $221 million. Although the museum recommends an admission price of $25, visitors can pay what they wish to enter.

[...] While the trust was used to support ministries of the church, it enmeshed the town counsel and the church in many legal entanglements.

Under "downward" commitment firms can commit only to <b>paying</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> their advertised wage. We show that wage posting is always an equilibrium, although in special cases other equilibria can exist. Surprisingly, the wage posting equilibrium in our economy {{is identical to the}} equilibrium when firms can commit to paying exactly their posted wage. When firms cannot even commit to <b>paying</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> their advertised wage, equilibrium exhibits job auctions with wage dispersion which generally are not constrained efficient. directed search, wage posting, job auctions, commitment...|$|R

[...] On April 14, 1992, Accolade filed for a stay on the injunction pending appeal in the district court, but when the court did not rule by April 21, Accolade appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A stay was granted on the mandate to recall all of Accolade's Genesis games, but the injunction preventing further reverse engineering and development of Genesis software was maintained until August 28, when the Ninth Circuit ordered it dissolved pending the appeal review.|$|E

Alternatively, a company meets the standard if it offers to <b>pay</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 33% of the premium cost of an individual health plan. For employers with 50 or more FTEs, both standards must be met, or 75% of full-time workers must be enrolled in the firm's health plan.

2500|$|Upon leaving Mitchell-Lama, {{the owners}} of rental {{buildings}} built since 1974 can raise rents without restriction.

[...] Tenants who do not qualify for enhanced vouchers, including all tenants in post-1973 buildings that were not federally subsidized, must pay the rent set by the landlords. That the buildings {{are no longer in}} a rent-regulation program poses a particular problem for tenants who were receiving special subsidies that may not cover the new, higher rent payments, such as subsidy programs because of proverty age, and disability. In some of the buildings, tenant associations are negotiating [...] "landlord assistance plans" [...] (LAPs) to implement the increases at a slower rate and to protect some of the weakest tenants. The plans are often limited to a specific number of years, and upon their expiration, tenants may be vulnerable. LAPs do not preserve the stock of affordable housing for future tenants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{implementation}} of healthcare insurance reform began in June 2006, with {{the appointment of}} members of the Connector board and the naming of Jon Kingsdale, a Tufts Health Plan official, {{as executive director of the}} Connector. On July 1, MassHealth began covering dental care and other benefits, and began enrolling children between 200% and 300% of the poverty level. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved the state's waiver application on July 26, 2006, allowing the state to begin enrolling 10,500 people from the waitlist for the MassHealth Essential program, which provides Medicaid coverage to long-term unemployed adults below the poverty line. In 2006, the Division of Health Care Finance and Policy issued regulations defining [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] for the fair share assessment. The regulations provide that companies with 11 or more full-time equivalent employees will meet the “fair and reasonable” test if at least 25 percent of those employees are enrolled in that firm’s health plan and the company is making a contribution toward it. A business that fails that test may still be deemed to offer a [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] contribution if the company offers to <b>pay</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 33 percent of an individual’s health insurance premium.|$|E
