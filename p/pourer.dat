60|$|I woke up {{and became}} aware that some one was pouring water down my throat. Heaven! I thought to myself, for at that time heaven and water were synonymous in my mind. I drank {{a good deal of}} it, not all I wanted by any means, but as much as the <b>pourer</b> would allow, then raised myself upon my hands and looked. The starlight was {{extraordinarily}} clear in that pure desert atmosphere, and by it I saw the face of Sergeant Quick bending over me. Also, I saw Orme sitting up, staring about him stupidly, while a great yellow dog, with a head like a mastiff, licked his hand. I knew the dog at once; it was that which Orme had bought from some wandering natives, and named Pharaoh because he ruled over all other dogs. Moreover, I knew the two camels that stood near by. So I was still on earth--unless, indeed we had all moved on a step.|$|E

50|$|Spats {{remain in}} use today as {{personal}} protective equipment in certain industries. In foundries, <b>pourers</b> wear leather spats over their boots to protect against splashes of molten metal. Even a small splash that lodges in a shoe or between the shoe and ankle could cause a severe burn. Many welders also wear fire-resistant spats for protection from sparks. Casual chainsaw operators often wear protective spats over steel-toe boots, but professionals are now encouraged to wear true chainsaw boots to prevent injury from accidental chainsaw contact with the foot or ankle.|$|R

50|$|Bloomfield {{was born}} into a wealthy Chicago Jewish-American family. Bloomfield's father, Harold Bloomfield, was born in Chicago in 1914. After {{pursuing}} business ventures in California during the 1920s, he returned to the city in the early 1930s. Harold Bloomfield began manufacturing restaurant supplies, and by {{the latter part of the}} decade his company, Bloomfield Industries, was making pie cases, kitchen utensils, salt and pepper shakers, and sugar <b>pourers.</b> By the early 1940s Bloomfield Industries had acquired more manufacturing and warehouse space. The company expanded during World War II by manufacturing supplies needed for the war effort. Working with his brother, Daniel, and his father, Samuel, Harold Bloomfield built up Bloomfield Industries into a thriving business. Michael Bloomfield's mother was born Dorothy Klein in Chicago in 1918 and married Harold Bloomfield in 1940.

40|$|The {{development}} of economy and industry introducing {{new technologies and}} materials often means the increased threat of occurrenceof factors harmful to humans and environment.

50|$|Besides priests, we {{find many}} other {{officials}} of various ranks attached to temples and recorded in inscriptions. Some of these, {{especially those who}} were concerned with buildings or constructions, or with the inventories of temple treasures and the accounts of administration, were lay officials appointed by the State, {{as in the case}} of political officers. But many others had specialised sacerdotal functions; for instance, in many places there were manteis or prophets, often of special families with hereditary skills in divination; at Eleusis we find records of the hierophant, the torch-bearer, and others who took part in the celebration of the mysteries. At Olympia, in later Greek times, we find a remarkable list of officials, that is: three priests, three libation <b>pourers,</b> two prophets, three custodians (of keys), a flute-player, an interpreter, a priest for the daily sacrifice, a secretary, a wine-pourer, three dancers at libations, a woodman (to supply wood for the sacrifices), and a steward and cook — the last no sinecure, in view of the numerous sacrificial feasts.|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} volume of drinks {{and the risk of}} overconsumption, health {{professionals}} recommend the use of tall skinny instead of short wide glasses. Yet {{the results of the present}} study contradict this health advice. Participants who generously filled up a glass with lemonade served 9 % more in tall narrow compared with short wide glasses (p< 0. 05). In addition, when pouring a small amount (i. e., a shot), participants poured 3 % more in a short wide than in a tall narrow glass (p< 0. 05). Elongation may bias the perceived volume that is poured but also the perceived volume of the free space in the glass. We hypothesised that shifting attention from the bottom to the brim of the glass when filling it close to capacity might reverse the glass elongation effect on the quantity poured. This hypothesis was tested, by investigating two pouring tasks that differed in the required focus of attention. When the instruction was to match a reference volume, participants poured more liquid in the short wide compared with the tall narrow glass (p< 0. 05). The effect of glass elongation on poured volume was the opposite when the instruction was to leave space in the glasses for the reference volume. It seems likely that task and individual factors affect the <b>pourer's</b> viewing strategy and thus may determine the direction of the glass elongation effect on the volume poured...|$|R

40|$|The ETANKFIRE {{project is}} focused on tank fires {{involving}} ethanol; the work conductedin {{this part of the}} ETANKFIRE project (WP 1 and WP 2) has been focused on tankfirefighting operations. Two series of fire extinguishing tests in reduced scale have been conducted. Both testseries simulated tank fire conditions by using a large amount of fuel and long preburntimes. The influence of foam application techniques, foam characteristics, and applicationrates have been investigated. Some tests have also included alternative extinguishingmedia such as cellular glass, liquid nitrogen and aqueous vermiculite dispersion (AVD). In total 29 extinguishing tests were conducted in the first test series using a 0, 41 m 2 firetray and 14 tests were conducted in the second test series using a 3, 14 m 2 fire tray. Priorto the experimental work a literature review was conducted to gain experience, both fromreal tank fire incidents and from various test and system design standards for the use offoam on water-miscible fuel fires. The results showed the importance of the characteristics of the finished foam. Higherfoam expansion ratios and longer drainage times resulted in significantly improved fireperformance. These improved foam characteristics are dependent on the foam applicationhardware as well as the foam concentrate formulation. To obtain these improvedcharacteristics the foam concentration was increased to 6 % from a nominal value of 3 %On the other hand, the improved foam characteristics allowed the application rate to bereduced by 50 % without compromising extinguishing performance. This shows that theperformance requirements in existing test standards for foam (e. g. UL 162, EN 1568) donot provide an incentive for manufacturers to formulate their foam to handle more severefire conditions, such as a tank fire scenario. The tests also indicated that gentle application of the foam is not guaranteed by the use offoam <b>pourers</b> (Type II discharge outlet according to NFPA 11) as the foam was not ableto flow gently along the tank wall due to high steel temperatures. With respect to alternative media, applying a layer of cellular glass followed by foamapplication made the extinguishing operation even more robust. The overall conclusion is that fighting ethanol tank fires would very likely result in afailure to extinguish if standard firefighting operations are used. However, the test resultsalso indicate important parameters that would improve the possibilities for a successfulextinguishment. Further validation of these results in larger scale could also providepossibilities to improve foam system standards, e. g. NFPA 11 and EN 13565 - 2 forextinguishment of water-miscible fuels as well as test standards for foam concentrates(e. g. UL 162, EN 1568 - 4).
