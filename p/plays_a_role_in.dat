40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the relation between beliefs and goals in agent theory. Beliefs play three <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> reasoning about goals: they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the generation of unconditional desires from conditional ones, they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> adoption of desires as goals, and they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the selection of plans to achieve goals. In this paper {{we consider the}} <b>role</b> of goals <b>in</b> reasoning about beliefs. Though we assume that goals do not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the belief generation problem, we argue that they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the belief selection problem. We show the rationality {{of the use of}} goals in belief selection, in the sense that there are cases in which agents that take their goals into account in selecting a belief set from a set of alternatives outperform agents that do not do so. We also formally distinguish between the rational <b>role</b> of goals <b>in</b> belief selection and irrational wishful thinking...|$|R

5|$|Various {{types of}} {{cyanobacteria}} inhabit Lake Chillisquaque. The specific genera that inhabit the lake vary {{at different times}} of the year and also at different depths within the lake.

5|$|AMPK {{probably}} also <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK {{is known to}} cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E

In Solanum lycopersicum (tomatoes), BCATs <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> synthesizing the branched-chain amino acids that act as electron donors in the electron transport chain. Overall, plant BCATs have catabolic and anabolic regulatory functions.|$|R

A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc.

5|$|Lithium deuteride was {{the fusion}} fuel {{of choice in}} early {{versions}} of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium â€” this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, {{was responsible for the}} runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve.

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles.

5|$|TBR1 was {{identified}} in 1995 by the Nina Ireland Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology Center at the University of California, San Francisco.

The protein product of TES-56 was discovered to be homologous to the Brachyury protein, a T-box transcription factor, which <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> establishing symmetry during embryonic development. Thus, due to its relation to T-box genes (such as Tbx-1, Tbx-2, Tbx-3), TES-56 was renamed TBR1.|$|E
