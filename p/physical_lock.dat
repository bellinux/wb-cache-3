2500|$|Lock {{screen is}} the {{simplest}} way to prevent unauthorized access your computer. [...] Since it is standard on most computers, it costs no extra memory or financial expense, but secures your computer so securely the FBI finds it difficult to gain access, let alone ordinary people. [...] Trying to control privacy and maintain parental controls within the computer without screen lock is like leaving the exterior doors of your house unlocked or wide open, relying on small locks on cabinets, drawers, closets, interior doors, (etc.), which your teenager or other intruder can lock-pick open at leisure away from the public view. Lock screen is actually more secure than common safeguards in life, such as locking your car so your child won't have a car accident which won't do any good if the child finds your keys, or a house-key while there are windows that can be smashed or pushed open for entry. If you do discover that the lock screen is not effective, then it is a certainty that you need to change your password to something less predictable, which is easily done, far easier than re-keying a car key or changing the combination of a <b>physical</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E

In such cases, a user would have real access to {{the contents of the}} (supposedly) frozen system. On a Windows-based computer, this scenario may be prevented by configuring the CMOS (nonvolatile BIOS memory) on the workstation to boot only to the hard drive to be protected, then password-protecting the CMOS. This is a normal precaution for most public access computers. A further precaution would be to lock the PC case shut with a <b>physical</b> <b>lock</b> or tiedown cable system to prevent access to motherboard jumpers.|$|E
40|$|Mass {{accuracy}} {{is a key}} parameter in proteomic experiments, improving specificity, and success rates of peptide identification. Advances in instrumentation now {{make it possible to}} routinely obtain high resolution data in proteomic experiments. To compensate for drifts in instrument calibration, a compound of known mass is often employed. This ‘lock mass ’ provides an internal mass standard in every spectrum. Here we take advantage of the complexity of typical peptide mixtures in proteomics to eliminate the requirement for a <b>physical</b> <b>lock</b> mass. We find that mass scale drift is primarily a function of the m/z and the elution time dimensions. Using a subset of high confidence peptide identifications from a first pass database search, which effectively substitute for the lock mass, we set up a global mathematical minimization problem. We perform a simultaneous fit in two dimensions using a function whose parameterization is automatically adjusted to the complexity of the analyzed peptide mixture. Mass deviation of the high confidence peptides from their calculated values is then minimized globally as a function of both m/z value and elution time. The resulting recalibration function performs equal or better than adding a lock mass from laboratory air to LTQ-Orbitrap spectra. This ‘software lock mass’ drastically improves mass accuracy compared with mass measurement without lock mass (up to 10 -fold), with none of the experimental cost of a <b>physical</b> <b>lock</b> mass, and it integrated into the freely available MaxQuant analysis pipeline (www. maxquant. org) ...|$|E

50|$|A rotary dial {{typically}} {{features a}} circular construction. The shaft that actuates the mechanical switching mechanism {{is driven by}} the finger wheel, a disk that has ten finger holes aligned close to the circumference. The finger wheel may be transparent or opaque permitting the viewing of the face plate, or number plate below, either in whole, or only showing the number assignment for each finger hole. The faceplate is printed with numbers, and sometimes letters, corresponding to each finger hole. The 1 is normally set at approximately 60 degrees clockwise from the uppermost point of the dial, or approximately at the 2 o'clock position, and then the numbers progress counterclockwise, with the 0 being at about 5 o'clock. A curved device called a finger stop sits above the dial at approximately the 4 o'clock position.

40|$|Several {{attacks against}} <b>physical</b> pin-tumbler <b>locks</b> re-quire access {{to one or}} more key blanks to perform. These attacks include bumping, impressioning, rights-amplification, and teleduplication. To {{mitigate}} these at-tacks, many lock systems rely on restricted keyways and use blanks that are not sold to the general public, making it harder for attackers to obtain them. Often the key blank designs themselves are patented, further discouraging dis-tribution or manufacture by even skilled machinists. In this paper we investigate the impact that emerging rapid prototyping—or 3 D printing—tools have on the se-curity of these restricted keyway systems. We find that commodity 3 D printers are able to produce key blanks and pre-cut keys with enough resolution to work in several commonly used pin-tumbler locks and that their material is strong enough to withstand the requirements to per-form the aforementioned attacks. In addition, in order to demonstrate the low skill requirements necessary to perform these attacks, we develop a tool that automati-cally generates a 3 D printable CAD model of a key blank using only a single picture of a lock’s keyway. This tool allows us to rapidly manufacture key blanks for restricted keyways that were previously difficult to make or buy. Finally, we discuss possible mitigations for these attacks that lock manufacturers, installers, and users can perform to protect their assets. ...|$|R
