5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the <b>power</b> <b>under</b> the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{civil war}} in the Arab Empire the Umayyads came to <b>power</b> <b>under</b> Muawiyah I. Under the Umayyads the conquest of the {{remaining}} Byzantine and northern Berber territories in North Africa was completed and the Arabs were able to move across large parts of the Berber world, invading Visigothic Spain through the Strait of Gibraltar, under the command of the allegedly Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad. But this happened only after they developed a naval power of their own, and they conquered and destroyed the Byzantine stronghold of Carthage between 695698. The loss of Africa meant that soon, Byzantine control of the Western Mediterranean was challenged by a new and expanding Arab fleet, operating from Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incarceration of the Thapas, a new {{government}} with joint mukhtiyars was formed with Rangnath Paudel {{as the head of}} civil administration, and Dalbarjan Pande and Ranjang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After about three months in <b>power,</b> <b>under</b> pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as mukhtiyar and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole mukhtiyar.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{the writer}} was still {{hoping for a}} return to the {{political}} stage, this time with the Nationalist Democratic Party, which came to <b>power</b> <b>under</b> Nicolae Iorga. To this goal, he approached Internal Affairs Undersecretary Nicolae Ottescu, requesting appointment as prefect, but was refused. During the same period, Caragiale was occasionally involved in events affecting the cultural scene. In May 1930, he was present at a banquet in honor of Italian author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the ideologue of Futurism. Organized by the Romanian Writers' Society and the Italo-Romanian Cultural Association, it was also attended by many other cultural figures, most of which, including artist Marcel Janco and the writers Ion Vinea, Jacques G. Costin, Ion Minulescu and Camil Petrescu, were associates of the magazine Contimporanul. In January 1934, linguist and publisher Alexandru Rosetti signed a contract with Caragiale, through which the latter agreed to complete Sub pecetea tainei and have it published by Rosetti's Editura Fundaศiilor Regale.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the <b>power</b> <b>under</b> Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E

First editions of the album came packaged in a case that doubled as a paper model of a video game arcade cabinet, and included a bonus CD; the Slow Life EP.
