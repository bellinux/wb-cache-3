5|$|Hexagonal and zincblende polymorphs have no {{inversion}} symmetry (reflection of {{a crystal}} relative to any given point does not {{transform it into}} itself). This and other lattice symmetry properties result in <b>piezoelectricity</b> of the hexagonal and zincblende ZnO, and pyroelectricity of hexagonal ZnO.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as <b>piezoelectricity,</b> from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong <b>piezoelectricity</b> of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} few decades, <b>piezoelectricity</b> {{remained}} something of a laboratory curiosity. More work was done to explore and define the crystal structures that exhibited <b>piezoelectricity.</b> This culminated in 1910 {{with the publication of}} Woldemar Voigt's Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik (Textbook on Crystal Physics), which described the 20 natural crystal classes capable of <b>piezoelectricity,</b> and rigorously defined the piezoelectric constants using tensor analysis.|$|E
25|$|Direct <b>piezoelectricity</b> of some substances, like quartz, can {{generate}} potential differences {{of thousands of}} volts.|$|E
25|$|Atomic force microscopes and {{scanning}} tunneling microscopes employ converse <b>piezoelectricity</b> to {{keep the}} sensing needle close to the specimen.|$|E
25|$|The {{semiconductors}} {{where the}} strongest <b>piezoelectricity</b> is observed are those {{commonly found in}} the wurtzite structure, i.e. GaN, InN, AlN and ZnO. ZnO is the most used material in the recent field of piezotronics.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} <b>piezoelectricity</b> in Topaz can {{probably}} {{be attributed to}} ordering of the (F,OH) in its lattice, which is otherwise centrosymmetric: orthorhombic bipyramidal (mmm). Topaz has anomalous optical properties which are attributed to such ordering.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>piezoelectricity</b> in sonar, and {{the success}} of that project, created intense {{development}} interest in piezoelectric devices. Over the next few decades, new piezoelectric materials and new applications for those materials were explored and developed.|$|E
25|$|Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF): PVDF exhibits <b>piezoelectricity</b> {{several times}} greater than quartz. Unlike ceramics, where the crystal structure of the material creates the piezoelectric effect, in polymers the intertwined long-chain molecules attract and repel each other when an electric field is applied.|$|E
25|$|All class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} using ferroelectric ceramics exhibit <b>piezoelectricity,</b> {{and have}} a piezoelectric effect called microphonics, microphony or in audio applications squealing. Microphony describes the phenomenon wherein electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an electrical signal which in many cases is undesired noise. Sensitive electronic preamplifiers generally use class 1 capacitors to avoid this effect.|$|E
25|$|The first {{demonstration}} of the direct piezoelectric effect was in 1880 by the brothers Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie. They combined their knowledge of pyroelectricity with {{their understanding of the}} underlying crystal structures that gave rise to pyroelectricity to predict crystal behavior, and demonstrated the effect using crystals of tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate). Quartz and Rochelle salt exhibited the most <b>piezoelectricity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Quartz clocks {{employ a}} crystal {{oscillator}} {{made from a}} quartz crystal that uses {{a combination of both}} direct and converse <b>piezoelectricity</b> to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time. The quartz crystal (like any elastic material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to oscillate, and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.|$|E
25|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO)–Wurtzite structure. While single {{crystals}} of ZnO are piezoelectric and pyroelectric, polycrystalline (ceramic) ZnO with randomly oriented grains exhibits neither piezoelectric nor pyroelectric effect. Not being ferroelectric, polycrystalline ZnO {{cannot be}} poled like barium titanate or PZT. Ceramics and polycrystalline thin films of ZnO may exhibit macroscopic <b>piezoelectricity</b> and pyroelectricity {{only if they}} are textured (grains are preferentially oriented), such that the piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses of all individual grains do not cancel. This is readily accomplished in polycrystalline thin films.|$|E
25|$|Of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric (not {{having a}} centre of symmetry), and of these, 20 exhibit direct <b>piezoelectricity</b> (the 21st is the cubic class 432). Ten of these {{represent}} the polar crystal classes, which show a spontaneous polarization without mechanical stress {{due to a}} non-vanishing electric dipole moment associated with their unit cell, and which exhibit pyroelectricity. If the dipole moment can be reversed by the application of an electric field, the material {{is said to be}} ferroelectric.|$|E
25|$|All {{ferroelectric}} materials exhibit <b>piezoelectricity</b> a piezoelectric effect. Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics dielectric, {{these types}} of capacitors may have electrical effects called microphonics. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an undesired electrical signal (noise). The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectricity</b> {{is found}} in useful applications, such as the {{production}} and detection of sound, generation of high voltages, electronic frequency generation, microbalances, to drive an ultrasonic nozzle, and ultrafine focusing of optical assemblies. It is also {{the basis of a}} number of scientific instrumental techniques with atomic resolution, the scanning probe microscopies, such as STM, AFM, MTA, SNOM, etc., and everyday uses, such as acting as the ignition source for cigarette lighters, and push-start propane barbecues, as well as the time reference source in quartz watches.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors, {{especially}} ceramic capacitors, {{and older}} designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves {{resulting in a}} microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate <b>piezoelectricity.</b> The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any.|$|E
25|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} {{are required by}} symmetry considerations to be also piezoelectric and pyroelectric. The combined properties of memory, <b>piezoelectricity,</b> and pyroelectricity make ferroelectric capacitors very useful, e.g. for sensor applications. Ferroelectric capacitors are used in medical ultrasound machines (the capacitors generate and then listen for the ultrasound ping used to image the internal organs of a body), high quality infrared cameras (the infrared image is projected onto a two dimensional array of ferroelectric capacitors capable of detecting temperature differences as small as millionths of a degree Celsius), fire sensors, sonar, vibration sensors, and even fuel injectors on diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|Twenty of the 32 crystal {{classes are}} piezoelectric, and {{crystals}} belonging {{to one of}} these classes (point groups) display <b>piezoelectricity.</b> All piezoelectric classes lack a center of symmetry. Any material develops a dielectric polarization when an electric field is applied, but a substance that has such a natural charge separation {{even in the absence of}} a field is called a polar material. Whether or not a material is polar is determined solely by its crystal structure. Only 10 of the 32 point groups are polar. All polar crystals are pyroelectric, so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes.|$|E
25|$|Dry bone {{exhibits}} some piezoelectric properties. Studies of Fukada et al. {{showed that}} these are not due to the apatite crystals, which are centrosymmetric, thus non-piezoelectric, but due to collagen. Collagen exhibits the polar uniaxial orientation of molecular dipoles in its structure and can be considered as bioelectret, a sort of dielectric material exhibiting quasipermanent space charge and dipolar charge. Potentials are thought to occur when a number of collagen molecules are stressed in the same way displacing significant numbers of the charge carriers from the inside {{to the surface of the}} specimen. <b>Piezoelectricity</b> of single individual collagen fibrils was measured using piezoresponse force microscopy, and it was shown that collagen fibrils behave predominantly as shear piezoelectric materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{piezoelectric}} effect {{is understood as}} the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The {{piezoelectric effect}} is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable <b>piezoelectricity</b> when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field {{is applied to the}} material. The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.|$|E
25|$|Of decisive {{importance}} for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either {{be caused by a}} reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments {{under the influence of the}} external stress. <b>Piezoelectricity</b> may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1cm3 cube of quartz with 2kN (500lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V.|$|E

2500|$|Ceramics with {{randomly}} oriented grains must be ferroelectric {{to exhibit}} <b>piezoelectricity.</b> The macroscopic <b>piezoelectricity</b> {{is possible in}} textured polycrystalline non-ferroelectric piezoelectric materials, such as AlN and ZnO.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Piezo{{electric}}ity</b> [...] is {{the electric}} charge that accumulates in certain solid materials (such as crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as bone, DNA and various proteins) {{in response to}} applied mechanical stress.

2500|$|Various {{specialized}} {{properties of}} molecular crystals and organic polymers with conjugated systems {{are of interest}} depending on applications, e.g. thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical such as <b>piezoelectricity,</b> electrical conductivity (see conductive polymers and organic semiconductors), and electro-optical (e.g. non-linear optics) properties. [...] For historical reasons, such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of polymer science and materials science.|$|E
2500|$|Classifying {{minerals}} {{ranges from}} simple to difficult. A mineral {{can be identified}} by several physical properties, some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation. In other cases, minerals can only be classified by more complex optical, chemical or X-ray diffraction analysis; these methods, however, can be costly and time-consuming. [...] Physical properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage and fracture, and specific gravity. Other less general tests include fluorescence, phosphorescence, magnetism, radioactivity, tenacity (response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form), <b>piezoelectricity</b> and reactivity to dilute acids.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} electric dipoles of a {{ferroelectric material}} are coupled {{to the material}} lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change {{the strength of the}} dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization). [...] The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge. [...] This can cause current flow {{in the case of a}} ferroelectric capacitor even without the presence of an external voltage across the capacitor. Two stimuli that will change the lattice dimensions of a material are force and temperature. The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an external stress to a material is called <b>piezoelectricity.</b> A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called pyroelectricity.|$|E
