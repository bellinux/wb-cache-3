25|$|With algal biofuel being a {{relatively}} new alternative to conventional petroleum products, it leaves numerous opportunities for drastic advances {{in all aspects of}} the technology. Producing algae biofuel is not yet a cost-effective replacement for gasoline, but alterations to current methodologies can change this. The two most common targets for advancements are the growth medium (open pond vs. <b>photobioreactor)</b> and methods to remove the intracellular components of the algae. Below are companies that are currently innovating algal biofuel technologies.|$|E

30|$|Cultivation is the {{production}} and accumulation of biomass containing target molecules {{using a combination of}} nutrient media, light, mixing/aeration, and CO 2 to promote microalgae growth. Commercially, green microalgae can be cultivated in open raceway ponds, <b>photobioreactors,</b> or hybrid systems. Open raceway ponds are cost-effective but prone to contamination, low biomass productivity, and low utilization of CO 2 due to constant evaporation (Tan et al.  2018). The ponds are also subject to limited light penetration due to dark zones and inadequate mixing. <b>Photobioreactors</b> allow for bulk quantity microalgae production, are less prone to contamination, and require less land for cultivation. Conversely, <b>photobioreactors</b> are much more costly, difficult to clean, and can experience a buildup of dissolved oxygen (Narala et al. 2016; Tan et al.  2018). Cultivation can also occur with a combination or hybrid blend of open raceway ponds and <b>photobioreactors</b> that can reduce cost and improve productivity. With hybrid cultivation strategies, a dense inoculum is produced in <b>photobioreactors</b> with minimized risk for contamination and then introduced in raceway ponds for continued cultivation and biomass production (Tan et al.  2018). Hybrid cultivation is an interesting strategy for species that accumulate products in nutrient deficient or deplete conditions as <b>photobioreactors</b> can be used for vegetative growth and raceway ponds can be used for bioproduct accumulation (Narala et al. 2016).|$|R

25|$|Blue Marble Production is a Seattle-based {{company that}} is {{dedicated}} to removing algae from algae-infested water. This in turn cleans up the environment and allows this company to produce biofuel. Rather than just focusing on the mass production of algae, this company focuses {{on what to do}} with the byproducts. This company recycles almost 100% of its water via reverse osmosis, saving about 26,000 gallons of water every month. This water is then pumped back into their system. The gas produced as a byproduct of algae will also be recycled by being placed into a <b>photobioreactor</b> system that holds multiple strains of algae. Whatever gas remains is then made into pyrolysis oil by thermochemical processes. Not only does this company seek to produce biofuel, but it also wishes to use algae for a variety of other purposes such as fertilizer, food flavoring, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer drugs.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{technical}} problems, such as harvesting, {{are being}} addressed successfully by the industry, the high up-front investment of algae-to-biofuels facilities {{is seen by}} many as a major obstacle to the success of this technology. Only few studies on the economic viability are publicly available, and must often rely on the little data (often only engineering estimates) available in the public domain. Dmitrov examined the GreenFuel's <b>photobioreactor</b> and estimated that algae oil would only be competitive at an oil price of $800 per barrel. A study by Alabi et al. examined raceways, photobioreactors and anaerobic fermenters to make biofuels from algae and found that photobioreactors are too expensive to make biofuels. Raceways might be cost-effective in warm climates with very low labor costs, and fermenters may become cost-effective subsequent to significant process improvements. The group found that capital cost, labor cost and operational costs (fertilizer, electricity, etc.) by themselves are too high for algae biofuels to be cost-competitive with conventional fuels. Similar results were found by others, suggesting that unless new, cheaper ways of harnessing algae for biofuels production are found, their great technical potential may never become economically accessible. Recently, Rodrigo E. Teixeira demonstrated a new reaction and proposed a process for harvesting and extracting raw materials for biofuel and chemical production that requires a fraction of the energy of current methods, while extracting all cell constituents.|$|E
50|$|A <b>photo{{bioreactor}}</b> is a bioreactor that utilizes a {{light source}} to cultivate phototrophic microorganisms.

Within the artificial environment of a <b>photobioreactor,</b> specific conditions are carefully controlled for respective species. Thus, a <b>photobioreactor</b> allows much higher growth rates and purity levels than anywhere in nature or habitats similar to nature.

40|$|ANannochloropsissp. is a {{promising}} microalgal resource for production of food, feed and bio-based commodities, {{as it can}} grow relatively fast and combines high lipid content with high content of poly-unsaturated fatty acids. High productivity with constant product quality can be achieved in fully controlled closed <b>photobioreactors.</b> In these closed <b>photobioreactors,</b> however, oxygen accumulation occurs and causes inhibition of the growth by photorespiration combined with photoinhibition. The inhibitory effects of photorespiration and photoinhibition can be partly dealt with via the carbon concentration mechanism of the cells and by activation of the water-water cycle. At constant high oxygen concentration and high light intensity, however, {{the growth of the}} cells ceases.

The algal culture is usually concentrated to 15 - 20 % by volume from its original concentration of 0.02 - 05 % concentration in the cultivation ponds. One can notice that all of the above steps require large quantities of energy.|$|R

Both open pond and flat-plate photoreactors were proven to be feasible, given that the lipid content of biomass could be increased to 60%.

25|$|With current {{technology}} available, it {{is estimated}} that the cost of producing microalgal biomass is $2.95/kg for <b>photobioreactors</b> and $3.80/kg for open-ponds. These estimates assume that carbon dioxide is available at no cost. If the annual biomass production capacity is increased to 10,000 tonnes, the cost of production per kilogram reduces to roughly $0.47 and $0.60, respectively. Assuming that the biomass contains 30% oil by weight, the cost of biomass for providing a liter of oil would be approximately $1.40 ($5.30/gal) and $1.81 ($6.85/gal) for <b>photobioreactors</b> and raceways, respectively. Oil recovered from the lower cost biomass produced in <b>photobioreactors</b> is estimated to cost $2.80/L, assuming the recovery process contributes 50% to the cost of the final recovered oil. If existing algae projects can achieve biodiesel production price targets of less than $1 per gallon, the United States may realize its goal of replacing up to 20% of transport fuels by 2020 by using environmentally and economically sustainable fuels from algae production.|$|R

They do not only have the capacity to produce high-value compounds, but also the ability to do it using only sunlight, carbon dioxide and seawater.

This can be obtained in closed <b>photobioreactors.</b> In these systems, besides the main scale-up parameters, which are associated to all microbial fermentations: mass transfer, mixing rate and hydrodynamic stress, the light regime has also to be considered because light energy is the limiting substrate. However, these parameters cannot be controlled independently, as they are closely interrelated. Therefore, in order to maximise productivity, the whole process has to be examined.
