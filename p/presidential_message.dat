Muñoz consented, despite the protests of Trías, who argued that the Joint Resolution stated otherwise. As a consequence, another Presidential Commission was to be created, the Status Commission, with only minor involvement from Congress. In a reunion with president Kennedy, Muñoz admitted that the presidential vote was not really important to him.

5000|$|In the Printing bill as {{presented}} by the Joint Committee to the House, section 53 (which later became section 52 of the Law of 1895) provided {{for the sale of}} duplicate plates by the Public Printer, this provision apparently having been suggested by Mr. Richardson with a view to facilitating the private republication of the <b>Presidential</b> <b>Messages.</b> Section 53 was attacked {{on the floor of the}} House on the ground that private persons might assert copyright claims upon republishing Government documents from the plates." [...] It was then proposed that a proviso be added to section 53 [...] "that no publication reprinted from such stereotype or electrotype plates shall be copyrighted." [...] The opposition was not satisfied with that but accepted a further proposal that the proviso be extended by inserting the words [...] "and no other Government publication." [...] The bill was passed with the proviso in that form. Perhaps the opposition had anticipated and sought to forestall what happened subsequently: After several volumes of the <b>Presidential</b> <b>Messages</b> were compiled by Mr. Richardson and Congress authorized them to be printed and distributed by the Government Printing Office, some of the volumes were printed with a copyright notice in the name of Mr. Richardson.When this was questioned in Congress, Representative Richardson said that he was not claiming copyright as against the Government but only against third persons, and that his claim was limited to the original matter created by his editorial work. Other members of Congress expressed the view that he had no right to claim copyright in the product of his editorial work since it was produced for a publication authorized by Congress. Subsequently the Senate Committee on Printing reviewed the matter and expressed its opinion that the proviso in section 52 precluded Mr. Richardson's claim of copyright.|$|R

[...] Jefferson signed the new law and the international trade became illegal in January 1808. The legal trade had averaged 14,000 slaves a year; illegal smuggling at the rate of about 1000 slaves a year continued for decades.

5000|$|Often {{referred}} to as the [...] "Father of Sinfonia", Mills was a familiar figure at annual conventions until his last years when his work would not permit his leaving Boston.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{interdisciplinary}} research was to see whether American presidents can reach Millennials more effectively in the digital age while publicly advancing the legislative agenda of their administration. The rationale is that presidents need to gain public support to pressure Congress into passing their legislation; while doing that, they can capture the public’s interest in politics and educate civically the most inattentive audience. To accomplish the task, strategic messaging adequate to digital media is necessary. Millennials appear as having modest interest and knowledge of politics despite their intense presence on digital media. On the other hand, they represent {{a third of the}} electorate— also projected to become the most important economic contributors in society — thus constituting an audience that cannot be ignored. Because metaphors are credited with an important role in processing new information and in branding leadership, I propose a category of new metaphors, labeled High Definition (HD) Metaphors that have three characteristics: they concentrate the policy contained in the message, are novel, and are relevant to the targeted audience. The most important claim is that HD metaphors catch the eye of the audience by increasing the message visibility; the corresponding hypothesis is (H 1) <b>Presidential</b> <b>messages</b> containing High Definition Metaphors are more salient than their literal counterparts. Second, I argue that HD metaphors facilitate the understanding of the message as they have a contribution to the acquisition of new information; hence the second hypothesis: (H 2) <b>Presidential</b> <b>messages</b> containing High Definition Metaphors produce more political knowledge. Last, I claim that metaphors can influence the audience, by producing more agreement with the message; this is reflected in the third hypothesis: (H 3) <b>Presidential</b> <b>messages</b> containing High Definition Metaphors are more persuasive than their literal counterparts. To test these claims I conducted an experiment with 251 students in a large American university in the southeast, in which two groups were exposed to written, fictitious metaphorical messages sourced by a fictitious president of the U. S. and two groups received the non metaphorical versions of the messages (literal counterparts). One pair of messages was constructed on a topic of high involvement and the other pair on a topic of low involvement, as determined at a previous date. Statistical analysis indicated that HD Metaphors increase the visibility of the message especially for audiences less interested in the topic. This is a key finding because it suggests that presidents can capture the attention of Millennials who are in general apathetic to the political discourse. On the other hand, HD Metaphors did not produce more political knowledge or more persuasion, in this particular design. The importance of this study is theoretical and practical. It advances a new concept, High Definition Metaphors that was empirically tested with the power of an experiment; future work can build on these findings by detecting other effects. This research also connects theoretical models and concepts from various disciplines, thus enriching the scholarly understanding of issues that are not satisfied within the boundaries of a single field. Most importantly, this research has applicability to practice by informing presidential communication in the digital era; additionally, it can enhance the external strategic communication of leadership in non- governmental and international organizations since HD Metaphors can be adapted to fit any audiences whose attention is desired...|$|R
