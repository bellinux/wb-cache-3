5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged {{to reduce the amount}} of food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, <b>pack</b> <b>size</b> range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{wolves and}} their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group the Rogue Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon. By July, wildlife biologists {{found evidence that}} OR-7 and his mate had produced a second litter of pups. A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total of wolves in this pack to seven. By 2016, the <b>pack</b> <b>size</b> had grown to nine.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline and}} {{extermination}} of the Arctic wolf population was studied in east Greenland between 1899 and 1939. Through these years, there were 252 sightings of the wolves and/or their tracks. Around 112 wolves were sighted {{in the early}} winter, 31.3% were lone wolves, 23.2% were in pairs, and the rest stayed together in larger groups. The average <b>pack</b> <b>size</b> of the Arctic wolves was 3.3; packs of four or more were rare. The Arctic wolf population was mainly in {{the central part of}} the range, which made them vulnerable to the Danish and Norwegian hunters, which exterminated the population with the use of poison. They are endangered due to their exceptionally low densities, smaller pack sizes, infrequent reproduction, and lower offspring production. The population was not harvested by the Europeans prior to 1899. There was no effort to bring back or grow the population because the main goal was to maximize profits by killing as many Arctic foxes as possible. Arctic wolves were considered less in terms of economic significance because of their low abundance. They were mainly killed and exterminated due to interfering with commercial hunting by killing foxes in traps. Between 1920 and 1932, 35 wolves were killed in the core wolf range, forcing the population to decline rapidly. The Arctic wolf population in five of the six core range areas of east Greenland has severely collapsed and declined rapidly after the arrival of European commercial hunters. There is no other evidence for the potential decline in the Arctic wolf population.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} reduce fatal self-poisoning {{legislation}} {{was introduced in the}} UK in 1998 to restrict <b>pack</b> <b>sizes</b> of paracetamol sold in pharmacies (maximum 32 tablets) and non-pharmacy outlets (maximum 16 tablets), and in Ireland in 2001, but with smaller maximum <b>pack</b> <b>sizes</b> (24 and 12 tablets). Our aim was to determine whether this resulted in smaller overdoses of paracetamol in Ireland compared with the UK. Methods: We used data on general hospital presentations for non-fatal self-harm for 2002 - 2007 from the Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England (six hospitals), and from the National Registry of Deliberate Self-harm in Ireland. We compared sizes of overdoses of paracetamol in the two settings. Results: There were clear peaks in numbers of non-fatal overdoses, associated with maximum <b>pack</b> <b>sizes</b> of paracetamol in pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets in both England and Ireland. Significantly more pack equivalents (based on maximum non-pharmacy <b>pack</b> <b>sizes)</b> were used in overdoses in Ireland (mean 2. 63, 95...|$|R

So, this research aims to analyze th demand ofLPG by household in Semarang and thefactors that influence the demadc of LPG. This research use survey methods by means of interviewing the consumer of LPG based on available questionnaire that consists ofquestions about LPG demand. Afterwards, all data gathered : LPG demand, LPG price, total earning per family, electricity bill, education level of decision maker of LPG usage, number offamily members and the choice of <b>packing</b> <b>size</b> are analyzed using multiple regression analysis which estimated using ordinary least squares method. Research result shows that LPG price is the most important variable that influences LPG demand was depicted by high elasticity value ofprice. While <b>packing</b> <b>size</b> shows that it is not significant variable which means there is no difference between the demand of 12 kilos LPG and 3 kilos LPG. Then, the result show earnings variable influence LPG demands significantly, it show that LPG is primary goods that depicted by inelastic elasticity of earnings. Afterwards, significant result is showed by electricity bill variable so it can be concluded that electricity constitutes substitute goods for LPG.
