25|$|However, other {{researchers}} have argued against the existence of Mokele Mbembe. According to Daniel Loxton and Donald Prothero, the conventional image of Mokele Mbembe held by cryptozoologists such as Roy Mackal {{is based on an}} outdated image of sauropod dinosaurs from the early twentieth century. More recent discoveries indicate that most sauropods did not live in swampy areas and subsist on aquatic plants (as was long supposed), but instead lived in seasonally dry woodlands and ate tough conifers and cycads. Loxton and Prothero argue that the sauropod image of Mokele Mbembe reflects a confirmation bias which seeks to force ambiguous eyewitness accounts to support wishful thinking. These authors also point out that a surviving population of sauropods would leave behind skeletal remains like other large animals do, and that Africa's rich fossil record would contain sauropod bones younger than 65 million years old if a group of such had survived to the present. The absence of this evidence, despite several centuries of Western contact with the region, numerous expeditions in search of the animal, and <b>periodic</b> <b>aerial</b> and satellite surveillance, all of which have detected elephants and other large animals - but no sauropods - all argue against the existence of Mokele Mbembe.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary to a {{solution}} {{of the problem of}} horizontally polarized log <b>periodic</b> <b>aerial</b> arrays above ground, various types of log periodic aerials are analysed. Numerical design data for the former problem are displayed in charts which should reduce trial-and-error beam scanning designs to a minimum. The single mast sloping dipole log <b>periodic</b> <b>aerial</b> is given particular attention. Computer programmes and approximate formulae are developed for both free-space and above-ground designs. The far field of these aerials is shown to be predictable from near field data. Experimental investigations, although limited in scope, confirm most of the developed theory at least qualitatively. Suggestions for further investigations are included...|$|E

40|$|This paper gives {{a summary}} of our {{research}} on pattern regularity. Periodic structures are perceived by humans as regular {{in a wide range}} of viewing angles. This observation motivates the development of a regularity based feature vector whose ane invariance is justified theoretically and tested experimentally. The vector is derived from the interaction map of a pattern. Several alternative but closely related definitions of the interaction map are discussed. The maximal regularity, a component of the feature vector, is shown to be consistent with human judgement on regularity. This feature can be implemented as a run filter, allowing for regularity based image filtering. Three applications of the regularity approach are presented. First, it is used for affine-invariant texture classification. Then, detection of <b>periodic</b> structures in <b>aerial</b> images is demonstrated. Finally, the texture inspection problem is addressed and structural defects are found as locations of low regularity. Key words: Pa [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Waimea Beach on {{the island}} of Oahu, Hawaii, is a popular {{recreation}} area, which is presently endangered by severe erosion. The extent of shoreline erosion has been determined from comparison of an 1884 survey map with aerial photographs from the period 1928 - 1975, and from measurements of the changes in the vegetation line during that time. The Waimea section of Oahu's shoreline has receded about 200 ft in this 47 -yr period. This erosion is caused primarily by storms that move the beach sand into deeper waters from which it cannot return to the beach and the lack of supply of new sand to the beach. Sand mining and abrasion also have contributed to the retreat of the shoreline. Continued <b>periodic</b> measurements and <b>aerial</b> surveys would be valuable in tracking the regression of the shoreline and useful for planning the future of public facilities located in Waimea Bay...|$|R
40|$|The {{depleted}} {{population of}} belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) inhabiting the St Lawrence estuary, Canada, was monitored by <b>periodic</b> photographic <b>aerial</b> surveys. In order to correct counts made on aerial survey film and {{to obtain an}} estimate of the true size of the population, the diving behaviour and the visibility from the air of these animals was studied. A Secchi-disk turbidity survey in the belugas’ summer range showed that water clarity varied between 1. 5 m and 11. 6 m. By studying aerial photographs of sheet-plastic models of belugas that had been sunk to different depths below the surface, we found that models of white adults could be seen down to about the same depth as a Secchi disk, but no deeper. Smaller models of dark-grey juveniles could only be seen down to about  50 % of Secchi-disk depth. By observing groups of belugas from a hovering helicopter and recording their disappearances and re-appearances, it was found that they were visible for 44. 3 % of the time, and that an appropriate correction for single photographs would be to multiply the photographic count by about 222 % (SE 20 %). For surveys in which there was overlap between adjacent frames, the estimated correction would be 209 % (SE 16 %). This correction factor was slightly conservative and gave {{an estimate of the}} true size of the population, based on a single survey, of 1, 202  belugas (SE 189) in 1997.

40|$|Moose {{populations are}} managed for {{sustainable}} yield balanced against costs caused by damage to forestry or agriculture and collisions with vehicles. Optimal harvests {{can be calculated}} based on a structured population model driven by data on abundance and the composition of bulls, cows, and calves obtained by aerial-survey monitoring during winter. Quotas are established by the respective government agency and licenses are issued to hunters to harvest an animal of specified age or sex during the following autumn. Because the cost of aerial monitoring is high, we use a Management Strategy Evaluation to evaluate {{the costs and benefits}} of <b>periodic</b> <b>aerial</b> surveys in the context of moose management. Our on-the-fly "seat of your pants" alternative to independent monitoring is management based solely on the kill of moose by hunters, which is usually sufficient to alert the manager to declines in moose abundance that warrant adjustments to harvest strategies. Harvests are relatively cheap to monitor; therefore, data can be obtained each year facilitating annual adjustments to quotas. Other sources of "cheap" monitoring data such as records of the number of moose seen by hunters while hunting also might be obtained, and may provide further useful insight into population abundance, structure and health. Because conservation dollars are usually limited, the high cost of aerial surveys is difficult to justify when alternative methods exist. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|Suspension-feeding organisms {{living in}} the {{intertidal}} zone experience reduced feeding times associated with <b>periodic</b> <b>aerial</b> exposure. The potential morphological and physiological adaptations to this reduced feeding time were investigated for two closely related gastropods, Crepidula fornicata and Crepipatella peruviana. Intertidal C. fornicata had heavier gills than subtidal conspecifics, a difference mediated by larger gill surface areas and greater numbers of gill filaments among intertidal individuals of a given size. In contrast, the gills of intertidal and subtidal C. peruviana were morphologically indistinguishable. Despite relatively larger food-collecting organs, individuals of C. fornicata from the intertidal zone had clearance rates (CR) that {{were not significantly different}} from those of subtidal conspecifics. In contrast, the CR of intertidal C. peruviana were significantly lower than those of subtidal conspecifics. The low CR of intertidal C. peruviana may be partially explained by significantly lower measured particle transport velocities across their gills. In the context of feeding, intertidal individuals of C. fornicata performed at least as well as subtidal conspecifics, resulting in a population whose adults were as large as those found subtidally. This suggests that C. fornicata has had a long interaction with the environmental heterogeneity associated with intertidal life. In contrast, intertidal individuals of C. peruviana were on average smaller than subtidal individuals and may be stressed in the intertidal.

40|$|Freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera margaritifera L. {{were exposed}} to air for 7 days, then {{immersed}} in circumneutral water (pH 7 - 85) or acidified water (pH 5 - 25) for 5 days. Mantle fluid pH and composition were monitored through-out. The mussels were observed to gape periodically when in air. <b>Periodic</b> gaping permitted <b>aerial</b> gas exchange such that mantle fluid P c o, and dissolved oxygen concentration stabilized at levels about twice and half, respectively, those of immersed mussels. During emersion, a dilute carbonate buffer equilibrium {{was established in the}} mantle fluid, involving reactions with CaCO 3 reserves and, simultaneously, aerial release of CO 2. Aerial CO 2 release was sufficient to shift the carbonate buffer equilibrium in the alkaline direction, resulting in a significant alkalosis of mantle fluids during air exposure. Mantle fluid characteristics returned to initial (time zero) values within 3 days of immersion in circumneutral water (pH 7 - 85). When immersed in acid water (pH 5 - 25), the mussels were able to maintain a sizeable gradient between mantle fluid pH and ambient water pH. Regulation of mantle fluid pH in acid water did not involve any isolation reaction (valve closure), but rather environmental protons were buffered at the expense of CaCO 3 reserves. Net calcium transfer, the difference between calcium uptake and loss, was shifted in the negative direction by decreases in water pH...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims To {{understand}} whether root {{responses to}} aerial rhythmic growth and contrasted defoliation treatments {{can be interpreted}} under the common frame of carbohydrate availability; root growth was studied in parallel with carbohydrate concentrations {{in different parts of}} the root system on oak tree seedlings. Methods Quercus pubescens seedlings were submitted to selective defoliation (removal of mature leaves, cotyledons or young developing leaves) at appearance of the second flush and collected 1, 5 or 10 d later for morphological and biochemical measurements. Soluble sugar and starch concentrations were measured in cotyledons and apical and basal root parts. Key Results Soluble sugar concentration in the root apices diminished during the expansion of the second aerial flush and increased after the end of aerial growth in control seedlings. Starch concentration in cotyledons regularly decreased. Continuous removal of young leaves did not alter either root growth or apical sugar concentration. Starch storage in basal root segments was increased. After removal of mature leaves (and cotyledons), root growth strongly decreased. Soluble sugar concentration in the root apices drastically decreased and starch reserves in the root basal segments were emptied 5 d after defoliation, illustrating a considerable shortage in carbohydrates. Soluble sugar concentrations recovered 10 d after defoliation, after the end of aerial growth, suggesting a recirculation of sugar. No supplementary recourse to starch in cotyledons was observed. Conclusions The parallel between apical sugar concentration and root growth patterns, and the correlations between hexose concentration in root apices and their growth rate, support the hypothesis that the response of root growth to <b>aerial</b> <b>periodic</b> growth and defoliation treatments is largely controlled by carbohydrate availability...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Presentation date: 1974 - 12 - 20 During {{the summers}} of 1970 and 1971 {{a total of}} 95 sea otter (Enhydra lutris) were shipped to Oregon from Amchitka Island, Alaska. The 1970 {{shipment}} consisted of 31 otter which were to be released on the southern Oregon Coast {{near the town of}} Port Orford. Two of these animals died in holding pens and 29 were successfully released to the wild on 18 July 1970. A second shipment of 64 sea otter was divided into two groups. On 24 June 1971, 24 otter were released at Port Orford and 40 more were released near Cape Arago. Total documented mortality of the translocated sea otter consisted of eight animals, seven of these were found within 1 week of the releases. During the study period reports of sea otter were distributed from Tillamook Head to Brookings, Oregon, a distance of approximately 276 miles. A single report was received from Tolvana Beach, Oregon, 181 miles north of the nearest release site. Concentrations of otter were established at two locations during 1972, Simpson and Blanco reefs. The number of animals that could. be observed at either of these sites seemed {{to be related to the}} season, with most otter using Simpson Reef during the winter months, subsequently moving to Blanco Reef 35 miles to the south as the weather subsided. The use patterns for 1972 - 73 were similar to those for 1971 - 72; however, the number of otter using Simpson Reef during the winter of 1972 - 73 was less than for the previous winter, suggesting that a portion of the herd may have remained in the vicinity of Cape Blanco during winter 1972 - 73. It is estimated that 30 - 35 sea otter were on the coast at the termination of this study (5 October 1973). The first sea otter pup was sighted on 20 February 1972, 19 months after the 1970 release at Port Orford. Subsequently nine more pups were observed during the study period: three in 1972 and six in 1973. Data on food habits were gathered at Simpson Reef. Sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus spp.) comprised the major portion of the sea otter's diet and accounted for nearly 64 percent of the total number of observations. Mollusks accounted for 14. 4 percent and several species of crabs comprised 5. 2 percent. Underwater surveys of 13 areas indicate that sea urchins are the most abundant macroinvertebrates normally preyed upon by sea otter. They occur at densities of up to 47 purple sea urchins (S. purpuratus) per 0. 25 m 2, with red sea urchins (S. franciscanus) occurring as high as an estimated six to eight animals per 1 m 2. Results of this study indicate that approximately one-third of the Oregon coastline is suitable for sea otter habitation; approximately 80 percent of the suitable area is situated along the south coast from Coos Bay to the Oregon-California border, with the remainder in the central region near the town of Newport. Both sites chosen for the translocations contain good sea otter habitat; however, because of greater probability of human-related mortality and environmental pollution and the lesser amount of contiguous sea otter habitat in the vicinity of Cape Arago than near Port Orford; the latter appears to have been the better site. It is suggested that in the future, translocated sea otter be tagged to facilitate their identification. Recommended management of the translocated otter in Oregon includes establishment of refuges, protection of the otter and their habitat, and <b>periodic</b> shoreline and <b>aerial</b> surveys to ascertain population growth and range expansion...|$|R
40|$|Colonias are low-income {{settlements}} on the US-Mexico border {{characterized by}} poor infrastructure, minimum services, and an active housing construction {{with a high}} self-help and self-management component. Housing in colonias is very diverse showing house forms that include temporary and permanent structures, campers, trailers or manufactured houses and conventional homes. Most of this housing does not meet construction standards and codes and is considered substandard. Colonias households are also of diverse nature and composition including single households, nuclear and extended families, as well as multiple households sharing lots. This wide variety of house forms and households in colonias fits poorly within the nuclear household, single family detached housing idealized by conventional low-income housing projects, programs and policies. As a result, colonias marginally benefit from the resources available to them and continue to depend mostly on the individual efforts of their inhabitants. This research identifies the housing diversity {{and the process of}} housing consolidation in colonias of the US-Mexico border by looking at the patterns of house form and household arrangements in colonias of South Texas. Ten colonias located to the east of the city of Laredo along Highway 359 in Webb County, Texas were selected based on their characteristics, data availability and accessibility. Data collected included <b>periodic</b> <b>aerial</b> images of the colonias spanning a period of 28 years, household information from the 2000 census disaggregated at the block level for these colonias, and information from a field survey and a semi structured interview made to a random sample of 123 households between February and June 2007. The survey collected information about house form and household characteristics. The survey also incorporated descriptive accounts on how households completed their house from the initial structure built or set on the lot until the current house form. Data was compiled and analyzed using simple statistical methods looking for identifiable patterns on house form and household characteristics and changes over time. Findings showed that housing in colonias is built and consolidated following identifiable patterns of successive changes to the house form. Findings also showed that households in colonias share characteristics that change over time in similar ways. These results suggest similarities of colonias with extra-legal settlements in other developing areas. Based on these findings, the study reflects on possible considerations that could improve the impact of projects, programs and policies directed to support colonias and improve colonias housing...|$|E
