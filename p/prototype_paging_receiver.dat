40|$|Circuit {{requirements}} of a direct-conversion FLEX <b>paging</b> <b>receiver</b> with the zero-crossing interpolation demodulator are derived by means of high-level simulation. Impacts of the limitations on noise and nonlinearity characteristics of the radio frequency (RF) stage, the in-phase and quadrature-phase mismatch, and the local oscillator frequency drift are analyzed relative to the degradation of the bit error rate. Official specifications on radio <b>paging</b> <b>receivers</b> are introduced to ensure the minimum performance. It is shown that an RF front end with 25 -dB gain, 5. 3 -dB noise figure, and 11 -dBm second order intercept point makes the receiver qualified for the sensitivity, desensitization, and intermodulation requirements...|$|R

The decoder in the typical Plectron receiver would not decode the tone as a valid call unless it was present for at least two to four seconds, (a very long variation of the burst tone).|$|R

50|$|The {{total size}} of memory-mapped files in Windows 2000 was limited because the memory manager {{allocated}} the <b>Prototype</b> <b>Page</b> Table entries (PPTEs) for all pages required {{to map the}} entire file, even if an application created mapped views to parts of the file. In Windows XP, the Prototype PTEs are allocated for active views only, allowing larger mapped files. A benefit of this, for example, is in case of making backups of large files on low memory systems. The paged pool limit of 470 MB has been lifted from the Memory Manager in Windows XP, with unmapped views dynamically reusable by the memory manager depending on pool usage.|$|R
50|$|Digital {{systems may}} {{communicate}} text messages from computer-aided dispatch (CAD). For example, a display in a tow truck may give a textual location for {{a call and}} any related details. The tow truck driver may press an acknowledge button, sending data {{in the opposite direction}} and flagging the call as received by the driver. They can be used for analog telemetry systems, such as the livestock tank levels, as described above. Another possibility is the lubricating oil pressure in a transit bus engine, or the current speed of the bus. Analog conditions are translated into data words. Some systems send radio paging messages which can either 1) beep a <b>paging</b> <b>receiver,</b> 2) send a numeric message, or 3) send a text message.|$|R
50|$|Two-tone sequential, {{also known}} as 1+1, is a {{selective}} calling method originally used in one-way, tone-and-voice <b>paging</b> <b>receivers.</b> Many companies have their own names for two-tone sequential options. General Electric Mobile Radio called it Type 99. Motorola called it Quik-Call II. For example, the encoder sends a single tone followed by 50 to 1,000 milliseconds of silence and then a second tone. Decoders look for a valid first tone followed by a valid second tone within a defined length of time, (a time window). For example, a decoder detecting a valid first tone might allow up to 2 seconds for a valid second tone to be decoded. If no valid second tone is decoded within 2 seconds, the decoder resets and waits for another valid first tone.|$|R
50|$|Quik-Call I, {{also known}} as 2+2, is a {{selective}} calling method originally used in one-way <b>paging</b> <b>receivers.</b> The Quik-Call name is a trademark of Motorola. It sends a pair of tones followed by 50 to 1,000 milliseconds of silence and then a second pair of tones. Decoders look for a valid first tone pair followed by a valid second tone pair within a defined length of time, (a time window). For example, a decoder detecting a valid first tone pair might allow up to 2 seconds for a valid second tone pair to be decoded. If no valid second tone is decoded within 2 seconds, the decoder resets and waits for another valid first tone pair. The system is less susceptible to falsing because it employs pairs of tone decoders that must detect valid tone pairs simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of producing a}} page composer for optical memory systems using thin, deformable, membrane-mirror elements as light valves was investigated. The electromechanical and optical performances of such elements were determined both analytically and experimentally. It was found that fast switching (approximately 10 microseconds), high-contrast (10 or greater), fatigue-free operation over missions of cycles, and efficient utilization of input light could be obtained with membrane light valves. Several arrays of 64 elements were made on substrates with feedthroughs, allowing access to individual elements from the backside of the substrate. Single light valves on such arrays were successfully operated with the transistors designed and produced for selection and storage at each bit location. This simulated the operation of a <b>prototype</b> <b>page</b> composer with semiconductor chips beam-lead bonded {{to the back of}} the substrate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{resource}} impoverished {{environment on}} mobile devices {{results in a}} poor experience for users browsing the World Wide Web. Proxy-based middleware that transform content on the fly to better suit the resource conditions on a user’s device provide a promising solution to this problem. A key challenge in such systems is deciding how to adapt content, especially when the same content has multiple uses that have varying adaptation requirements. In this paper, we show {{that it is possible}} to provide fine grain adaptation of multi-purpose content by detecting correlations in the adaptation requirements of past users across multiple objects on a web site, and using this history to make adaptation predictions for users encountered subsequently. To evaluate our technique, we built <b>prototype</b> <b>page</b> layout and image fidelity adaptation systems, and used these to gather traces from users browsing multi-purpose web content in a laboratory setting. Our experimental results show that using correlations to make adaptation predictions can significantly reduce bandwidth consumption, browsing time, energy usage and user effort required to adapt content...|$|R
40|$|<b>Paging</b> <b>receivers</b> {{often have}} {{to work in a}} dense signal environment. This poses high demands on the {{preselection}} filter. One of the most difficult aspects is the large image rejection demand, which only can be satisfied by use of a narrow-band or high-Q filter. The practical restrictions for possible filter implementations are the low cost, low power and the small size of the pager. By use of positive feedback around a cheap off-chip low-Q inductor we obtain an enhanced quality factor. We are therefore able to construct selective filters using cheap small-size inductors. The price paid for Q-enhancement is a larger noise and higher sensitivity to component variations. The higher noise influence is eliminated using a high gain in the preceding LNA-stage, which is considered a part of the filter. Simulated results are: Q enhanced from 30 to 100, Image-rejection = 48 dB, f 0 = 280 MHz, Voltage-gain = 20 dB, Noise- figure = 2. 4 dB, IMFDR = 66 dB, IDD = 1 mA, VDD = 2 V. The original contribution of this work is the application of the enhancement principle to off-chip components, which benefits the minimization of size and cost...|$|R

40|$|As {{the radio}} paging system is {{upgraded}} from POCSAG {{to the high}} speed FLEX or ERMES protocol, both the modulation level and the baud rate are increased. What is unchanged is the available bandwidth. Consequently, the modulation index is decreased and additional difficulties are imposed {{on the design of}} a direct-conversion receiver. The main problems are (1) there are no mature demodulation techniques available for zero-IF M-ary FSK signals, and (2) the signal contains strong DC/low-frequency energy and hence DC offset cancellation is no longer an easy task. In this dissertation, a direct-conversion receiver is designed for high speed 4 FSK radio paging applications. Various design considerations are discussed and analyzed. A zero-crossing based counting/comparing scheme is chosen for the demodulation. The BER is improved by a novel zero-crossing interpolation technique. Following official specifications on radio <b>paging</b> <b>receivers,</b> a high level simulation is carried out to verify the demodulator performance and derive circuit requirements. The self-mixing-related time-varying offset is suppressed by the harmonic mixer to the noise level. A differential peak alignment method is developed to cancel the mismatch-induced static offset. A frame-by-frame scheme is also proposed for further offset reduction. A prototype receiver is fabricated in a 0. 35 micron CMOS process, with all major building blocks included. The front-end consists of a differential LNA and a quadrature harmonic mixer. In the base-band, an AGC circuit provides over 30 dB gain tuning range. The channel selection is done by a 5 th order gyrator filter. The demodulator is formed by a l-level zero-crossing interpolator, clock recovery circuits and decision logics. Main functions of the receiver has been verified...|$|R
