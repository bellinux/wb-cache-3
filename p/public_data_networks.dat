The interaction of Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and the international standards now being developed is discussed. A provisional architecture model is {{used as the basis}} for discussion, SNA and is compared to each level of the model. SNA and emerging international standards by F. P. Corr and D. H. Neal The successful adaptation of telephone networks to data trans-mission has fostered two decades of rapid growth in data process-ing systems using telecommunications facilities. To augment the telephony base, new public networks {{are now being}} designed specifically for data communications. The international scope and technological aspects of these new services have been de-scribed elsewhere in this issue by Halsey, Hardy, and Powning. ' As a sequel, this paper examines the new services from the per-spectives of emerging international standards and IBM'S Systems Network Architecture (SNA). A provisional architecture model ' is used as a framework for discussion, illustrating the respective roles played by <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>networks,</b> the emerging interface standards, and SNA. The roles of SNA and the new interfaces differ, and in some cases, overlapping functional capability occurs. However, there is a complementary intenvorking of SNA with the <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>networks</b> employing the new interfaces. Beginning with a broad outline of the provisional seven-layered architecture model, the paper proceeds to a level-by-level com-parison of SNA and the model.

As early as the 1960 s, private companies started to connect their local computers. As a result, small private computer networks started to emerge. As the state company offering general access to public services in telephony, the PTT strove to develop a <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network,</b> accessible to every user and telephone subscriber. This ambition was realized with Datanet 1, the <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network</b> which was officially opened in 1982.

The large-scale application of Datanet in public municipal administration serves as a case study for the development of data communication in practice, that shows that there was a gradual migration from X- 25 to TCP/IP protocols.
