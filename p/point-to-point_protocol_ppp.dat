50|$|In {{computer}} networking, the Link Control Protocol (LCP) forms {{part of the}} <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>PPP),</b> {{within the}} family of Internet protocols.

50|$|Unlike {{commercial}} Internet service providers, free-nets originally provided direct terminal-based dialup, {{instead of}} other networked connections, such as <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>PPP).</b> The development of Internet access with cheaper and faster connections, and {{the advent of}} the World-Wide Web made the original free-net community concept obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> over Ethernet (PPPoE) is {{a network}} <b>protocol</b> for {{encapsulating}} <b>PPP</b> frames inside Ethernet frames. It appeared in 1999, {{in the context}} of the boom of DSL as the solution for tunneling packets over the DSL connection to the ISP's IP network, and from there to the rest of the Internet. A 2005 networking book noted that [...] "Most DSL providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, encryption, and compression." [...] Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, predominately via the PAP protocol and less often via CHAP.|$|R

50|$|Another type of dialer is a {{computer}} program which creates {{a connection to the}} Internet or another computer network over the analog telephone or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) network. Many operating systems already contain such a program for connections through the <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>PPP),</b> such as WvDial.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} establishing consistency of code implementing a network protocol {{with respect to the}} documentation as a standard RFC. The problem is formulated as a refinement checking between two models, the implementation extracted from code and the specification extracted from RFC. After simplifications based on assumeguarantee reasoning, and automatic construction of witness modules to deal with the hidden specification state, the refinement checking problem reduces to checking transition invariants. The methodology is illustrated on two case-studies involving popular network <b>protocols,</b> namely, <b>PPP</b> (<b>point-to-point</b> <b>protocol</b> for establishing connections remotely) and DHCP (dynamic-host-configuration-protocol for configuration management in mobile networks). We also present a symbolic implementation of a reduction scheme based on compressing internal transitions in a hierarchical manner, and demonstrate the resulting savings for refinement checking in terms of memory size. ...|$|R
50|$|Protocols {{are used}} mainly by <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>PPP)</b> servers to {{validate}} the identity of remote clients before granting them access to server data. Most of them are using a password as {{the cornerstone of the}} authentication. The password has to be shared between the communicating entities in advance.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{computer}} networking, {{data to be}} transmitted is the payload, but is almost always encapsulated in some type of a [...] "frame" [...] composed of framing bits and a frame check sequence. [...] Examples are Ethernet frames, <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>PPP)</b> frames, Fibre Channel frames, and V.42 modem frames.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, <b>Point-to-Point</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>PPP)</b> is a {{data link}} layer (layer 2) communications protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes. It connects two routers directly without any host or any other networking device in between.
