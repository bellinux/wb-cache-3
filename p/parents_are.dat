5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii.

Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them.

Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
