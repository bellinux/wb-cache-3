50|$|When {{installed}} in a tank, the R-975 {{did not have the}} benefit of being cooled by an air slipstream or <b>propeller</b> <b>blast,</b> so a cooling fan was attached to the power shaft and surrounded by a shroud to provide the same effect.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} is suspended using fibreglass axles. The tailwheel is steerable. The controls are conventional three-axis and include full-span ailerons. The large, flat-plate triangular windshield protects the pilot from the <b>propeller</b> <b>blast</b> and has distinctive cut-outs for the rudder pedals.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1954, the U.S. Marines {{experimented with}} helicopter-deliverable {{geodesic}} domes. A 30-foot wood and plastic geodesic dome was lifted and carried by helicopter at 50 knots without damage, {{leading to the}} manufacture of a standard magnesium dome by Magnesium Products of Milwaukee. Tests included assembly practices in which previously untrained Marines were able to assemble a 30-foot magnesium dome in 135 minutes, helicopter lifts off aircraft carriers, and a durability test in which an anchored dome successfully withstood a day-long 120 mph <b>propeller</b> <b>blast</b> from the twin 3,000 horsepower engines of an anchored airplane without damage.|$|E
50|$|Bart Spadaro (founder of the airport) died October 5, 2013, {{at which}} time Susan Spadaro (Bart's daughter) had assumed control of the airport. Since then, {{aviation}} services such as aircraft maintenance, aircraft repair, aircraft inspections, aircraft rentals, flight instruction, sightseeing, etc. were no longer available at this facility. Skydiving operations continued {{at the airport and}} were provided by an independent operator. Airport maintenance was the removal of debris {{around the perimeter of the}} airport as well as removal of abandoned vehicles and hangars. The dirt taxiway was not very well maintained. The segmented circle was typically overgrown with weeds and was not visible during warmer months. There were no wind sock, flags or any other devices on the field to indicate wind direction or wind speed. The asphalt runway surface was in generally good condition although there was a pothole near the beginning of runway 18 on the right side. Markings for runway 18 were faded to the point of no longer being visible. Adjacent to the runway was mostly bare sandy ground that was prone to creating dust clouds and flung gravel in the presence of <b>propeller</b> <b>blast.</b> Susan Spadaro is not known to hold any credentials in the field of aviation. As of 2016, the airport is closed to operations. The town of Brookhaven decided to shut down the airport, due to failure of pilots to action the noise abatement procedures established by the town, bringing a series of complaints that led to its closure, as well as the closure of Lufker Airport for three months.|$|E
