40|$|Isometric {{exercise}} (IE) {{has been}} shown to lower blood pressure (BP). Using equipment with force output displays, intensity is usually regulated at 30 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC); however, the cost of programmable equipment and their requirement for maximal contractions presents limitations. A simple, cost-effective alternative deserves investigation. The {{purpose of this study was}} (1) to explore the relationship between %MVC, change in systolic BP (ΔSBP), and perceived exertion (CR- 10) and (2) to assess the validity of self-regulation of intensity during isometric hand-grip exercise. Fourteen pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults completed eight, 2 -min isometric hand-grip exercises at randomised intensities; participants estimated their perceived exertion at 30 -s intervals (estimation task). Subsequently, on three separate occasions, participants performed four 2 -min contractions at an exertion level that they perceived to be equivalent to CR- 10 "Level- 6 " (production task). There were significant linear relationships between the estimated exertion on the CR- 10 scale, and ΔSBP (r[*]=[*] 0. 784) and %MVC (r[*]=[*] 0. 845). Level- 6 was equivalent to an average ΔSBP of 38  mmHg (95 % CI; 44, 32  mmHg) and a relative force of 33 % MVC (95 % CI; 36. 2, 30 %). During the production task, %MVC was not significantly different between the estimation task and each <b>production</b> <b>trial.</b> In at least the first two repetitions of each <b>production</b> <b>trial,</b> ΔSBP was significantly lower than that observed in the estimation task. These findings show that CR- 10 "Level- 6 " is an appropriate method of self-regulating isometric hand-grip intensity; its use offers an affordable and accessible alternative for isometric exercise prescription aimed at reducing BP...|$|E

40|$|The newest EN 1563 {{standard}} about {{ductile iron}} castings {{was published in}} 2011. The standard contains three new solid solution strengthened ferritic ductile iron grades: 450 – 18, 500 – 14 and 600 – 10. There are some studies for laboratory scale SSF samples, but very few studies about actual full scale SSF ductile iron production. The objective of this thesis was to gain more insight about the specifics of SSF ductile iron production. The theory portion of this thesis consists of a literature survey that focuses on cast iron metallurgy, ductile iron melt processes and cooling curve analysis of cast irons. The experimental part of this thesis consists of two <b>production</b> <b>trials</b> of 600 – 10 ductile iron and several linked cooling curve analyses and solidification simulations. The <b>production</b> <b>trials</b> were not completely successful. Different separately cast tensile test bars showed properties above and below standard requirements.
