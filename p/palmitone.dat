40|$|Crude and hexane leaf {{extracts}} of Apama tomentosa (Aristolochiaceae) showed {{inhibitory effect}} on ovarian adenocarcinoma (CaOV- 3) cells cultured in vitro with IC 50 of 46. 13 Â± 1. 09 Âµg/ml and 18. 50 Â± 0. 50 Âµg/ml respectively. The crude extract exerted a mild inhibitory effect on {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs). Hexane extract and <b>palmitone</b> did not exert any {{significant effect on}} the PBMC proliferation. Subsequent isolation of the leaf extract led to the isolation and identification of <b>palmitone</b> (16 -hentriacontanone). This compound exhibited inhibitory effect (IC 50 = 17. 70 Â± 1. 86 Âµg/ml) on CaOV- 3 but was ineffective on PBMCs. This plant compound can potentially help to treat ovarian cancer...|$|E
40|$|Thermal and {{catalytic}} conversions of {{palm oil}} were investigated at 693 K. The conversions of acetic acid and ethyl acetate {{in the gas}} phase were also investigated over the same catalysts as model reactions. The acido-basicity of the catalysts was assessed by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. Oxide catalysts slightly decrease the liquid yield, but allow the strong reduction of the production of saponifiable compounds, including fatty acids, in the liquid. The basic catalyst calcined hydrotalcite {{is the most effective}} in reducing saponifiables, but produces big amounts of heavy ketones (stearone and <b>palmitone)</b> according to its high activity in acid and ester ketonization. The Lewis acid catalysts alumina (strong) and Na-faujasite (weak) favor decarboxylation reaction, producing hydrocarbon rich liquids with significant amounts of olefins. The Brønsted acid catalyst H-ZSM- 5 zeolite produces liquids richest in paraffins with some aromatics. However, the volatility range of the produced liquids is quite broad...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDNatural {{products}} {{have been a}} source of many pharmaceutical drugs and a number of drugs that are currently used in the treatment of cancer are derivatives of compounds originally isolated from natural products. There is evidence that extracts of Tulbaghia violacea can be used to treat cancer. The activation of apoptosis in cancer cells is a target for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs since one of the characteristics of cancer cells is resistance to apoptosis due to the deregulation of biochemical pathways leading to apoptosis. In fact, many current anti-cancer drugs exert their effects through the activation of apoptosis. Previous studies showed that extracts of T. violacea induce apoptosis in cancer cells and one study reported on the isolation of a compound (methyl-ԃ-D-glucopyranoside), which is responsible for the pro-apoptotic activity of the T. violacea extract. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the anti-cancer activity of methyl-ԃ-Dglucopyranoside and extracts prepared from T. violacea. In this study the pro-apoptotic activity of methyl-ԃ-D-glucopyranoside and extracts prepared from T. violacea were investigated on a panel of human cancer cell lines, which included HepG 2, MCF 7, H 157, HT 29 and the non-cancerous cell line, KMST 6. The induction of apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using several bioassays which measures biochemical events (caspase activation, phosphatidylserine externalisation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that is associated with the induction of apoptosis. The results demonstrated that the effects of methyl--D-glucopyranoside on cultured cells are transient and that the cells recover from the effects of methyl--D-glucopyranoside. This suggested thatmethyl-ԃ-D-glucopyranoside is not the compound responsible for the pro-apoptotic bioactivity in the T. violacea extract. This study also showed that cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic bioactivity of the leaf-extract was significantly higher in comparison to the tuber-extract. The bioactivity of the organic solvent extracts (dichloromethane, hexane, methanol and 50 % methanol/water) of T. violacea leaves was also significantly higher than water extracts of T. violacea leaves. A comparison of the different organic extracts prepared from the T. violacea leaves showed that the highest activity was observed for the dichloromethane and hexane extracts. In an effort to identify the bioactive compound(s) the dichloromethane extract was subjected to Versaflash® column chromatography. However, due to problems experienced with the solubility of the dichloromethane sub-fractions, these compounds could not be tested for their bioactivity. <b>Palmitone</b> (16 -hentriacontanone) was identified as one of the major compounds present in the dichloromethane sub-fractions. This compound was previously shown to have anticonvulsant bioactivity but there is no evidence in the literature that it has anti-cancer or pro-apoptotic activities. Fingerprinting of the methanol extract showed the presence of long chain fatty acid derivatives, flavonoids and allicin derivatives in the methanol extract. Although, this study failed to isolate the pro-apoptotic bioactive compound(s) present in the extracts of T. violacea, it confirmed that extracts of this plant induce apoptosis in cultured human cancer cell lines...|$|E
