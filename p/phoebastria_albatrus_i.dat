40|$|Minimizing bycatch of seabirds is a {{major goal}} of the U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service. In Alaska waters, the bycatch (i. e., {{inadvertent}} catches) of seabirds has been an incidental result of demersal groundfish longline fishery operations. Notably, the endangered short-tailed albatross (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus)</b> has been taken in this groundfish fishery. Bycatch rates of seabirds from individual vessels may be of particular interest because vessels with high bycatch rates may not be functioning effectively with seabird avoidance gears, {{and there may be}} a need for suggestions on how to use these avoidance gears more effectively. Therefore, bycatch estimates are usually made on an individual vessel basis and then summed to obtain the total estimate for the entire fleet...|$|R

The short-tailed albatross <b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus</b> once numbered in the millions but was thought to be extinct by the mid 20 th century. Albatrosses, of the family Diomedeidae, are among the most threatened birds globally as a result of commercial exploitation, introduced predators, and mortality in commercial fisheries. We applied an experimental approach over 5 years to evaluate the translocation and hand-rearing of albatross chicks by comparing growth, physiological health indices, post-fledging survival, and migration patterns with a control group of naturally reared chicks in the source population. Hand-reared chicks had comparable or superior health and similar rates of immediate post-fledging mortality (15...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} impact of longline fisheries on Albatross populations has been a concern (Croxall, 1998) since Weimerskirch et al. (1997) documented the detrimental effect of long-line fisheries on the population dynamics of the wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans. Accidental by-catch of individuals of the three North Pacific albatross species (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus,</b> P. immutabilis and P. nigripes) has also raised concerns {{on the impact of}} by-catch at the population level in these three species. In particular, Cousins and Cooper (1999) reviewed the available knowledge on population biology of the Black-footed Albatross, to determine if by-catch by longline fisheries was detrimental to the species. Similar concerns exist for Laysan Albatross P. immutabilis. The purpose of the present project is to develop integrated population modeling for Black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes) and Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) albatross populations to assess whether past and present levels of by-catch are likely to affect significantly the populations of these species. The first step of the project will review the information existing on demographic parameters, and proceed with further analyses whenever needed. In the second phase, we will develop a Leslie matrix model (Caswell 2001), that wil...|$|R
40|$|Albatrosses (Diomedeidae) do {{not occur}} in the North Atlantic Ocean today except as vagrants, {{although}} five species {{were present in the}} early Pliocene. No fossil breeding sites of albatrosses were known previously. The timing of extinction of albatrosses in the North Atlantic was likewise unknown. Deposits that formed near present-day sea level along the southeastern shore of Bermuda contain remains of a former breeding colony and include intact eggshells and bones of embryos, juveniles, and adults of Short-tailed Albatross (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus),</b> a critically endangered species now confined to a few islets in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. These deposits are correlated with the middle Pleistocene Lower Town Hill Formation, which at other sites have a radiometric age of ≈ 405, 000 years ago. This equates with the marine isotope stage 11 interglacial, which culminated in a rise in sea-level to >+ 20 m. Bones of a juvenile Short-tailed Albatross were also found in beach deposits at + 21. 3 m from this same interglacial. We interpret the extirpation of albatrosses on Bermuda as probably resulting from lack of nesting sites protected from storm surges over the little emergent land that remained {{at the height of the}} marine isotope stage 11 sea level rise...|$|R
40|$|The short-tailed (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus),</b> black-footed (P. nigripes) and Laysan {{albatrosses}} (P. immutabilis), all {{native to}} the North Pacific, interact with demersal and pelagic longline vessels and may on occasion be caught by a baited hook and drown. This problem has been studied in detail for 105 - 115 pelagic longline vessels home-ported in Hawaii, which take between 1, 000 - 2, 000 each of both black-footed and Laysan albatrosses each year. No takes of short-tailed albatrosses have been reported for the Hawaii longline fishery, but between 1993 and 1997, {{a total of five}} birds have been incidentally caught in the Alaska longline fisheries. The black-footed and Laysan albatrosses are most vulnerable to longline fishing for broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius), where longlines are set near the surface providing ample opportunity for albatrosses to intercept baited hooks. Studies of the rarer black-footed albatross population revealed fishery induced mortality to be a chronic rather than catastrophic source of mortality. Some simple mitigation methods implemented in the fishery should reduce the incidental catch of albatross by an order of magnitude and eventually lead to negligible take levels. However, the Hawaii-based longline vessels targeting swordfish represents {{only a small fraction of}} pelagic longline effort in the North Pacific and albatrosses will continue to be taken by Japanese...|$|R
40|$|Final Biological Opinion {{based on}} our review of the {{proposed}} construction of a harbor at the Little South America-South site in Unalaska, as modified, {{and its effects on}} the Steller’s eider (Polysticta stelleri) in accordance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U. S. C. 1531 et seq.). On March 30, 2007, we received notification that harbor location had been moved approximately 15 meters further off shore to reduce the volume of dredged material and to avoid blasting activities in the nearshore environment. While we determined that the proposed modifications to the project fall within the scope of analysis of the existing biological opinion, we have updated population estimates for the Steller’s eider and listed the southwestern distinct population segment of the northern sea otter (Enhydra lutris kenyonii) as threatened. Consequently, we revised the life history and analysis of effects for both of these species. Our reanalysis did not result in any changes to our take estimate or terms and conditions. This letter provides only a summary of the findings included in the Biological Opinion, where a complete discussion of the effects analysis can be found. Also considered in this Biological Opinion are the potential effects of the proposed action on the short-tailed albatross (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus).</b> This Biological Opinion is based on information provided in the Biological Assessments for th...|$|R
40|$|Extended Abstract: The short-tailed {{albatross}} (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus),</b> one {{of three}} northern hemisphere albatrosses, is listed as an endangered species under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. The species is known to breed in only two locations. The main colony, where 80 % of the birds breed, is located on a fluvial outwash plain of an active volcanic island, Torishima, {{off the coast of}} Japan. The other known breeding site is in the Senkakus, an island chain claimed by Japan, Taiwan, and mainland China, which may contain notable oil reserves. Short-tailed albatrosses are very much at home in the ocean; in fact, after fledging, they remain at sea for 5 – 6 years before returning to land to breed. The mature birds develop a white head and golden cape; younger birds go through various darker plumage phases. Available evidence indicates that there were millions of short-tailed albatrosses up until the late 1800 s. By many accounts, they were the most numerous albatross species in the North Pacific. Between 1885 and 1903, an estimated 5 million birds were harvested from the breeding colony on Torishima. The birds were harvested for their feathers and fat, their bodies were used for fertilizer, and their eggs were collected for food. By 1949, there were no short-tailed albatrosses breeding at any historically known sites, and the species was believed to be extinct...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Short-tailed {{albatrosses}} (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus,</b> hereafter "STAL") migrate {{throughout the}} North Pacific, overlapping with multiple large scale fisheries. In the Bering Sea, documented bycatch {{of this species}} is a focal conservation concern, {{due to the fact}} that this species is listed as "endangered" under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. We conducted the first year-round tracking study of immature (≤ 3 years) STAL, an understudied age class, between 2008 and 2012. We quantify seasonal distributions and fisheries associations. Our findings highlight regional differences in distributions and areas of high vessel associations within the Bering Sea. We examined travel distances across seasons and bird demographics, seasonal ranges of birds, and whether core use areas differed among ages, sexes, or source colonies. Source colonies include Torishima, the main STAL colony, and an anticipated new colony on Mukojima where birds were translocated and hand-reared. Linear mixed models (LMM) were used to evaluate travel distances across temporal and demographic (sex, age, and source colony) variables. Kernel density estimations (KDE) were used to quantify range and core areas. These areas were further analyzed using overlap indices. Regional variations were found in core areas of sexes and age classes. Moreover, STAL in first year of flight have a broader distribution than other ages, which may suggest a period of learning foraging skills or exploratory movements. We also found no concerning differences in year-round distributions between colonies (which included translocated and non-translocated birds), and documented via satellite tracking an initial return to Mukojima by a three year old translocated bird. In the Bering Sea, we examined seasonal distributions and STAL association with Bering Sea/Aleutian Island fisheries. Associations (defined here as STAL locations within 2 hours and 10 kilometers from a vessel setting gear), were quantified spatially and examined with a LMM. STAL-vessel associations occurred year round but predominately during summer and fall months along shelf-break and near canyon habitats. Additionally, the relative abundance of associations with longline vessels vs. other gear types increased from summer to fall, when most STAL bycatch was documented. While greater vessel associations and one bycatch event did occur within STAL high use areas, STAL bycatch during this study period occurred in areas of low longline association. We also did not find variations in fisheries association between translocated and non-translocated STAL...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 This study {{developed}} a strategic conservation {{project for the}} Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon focusing on a signature species and this aquarium’s conservation focus areas (i. e., marine debris, sustainable fisheries, water quality, climate change). This study also examined the potential for incorporating an ecotourism or wildlife tourism component to enhance this project and provide visitors with a unique field experience. The first phase involved species identification using database analysis and informal interviews with Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) staff, research institutions, and government agencies. The second phase focused on suggestions for implementation based on these discussions and an internal stakeholder meeting with aquarium staff to assess institutional support for identified projects. This second phase also included input from the tourism industry to examine the potential for incorporating a field experience into the project to help generate personal connections with the environment, inspire public stewardship, and mitigate impacts in coastal areas. Main objectives were to: (a) determine how and where this aquarium could best {{meet the needs of}} local species and ecosystems, (b) identify any preferred AZA methods for development of a conservation project, and (c) explore the potential for incorporating a tourism related field experience to enhance the project. The database analysis identified 23 potential species for the project, and identification criteria subsequently refined the list (e. g., species conservation status; Phase I). Interviews revealed three overarching themes: (a) what this aquarium’s conservation project should be and how it should be implemented, (b) project research and development, and (c) incorporating a field experience. Many respondents suggested species listed within the database analysis, including rockfish and sea otters. AZA interviewees reported benefits of focusing on a species housed on-site at the aquarium. Although there are no existing AZA protocols for developing a strategic conservation project, this organization’s accreditation questionnaire was recommended as a guide. Researchers who were interviewed also noted the importance of incorporating key stakeholder groups (e. g., fishing community) and policies into the plan. All interviewed groups agreed that database analyses of federally listed species coupled with interviews with stakeholders are important for creating a baseline for project identification. Respondents from the AZA and tourism industry favored incorporating a field experience into the project for providing benefits such as project enhancement and marketing. Some interviewees, however, were concerned about necessary resources (e. g., funding) and potential competition among industries for attracting tourists. These findings were reported to aquarium staff during a meeting (Phase II) where it was observed that internal consensus of project goals and objectives had not yet been reached. Regardless, staff interest in conservation of rockfish, North Pacific Albatross, and sea otters were taken into consideration during final project assessment. Based on these results, the primary project recommended to this aquarium is North Pacific Albatrosses, including laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis), black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes), and short-tailed albatross (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus).</b> The alternative project focuses on sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Recommendations for project implementation and measurement are also provided and based on a content analysis of existing conservation projects and management initiatives for these subjects (e. g., U. S Fish and Wildlife Species Conservation Plans). Suggestions for a field component related to each project are also included...|$|R
40|$|The {{offshore}} {{waters and}} the coastline of Oregon provide year-round habitat {{for a number}} of birds, marine mammals, sea turtles, and possibly bats, at least fifteen of which are federally listed as threatened or endangered. Previous workshops on offshore renewable energy have provided baseline information on the distribution and abundance of these species on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). There are varying amounts of baseline information for offshore species; however, seasonal variability and relative abundance are generally known at a broad scale. Sea turtles are subtropical and tropical breeders and all species found on the Pacific OCS are uncommon north of Mexico. Sea turtles that occur in the waters off of Oregon are primarily leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea); however, loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtles could also occur. All of these species are listed as either threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA); there is designated Critical Habitat for the leatherback sea turtle off the Oregon coast. Sea turtles are drawn to offshore waters during the summer upwelling period where they feed on a variety of pelagic and benthic organisms. A diversity of marine mammals occur offshore of Oregon including 24 species of cetaceans and 6 species of pinnipeds. Sea otters are rare, but stragglers from Washington are occasionally seen along the Oregon coast. Among the cetaceans seen in Oregon waters, the north Pacific right (Eubalaena japonica), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), sei (Balaenoptera borealis), humpback (Megaptera novaengliae), killer (Orcinus orca), and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) whales are listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA. Federally listed pinnipeds include the Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi) and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), the latter of which also has designated Critical Habitat off the Oregon coast. Little is known about the offshore movement of bats on the Pacific OCS, but observations from the Farallon Islands off San Francisco have regularly recorded the presence of the migratory hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) during migration periods. Modeling has shown that hoary bat arrivals and departures correlate with low wind speeds, low moon illumination, and relatively high degrees of cloud cover. In addition, low barometric pressure predicted arrivals. The status of bats offshore has received little to no attention and study is needed to determine their presence on the Pacific OCS. Marine birds occur widely on the Pacific OCS off Oregon. Nearshore areas are inhabited by a variety of species of sea ducks, loons, grebes, cormorants, pelicans, gulls, terns, and several alcids. Deepwater areas 8 - 35 miles offshore and beyond are inhabited by albatrosses, shearwaters, petrels, storm-petrels, skuas, jaegers, alcids, and pelagic shorebirds, gulls and terns. Federally listed species under the ESA that have been extensively monitored and studied along the Oregon coast include the Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus nivosus) and Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus). As studies reveal more information about the population status and movements of the endangered Short-tailed Albatross (<b>Phoebastria</b> <b>albatrus)</b> and Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), we are finding that these species are rare, but regular off the Oregon coast at specific times of the year. Previous workshops on offshore renewable energy have also described the potential effects that the construction and operation of energy devices could have on these taxonomic groups. Activities that can have effects on these species include construction and operational activities, vessel traffic, seismic surveys, foundation and cable installation, turbine operation, foundation protection, and the ongoing presence of cables. Resulting effects include collision and entanglement, barotrauma (particularly for bats), prey base and habitat alteration, trash ingestion (particularly for sea turtles), displacement, movement barriers, electromagnetic field effects, light attraction, pollution, and noise impacts. Renewable energy conferences and workshops have identified knowledge and data gaps {{that need to be addressed}} to inform the planning and regulating of commercial-scale projects on the Pacific OCS. Gaps identified for sea turtles include understanding their seasonal use of the OCS particularly for post-hatchling stages; noise and EMF effects; and comprehensive population estimates; the latter will be difficult to assess due to the turtles’ solitary nature and wide distribution. Gaps identified for marine mammals include information on site-specific baseline data on occurrence, distribution, and behavior; site-specific acoustic effects on species with low frequency sensitivity; baseline information on migration routes and home ranges; impacts on gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus); monitoring to understand interactions between marine mammals and renewable energy devices; and acoustic-related effects. Gaps identified for marine birds include site-specific spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of birds at sea; nocturnal activity; important areas of bird activity that should be avoided; important migration patterns; potential effects on seabird prey; energetic consequences; and effects of EMF, noise, lights and structures, and collision risk. Sensitivity analysis and decision support tools have also been identified as necessary to assess the risk to marine birds. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Environmental Studies Program has funded a variety of seabird and marine mammal studies to collect baseline information and assess the effects of conventional and renewable energy projects on the Pacific OCS. Recently completed studies focused on renewable energy include a summary of knowledge of select areas of the Pacific coast, an analysis of the effects of EMFs from undersea power cables on marine species, and protocols for baseline studies and monitoring for ocean renewable energy. A number of additional studies focused on renewable energy are underway or proposed, several of which should eliminate some of the identified knowledge and data gaps. These include aerial surveys of seabirds and marine mammals off the Pacific Northwest, assessing vulnerability of marine birds to offshore renewable energy devices, data synthesis and high-resolution predictive modeling of marine bird distributions in the Pacific, and several others. In addition, there are pilot studies in the Atlantic that are assessing and testing technologies that could be used for surveying and monitoring birds, bats, marine mammals, and sea turtles in the Pacific...|$|R
