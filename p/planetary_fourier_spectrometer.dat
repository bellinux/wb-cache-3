The PIFTS breadboard was developed under prior PIDDP funding. That effort is described in the final report for NASA Grant NAG 5 - 6248 and in two conference papers (Sromovsky et al. 2000; Revercomb et al. 2000). The PIFTS breadboard was designed for near-IR (1 - 5. 2 micrometer imaging of planetary targets with spectral resolving powers of several hundred to several thousand, using an InSb detector array providing at least 64 x 64 pixels imaging detail. The major focus of the development effort was to combine existing technologies to produce a small and low power design compatible with a very low mass flyable instrument. The objective of this grant (NAG 5 - 10729) was further characterization of the breadboard performance, including intercomparisons with the highly accurate non-imaging Advanced Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) (Revercomb et al. 1994; Best et al. 1997) ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{study with}} the <b>Planetary</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> in the Mars Express {{spacecraft}} found possible methane in three areas of Mars, {{one of which was}} in Arabia. One possible source of methane is from the metabolism of living bacteria. [...] However, a recent study indicates that to match the observations of methane, there must be something that quickly destroys the gas, otherwise it would be spread all through the atmosphere instead of being concentrated in just a few locations. There may be something in the soil that oxidizes the gas before it has a chance to spread. If this is so, that same chemical would destroy organic compounds, thus life would be very difficult on Mars.|$|E
50|$|On March 2004, Professor Vittorio Formisano, the {{researcher}} {{in charge of}} the Mars Express <b>Planetary</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>Spectrometer,</b> announced the discovery of methane in the Martian atmosphere. However, methane cannot persist in the Martian atmosphere {{for more than a few}} hundred years since it can be broken down by sunlight. Thus, this discovery suggests that the methane is being continually replenished by some unidentified volcanic or geologic process, or that some kind of extremophile life form similar to some existing on Earth is metabolising carbon dioxide and hydrogen and producing methane. In July 2004, rumours began to circulate that Formisano would announce the discovery of ammonia at an upcoming conference. It later came to light that none had been found; in fact some noted that the PFS was not precise enough to distinguish ammonia from carbon dioxide anyway.|$|E
