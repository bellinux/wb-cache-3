5|$|The game {{does not}} feature an inventory, and neither health packs nor ammo can be stockpiled.

5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a <b>predetermined</b> pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is <b>predetermined.</b> The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{hundred and}} eighty-four genes of eight {{eukaryotic}} genomes for mitochondrial anion carriers were sorted into 43 (+ 18 single protein) subfamilies. Subfamilies differ by the number, nature, and locations of charges and polar residues in the transmembrane α-helices. Consequently, these residues and the rarely unique residues {{of the matrix}} and cytosolic segments most likely determine the different molecular phenotypes (functions). ‘Common ancestral hydrophilic segments’ were found in matrix and cytosolic segments, with interchangeable polar residues. Thus the hydrophobic microstructures of hydrophilic carrier parts are supposed to <b>predetermine</b> structure/conformation, whereas polar and charged microstructures should <b>predetermine</b> function, namely in the transmembrane spanning α-helices...|$|R
5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in <b>predetermined</b> locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was also concerned about the restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E
