5|$|Keegan took Newcastle to two {{consecutive}} runners-up finishes {{in the league}} in 1995–96 and 1996–97, coming very close to winning the title in the former season. This success was in part due to the talent of <b>players</b> <b>like</b> David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £15million.|$|E

5|$|The Giants regressed to a 5–11 {{record in}} 1995. Much {{of the blame}} for the Giants' poor {{performance}} was placed on Brown. He put up lackluster numbers for the second straight year.

For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon said {{one of the reasons for}} Italy's early exit was due to the lack of creative <b>players</b> <b>like</b> Totti in the team.|$|E

As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Predrag Mijatović.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Iginla was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} NHL's most prominent power forwards. Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate <b>players</b> <b>like</b> Brendan Shanahan and Keith Tkachuk, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only Jaromír Jágr scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.|$|E
