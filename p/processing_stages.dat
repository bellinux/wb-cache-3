2500|$|Feature {{detection}} is {{the ability}} to extract biologically relevant information from combinations of sensory signals. [...] In the visual system, for example, sensory receptors in the retina of the eye are only individually capable of detecting [...] "points of light" [...] in the outside world. [...] Second-level visual neurons receive input from groups of primary receptors, higher-level neurons receive input from groups of second-level neurons, and so on, forming a hierarchy of <b>processing</b> <b>stages.</b> [...] At each stage, important information is extracted from the signal ensemble and unimportant information is discarded. [...] By the end of the process, input signals representing [...] "points of light" [...] have been transformed into a neural representation of objects in the surrounding world and their properties. [...] The most sophisticated sensory processing occurs inside the brain, but complex feature extraction also takes place in the spinal cord and in peripheral sensory organs such as the retina.|$|E
