40|$|In {{this work}} {{possible}} energy savings were investigated by introducing a new layout of a 2 -zone <b>progressive</b> <b>kiln.</b> The layout consisted of installing a door {{between the first}} and second zone, thereby allowing the two zones to be run at different temperature levels -making internal heat recovery possible. An Optimized Two Stage continuous kiln is dimensioned for drying sideboard of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) with the aid of a commercial simulation program. Temperature levels of 75 / 55 °C (dry bulb/wet bulb) were chosen at the pressure side of zone 1 and 45 / 25 °C (dry bulb/wet bulb) at the pressure side of zone 2. The capacity of the heat exchanger was assumed to be sufficient to make the suggested design functional and no consideration was given to the increased air flow resistance the introduction of the heat exchanger would cause. The results indicated that roughly 30 % of the heat is possible to recover in comparison to a traditional kiln. It was finally concluded that the influence of ingoing process parameters needs to be implemented in the kiln control system to fully utilize the kilns potential.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} has been to develop a {{computer}} based simulation model for the timber drying process in progressive kilns and to use this model for {{an analysis of the}} process, with special emphasis on energy and cost efficient drying. The software, TorksimLC, is based on the same principles as our corresponding models for batch kilns. In this way direct comparisons between different drying methods can be made. TorksimLC includes both the single stage and the both common types of two stage progressive kilns. The software has been verified and validated based on experimental results from drying tests in full scale. The model accuracy {{has been shown to be}} comparable to the accuracy of the corresponding models for batch kilns. It is judged that this accuracy is sufficient for industrial analyses at the sawmills. The analysis of the drying process has clearly shown that the temperature level, at which the drying is performed, has an utmost importance regarding both the energy consumption and the drying costs. Even a small increase in the temperature level has a positive effect. A comparison of different types of dryers has shown that two stage progressive kilns are more cost efficient than single stage kilns, although the energy consumption is about the same. Compared to batch kilns the progressive kilns require longer drying times but both the energy consumption and the drying costs are clearly lower. The progressive kilns have a good potential for both energy and cost efficient timber drying. Progressive kilns can not in all respects replace the batch kilns, but it seems that this potential is not fully utilised today.

40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from chamber kilns with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate chamber kilns with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot kiln. The conditioning chamber opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the spray line must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough. Finally the control system to support the kiln operator in his daily work must be developed with more functions when adding a conditioning chamber to the <b>progressive</b> <b>kiln.</b> This system should give some guidance of how to adjust the climate in the conditioning chamber when changing board-dimensions to be able to achieve a good accuracy around the target moisture...|$|E
40|$|The {{sorption}} isotherms of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) wood were determined. The {{experiments were}} carried out for wood previously dried in industrial batch and <b>progressive</b> <b>kilns</b> according to various drying schedules. The experiments per-formed {{made it possible to}} determine the influence of different drying technologies, as well as parameters, on the sorption characteristics of kiln-dried Scots pine wood. The relationship between the sorption hysteresis and changes in the moisture con-tent of seasoned wood was found. Practical guidelines for equalizing the spread of the final moisture content of individual boards forming a stack were proposed...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to increase the yield of first-class exterior cladding by improving the drying process. Secondary objectives was to investigate how the drying process at AB Hilmer Andersson works today {{and how it can}} be improved to get better drying results and thereby yields. The work has been performed at AB Hilmer Andersson, a sawmill / planing mill located in western Värmland. The end product of the yield measurement was measured on sawed rectangular spruce panel 19 x 148, sawn from planks with dimensions 63 x 150. The work began with interviews to find out what is problematic with the drying and which drying damages that is most common at AB Hilmer Andersson. The most common problems was poorly sticked packages, kilns are not charged accurate and that the conditioning equipment was not working. The most common drying damages was warping and cracking. Through theoretical studies of drying solutions to drying damages were identified, and new drying schedules were developed to compare with existing drying. The new schedules had gentler drying to achieve less tension in the wood and therefore less cracking and warping. The problem of sticking was solved by modifying the stacking of the green sorting. Some of the poor recharging of the kilns was solved by a larger compressor to make the pressure frames move more accurate. The main conclusions are as follows; It was not worth the cost of an expensive drying process in relation to the economic benefit, they should continue with <b>progressive</b> <b>kiln</b> drying on wood that is to be split. Drying is very seasonal so in the dry season in March-June, dryer operator must be extra careful and plan the drying so that no timber may be left outdoors for long. The drying operator must get instructions about the saw planning in time so he knows which end products the sawn goods will be. Stacking and packing {{is an important part of}} the drying process and must be correct for good drying results and therefore, the staff must be careful with the maintenance and report errors immediately. The focus needs to be reversed from that only getting the timber into the dryer to dry after which final product the current timber is going to be ie after the end quality to be achieved and how the timber should be treated after dryingValiderat; 20120109 (anonymous...|$|E
