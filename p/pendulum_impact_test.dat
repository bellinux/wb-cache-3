30|$|Few authors {{dealt with}} the use of fiber {{reinforced}} polymers in concrete barriers. Maheu and Bakht (1994) developed a new barrier wall using GFRP, New Fiber Composite Material for Reinforcing Concrete (NEFMAC) grids, with connection to the deck slab by means of double-headed tension bars of steel spaced at 300  mm. This new barrier wall system was adopted in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CSA 2006 a). El-Salakawy et al. (2003) tested to-collapse PL- 2 and PL- 3 barrier walls reinforced with low-modulus GFRP bars. They conducted <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> (El-Salakawy et al. 2005) on the developed barriers in lieu of vehicle crash testing. In 2007, El-Gamal et al. (2007) conducted <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> on PL- 2 and PL- 3 barrier walls reinforced with GFRP bars with lower tensile strength and bigger modulus of elasticity than those used in the earlier <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing.</b> In 2011, Charron et al. (2011) developed a precast bridge parapet made with fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) using the nonlinear finite-element computer modeling. Specific properties of high- and ultrahigh-performance FRC were exploited in these designs. Others conducted finite-element analysis modeling of GFRP-reinforced bridge barrier (Hedjazi et al. 2016; Khederzadeh and Sennah 2015). They conducted experimental testing on the developed FRC barrier to examine the barrier wall cantilever action and compared the results with numerical simulation. Buth et al. (2003) conducted vehicle crash test on a 685 -mm-height bridge open-rail reinforced with glass fibre-reinforced polymer bars. Sennah et al. (2011, 2014) developed GFRP-reinforced PL- 3 barriers and crash-tested it using tractor-trailer and then tested under static loading to collapse (Khederzadeh and Sennah 2014). These tested resulted in two MTO Standard Drawings that are currently used by contractors and consulting engineering to bid on MTO bridge projects. Few authors conducted tests on the capacity of barrier–deck junction incorporating GFRP with headed-ends and bars with 180 ° hooks (Azimi et al. 2014 a, b; Rostami et al. 2016). El-Salakawy and Islam (2014) examined experimentally two repair strategies of a GFRP-reinforced concrete bridge barrier damage by vehicle impact. Most recently, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, AASHTO (2009) established bridge guide specifications for GFRP-reinforced concrete bridge decks and traffic railings. However, this guide does not provide procedure for the design of the barrier wall except for the diagonal tension in the deck slab below the barrier–deck junction based on a recent work by Matta and Nanni (2009).|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a new breakaway connection-for use in large roadside sign structures-with improved performance characteristics relative to existing breakaway connection designs. By using a hybrid combination of steel and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) structural components, a new system was designed to resist statically equivalent hurricane wind loading, but also breakaway under direct vehicle impact loading. By replacing the heavier steel sign posts that have been used in previous designs with lighter FRP posts, and simultaneously introducing the use of innovative steel cutting surfaces that are engaged only during direct vehicle impact loading, occupant risks associated with collisions were reduced in severity, thereby producing improving safety. Since the performance standard for the design of roadside breakaway connections is currently the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH), the new connection system developed in this study was designed to meet the MASH requirements. However, since MASH is a relatively new standard, existing (i. e., previously-developed) designs of surrogate vehicles-used in <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> of breakaway hardware-that meet the current MASH requirements were not available in the literature. Therefore, to facilitate physical testing of newly developed prototype connections, a MASH-compliant surrogate vehicle first had to be designed, fabricated, and validated. Hence, a secondary {{objective of this}} study was to develop a new 'small car' (1100 kg) surrogate vehicle for use in conjunction with the FDOT <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> facility. In the course of pursuing this objective, several innovative and improved methods for designing surrogate impact vehicles were developed in this study [...] A key improvement was using tapered (trapezoidal) aluminum honeycomb cartridges, rather than the traditionally employed rectangular (constant cross-section) cartridges, to the reproduce the force-deformation behavior of the target production (market) vehicle (a 2006 Kia Rio in this study) [...] Additionally, the behavior of aluminum honeycomb at high levels of compressive stress (and deformation) was investigated using experimental testing and the findings were integrated into the surrogate vehicle design process. Validation crash-testing of the final surrogate vehicle (i. e., a combination of an impact block and a crushable nose constructed from aluminum honeycomb cartridges) demonstrated an acceptable match to the behavior of the target vehicle. Subsequently, the newly developed MASH-compliant surrogate vehicle was used to experimentally evaluate, using <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing,</b> multiple prototypes of a new hybrid (FRP and steel) breakaway connection design. The final design was demonstrated to meet the impact risk requirements stipulated in MASH as well as the hurricane wind resistance requirements specified by AASHTO and FDOT...|$|R
40|$|Anti ram {{perimeter}} {{barriers are}} part of the protection of important facilities such as power plants, air ports and embassies against unrestricted vehicle access. Many different systems can be used to achieve the containment goal. One of these systems makes use of soil embedded posts either single posts if the soil is hard enough or groups of soil embedded posts tied together by beams if the soil is not hard enough for a single post to stop the in-coming truck. The design of these soil embedded posts needs to take account a number of influencing factors which include the soil strength and stiffness, the post strength and stiffness, the mass of the vehicle and its approach velocity. This dissertation describes the work done to develop a set of design recommendations to select the embedment of a single post or group of posts. The post is a steel beam with an H shape cross section: W 14 X 109 for the single post system and W 14 X 90 for the group system with a double beam made of square hollow steel section HSS 8 X 8 X 1 / 2. The spacing of the posts for the group includes 2. 44 m, 4. 88 m, and 7. 32 m. The soil strength varies from loose sand and soft clay to very dense sand and very hard clay. The vehicle has a mass of 6800 kg and the velocities include 80 km/h, 65 km/h, and 50 km/h. The design guidelines presented here are based on 10 medium scale <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> 2 medium scale bogie <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> 1 full scale <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> on a single post, 1 full scale <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> on a group of 8 side by side posts with a 5. 2 m spacing and connected with two beams, approximately 150 4 -D numerical simulations of full scale <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> using LS-DYNA, as well as fundamental theoretical concepts...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{theoretical}} and experimental study {{of the relationship between}} the microstructural parameters, mechanical properties, and impact deformation and fracture of steels using the example of 17 Mn 1 Si pipe steel. A model for the behavior of a polycrystalline grain conglomerate under impact loading at different temperatures was proposed within a cellular automata framework. It was shown that the intensity of dissipation processes explicitly depends on temperature and these processes play an important role in stress relaxation at the boundaries of structural elements. The Experimental study reveals the relationship between <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> temperature and the deformation/fracture energy of the steel. The impact toughness was shown to decrease almost linearly with the decreasing test temperature, which agrees with the fractographic analysis data confirming the increase in the fraction of brittle fracture in this case. It was shown with the aid of the proposed model and numerical simulations that the use of the excitable cellular automata method and an explicit account of test temperature through the possibility of energy release at internal interfaces help to explain the experimentally observed features of impact failure at different temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Laminated {{glass panes}} are widely adopted as blast-resistant glass windows to {{mitigate}} the hazard from ejecting fractured glass fragments. The response of laminated glass windows under blast loads is often predicted by equivalent static analysis or simplified equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) analysis. The equivalent SDOF and equivalent static analyses are also respectively adopted in UFC and ASTM design guide for glass window designs. Owing to the inherent problems, the SDOF analysis can only predict the global responses of glass windows and the predictions are not necessarily always satisfactory. Therefore the accuracy and applicability of the SDOF analysis is sometimes questioned. Often numerical simulations and/or experimental tests have {{to be carried out}} for reliable predictions of laminated glass window responses to blast loads. In this study, experimental tests on laminated glass windows subjected to impact and blast loads were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of available analyses and design methods. <b>Pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted first on laminated panes of various thicknesses. Full-scale field blast tests were performed on laminated glass windows of dimension 1. 5 m × 1. 2 m. Glass pane deflections were monitored by mechanical linear voltage displacement transducer (LVDT) and high-speed cameras. The responses of the tested windows are compared with the estimations of SDOF models and design standards in this paper. Available blast testing data by other researchers are also included together with the current testing data to evaluate the accuracy of the SDOF and equivalent static analyses defined in the design guides. The adequacy of these simplified approaches in predicting laminated glass window responses to blast loads is discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStatement of the problemPoly methyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) acrylic resin, although {{being the most}} popular denture base material, is associated with poor mechanical properties. It has been documented that acrylic resin can be strengthened with an addition of structural component (filler) added in the acrylic matrix, to form a composite structure. ObjectiveTo evaluate and compare the transverse strength, impact strength, surface hardness and water sorption of 10 % and 20 % zirconia (ZrO 2) reinforced high impact acrylic resin with that of high impact acrylic resin (Trevalon HI, Dentsply India). Materials and methodsThere were 30 specimens {{in each of the}} four tests, amounting to a total of 120 specimens. Each of the tests had 10 specimens fabricated from high impact acrylic resin (control); 10 specimens fabricated from 10 % zirconia (ZrO 2) and 10 specimens fabricated from 20 % zirconia (ZrO 2) reinforced high impact acrylic resin. Specimens were subjected to the test of transverse strength in Universal <b>Testing</b> Machine, <b>impact</b> strength in Izod <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> machine and surface hardness by Vickers Microhardness tester according to ISO Specification No. 1567. Water sorption was assessed according to ADA Specification No. 12. Data were analyzed by means of a one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison test. ResultsA significant increase in the transverse strength was observed in the reinforced specimens when compared to the control group. Impact strength and surface hardness were found having lesser values compared to the control group. Water sorption was found to increase on the addition of 10 % and 20 % zirconia (ZrO 2) but the value lied below 0. 8 mg/cm 2 i. e. within the limit of ADA Specification No. 12.
