He set out from Karachi, but on the <b>preliminary</b> <b>voyage</b> to Bombay he {{suffered}} so severely from sea sickness that on landing there he cancelled the visit.|$|E
5000|$|Stowe's {{prelude to}} the present voyage was {{undertaken}} in 1999, {{when he and his}} new bride, Laurence Guillem, voyaged the South Atlantic Ocean for 194 days on the Anne, an expedition which Guillem dubbed [...] "The Odyssey of the Sea Turtle." [...] Stowe's intent during this <b>preliminary</b> <b>voyage</b> was to shape a course literally {{in the shape of a}} turtle. Of this choice, Stowe said: [...] "There's also something to be said about not racing around all the time. So this voyage was sort of an antidote to our speed-obsessed society. And the turtle is also a reminder about endangered species and the environment. I'm sure it's going to be interpreted in different ways."The voyage lasted from June 4, to December 17, 1999, with no major mishap, though it had its tribulations. The Anne suffered engine failure under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, aging sailcloth limited the precision of Stowe's navigation — the turtle was neither as large nor as complete as he had originally hoped — and a brush with Hurricane Lenny on their return leg hampered their return to the port of New York. Still, he and his sailing mate had spent over a half year out of sight of land.|$|E
