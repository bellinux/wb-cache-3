40|$|The field-effect {{mobility}} in {{an organic}} thin-film transistor is studied theoretically. From a percolation model of hopping between localized {{states and a}} transistor model an analytic expression for the field-effect mobility is obtained. The theory is applied to describe the experiments by Brown et al. [Synth. Met. 88, 37 (1997) ] on solution-processed amorphous organic transistors, made from a polymer (<b>polythienylene</b> <b>vinylene)</b> and from a small molecule (pentacene). Good agreement is obtained, both {{with respect to the}} gate-voltage and the temperature dependence of the mobility. Comment: 13 pages RevTeX, 2 Postscript figure...|$|E

40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} {{have been}} a popular research field {{in the past three}} decades since the discovery of conducting polymers in 1977, 1 owing to their novel properties and promising applications in optoelectronic devices such as polymer light-emitting diodes, 2 polymer solar cells (PSCs), 3 - 5 chemical sensors, 6 and nonlinear optical devices. 7 Recently, conjugated polymers with low bandgaps have drawn much attention due to their potential to be intrinsic conductive polymers and red-emitting luminescent polymers as well as for their better spectral matching with the solar spectrum for the application in PSCs. 3 b, 4 c, 8 <b>Poly(thienylene</b> <b>vinylene)</b> (PTV) derivatives are well-known low-bandgap polymers. 9 PTVs have already proven to be inter-esting polymers with high conductivity upon doping. 10 In addi-tion, PTVs have high hole mobility (ca. 0. 22 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1) 11 an...|$|E

Conjugated polymers (CPs), macromolecules consisting of alternating single and double bonds, are of tremendous {{interest to the}} scientific community considering their applications in field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, sensors, and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). OPVs are an area of particular interest because cost-effective solution processing techniques can be employed to prepare flexible large-area light harvesting devices. In addition, light absorption and charge transport characteristics may be tuned by synthetically altering the CP scaffold. This dissertation describes the synthesis {{of a variety of}} CPs prepared by acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization using versatile ruthenium-based Grubbs catalysts. All polymers were based on the low band gap <b>poly(thienylene</b> <b>vinylene)</b> (PTV) scaffold. The influence of polymer molecular weight, composition, and repeat unit architecture on both individual polymer behavior and OPV performance was investigated systematically...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{a few of}} the most crucial topics in the development of polymer based organic solar cells. The first topic involves the study and characterization of novel organic polymers, with focus on low-bandgap materials able to harvest a broader portion of the solar spectrum. This is a crucial subject of research, since the efficiency of organic solar cells is strictly related to the properties of the active layer. The first part of the thesis discusses the recent progresses in the synthesis of novel polymers and highlights the fundamental properties that make them suitable for high-efficiency organic solar cells. The first chapter is dedicated to the detailed characterization of a series of soluble poly thienylene vinylene derivatives. The second topic concerns alternative deposition techniques to spin coating, the most used technique in laboratories for the production of polymer based organic solar cells. The promise of these devices, indeed, lies in their low-cost high-throughput manufacturability, but this low cost aspect can only be fully realized if the layers are deposited by in-line compatible methods. Among several techniques, ink-jet printing and spray coating are studied in depth {{in the second part of}} the thesis for the deposition of the active layer. A thorough investigation on the behavior of spray coating is reported, together with the optimization of the deposition of polymer based layers. The development of two-solvent systems extended the uniformity of the sprayed films owing to the spreading properties induced by outward Marangoni flows in the liquid, as explained in the central part of the thesis. The benefits of the enhanced uniformity are clear from the closing of the performance gap between spin coated devices and spray coated ones. The technique is particularly advantageous since the deposition is obtained as a superposition of micron-sized droplets, which either merge into a full wet layer or dry upon impact with substrate. In the latter case, the damage of the solvent on the previously deposited layers is reduced to minimum, so that spray coating can be used to deposit even a metal top contact from a metal nanoparticle based ink, as described in the last two chapters of the thesis. This allowed for the demonstration of fully spray coated devices, showing that spray coating is a good candidate for the replacement of spin coating, since it is a large-area, roll-to-roll scalable technique that can produce spray coated organic solar cells with efficiencies in the same range of spin coated/evaporated reference devices.
