40|$|ABSTRACT: Usher {{syndrome}} {{is the leading}} cause of combined deaf–blindness, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the auditory and visual impairment are poorly understood. Usher I is characterized by profound congenital hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and <b>progressive</b> <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa beginning in early adolescence. Using the c. 216 G>A cryptic splice site mutation in Exon 3 of the USH 1 C gene found in Acadian Usher I patients in Louisiana, we constructed the first mouse model that develops both deafness and retinal degeneration. The same truncated mRNA transcript found in Usher 1 C patients is found in the cochleae and retinas of these knock-in mice. Absent auditory-evoked brainstem responses indicated that the mutant mice are deaf at 1 month of age. Cochlea...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} azithromycin in patients with ocular toxoplasmosis.  METHODS— 11 immunocompetent patients with ocular toxoplasmosis were treated with azithromycin (500  mg the first day, followed by 250  mg/day for 5  weeks). Ocular and systemic examinations were performed during active retinitis episodes and all patients were followed for at least 1  year.  RESULTS—The intraocular inflammation disappeared within 4  weeks in seven patients, including two cases with <b>progressive</b> <b>retinitis</b> despite previous treatment with pyrimethamine, sulphadiazine, and folinic acid. Recurrence of retinitis occurred in three patients (27 %) within {{the first year of}} follow up. No systemic side effects of azithromycin were encountered.  CONCLUSION—These results indicate that although azithromycin cannot prevent recurrent disease it may be an effective alternative for patients with ocular toxoplasmosis who cannot tolerate standard therapies.    Keywords: azithromycin; ocular toxoplasmosi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The waltzer (v) mouse mutant harbors a {{mutation}} in Cadherin 23 (Cdh 23) {{and is a}} model for Usher syndrome type 1 D, which is characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and prepubertal onset of <b>progressive</b> <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. In mice, functionally null Cdh 23 mutations affect stereociliary morphogenesis and the polarity of both cochlear and vestibular hair cells. In contrast, the murine Cdh 23 ahl allele, which harbors a hypomorphic mutation, causes an increase in susceptibility to age-related hearing loss in many inbred strains. We produced congenic mice by crossing mice carrying the v niigata (Cdh 23 v-ngt) null allele with mice carrying the hypomorphic Cdh 23 ahl allele on the C 57 BL/ 6 J background, and we then analyzed the animals ’ balance and hearing phenotypes. Although the Cdh 23 v-ngt/ahl compound heterozygous mice exhibited normal vestibular function, their hearing ability was abnormal: the mice exhibited higher thresholds of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and rapid age-dependent elevation of ABR thresholds compared with Cdh 23 ahl/ahl homozygous mice. We found that the stereocilia developed normally but were progressively disrupted in Cdh 23 v-ngt/ahl mice. In hair cells, CDH 23 localizes to the tip links of stereocilia, which are thought to gate the mechanoelectrical transduction channels in hair cells. We hypothesize that the reductio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Acute retinal {{necrosis}} (ARN) is a rare, rapidly <b>progressive</b> viral <b>retinitis.</b> The current {{standard of}} care for ARN consists of intravenous acyclovir for 5 - 10 days, followed by oral acyclovir for an additional 6 - 12 weeks. Valacyclovir has superior plasma bioavailability to acyclovir as an oral preparation.

40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is {{the most}} common intraocular {{opportunistic}} infection in profoundly immunocompromised patients with AIDS. It is characterized by an acute, <b>progressive,</b> necrotizing <b>retinitis</b> in patients with a CD 4 count of < 50 cells/μL. Although the incidence of CMV retinitis has declined because of the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a new syndrome of intraocular inflammation has emerged in patients with rising CD 4 lymphocyte counts following ART. This is called immune recovery uveitis (IRU). It is thought to occur as a result of restored immunity to various infectious agents, commonly mycobacterial, Cryptococcus, and herpes virus infections. We report a man who was treated for CMV retinitis and later developed IRU in the form of cystoid macular edema (CMO) even though his CMV retinitis remained inactive.

40|$|Hearing-impaired mouse mutants {{not only}} are good models for human {{hereditary}} deafness, but also are extremely useful for understanding the molecular basis of the cochlear defect. We describe here how we identified the gene responsible for the deafness and vestibular defects in the shaker- 1 mouse mutant as a myosin VII gene. Three different mutations, all causing the same phenotype in different lines of mouse, were found, providing good evidence that we had, indeed, found the correct gene. The same gene was subsequently found {{to be involved in}} Usher's syndrome type 1 B, which features deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and <b>progressive</b> <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. The myosin VII gene is expressed in sensory hair cells, but not in supporting cells or neurons. We are investigating the role of myosin VII in hair cell development and function. Analysis of the different mutant stocks suggests it has at least two functions. First it is involved in the development and maintenance of the stereocilia bundle. Second, it has a role in inner hair cell function. No evidence of retinal degeneration like that in Usher's syndrome has been found in the shaker- 1 mutants so far studied. The benefits of understanding the function of the gene for families with Usher's type 1 B are discussed. This gene is the first to be identified as causing {{the most common type of}} disorder in human hearing impairment, neuroepithelial abnormalities, and suggests a new class of candidate genes for involvement in such defects...|$|E
40|$|Usher {{syndrome}} type II (USH 2) is {{a genetically}} heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder {{with at least}} three genetic subtypes (USH 2 A, USH 2 B, and USH 2 C) and is classified phenotypically as congenital hearing loss and <b>progressive</b> <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. The VLGR 1 (MASS 1) gene in the 5 q 14. 3 -q 21. 1 USH 2 C locus was considered a likely candidate {{on the basis of}} its protein motif structure and expressed-sequence-tag representation from both cochlear and retinal subtracted libraries. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing of polymerase-chain-reaction products amplified from 10 genetically independent patients with USH 2 C and 156 other patients with USH 2 identified four isoform-specific VLGR 1 mutations (Q 2301 X, I 2906 FS, M 2931 FS, and T 6244 X) from three families with USH 2 C, as well as two sporadic cases. All patients with VLGR 1 mutations are female, a significant deviation from random expectations. The ligand(s) for the VLGR 1 protein is unknown, but {{on the basis of its}} potential extracellular and intracellular protein-protein interaction domains and its wide mRNA expression profile, it is probable that VLGR 1 serves diverse cellular and signaling processes. VLGR 1 mutations have been previously identified in both humans and mice and are associated with a reflex-seizure phenotype in both species. The identification of additional VLGR 1 mutations to test whether a phenotype/genotype correlation exists, akin to that shown for other Usher syndrome disease genes, is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Usher {{syndrome}} type IIa (USHIIa) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by {{moderate to severe}} sensorineural hearing loss and <b>progressive</b> <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. This disorder maps to human chromosome 1 q 41. Recently, mutations in USHIIa patients were identified in a novel gene isolated from this chromosomal region. The USH 2 A gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 171. 5 kD and possesses laminin epidermal growth factor as well as fibronectin type III domains. These domains are observed in other protein components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes; {{they may also be}} observed in cell-adhesion molecules. The intron/exon organization of the gene whose protein we name "Usherin" was determined by direct sequencing of PCR products and cloned genomic DNA with cDNA-specific primers. The gene is encoded by 21 exons and spans a minimum of 105 kb. A mutation search of 57 independent USHIIa probands was performed with a combination of direct sequencing and heteroduplex analysis of PCR-amplified exons. Fifteen new mutations were found. Of 114 independent USH 2 A alleles, 58 harbored probable pathologic mutations. Ten cases of USHIIa were true homozygotes and 10 were compound heterozygotes; 18 heterozygotes with only one identifiable mutation were observed. Sixty-five percent (38 / 58) of cases had at least one mutation, and 51 % (58 / 114) {{of the total number of}} possible mutations were identified. The allele 2299 delG (previously reported as 2314 delG) was the most frequent mutant allele observed (16 %; 31 / 192). Three new missense mutations (C 319 Y, N 346 H, and C 419 F) were discovered; all were restricted to the previously unreported laminin domain VI region of Usherin. The possible significance of this domain, known to be necessary for laminin network assembly, is discussed in the context of domain VI mutations from other proteins...|$|E

40|$|Viral {{retinitis}} is a {{group of}} conditions including Cytomegalovirus (CMV) <b>retinitis,</b> <b>Progressive</b> Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN), and Acute Retinal Necrosis. Despite different aetiologies, there are similarties.

40|$|Acute retinal {{necrosis}} (ARN) is {{a rapidly}} <b>progressive</b> and severe <b>retinitis</b> {{resulting in a}} poor visual outcome. Infections caused by herpes viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 or the varicella zoster virus (VZV) {{are known to be}} implicated in the development of ARN. In the present study, an 80 -year-old female with ARN was examined. She had been affected with rheumatoid arthritis and had taken methotrexate for over 10 years. Her right eye showed clinical features of ARN, and her left eye showed mild retinitis. The genomic DNA in the aqueous humor and vitreous fluid from her right eye were analyzed by a comprehensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to screen infectious pathogens including viruses. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected from both specimens, but neither HSV or VZV nor cytomegalovirus was detected. She underwent intraocular surgery following systemic corticosteroid and acyclovir applications. However, although the retinitis of her right eye was extinguished, the final visual outcome was blindness due to optic nerve atrophy. There are few reports indicating that EBV is associated with ARN development. The present findings suggest that EBV alone can be the causative agent of ARN...|$|R
40|$|Hearing loss is {{the most}} common sensory {{disorder}} in the human population. It affects 0. 1 % of all young children and by the age of 70, 30 % of the population suffers from hearing loss greater than 40 dB. When early onset hearing loss is inherited, 70 % is classified as nonsyndromic and 30 % as syndromic. Nonsyndromic hearing loss is further subdivided by its mode of inheritance; ~ 77 % of the cases are autosomal recessive (DFNB), ~ 22 % are autosomal dominant (DFNA) and ~ 1 % are X-linked (DFN). Eighty nonsyndromic hearing loss loci have been described so far, but new loci are continuously found. For approximately half of the loci the genetic defect responsible for the hearing loss has been identified. Recently several new strategies have been developed to elucidate the genetic defect for the remaining loci. One of these new strategies, the construction and analysis of a cDNA library, is described in chapter two. DFNA 5, is characterised by high frequency hearing loss caused by a mutation in the DFNA 5 gene. The second Dutch family with DFNA 5 is described in chapter three. The hearing impairment in this family is caused by a novel mutation in DFNA 5. The mutation likely results in a deleterious gain of function of the protein in the inner ear. Another form of high frequency hearing loss, DFNA 11, is associated with a mutation in the MYO 7 A gene. In chapter 4 a Dutch family with DFNA 11 is described in which hearing impairment segregates with a novel mutation in MYO 7 A. The nucleotide change is predicted to lead to an amino acid change in the motor domain, causing severe effects on the function of the myosin VIIA protein. Usher syndrome is a form of syndromic hearing loss that is characterized by various degrees of congenital hearing loss and of loss of eyesight through <b>progressive</b> <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa.

40|$|Abstract Background There is no {{generally}} accepted medical or surgical treatment {{to stop the}} <b>progressive</b> course of <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. Previous studies have suggested lutein as a potential treatment with positive effects on macular pigment density. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of lutein supplementation on preservation of visual function in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) Methods In a double-masked randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II clinical trial with a cross-over design, 34 adult patients with RP were randomized to two groups. One group, consisted of 16 participants, received lutein supplementation (10 mg/d for 12 wks followed by 30 mg/d) for the first 24 weeks and then placebo for the following 24 weeks, while the other group included 18 participants for whom placebo (24 weeks) was administered prior to lutein. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and central visual field were measured at different illumination levels at baseline and every week using a PC-based test at home. Results For visual acuity (VA) at normal illumination level, treatment with lutein reduced logMAR, i. e. improved VA, but this effect was not statistically significant. The changes in normal (100 %), low (4 %), and very low (0. 1 %) illumination log CS were not statistically significant (p-values: 0. 34, 0. 23, and 0. 32, respectively). Lutein had a statistically significant effect on visual field (p-value: 0. 038) and this effect increased in the model assuming a 6 -week delay in effect of lutein. Comparing the development of vision measures against the natural loss expected to occur over the course of 48 weeks, most measures showed reduced decline, and these reductions were significant for normal illumination VA and CS. Conclusion These results suggest that lutein supplementation improves visual field and also might improve visual acuity slightly, although these results should be interpreted cautiously. As a combined phase I and II clinical trial, this study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of lutein supplementation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is little}} {{information}} on the incidence of AIDS-defining events which {{have been reported in}} the literature to be associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation. These events include tuberculosis, mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), cytomegalovirus (CMV) <b>retinitis,</b> <b>progressive</b> multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), cryptococcosis and candidiasis. Methods: We identified individuals in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration, which includes data from six European countries and the US, who were HIV-positive between 1996 and 2013, antiretroviral therapy naive, aged at least 18 years, had CD 4 + cell count and HIV-RNA measurements and had been AIDS-free for at least 1 month between those measurements and the start of follow-up. For each AIDS-defining event, we estimated the hazard ratio for no cART versus less than 3 and at least 3 months since cART initiation, adjusting for time-varying CD 4 + cell count and HIV-RNA via inverse probability weighting. Results: Out of 96 562 eligible individuals (78 % men) with median (interquantile range) follow-up of 31 [13, 65] months, 55 144 initiated cART. The number of cases varied between 898 for tuberculosis and 113 for PML. Compared with non-cART initiation, the hazard ratio (95 % confidence intervals) up to 3 months after cART initiation were 1. 21 (0. 90 – 1. 63) for tuberculosis, 2. 61 (1. 05 – 6. 49) for MAC, 1. 17 (0. 34 – 4. 08) for CMV retinitis, 1. 18 (0. 62 – 2. 26) for PML, 1. 21 (0. 83 – 1. 75) for HSV, 1. 18 (0. 87 – 1. 58) for Kaposi sarcoma, 1. 56 (0. 82 – 2. 95) for NHL, 1. 11 (0. 56 – 2. 18) for cryptococcosis and 0. 77 (0. 40 – 1. 49) for candidiasis. Conclusion: With the potential exception of mycobacterial infections, unmasking IRIS does not appear to be a common complication of cART initiation in high-income countries...|$|R
