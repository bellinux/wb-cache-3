40|$|The {{symposium}} {{issue is}} a nice microcosm of the competition law issues facing the world. It presents the tensions between national control and world integration. It presents the twin, conflicting impulses to eschew internationalization, hoping to do well enough by deepened <b>positive</b> <b>comity</b> (Waller), and to embrace internationalization at least cautiously to address concerns where unharnessed operation of national interests obstructs efficient solutions and where internationalization {{is most likely to}} sidestep the political landmines (Fiebig) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{closer look}} at the European and American {{competition}} rules reveals two divergent regulatory approaches guided by the respective ethoi of ‘gentlemanly competition’ and ‘cowboy capitalism’. The resulting behaviours of the individual and the sector also promote varying conventionalities of business strategy. The increased momentum of globalisation and <b>positive</b> <b>comity</b> in environments of regulatory flux (deregulation, privatisation and re-regulation) engenders regulatory risk that policymakers will self-protect or protect competitors rather than competition, thereby confusing the ends of the rules with their means...|$|E
40|$|Bilateral {{cooperation}} between antitrust agencies, {{in particular the}} European Commission and the US agencies, {{is the focus of}} this new work. It first shows how bilateral cooperation was developed {{as a response to the}} limits of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national competition laws, and how it has evolved from an instrument initially designed to avoid conflicts into a tool aimed at coordinating joint investigations of international competition cases. It then considers how bilateral cooperation could be used optimally, by analysing two forms of advanced cooperation: the exchange of confidential information, and <b>positive</b> <b>comity,</b> which is the only satisfactory answer competition law can provide to market access cases. It shows that the use of such instruments is limited by significant legal and political obstacles, even in the context of the exemplary EC-US relationship. The book therefore argues that the efficient use of bilateral cooperation will be limited to a small number of well-established competition agencies. If international anticompetitive practices are to be efficiently addressed by an increasingly large and heterogeneous group of competition agencies, horizontal {{cooperation between}} antitrust agencies must be complemented by a multilateral and supranational solution going beyond the proposals currently put forward. The book concludes that only the WTO and its dispute settlement system could provide the basis for such a system. Published version of EUI PhD thesis, 200...|$|E
40|$|The South African Customs Union (SACU) {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{regional}} trade arrangements that litter the African continent. However unlike its counterparts it is unique in terms of the huge disparities between the economic states of its member states. SACU is currently struggling to redefine itself from its historical trimmings as a plumped up South African foreign policy tool to a regional body that caters for the needs of all its member nations. Key to this purported transformation would be how SACU copes with the increased presence of foreign multinational companies within the common market and coupled to this the persistent threat from established South African companies on infant industries within smaller SACU states. This dissertation highlights the potential role of competition policy as a market correcting mechanism within the regional context. It does so by shedding insights as to the workings of competition law, its natural impediments, modifications it would require and the objectives which it can be used to achieve. It considers the current state of competition law within SACU both on the domestic and regional front and compares them with examples found in other regional arrangements. It strives having regard to peculiarities within SACU to draw attention to shortfalls in its current approach to competition issues and makes a case for the modifying the current modus operandi. It proceeds from the viewpoint that without a fortification of SACU current approach to competition issues, the huge lacuna currently existing would deprive the regional body of any true gains to be made from trade liberalisation. It also proposes a regional competition policy as a means of controlling the ever present threat of established South African to infant industries in smaller SACU states and hopes this instrument will have the secondary effect of easing political tensions within the union. It makes an important call that special consideration be given towards smaller SACU states noting the cost and burden of implementing competition policy. It also considers the role competition law plays within a development framework dispelling prevailing conceptions within certain schools that it stunts growth of industries. It factors into its analysis, the ongoing negotiations between the European Union and SADC. It holds these processes as placing a further impetus on SACU nations to consider a movement from the current <b>positive</b> <b>comity</b> form which competition policy takes in the region by declaring it to be a weak form of cooperation and unsuited to effectively managing the new challenges that successfully negotiated EPA’s would place on competition authorities within SACU. Ultimately it proposes that SACU requires a strengthened competition policy to secure the gains from international trade but that more importantly it requires the right form of policy, a policy created in consideration of its history, current tensions, developmental needs, that foresees the potential for harm inherent in the EPA process and a policy that appreciates the burden a generic law might place on its member states. Its solution to the current crisis is a hybrid system incorporating elements of the EC supranational competition directorate and CARICOM special and differential treatment provisions.
