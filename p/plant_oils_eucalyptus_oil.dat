Whereas, the poultries participate in food cycle of human, the residues of these agents enter in human and cause many undesired side effects. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of Respitol-B and its main components (<b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> and menthol) was evaluated on different kinds of microorganisms including gram positive, gram negative bacteria, yeast and fungi in vitro conditions by disc diffusion and micro broth dilution assays. The gram positive bacteria, yeast and fungi is more sensitive than Gram negative ones to Respitol-B.

The objective {{of the study is}} to identify the parameters that influence gross indicated fuel conversion efficiency and how they are affected by the use of biodiesel relative to petroleum diesel. Important physicochemical properties of palm kernel <b>oil</b> and <b>eucalyptus</b> blend were experimentally evaluated and found within acceptable limits of relevant standards. As most of vegetable oils are edible, growing concern for trying nonedible and waste fats as alternative to petrodiesel has emerged. In present study diesel fuel is completely replaced by biofuels, namely, methyl ester of palm kernel <b>oil</b> and <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> in various blends. Different blends of palm kernel <b>oil</b> and <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>oil</b> are prepared on volume basis and used as operating fuel in single cylinder 4 -stroke variable compression ratio diesel engine.
