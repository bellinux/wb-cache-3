40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{stressors}} of parenting an adult child <b>who</b> experiences homelessness. <b>Parents</b> whose adult children become homeless may provide support to this child, but they may also subsequently experience stress and require social support themselves.

Results also show higher levels of stress among <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> helped with activities of daily living and among <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> worked to prevent harm involving their adult homeless offspring. Among 37 respondents, a majority of whom were African American mothers parenting homeless sons, <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> engaged in activities to prevent harm and <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> experienced stress from harm prevention received more extensive social support. Health and social service providers should recognize and respond to the financial, emotional, and temporal burdens of <b>parenting</b> an adult <b>who</b> becomes homeless. Service providers can both support people who become homeless and reinforce larger family systems, particularly in circumstances that involve more extensive parental support or more harmful situations...|$|R
