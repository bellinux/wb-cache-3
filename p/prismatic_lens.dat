40|$|In {{this paper}} we present and {{experimentally}} validate a low-cost {{design of a}} spectral splitting concentrator for the efficient conversion of solar energy. The optical device consists of a dispersive <b>prismatic</b> <b>lens</b> made of polycarbonate designed to simultaneously concentrate the solar light and split it into its spectral components. With respect to our previous implementation, this device concentrates the light along two axes and generates a light pattern compatible with the dimensions {{of a set of}} concentrating photovoltaic cells while providing a higher concentration ratio. The mathematical framework and the constructive approach used for the design are presented and the device performance is simulated using a ray-tracing software. We obtain spectral separation in the visible range within a 3 x 1 cm 2 area and a maximum concentration of 210 x for a single wavelength. The device is fabricated by injection molding and its performance is experimentally investigated. We measure an optical transmissivity above 90 % in the range 400 - 800 nm and we observe a spectral distribution in good accordance with simulations. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the device for cost effective high efficiency concentrated photovoltaic systems. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

A <b>prismatic</b> <b>lens</b> was designed using geometric optics and the dispersive properties of the employed material, and its performance was simulated with a ray- tracing software. After device optimization, it was fabricated by injection molding, suitable for large-scale mass production.

Finally, two prototype systems were tested: one with GaAsP and c-Si photovoltaic devices and one {{with a pair of}} copper indium gallium selenide based solar cells. The systems demonstrated an increase in peak electrical power output of 51 % and 64 % respectively under white light illumination.

40|$|Detailed {{simulations}} of lighting and HVAC energy consumption {{were performed on}} a prototype office building in six North American climates. The goal of these simulations was to calculate the overall energy savings attributable to reductions in lighting power density (LPD) from 25. 8 W/m (past practice) to 17. 2 W/m (current code) to 8. 6 W/m (low). Results showed that as LPD decreases, reductions in cooling energy, due to reductions in heat produced by lighting, could substantially increase cost savings over the cost savings attributable to lighting in isolation, particularly in warm climates. Further, nine different lighting designs were installed in a windowless, 83 m), mock-up open-plan office space, containing six workstations. The nine lighting designs resulted {{from a combination of}} the three LPDs used in the simulations, created using three ambient lighting technologies (recessed troffers with prismatic lenses; recessed troffers with parabolic louvers; indirect or direct/indirect fixtures); in the low lighting power density options, the ambient lighting systems were supplemented with task lighting. At least thirty participants, in groups of three to six, worked for a full day under one design (292 participants in total). They performed a variety of computer-based and paper-based tasks designed to be representative of modern office work, and completed questionnaires to assess satisfaction and impressions of lighting quality.

We propose that the changes occurring in everyday life are better represented as the accumulation of many smaller perturbations contaminated by measurement noise. We have therefore tested human performance to random walk variations in the visual feedback of hand movements during a pointing task. Subjects made discrete targeted pointing movements to a visual target and received terminal feedback via a cursor the position of which was offset from the actual movement endpoint by a random walk element and a random observation element. By applying ideal observer analysis, which for this task compares human performance against that of a Kalman filter, we show that the subjects ’ performance was highly efficient with Fisher efficiencies reaching 73 %. We then used system identification techniques to characterize the control strategy used. A “modified ” deltarule algorithm best modeled the human data, which suggests that they estimated the random walk perturbation of feedback in this task using an exponential weighting of recent errors. The time constant of the exponential weighting of the best-fitting model varied with the rate of random walk drift.

When viewed using a <b>prismatic</b> <b>lens</b> of history, recurrent themes regarding adverse HT sequelae separate and become apparent. These can be broadly classified into three categories: infectious, noninfectious, and administrative/logistical. Using the HT care map as a frame of reference along with its associated rites, we examine the contemporary spectrum of HT adverse events and concerns, and some approaches as to how these may be addressed from bedside and laboratory medicine biovigilance perspectives enhancing patient care and blood transfusion safety. Although our vantage point is from an academic community hospital venue, the issues and concerns identified are germane to many if not all transfusion-medicine practice environments. Included among the subjects we explore are patient/specimen identification issues, blood-management initiatives, unrecognized and/or unreported suspected transfusion reactions, transfusion-associated adverse pulmonary sequelae (including transfusion-related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated circulatory overload), expanded applications of electronic health records and issues regarding their “meaningful use” and interinstitutional “digital compatibilities”, biovigilance integration of electronic data networks within and between health care entities, and anticipated workforce contractions secondary to projected declines in the availability of qualified laboratory professionals. Cooperative initiatives between accreditation and regulatory entities, blood collectors and suppliers, hospital laboratory transfusion services and health care providers involved in the bedside care of the patient offer the best means in further mitigating adverse HT sequelae and potential nonconformities that may arise in the daily operations of contemporary hospital blood banks and transfusion-medicine services.

40|$|Purpose: It is {{important}} to establish a differential diagnosis between {{the different types of}} nystagmus, in order to give the appropriate clinical approach to every situation and to improve visual acuity. The nystagmus is normally blocked when the eyes are positioned in a particular way. This makes the child adopt a posture of ocular torticollis that reduces the nistagmiformes movements, improving the vision in this position. A way to promote the blocking of the nystagmic movements is by using prismatic lenses with opposite bases, to block or minimize the oscillatory movements. This results in a vision improvement and it reduces the anomalous head position. There is limited research on the visual results in children with nystagmus after using prisms with opposing bases. Our aim is to describe the impact on the visual acuity (VA) of theprescription prism lenses in a nystagmus patient starting at 3 months of age. Methods: Case report on thirty month old caucasian male infant, with normal growth and development for their age, with an early onset of horizontal nystagmus at 3 months of age. Ophthalmic examination included slit lamp examination, fundus, refractive study, electrophysiological and magnetic resonance tests, measurement of VA over time with the Teller Acuity Cards (TAC) in the distance agreed for the age. At age ten months, the mother noted a persistent turn {{to the right of the}} child’s head, which became increasingly more severe along the months. There’s no oscillopcia. At 24 months, an atropine refraction showed the following refractive error: 0 D. : - 1, 50, OS: - 0, 50 and <b>prismatic</b> <b>lens</b> adapting OD 8 Δ nasal base and OE 8 Δ temporal base. Results: Thirty month old child, with adequate development for their age, with onset of idiopatic horizontal nystagmus, at 3 months of age. Normal ocular fundus and magnetic ressoance without alterations, sub-normal results in electrophysiological tests and VA with values below normal for age. At 6 months OD 20 / 300; OE 20 / 400; OU 20 / 300. At 9 months OD 20 / 250; OE 20 / 300; OU 20 / 150 (TAC a 38 cm). At 18 months OD 20 / 200; OE 20 / 100; OU 20 / 80 (TAC at 38 cm), when the head is turned to the right and the eyes in levoversão, the nystagmus decreases in a “neutral” area. At 24 month, with the prismatic glasses, OD 20 / 200 OE 20 / 100, OU 20 / 80 (TAC at 54 cm, reference value is 20 / 30 – 20 / 100 para OU e 20 / 40 – 20 / 100 monocular), there was an increase in the visual acuity. The child did visual stimulation with multimedia devices and using glasses. After adaptation of prisms: at 30 months VA (with Cambridge cards) OD e OE = 6 / 18. The child improved the VA and reduced the anomalous head position. There is also improvement in mobility and fine motricity. Conclusion: Prisms with opposing bases., were used in the treatment of idiopathic nystagmus. Said prisms were adapted to reduce the skewed position of the head, and to improve VA and binocular function. Monitoring of visual acuity and visual stimulation was done using electronic devices. Following the use of prismatic, the patient improved significantly VA and the anomalous head position was reduced...|$|E
40|$|Dreams and Ghosts is {{the title}} of a book {{published}} in 1897 by Andrew Lang. Andrew Lang's title provides in itself an ideal summary of this article, the first one in a series devoted to the theme of necromancy in pre-modern and modern Japanese letters. This essay is an enquiry into the genealogy of the fantastic tale (gensō bungaku) in the modern era in Japan and an examination of the strong connections it established with traditional religion and the classics. In order to be read meaningfully, modern Japanese tales of the fantastic call for a closer examination of their classical forebears. They also require to be read in the light of various religious discourses born in the modern era, especially Buddhism. Eventually, they need to be confronted to their coeval Western counterparts in order to grasp both the differences in their treatment of the supernatural and the similarities in the motifs they commonly use. The following pages deal with two illustrious writers Kōda Rohan (1867 - 1947) and Izumi Kyōka (1873 - 1939) who were the most famous heralds of resistance to modernity among the literati. Their best fictions belong to the genre (in fact, Kyōka 's entire career was devoted to the exploration of this Twilight Zone of Japanese imagination). Rather than giving a general survey of their works belonging to this precise category, the article is an examination of the use they made of the notion of dreams and ghosts, as they inherited it from the medieval corpus of the nō plays. The structure of the mugen nō (nō of illusions and dreams) they transposed into their fictional works is also closely connected to the Buddhist notions of redemption, of the after life and of gender. The introduction deals with the general situation of Buddhism in modern Japanese letters and with the functions of the religious past in Rohan and Kyōka 's tales. The first part deals with the origins and the definition of the word mugen nō from Zeami's time to its revival in the Taishō era (1912 - 1926). The three other parts of the article are devoted to representative fictions of Rohan and Kyōka read in association with Buddhist motifs and the world of the nō plays. Many recurrent images run through texts like Taidokuro (Facing the Skull) (1890), Kōya Hijiri (The Holy Man of Mount Kōya) (1900) and Shunchū (One Day in Spring) (1906). In this article, we have dealt mainly with the oneiric structure of these texts and with the motif of the femme fatale around which the various tales develop. These two themes - one is structural (narrative patterns) and one belongs to the history of representations (ghosts), allow us to read these texts in close connection to the various classical sources meaningfully used by their authors to give birth to their fictional worlds. The form of the dream-play revived in the modern era, equally shows the possibility of transforming the writing of fiction into a necromantic rite of placation. In using Buddhist notions of the afterlife and of desire through the <b>prismatic</b> <b>lens</b> of the nō plays, these texts vindicate the classical notion of literature as a form of sacred conversation between the living and the dead.

Altogether, these results suggest the existence of a strong link between low-level sensorimotor plasticity and high-level cognitive functions and raise important questions about the mechanisms involved in producing unexpected cognitive effects following prism adaptation. Implications for the functional mechanisms and neuroanatomical network of prism adaptation are discussed to explain how sensorimotor plasticity may affect cognitive processes...|$|R
40|$|Visuomotor {{adaptation}} to {{a shift in}} visual input produced by <b>prismatic</b> <b>lenses</b> {{is an example of}} dynamic sensory-motor plasticity within the brain. Prism adaptation is readily induced in healthy individuals, and is thought to reflect the brain’s ability to compensate for drifts in spatial calibration between different sensory systems. The neural correlate of this form of functional plasticity is largely unknown, although current models predict the involvement of parieto-cerebellar circuits. Recent studies that have employed event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain regions associated with prism adaptation have discovered patterns of parietal and cerebellar modulation as participants corrected their visuomotor errors during the early part of adaptation. However, the role of these regions in the later stage of adaptation, when ‘spatial realignment’ or true adaptation is predicted to occur, remains unclear. Here, we used fMRI to quantify the distinctive patterns of parieto-cerebellar activity as visuomotor adaptation develops. We directly contrasted activation patterns during the initial error correction phase of visuomotor adaptation with that during the later spatial realignment phase, and found significant recruitment of the parieto-cerebellar network – with activations in the right inferior parietal lobe and the right posterior cerebellum. These findings provide the first evidence of both cerebellar and parietal involvement during the spatial realignment phase of prism adaptation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study describes the long-term effectiveness on spatial neglect recovery of a 2 -week treatment based on prism adaptation (PA). Seven right-brain-damaged patients affected by chronic neglect were evaluated before, {{after two weeks}} of the PA treatment and at a follow-up (variable between 8 and 30 months after the end of PA). Neglect evaluation was performed by means of BIT (conventional and behavioral), Fluff Test, and Comb and Razor Test. The results highlight an improvement, after the PA training, in both tasks performed using the hand trained in PA treatment and in behavioral tasks not requiring a manual motor response. Such effects extend, even if not significantly, to all BIT subtests. These results support previous findings, showing that PA improves neglect also on imagery tasks with no manual component, and provide further evidence for long-lasting efficacy of PA training. Dissociations have been found with regard to PA efficacy on peripersonal, personal, and representational neglect, visuospatial agraphia and neglect dyslexia. In particular, we found {{no significant differences between the}} pre-training and post-training PA session in personal neglect measures, and a poor recovery of neglect dyslexia after PA treatment. The recruitment of a larger sample could help to confirm the effectiveness of the <b>prismatic</b> <b>lenses</b> with regard to the different clinical manifestations of spatial neglect. 1...|$|R
40|$|Contrast {{sensitivity}} {{for target}} I (3. 24 /diameter) of the 30 cm radius Goldmann perimeter was measured along the horizontal meridian to 50 degrees eccentricity in 5 subjects. Background luminance was 10. 0 cd/m 2 and stimulus duration was 130 ± 4 ms. Using this {{data and the}} ophthalmic <b>lens</b> <b>prismatic</b> effects to be presented in another paper, the alteration in static perimetric sensitivity caused by spectacle <b>lens</b> <b>prismatic</b> effects was estimated. For spectacle lenses with powers between - 6 D and + 10 D, the maximum sensitivity alteration was only 0. 30 log units (+ 10 D, 25 degrees temporal) for a 14 mm vertex distance. As the experiment used conditions producing maximum visual field sensitivity gradients, and hence the maximum alteration in sensitivity caused by prismatic effects, prismatic effects of corrective ophthalmic lenses can be ignored within the central 30 degrees - 40 degrees visual field during static perimetry for lens powers less than ± 10 D...|$|R
