The study {{is based on an}} extensive set of household <b>purchase</b> <b>panel</b> data for each country.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} proposed structure and {{contents of a}} frequently discussed Category Management (CM) model in the Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) context. Based on this we present an extensive empirical study where the data from a survey of 202 household representatives are merged with their actual purchasing data taken from a consumer <b>purchase</b> <b>panel</b> (> 30, 000 purchase observations). The results from an exploratory factor analysis and subsequent multiple regression analyses show that the investigated CM model needs to be amended by personnel and Point-of-Sale aspects as they affect Consumer Value significantly. Finally, the investigated differences between the drivers of Consumers Value call for including both survey and consumer purchase data and consequently incorporate attitudinal and behavioural aspects into Category Management...|$|E
40|$|Wine {{marketers}} {{are continually}} involved with measuring consumer preferences usually {{by means of}} surveys or consumer <b>purchase</b> <b>panel</b> data. In this paper we provide initial results using a relatively new and very straightforward method for measuring consumer preferences. The best-worst scaling method (also called max-diffs) simply asks consumers to look at sets of products, attributes, or other factors to be compared and choose from each set the best/most favourable and the worst/least favourable. A simple count and manipulation results in a single preference scale, where the differences may be compared as distances rather than rank order. Managerial implications {{of the importance of}} wine attributes that influence consumer drinks purchasing and wine style selection are discussed as well as suggestions for future research. The goal {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the practical and a scholarly usefulness of this approach and present a call for replication in other markets in an ongoing manner.

40|$|For decades, {{managers}} have analysed, planned and implemented long-term brand strategies based on customer mindset metrics (MSMs). Typically, such MSMs are customer satisfaction, liking, brand preference and Net Promoter Score (NPS). One {{of the core}} pillars, in brand management literature, is the assumed link between certain customer-based brand assets, often operationalized as MSMs, and future long-term market performance. However, few studies have systematically and broadly evaluated how the most common MSMs relate to actual performance data. This study investigates {{the link between the}} customer MSMs, most commonly used by practitioners, and their relationships with actual market performance. The paper explores 10 MSMs and 14 market performance metrics, in 10 categories, in the Swedish fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market. The study is based on survey data from 2007 that is compared to <b>purchase</b> <b>panel</b> household data from 2007 and 2010. Although MSMs are highly correlated to each other, their relations to brands' long-term market performance differ. A more nuanced approach to the MSM-market performance link is proposed, as {{there appears to be no}} single “silver bullet” MSM to rely on. Using a cash flow-oriented framework, the authors recommend opting for different MSMs depending on which of the three generic types of market performance (enhanced, sustained or accelerated) are targeted...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAs first {{described}} in the 1980 s, the core food intake model allows a precise assessment of dietary nutrient intake and dietary exposure to contaminants insofar as it reflects the eating habits of a target population and covers the most important foods in term of consumption, selected nutrient and contaminant contribution. This model {{has been used to}} set up the sampling strategy of the second French Total Diet Study (TDS) which aims to obtain a realistic panorama of nutrient intakes and contaminant exposure for the whole population, useful for quantitative risk assessment. Data on consumption trends and eating habits from the second French individual food consumption survey (INCA 2) as well as data from a 2004 <b>purchase</b> <b>panel</b> of French households (SECODIP) were used to identify the core foods to be sampled. 116 core foods on a national scale and 70 core foods on a regional scale were selected according to (i) the consumption data for adults and children, (ii) their consumer rates, and (iii) their high contribution to exposure to one or more contaminants of interest. Foods were collected in 8 French regions (36 cities) and prepared “as-consumed” to be analysed for their nutritional composition and contamination levels. 20, 280 different food products were purchased to make up the 1, 352 composite samples of core foods to be analysed for additives, environmental contaminants, pesticide residues, trace elements and minerals, mycotoxins and acrylamid. The establishment of such a sampling plan is essential for effective, high-quality monitoring of dietary exposure from a public health point of view...|$|E

40|$|Global {{warming is}} a concern for many {{people around the world}} (Lorenzoni, Pidgeon, 2006; Searle 2 ̆ 6 Gow, 2010). The {{negative}} effect of climate change is increasingly apparent (Belluscio, 2010; Dunlop, 2010; Hirabayashi, Kanae, Emori, Oki 2 ̆ 6 Kimoto, 2008; Oelemans, 1994). In response to growing public concern, governments are implementing legislation and carbon initiatives to decrease the impact of climate change (Crane, 2010; D’Souza, 2005). Although these government actions are important to implement environmental preservation among industries, this study focuses on the intentions of purchasing behaviour of the individual homeowner of the South West region of Western Australia. More specifically, the purchasing behaviour towards solar panels as they are the most commercially accessible form of renewable technology for homeowners. Increasing the intention of homeowners to <b>purchase</b> solar <b>panels</b> may subsequently reduce the impact of global warming. This study used Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to test three factors (behavioural beliefs, normative beliefs and control beliefs) that may influence the intention to <b>purchase</b> solar <b>panels.</b> A quantitative approach was used in this study, surveying 342 respondents. The results indicated that intention to <b>purchase</b> solar <b>panels</b> can be predicted by behavioural, normative and control beliefs, however, normative beliefs was the strongest predictor. In light of the findings attained by this study, marketing firms may use the results to add additional dimensions to future campaigns. This may have an effect of increasing the uptake of solar panels by homeowners in the South West region, which could reduce carbon emissions that are a side-effect of producing electricity. Reducing carbon emissions in the South West region could be the start of reducing the global impact of climate change...|$|R
