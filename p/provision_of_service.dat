2500|$|The {{issue of}} locationof the Internet user, the user's {{counterparties}} {{in a commercial}} transaction, the headquarters facilities of any involved commercial entities, and even the servers and switchesis important for tax purposes. For example, of the nine U.S. states that currently tax access in some manner, four make reference to location. [...] In each case, both the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and the billing must take place within the state. Connecticut places the burden of determining whether this is so upon the Internet service provider. But in general, there is no simple way to determine location, owing largely to the Internet's lack of boundaries. Users can and routinely do access their accounts from remote locations; providers are almost always located in multiple taxing jurisdictions; and the data traffic itself, via the Internet's packet-switched architecture, is routed through myriad locations. [...] Such issues are important not only for practical reasons of determining the incidence of the tax and its enforcement, {{but also because the}} U.S. Constitution requires that a state or taxing sub-jurisdiction have [...] "nexus" [...] with the transaction in order to exert its taxing power, and that determination rests precisely upon such considerations.|$|E

50|$|Reliability of {{electricity}} supply is low, and characterized by frequent and long outages (the highest incidence in Latin America and the Caribbean), load discharges and voltage variations.

Since large firms can afford to invest on own power generation equipment, these losses are smaller for them than for small firms.|$|E
