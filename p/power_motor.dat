2500|$|... 1977 {{also saw}} two radical {{technical}} innovations {{that would change}} the future of Formula One. The purpose of Lotus's experimentation in 1976 was revealed with the Lotus 78, which brought ground effect to Formula One for the first time, using wing-profiled sidepods sealed to the ground by sliding lexan skirts. Generating radically increased downforce with significantly less drag, the Lotus 78s driven by Mario Andretti and Gunnar Nilsson won five Grands Prix in 1977. Renault unveiled the second when their RS01 made its first appearance powered by a 1.5-litre turbocharged engine, derived from their sportscar unit. Although supercharged engines were successful in the 1950s and the regulations allowing for turbocharged engines had existed for 11 years, no Formula One team had built one, feeling that the fuel consumption and turbo lag (boost lag) would negate its superior <b>power.</b> <b>Motor</b> engineer Bernard Dudot, who had observed the turbocharged Offenhauser engines used in Champ Car racing in the USA, pushed for this choice.|$|E

A team led by Tsu-Chin Tsao, a UCLA mechanical and aerospace engineering professor, collaborated with engineers from Ford to get pneumatic hybrid technology up and running.

50|$|The {{popularity}} of Mini-Z is {{partly due to}} the relatively low cost of the stock car compared to 1/10 scale RC racing and the small space requirement. This is all relative though as a fully adjustable Mini-Z with high <b>power</b> <b>motor,</b> upgraded electronics and radio, suspension and exotic material support parts can easily end up on the expense level of some of the larger scales of RC racing. However, unlike 1/10 scale racing, a moderately modified Mini-Z can be fully competitive.|$|E
50|$|Canton Lake is a {{freshwater}} reservoir {{located in}} Fulton County, Illinois. Known for its trophy sized largemouth bass and its abundant channel catfish.

The City of Canton, Illinois has various user fees for boat use and an 85 horse <b>power</b> <b>motor</b> limit. The lake {{had a large}} number of channel catfish, largemouth bass, and tiger muskie stocked over the last decade.

50|$|The Palace of Engineering (in 1925 the Palace of Housing & Transport) was {{the largest}} {{exhibition}} building. It contained a crane capable of moving 25 tons (a practical necessity, not an exhibit) and contained displays on engineering, shipbuilding, electric <b>power,</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles, railways (including locomotives, see below), metallurgy and telegraphs and wireless. In 1925 there {{seems to have been}} less emphasis on things that could also be classified as Industry, with instead more on housing and aircraft. The Palace of Industry was slightly smaller. It contained displays on the chemical industry, coal, metals, medicinal drugs, sewage disposal, food, drinks, tobacco, clothing, gramophones, gas and Nobel explosives.|$|E
50|$|In flux braking the {{increased}} current means increased losses inside the motor. The braking power is therefore also increased although the braking power {{delivered to the}} frequency converter is not increased. The increased current generates increased losses in motor resistances. The higher the resistance value the higher the braking energy dissipation inside the motor. Typically, in low power motors(below 5 kW) the resistance value of the motor is relatively large in respect to the nominal current of the motor. The higher the power or the voltage of the motor the less the resistance value of the motor in respect to motor current.In other words, flux braking is most effective in a low <b>power</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{year after}} the launching, the {{submarine}} was in completion and was due at sea {{for a series of}} trials prior being integrated into the fleet. Le Prométhée left the port of Cherbourg on Thursday July 7, 1932 towards 0900 in a northern-east direction, being the boat's fifth sortie. The trials for the day consisted of spreading the electrical motors and establish <b>power</b> <b>motor</b> curves prompting surface propulsion, developing each 3000 horsepower. The crew was then accompanied by sixteen workers of Cherbourg, five engineers and workers hailing from Creusot and one other worker. These drills were conducted under the co-joint responsibility of the boat's Commandant and the Maritime engineer (ingénieur du génie maritime) Ambroise Aveline.|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} {{diverter}} switch powerful springs are tensioned by a low <b>power</b> <b>motor</b> (motor drive unit, MDU), and then rapidly released {{to effect the}} tap changing operation. To reduce arcing at the contacts, the tap changer operates in a chamber filled with insulating transformer oil, or inside a vessel filled with pressurized SF6 gas. Reactance-type tap changers, when operating in oil, must allow for the additional inductive transients generated by the autotransformer and commonly include a vacuum bottle contact in parallel with the diverter switch. During a tap change operation, the potential rapidly increases between the two electrodes in the bottle, {{and some of the}} energy is dissipated in an arc discharge through the bottle instead of flashing across the diverter switch contacts.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} AHC {{is to keep}} a load, held by {{equipment}} on a moving vessel, motionless {{with regard to the}} seabed or another vessel. Commercial offshore cranes usually use a Motion reference unit (MRU) or pre-set measurement position detection to detect the current ship displacements and rotations in all directions. A control system, often PLC or computer based, then calculates how the active parts of the system are to react to the movement. The performance of an AHC system is normally limited by <b>power,</b> <b>motor</b> speed and torque, by measurement accuracy and delay, or by computing algortithms. Choice of control method, like using preset values or delayed signals, may affect performance and give large residual motions, especially with unusual waves.|$|E
50|$|Biogas can be {{compressed}}, {{the same}} way natural gas is compressed to CNG, and used to <b>power</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles. In the UK, for example, biogas is estimated to {{have the potential to}} replace around 17% of vehicle fuel. It qualifies for renewable energy subsidies {{in some parts of the}} world. Biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards, when it becomes bio-methane. Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its production-and-use cycle is continuous, and it generates no net carbon dioxide. Organic material grows, is converted and used and then regrows in a continually repeating cycle. From a carbon perspective, as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bio-resource as is released when the material is ultimately converted to energy.|$|E
