5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more <b>proportional</b> to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts <b>proportional</b> to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain <b>proportional.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elections for the Scottish Parliament were {{amongst the}} first in Britain to use a mixed member <b>proportional</b> {{representation}} (MMP) system. The system {{is a form of}} the additional member method (AMS) of <b>proportional</b> representation, and is better known as such in Britain. Under the system, voters are given two votes: one for a specific candidate and one for a political party.|$|E
5|$|The French TOURNESOL {{instrument}} {{consisted of}} four <b>proportional</b> counters and two optical detectors. The <b>proportional</b> counters detected photons between 2keV and 20MeV in a 6° by 6° field of view. The visible detectors {{had a field}} of view of 5° by 5°. The instrument was designed to look for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing spectral analysis of the high-energy events.|$|E
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} constructs a clustering in time <b>proportional</b> to {{the square}} of the number of points to be clustered. This is also <b>proportional</b> to the size of its input, when the input is provided {{in the form of an}} explicit distance matrix. The algorithm uses an amount of memory <b>proportional</b> to the number of points, when it is used for clustering methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other clustering methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an auxiliary data structure with which it keeps track of the distances between pairs of clusters.|$|E
5|$|The size of nuclei {{which will}} grow during {{decompression}} is inversely <b>proportional</b> to the supersaturation gradient.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power is}} thus <b>proportional</b> {{to the third}} power of the wind velocity.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely <b>proportional</b> to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is <b>proportional</b> to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model is <b>proportional</b> to {{the square of the}} mass and inversely <b>proportional</b> to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, <b>proportional</b> to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E
5|$|Further insufficiencies, such as {{rotor blade}} {{friction}} and drag, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) <b>proportional</b> {{to the third}} power of velocity remains.|$|E
5|$|If the Universe were {{contracting}} {{instead of}} expanding, {{we would see}} distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount <b>proportional</b> to their distance instead of redshifted.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont {{are elected}} from six-member {{constituencies}} using <b>proportional</b> representation {{and using the}} same constituencies as for Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Minehead {{is within}} the South West England (European Parliament constituency), which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list <b>proportional</b> representation.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{arguments}} against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of the typewriter, and is no longer needed with modern <b>proportional</b> fonts.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{conclude that}} the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, <b>proportional</b> and not cruel.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be <b>proportional</b> to the degree of viremia, and inversely <b>proportional</b> to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is <b>proportional</b> to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly <b>proportional</b> to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|Richmond is {{included}} in the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency for elections to the European Parliament. It currently elects six members using the d'Hondt method of party-list <b>proportional</b> representation.|$|E
5|$|The county prefects {{and city}} and {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms by majority of votes cast within applicable local government units. A runoff election is held if no candidate achieves {{a majority in}} the first round of voting. Members of county, city, and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through <b>proportional</b> representation; the entire local government unit forms a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council as required by the constitution. If the minorities are not represented, further members, who belong to the minorities and who have not been elected through the <b>proportional</b> representation system, are selected from electoral candidate lists and added to the council.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{assumption was}} that bubble number is directly <b>proportional</b> to decompression stress. This approach worked well for long exposures, but not when the exposure time varied considerably.|$|E
5|$|The provincial legislatures, which vary in {{size from}} 30 to 80 members, are also elected by <b>proportional</b> {{representation}} with closed lists. The premiers of each province will be chosen by the winning majority in each provincial legislature.|$|E
5|$|Weston {{is within}} the South West England {{constituency}} of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list <b>proportional</b> representation.|$|E
5|$|While {{in hiding}} during World War II, Steinhaus {{worked on the}} fair cake-cutting problem: how to divide a {{heterogeneous}} resource among several people with different preferences such that every person believes he received a <b>proportional</b> share. Steinhaus' work has initiated the modern research of the fair cake-cutting problem.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power in}} an open air stream is thus <b>proportional</b> to the third power of the wind speed; the {{available}} power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.|$|E
5|$|Convolve the {{pixelated}} {{image with}} a heat kernel to simulate its evolution under the heat equation {{for a short}} time step. The result is a Gaussian blur of the image, or equivalently the Weierstrass transform of the indicator function, with radius <b>proportional</b> to the square root of the time step.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent of the curve. Therefore, the total time for a curve to shrink to a point is <b>proportional</b> to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E
5|$|Somerton elects one Member of Parliament (MP) for Somerton and Frome county constituency, {{represented}} in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and {{is part of the}} South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list <b>proportional</b> representation.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy of}} an emitted photon is <b>proportional</b> to its frequency, so these {{specific}} energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. Each element has a characteristic spectrum that {{can depend on}} the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface is <b>proportional</b> to the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
5|$|To achieve <b>proportional</b> representation, seat {{allocation}} was conducted using the largest remainder method, whereby the Hare quota {{was used to}} determine seats automatically secured by individual parties. Any remaining seats assigned to the electoral region were allocated to remaining political parties based on the rank order of their remaining votes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>proportional</b> term {{produces}} an output value that is <b>proportional</b> {{to the current}} error value. The <b>proportional</b> response can be adjusted by multiplying the error by a constant Kp, called the <b>proportional</b> gain constant.|$|E
25|$|Because a non-zero {{error is}} {{required}} to drive it, a <b>proportional</b> controller generally operates with a so-called steady-state error. Steady-state error (SSE) is <b>proportional</b> to the process gain and inversely <b>proportional</b> to <b>proportional</b> gain. SSE may be mitigated by adding a compensating bias term to the setpoint AND output, or corrected dynamically by adding an integral term.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand has a {{multi-party system}} due to <b>proportional</b> representation; no party has won an {{outright}} majority since {{the introduction of}} <b>proportional</b> representation. The most significant constitutional change in 20th century New Zealand was {{the introduction of the}} mixed-member <b>proportional</b> (MMP) voting system in 1993. The Chief Electoral Office and the Electoral Commission co-ordinate the electoral system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proportional</b> policy: This {{involves}} re-visiting {{more often}} the pages that change more frequently. The visiting frequency is directly <b>proportional</b> to the (estimated) change frequency.|$|E
25|$|Each step either takes {{constant}} time, or involves {{finding a}} vertex cover of constant size within a graph S whose size is <b>proportional</b> {{to the number}} of neighbors ofv. Thus, the total time for the whole algorithm is <b>proportional</b> to the sum of the numbers of neighbors of all vertices, which (by the handshaking lemma) is <b>proportional</b> {{to the number of}} input edges.|$|E
25|$|A high <b>proportional</b> gain {{results in}} a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the <b>proportional</b> gain is too high, the system can become {{unstable}} (see the section on loop tuning). In contrast, a small gain {{results in a}} small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the <b>proportional</b> gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the <b>proportional</b> term should contribute {{the bulk of the}} output change.|$|E
