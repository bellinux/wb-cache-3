The <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> must be manufactured {{in a very}} symmetrical manner, as this provides the boundary conditions for the magnetic field that forms the lens.

The exact dimensions of the gap, <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> internal diameter and taper, as well as the overall design of the lens is often performed by finite element analysis of the magnetic field, whilst considering the thermal and electrical constraints of the design.|$|E
25|$|In this illustration, a solid {{copper bar}} {{conductor}} on a rotating armature is just passing under {{the tip of}} the <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.|$|E
500|$|Later, authors Vince Gordon and Peter DijkemaIt {{argue that}} the guitar sound on [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] could be created with {{distortion}} commonly achievable with a highly-overdriven early 1950s guitar amplifier. They point {{out that in the}} recording, the higher treble strings sound relatively clean, with the low E string having the most distortion; with a tube malfunction, all strings would be distorted more or less to an equal degree. [...] The authors add that this difference in sound could be achieved with the <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> for the low E string raised higher than the rest, thereby allowing it to overload the amplifier more than the treble strings. They also argue that Nashville session guitarist Grady Martin provided the guitar parts for the Trio's recording; they base this on stylistic and technical qualities, since, at the time, Martin was a more accomplished player than Burlison, and these qualities are apparent in his work on other recordings.|$|E

2500|$|The wire in a {{voice coil}} is usually made of copper, though aluminum—and, rarely, silver—may be used. [...] The {{advantage}} of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper. [...] This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency. [...] A disadvantage of aluminum {{is that it is}} not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed. [...] These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration. [...] Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the center post (called the <b>pole</b> <b>piece)</b> being the other. The <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.|$|E
2500|$|The {{size and}} type of magnet and details of the {{magnetic}} circuit differ, depending on design goals. For instance, {{the shape of the}} <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> affects the magnetic interaction between the voice coil and the magnetic field, and is sometimes used to modify a driver's behavior. A [...] "shorting ring", or Faraday loop, may be included as a thin copper cap fitted over the pole tip or as a heavy ring situated within the magnet-pole cavity. The benefits of this complication is reduced impedance at high frequencies, providing extended treble output, reduced harmonic distortion, and a reduction in the inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions. On the other hand, the copper cap requires a wider voice-coil gap, with increased magnetic reluctance; this reduces available flux, requiring a larger magnet for equivalent performance.|$|E
2500|$|As TEM samples cannot {{typically}} {{be viewed}} at a full 180° rotation, the observed images typically {{suffer from a}} [...] "missing wedge" [...] of data, which when using Fourier-based back projection methods decreases the range of resolvable frequencies in the three-dimensional reconstruction. Mechanical refinements, such as multi-axis tilting (two tilt series of the same specimen made at orthogonal directions) and conical tomography (where the specimen is first tilted to a given fixed angle and then imaged at equal angular rotational increments through one complete rotation in {{the plane of the}} specimen grid) can be used to limit the impact of the missing data on the observed specimen morphology. Using focused ion beam milling, a new technique has been proposed which uses pillar-shaped specimen and a dedicated on-axis tomography holder to perform 180° rotation of the sample inside the <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> of the objective lens in TEM. Using such arrangements, quantitative electron tomography without the missing wedge is possible. In addition, numerical techniques exist which can improve the collected data.|$|E

50|$|Early EMG pickup {{designs were}} made with a bar magnet inside for two reasons.

The second reason is that the <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> can make tuning and placement of the strings much more difficult. Using the bar magnet however gave the strings a more balanced output. The design of the bar magnet gives it a smoother distortion, better sustain through the amplifier, and have less fade onto the strings than the design of <b>pole</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Therefore, {{the limit}} to the cyclotron's output energy for a given type of {{particle}} is {{the strength of the}} magnetic field , which is limited to about 2 T for ferromagnetic electromagnets, and the radius of the dees , which is determined by the diameter of the magnet's <b>pole</b> <b>pieces.</b> So very large magnets were constructed for cyclotrons, culminating in Lawrence's 1946 synchrocyclotron, which had <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> [...] (15.3 feet) in diameter.|$|R

5000|$|The first DC {{electrical}} motors, {{from the}} Gramme motor of the 1870s onwards, used bipolar fields. These early machines used crudely designed field <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> with long magnetic circuits, wide pole gaps and narrow <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> that gave {{only a limited}} flux through the armature.

50|$|Pole {{pieces are}} used with both {{permanent}} magnets and electromagnets.
