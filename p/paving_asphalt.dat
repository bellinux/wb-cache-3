40|$|Objectives: To {{characterize}} temperature-dependent {{emissions from}} paving and built-up roof-ing asphalt (BURA) and to quantify differences in temperature-related concentrations and composition. Methods: Using headspace gas chromatography, 18 {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) emission concentrations were quantified over eight temperatures (120 – 315 C) for <b>paving</b> <b>asphalt</b> (n 5 20) and Types II, III, and IV BURA (n 5 5) and were summarized by geometric means (GMs) and geometric standard deviations (GSDs) at each temperature. The relationships between temperature and concentration were evaluated for PAH analytes using mixed-effects regression models. Temperature was categorized into regimes: Regime 1 (120 – 150 C) representing temperatures typical of <b>paving</b> <b>asphalt</b> application, Regime 2 (180 – 230 C) representing temperatures typical of BURA application, and Regime 3 (260 – 315 C) which were high temperatures outside typical application temperatures.

40|$|Abstract: For the {{interface}} end formed after <b>paving</b> <b>asphalt</b> overlay on cement concrete pavement, the stress field of interface end {{is very important}} for both structural analysis and interface design when the temperature drops. The stress field of interface end can be gotten with the crack-tip field theory that consider displacement continuation and stress equality on each side of interface, but it needs further verification to prove whether the initial stress field can satisfy far field boundary condition when temperature dropping. In conditions of different material properties, different plane dimension and different thickness of asphalt overlay the stress field is calculated with the finite element method (FEM), and the results show that the forms of theoretical solution can exactly describe stress field of {{the interface}} end when temperature dropping. The stress field of interface end indicates that when the elastic modulus of asphalt overlay becomes lager, the stress singularity’s degree of interface end will reduce. As for the interface end formed after <b>paving</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete overlay on the concrete pavement, improving the elastic modulus of asphalt overlay is beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} make {{improvements}} to conventional <b>paving</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{to make it more}} suitable for containment applications, Wilder Construction Co. of Everett, WA offers MatCon, a polymer modified asphalt system comprised of proprietary binder, when coupled with a selected aggregate type and gradation, a specialized job mix formula and installation specifications results in a potentially superior substitution for conventional <b>paving</b> <b>asphalt</b> in cover containment applications. Under US EPA’s Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) program, the system was installed and placed under study at two locations, with two more possible in 2001. MatCon is intended for use as a waste containment material, and can be configured to function as both a hydraulic barrier and as a drainage material, to comprise a single or multiple layer cover system. MatCon is noted for its superior engineering qualities and is designed for long-term performance, yet can be applied with conventional paving equipment. The hydraulic performance of the material was examined by both removing destructive samples for laboratory testing, as well as field evaluation. While the study focuses on hydraulic properties, accompanying engineering properties were evaluated in the laboratory. Finished MatCon can serve multiple purposes such as staging for trucks and construction equipment, pavement, and light industrial facilities.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Inhalation of bitumen fumes is {{potentially}} carcinogenic to humans. METHODS: We {{conducted a study}} of 29, 820 male workers exposed to bitumen in road <b>paving,</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixing and roofing, 32, 245 ground and building construction workers unexposed to bitumen, and 17, 757 workers not classifiable as bitumen workers, from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, with mortality follow-up during 1953 - 2000. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) based on national mortality rates. Poisson regression analyses compared mortality of bitumen workers to that of building or ground construction workers. RESULTS: The overall mortality was below expectation in the total cohort (SMR 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 90 - 0. 94) and in each group of workers. The SMR of lung cancer was higher among bitumen workers (1. 17, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 30) than among workers in ground and building construction (SMR 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 89 - 1. 15). In the internal comparison, the relative risk (RR) of lung cancer mortality among bitumen workers was 1. 09 (95 % CI 0. 89 - 1. 34). The results of cancer {{of the head and}} neck were similar to those of lung cancer, based on a smaller number of deaths. There was no suggestion of an association between employment in bitumen jobs and other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: European workers employed in road <b>paving,</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixing and other jobs entailing exposure to bitumen fume might have experienced a small increase in lung cancer mortality risk, compared to workers in ground and building construction. However, exposure assessment was limited and confounding from exposure to carcinogens in other industries, tobacco smoking, and other lifestyle factors cannot be ruled out...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of producing and <b>paving</b> <b>asphalt</b> at lower temperatures are beyond discussion. There is already a lot of know-how on various techniques for producing warm mix asphalt, but there is insufficient data available {{about the impact of}} these techniques on the final performance characteristics of the asphalt.

These techniques are: the use of foamed bitumen, the addition of waxes to the bitumen and the addition of zeolites to the mixture. The present paper focuses on the last technique. The performance of warm asphalt mixtures produced with different types and quantities of zeolites is compared to the performance of a reference hot mix asphalt. Several aspects have been studied: compactability, permanent deformation, water sensitivity and low temperature cracking.

40|$|Robotic {{vehicles}} that navigate autonomously are hindered by unnecessary avoidance of soft obstacles, and entrapment by potentially avoidable obstacles. Existing sensing technologies fail to reliably distinguish hard obstacles from soft obstacles, {{as well as}} impassable thickets and other sources of entrapment.

Multi- and hyper-spectral electro-optic sensors are used in remote sensing applications to classify both man-made and naturally occurring materials on the earth's surface by their reflectance spectra. The applicability of this sensing technology to obstacle identification for autonomous ground vehicle navigation is the focus of this report. The analysis is restricted to system concepts in which the multi- or hyper-spectral sensor is on-board the ground vehicle, facing forward to detect and classify obstacles ahead of the vehicle.
