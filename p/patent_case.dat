40|$|This article observes {{a startling}} new appellate {{jurisdictional}} battle waged by regional circuit courts to chip away the Federal Circuit’s exclusive jurisdiction in <b>patent</b> <b>cases.</b> The Eleventh Circuit took an unprecedented step {{by engaging in}} patent claim construction and infringement under literal infringement analysis and the doctrine of equivalents analysis. In a case of first impression, the Eleventh Circuit asserted that it legitimately has appellate jurisdiction to decide <b>cases</b> involving substantive <b>patent</b> law. Instead of grabbing jurisdiction, the Seventh Circuit, through its Chief Judge, grabbed public attention by advocating for the abolishment of the Federal Circuit’s exclusive jurisdiction over <b>patent</b> <b>cases.</b> The Chief Judge announced that the Seventh Circuit is able and ready to hear <b>patent</b> <b>cases.</b> Why do regional circuit courts now want to assert jurisdiction over <b>patent</b> <b>cases?</b> What implications {{can be drawn from}} the jurisdictional battle? Are their assertions of jurisdiction over <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> legitimate? This article addresses these urgent questions...|$|R
5000|$|According to Lex Machina {{and other}} sources, Judge Gilstrap is the United States District Judge that hears the most <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> {{in the country}} and has been {{referred}} to by many sources as the nation's single [...] "busiest patent judge". In 2016, for example, 1,119 cases were brought before Judge Gilstrap, who saw more new cases than the next 10 highest ranking judges - 2016 was also the fourth year in a row where Judge Gilstrap had more <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> than any other federal judge. [...] In 2015, over 28% of the nation's <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> were filed before him. Judge Gilstrap and United States Magistrate Judge Roy S. Payne, who are the only two judges based out of the Marshall division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, also have the most <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> filed before them out of the predominant share of the nation's <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> that are filed in the Eastern District of Texas.|$|R

Instead of a cash payment for infringement, Pfizer took the veterinary and feed-additive businesses of International Rectifier's subsidiary, Rachelle Laboratories.|$|E
25|$|On May 12, 2011, ClearCorrect filed a countersuit against Align Technology, denying {{allegations}} {{that it is}} infringing on Align patents. In the countersuit, ClearCorrect alleged that Align's allegations are invalid and accused Align of patent misuse and double patenting. The countersuit cited much of the evidence raised in Align's previous <b>patent</b> <b>case</b> against Ormco, {{which resulted in a}} federal court ruling that 11 of Align's patent claims were invalid.|$|E

40|$|Judge Rodney Gilstrap {{has a lot}} of <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> on his docket. In fact, in 2015 {{there were}} 1, 686 <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> that were filed and {{assigned}} to Judge Gilstrap, an astronomical number for a single judge. Judge Gilstrap — one of eight federal judges who sit on the Eastern District of Texas — is so popular with patent plaintiffs that over one-fourth of all <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> in the country are heard by him. This Article addresses the problems with allowing this judge shopping to occur. It reviews the scholarship on the topic that is almost universally opposed to judge shopping for reasons of judicial legitimacy. In addition to those concerns, this Article argues against judge shopping for a separate reason. Judge shopping is often a way that district courts compete for litigation. It is this competition that poses the greatest threat to judicial impartiality. To effectively root out judge shopping in <b>patent</b> <b>cases,</b> some form of venue reform is needed in patent law. Either congressional action or changes from the Supreme Court are required to more evenly distribute the <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> across the country...|$|R

500|$|Brady {{received}} his {{first taste of}} legal notoriety during the Goodyear v. Day <b>patent</b> <b>case,</b> where he worked under Daniel Webster and delivered the opening arguments for the plaintiff. Nevertheless, Brady {{is best known for}} his work as a criminal lawyer. In the quarter century preceding his death, he was involved in nearly every notable criminal proceeding in the Eastern United States. Among his most famous legal undertakings was the defense of Daniel Sickles during his trial for the murder of Philip Barton Key, the then Attorney General of the District of Columbia. During this trial, Brady worked with Edwin Stanton, who would go on to become the United States Secretary of War. Brady also defended Lew Baker at the murder trial of the infamous William [...] "Bill the Butcher" [...] Poole, whom Baker shot to death in 1855 at Stanwix Hall, a bar on Broadway in Manhattan. Over his career, Brady tried 52 criminal cases and lost only one, the case of Confederate privateer John Yates Beall.|$|E

50|$|Also, Judge Payne is the U.S. Magistrate Judge {{that has}} had the most <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> filed before him: for example, in 2016, Judge Payne had 767 new <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> filed before him, which is the highest number for any U.S. Magistrate Judge, and second amongst all federal judges, District or Magistrate, the first being U.S. District Judge James Rodney Gilstrap of the same U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas {{courthouse}} in Marshall, Texas. Moreover, in 2015, more than 25% of the nation's <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> were filed before Judge Payne and/or also Judge Gilstrap in the Marshall, Texas division of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. In 2014-2015, Judge Payne was ranked second amongst all federal judges (either District or Magistrate judge) with the most new <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> filed before him (2015:1074 cases; 2014:445 cases), the first ranked being Judge Gilstrap. According to Docket Navigator, in 2015 Judge Payne was ranked second as {{to the number of}} <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> filed before him, the number of litigants, and the number of accusations, the first again being Judge Gilstrap. Similar statistics performed by Docket Navigator rank Judge Payne the second most active federal judge (either District or Magistrate judge) by number of parties, the third most active federal judge by number of orders and the fifth most active federal judge by number of cases from the years of 2014 to 2008 (even though he came on the bench in 2011) for patent litigation.|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief that}} patent law is special has shaped {{the development of}} patent law {{into one of the}} most specialized areas of the law today. The belief in patent law’s exceptionalism manifests itself as two related presumptions with respect to the judiciary: first, that generalist judges who do not have patent law expertise cannot effectively decide <b>patent</b> <b>cases,</b> and second, that judges can develop necessary expertise through repeated experience with <b>patent</b> <b>cases.</b> Congress showed that it acquiesced to both views when it created the Federal Circuit and the Patent Pilot Program. In recent years, however, the Supreme Court has reminded us that the judiciary’s difficulty with <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> is not the law, but is instead that <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> often involve difficult subject matter, which sometimes requires technical or scientific expertise. While Congress’s early attempts to deal with these difficulties focused on courts with legal―rather than technical―expertise, the Supreme Court’s recent pronouncements suggest that they should have been doing the reverse. Moreover, to the extent that it is the underlying technology that makes <b>patent</b> <b>cases</b> difficult, that commends the use of an administrative, rather than a judicial, solution. One potentially viable answer to the judiciary’s problem with patent law has already been partly implemented in the form of the recently created Patent Trial and Appeal Board. This Article proposes expansion of that solution by making that new entity the exclusive forum for deciding issues of patent validity...|$|R
2500|$|Although Lincoln was {{prepared}} and well-paid, his co-counsel thought him too [...] "ungainly and unpresentable {{to be allowed}} to participate" [...] and present the argument. Although he was sent home unheard, Manny won the case in an opinion authored by Supreme Court Judge John McLean. Upon Lincoln's taking office, he offered Harding the job of Commissioner of Patents, which was refused. He later offered the position of United States Secretary of War to Stanton, who accepted and served. Lincoln's final <b>patent</b> <b>case</b> was Dawson v. Ennis. It occurred between his presidential nomination and the election. His electoral triumph was juxtaposed with a litigation loss for his client.|$|E
2500|$|In 1876, Edison {{began work}} {{to improve the}} {{microphone}} for telephones (at that time called a [...] "transmitter") by developing a carbon microphone that used a button of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. Up to that point, microphones, {{such as the ones}} developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it. His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later <b>patent</b> <b>case</b> against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).|$|E
2500|$|The term can {{be found}} used in an October 1845 Massachusetts Circuit Court ruling in the <b>patent</b> <b>case</b> Davoll et al. v. Brown., in which Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote that [...] "only in this way can we protect {{intellectual}} property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests are as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears." [...] The statement that [...] "discoveries are...property" [...] goes back earlier. Section 1 of the French law of 1791 stated, [...] "All new discoveries are {{the property of the}} author; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery, there shall be delivered to him a patent for five, ten or fifteen years." [...] In Europe, French author A. Nion mentioned propriété intellectuelle in his Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs, published in 1846.|$|E

60|$|One {{indirect}} effect {{that is not}} unworthy of notice in the new system is its tendency to narrow the openings for the writer by profession. If an article is to be signed, the editor will naturally seek {{the name of an}} expert of special weight and competence on the matter in hand. A reviewer on the staff of a famous journal once received for his week's task, General Hamley on the Art of War, a three-volume novel, a work on dainty dishes, and a translation of Pindar. This was perhaps taxing versatility and omniscience over-much, and it may be taken for granted that the writer made no serious contribution to tactics, cookery, or scholarship. But being a man of a certain intelligence, passably honest, and reasonably painstaking, probably he produced reviews sufficiently useful and just to answer their purpose. On the new system we should have an article on General Hamley's work by Sir Garnet Wolseley, and one on the cookery-book from M. Trompette. It is not certain that this is all pure gain. There is a {{something to be said for}} the writer by profession, who, without being an expert, will take trouble to work up his subject, to learn what is said and thought about it, to penetrate to the real points, to get the same mastery over it as an advocate or a judge does over a <b>patent</b> <b>case</b> or a suit about rubrics and vestments. He is at least as likely as the expert to tell the reader all that he wants to know, and at least as likely to be free from bias and injurious prepossession.|$|E
