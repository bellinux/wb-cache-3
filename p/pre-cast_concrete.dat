25|$|Exchange Plaza was {{designed}} by architects Peddle Thorp & Walker. It is a steel-framed structure with <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> floor panels. The exterior of the building is fully glazed with curtain walls, which step back at the upper levels. The unique blue glass was produced in a one-off batch by Pilkingtons Australia.|$|E
25|$|Kuranda Railway Station {{includes}} three early (c.1914) surviving Queensland examples of <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> railway station buildings, and {{has one of}} the few mechanically interlocked signal cabins still commissioned in Queensland. The complex is also a rare surviving resort station, comparable with those at Spring Bluff (Main Range Railway) and Yeppoon railway station.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Bank and Trust Tower is a steel-frame 28-story tower {{designed}} in 1963 by Harley, Ellington, Cowan, and Stirton for Detroit Bank and Trust (now Comerica Bank). The <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> forms filled with glass give the building a grid-like appearance. This building does {{not contribute to}} the district, but only because it is less than 50years old.|$|E
5000|$|The renovations used [...] of {{concrete}} and [...] of <b>pre-cast</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> elements. Some [...] {{of concrete}} was demolished and removed and [...] of natural stone was refurbished.|$|R
5000|$|Concrete Silo (1940s): It {{is nearly}} as tall as the barn and is used to store corn and other grains. It was built by {{stacking}} identical <b>pre-cast</b> interlocking <b>concrete</b> staves, creating a ringed appearance.|$|R
50|$|Fergusson Bridge (or the Low-level bridge) is a <b>pre-cast,</b> {{prestressed}} <b>concrete</b> {{bridge in}} Cambridge, New Zealand, spanning the Waikato River. It cost £41,000, {{was designed by}} North, Swarbrick, Mills & Westwood and opened in 1964.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea for}} these new posts {{originated}} in 1947, however {{it was only}} during 1951/52 {{as part of the}} programme to update the air defences through the Rotor Plan that more substantial buildings were built to offer at least some level of protection from the elements or attack. Although some of these new structures were built of brick, many sites received <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> panelled structures known as “Orlit” posts, after the manufacturers of the structures Messrs Orlit Ltd.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, {{now known}} as the Ashley Building, was {{designed}} by Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis and is a long, curving two-storey block linked to a five-storey whorl. The two-storey block follows the curve of the road, and has load-bearing brick cross walls. It is faced in specially-made concrete blocks. The spiral is faced with faceted <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> cladding panels. It was statutorily listed in 1993 and a refurbishment by Berman Guedes Stretton was completed in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Later {{applications}} of continuously supported track include Balfour Beatty's 'embedded slab track', {{which uses a}} rounded rectangular rail profile (BB14072) embedded in a slipformed (or <b>pre-cast)</b> <b>concrete</b> base (development 2000s). The 'embedded rail structure', used in the Netherlands since 1976, initially used a conventional UIC54 rail embedded in concrete, and later developed (late 1990s) to use a 'mushroom' shaped SA42 rail profile; a version for light rail using a rail supported in an asphalt concrete–filled steel trough has also been developed (2002).|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{proprietary}} systems, and variations include a continuous reinforced concrete slab, or alternatively the use of <b>pre-cast</b> pre-stressed <b>concrete</b> units laid on a base layer. Many permutations of design have been put forward.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{fractures}} that developed in the <b>pre-casted</b> <b>concrete</b> liner of a deep tunnel is investigated {{through a series of}} non-linear finite element analyses in plane strain regime. Three possible causes are considered, i. e. the excessive mountain pres-sure, the anisotropic in situ stress field and the incomplete filling of the rock/lining gap. The calculations are based on two numerical models, one of which accounts for the strain softening behaviour of the lining and for the rock/lining mono-lateral con-tact. The results of analyses show that the observed damages are likely to depend on the mentioned incomplete filling. On this base some conclusions are drawn on the possible procedures for the structural restoration of the opening...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{determining}} the life cycle assessment of IBS and compares the environmental impacts of building. There are two different kinds of structure has been assessed in this project namely: Timber prefabricate and <b>concrete</b> <b>pre-cast.</b> IBS is a prefabricated structure which component manufacturing in the factory and then transfer to site work for erect. Timbers prefabricate and <b>concrete</b> <b>pre-cast</b> is compared from the initial stage of extracting material to end of life. The method of LCIA in the project is Impact 2002. This project reveals that the total environmental impact of Timber prefabricated is lower than <b>concrete</b> <b>pre-cast</b> in both manufacturing and use phase 100 year life cycle of IBS. Secondly global warming and ozone layer depletion emissions from timber are also much lower than concrete...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} {{version of the}} Pickett-Hamilton fort {{consists}} of two cylinders of <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> each with one end closed. The slightly smaller of the two cylinders slides into the larger and they are kept apart by small guard rollers on the moving part that engaged with grooves. The structure is buried so that the overhanging top of the smaller cylinder lies flush with the ground. Closed in this position the pillbox is inconspicuous and allows aircraft and other vehicles to safely drive straight over it.|$|E
25|$|A second {{expansion}} {{was completed}} in 1980 that added a three-level section {{at the back of}} the mall which included a food court. This replaced the previous open-air Plaza Court and supermarket. Lenox Square now encompassed 1,040,000 leasable square feet. The new food court was soon joined by a 19-story, 370,000 sqft (gross), class-A office building, a twin-appearing 24-story hotel, 1,800 space, five-level combined hotel-office parking garage (two below ground), and 800-space four-level retail <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> parking deck. These were adjacent to the MARTA's Lenox transit station, which opened in December 1984.|$|E
25|$|Constructed on site, {{the main}} {{parabolic}} frames of St Paul's Church were of laminated timber, {{with the exception}} of the front frame which was made of <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete.</b> The first two laminated arches constructed were used as the basis for the formwork of the front concrete arch. The unusual form of the nave with its exposed internal structure led to it being compared to World War II igloos. With their large curved trusses made from small pieces of timber, igloos were a familiar building type to Oribin who had worked in the Allison Overhaul Assembly Plant igloos at Albion during World War II.|$|E
50|$|On 28 September 2016, Blackpool Pleasure Beach {{released}} {{plans for}} a new steel roller coaster entitled Construction 2018 that would be constructed by Mack Rides at the cost of £16,250,000 for the 2018 season; in addition, they released a simulated POV of the ride. Soon after on 1 December 2016, construction on the ride began, and on 30 March 2017 the foundations for the ride were around 80 percent completed with 282 concrete cylinders driven for main pilings. On 10 April 2017, the park announced the official name of the ride, Icon, with an accompanying CGI video of the rides layout. Around the time of announcement, 8,000 metres of steel tubes and <b>pre-casted</b> <b>concrete</b> piles had been placed 12 metres into the ground and 5,500 tonnes of soil had been dug out.|$|R
50|$|The Monier Ventilation Shafts {{are thought}} to have been {{constructed}} , as part of a system of ventilation shafts (either concrete or steel/iron) located at intervals along some of Brisbane's inner city arterial stormwater drains. Three concrete shafts survive (of at least five erected) and may be the first <b>pre-cast</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> structures in Queensland.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a chronic {{shortage}} of houses. In the short term this was relieved by the construction of pre-fabs with a ten-year life. The successor was the <b>pre-cast</b> re-inforced <b>concrete</b> semi-detached house. Though the frame was concrete the panels were often traditional brick, so the final building was indistinguishable from a traditionally built house.|$|R
25|$|The Milburn {{stand and}} Leazes end are double tiered, {{separated}} by a level of executive boxes; The East Stand and Gallowgate End are single tiered, with boxes also {{at the top of}} the Gallowgate. The three newest sides, the Milburn Stand, Leazes End and Gallowgate End are of structural steel frame and <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> construction. In common with many new or expanded British football stadiums, the traditional box shaped 'stands' were augmented in the 1993 expansion by filling in the corners to maximise available seating, up to a uniform height. The Milburn Stand and Leazes End now rise higher than this level, covered by a one piece cantilevered glass roof. A further smaller stand section rises above this level behind the Gallowgate End.|$|E
25|$|An {{ironworker}} is the US {{term for}} a tradesman (man or woman) {{who works in the}} ironworking industry. A structural/ ornamental Ironworker, erects (or even dismantles) the structural steel framework of pre-engineered metal buildings, single and multi-story buildings, stadiums, arenas, hospitals, towers, wind turbines, and bridges. Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with engineered drawings. Ironworkers also unload, place and tie reinforcing steel bars (rebar) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, footings, slabs, buildings and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place and set machinery and equipment and operate power hoists, forklifts, and aerial lifts. They unload, place and fasten metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate safe working practices. Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting curtain wall and window wall systems, <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> and stone, stairs and handrails, metal doors, sheeting and elevator fronts. Ironworkers perform all types of industrial maintenance as well.|$|E
25|$|A further {{suburban}} subdivision {{known as}} Graceville Estate was {{offered for sale}} in 1911 {{on the eastern side}} of the station along Verney Road. By January 1916 the level crossing dividing this roadway was eliminated and a new station was constructed in March incorporating overhead bridge access. Graceville continued to grow as a small suburban community through the interwar years. Its recreation reserve, which had been gazetted in 1904, became the site of the Graceville War Memorial, unveiled in 1929 and then became known as Graceville Memorial Park. Electricity was connected in 1920 and a picture theatre opened the following year near to the station on Honour Avenue. A Progress Association formed, and the first Agricultural Show was held in 1921. In 1924, six shops were built by Walter Taylor on Honour Avenue between Verney Road West and Rakeevan Road. He was also a driving force behind the building of the <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> Graceville Uniting Church building on Oxley Road in 1930). A state school opened in 1928 and a Catholic school in 1937.|$|E
50|$|Permanent {{blast walls}} {{can be made}} from <b>pre-cast</b> {{reinforced}} <b>concrete,</b> or steel sheeting. Various types of moveable blast wall have been manufactured.

500|$|Petru Hall, {{which was}} used for the annual school auction after the orphans left, was {{demolished}} {{to make way for the}} new performing arts center, named St. Daniel Hall, after Abbot Daniel Kucera and Saint Daniel. Constructed of brick and <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete,</b> the design includes arched entrances to match the other buildings on campus. The facility features a 369-seat auditorium, an outdoor theater complex, a rehearsal room for bands and choirs, a set-construction area, and storage areas. [...] In addition to plays and concerts, St. Daniel Hall is also used for assemblies, lectures, and masses, which had previously been held in the gymnasium.|$|E
500|$|To {{prevent future}} deluges, a major flood {{alleviation}} tunnel— completed in 1977– was constructed beneath the high street to remove excess water when the town centre was threatened with flooding. [...] The infrastructure comprises a sluice gate {{situated at the}} top of the high street near Somervale School through which the water is carried under the town via a <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> culvert several metres in diameter to an outlet further downstream at Rackvernal. [...] Since it began operation, no flooding has occurred to the high street and an Environment Agency report confirms that the relief scheme remains in good condition and continues to serve to its 100-year standard.|$|E
500|$|There are 90 Grade II* listed {{buildings}} in Sedgemoor. The oldest {{buildings in}} the list are Anglo-Saxon and Norman churches, with many more churches and churchyard crosses from the Middle Ages. There are also medieval country houses {{and the remains of}} castles. Urban architecture is represented by King Square in Bridgwater. Industrial buildings include Ashton Windmill which was built in the 18th century, on a site which has been the location of a windmill since the medieval period. In Bridgwater the Chandos Glass Cone and [...] Brick Kiln are parts of its industrial history. Related transport structures include Bridgwater railway station and the Telescopic Bridge carrying the railway over the River Parrett. The history of the drainage of the Somerset Levels is on display at the Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fact that}} Indonesia {{is located in}} the Pacific Ring of Fire in which some big {{earthquakes}} frequently occur has increased concern on the needs for temporary shelter and building safety. Hence, the use of lightweight pre-cast wall becomes one of the ideal choices to fulfill the need of rapid temporary shelter and to increase building safety. This paper reported the investigation of the properties of <b>pre-cast</b> hollow <b>concrete</b> wall panel with different thickness of partition using self compacting concrete technology. The test of concrete properties consists of compressive strength of mortar, flexural strength of hollow concrete wall, the density of the wall. In addition, the flexural strength is tested on the hollow concrete panel wall with the dimension of 1, 000 x 300 x 120 mm. The result shows that the hollow concrete panel wall satisfies the properties requirement for concrete wall. Moreover, the <b>pre-cast</b> hollow <b>concrete</b> panel wall with the partition thickness of 15 mm is the most optimum dimension of the panel wall and becomes one of appropriate technologies to provide rapid shelter for post disaster area...|$|R

500|$|The first non-concurrent {{portions}} of Route 54 to be numbered were in Maryland in 1939, when MD 467 was {{marked on the}} portion around Mardela Springs and MD 455 was marked on the portion around Delmar, which extended from where Waller Road fully enters Maryland east to Brittingham Road. The portion of road between Brittingham Road and MD 353 was county-maintained. MD 455 was extended east from Brittingham Road to DE 26 in 1958. In 1968, DE 32 {{was assigned to the}} entire highway within Delaware; the Maryland sections were still marked as MD 467 and MD 455. [...] The whole highway was marked as Route 54 in 1969. [...] In addition to the concurrencies with DE 26 and DE 30, Route 54 has been concurrent with DE 20. [...] DE 20 was extended east of Dagsboro to terminate in Fenwick Island along with Route 54 by 1994. [...] DE 20's eastern terminus was rolled back to its present location in 2005. Despite this, some DE 20 shields are posted along DE 54 between that route's eastern terminus and Fenwick Island. In September 2001, construction began to build an elevated causeway for Route 54 to the west of Fenwick Island in order to prevent flooding from high tides and storms. The project involved building the new causeway {{to the north of the}} original alignment, using <b>pre-cast</b> <b>concrete</b> segments. The project, which cost over $15 million, was slated to be finished in August 2003. In 2010, a $10 million project began to add a center left-turn lane along with bike lanes and sidewalks to the portion of Route 54 between DE 20 and Mallard Lakes, a section of road that was targeted for safety improvements due to rapid development; this project was completed in 2012.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{construction}} of 156,622 temporary housing programme prefabs the United Kingdom still faced an acute housing shortage and waiting lists soared in urban areas. Local authorities took then {{took the lead in}} building new homes despite a shortage of materials and the hard winter of 1947. New estates were created and established ones expanded. To meet the shortage and bring the cost of housing down, a new form of construction was pioneered, commonly called ‘PRC’ (<b>Pre-cast</b> Reinforced <b>Concrete).</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of new high speed railway infrastructure in many European countries is actually a great civil engineering effort. One of the main design issues {{is related to the}} fact that trains at speeds above 220 km/h may induce resonance effects in structures as bridges, subway frames, etc. In consequence, the design of such structures requires dynamic calculations. Several methods are available for the dynamic calculations of structures under high speed train loads. The simplest ones are based on sums of harmonic terms, providing upper bounds for the dynamic response, and with application limited to isostatic bridges. Alternatively, for statically indeterminate structures some models based on the direct time integration of the equations of motion are available. These methodologies suitable for hyperestatic structures, performed on full or reduced models, are discussed in this paper. Additionally, some recent results for high speed traffic loads on bridges are presented. The object of these studies is diverse: simplified torsion analysis, a proposal of a simplified method for dynamic analysis of portal frames, and several practical results obtained for concrete bridges, composite steel-concrete bridges and <b>pre-casted</b> <b>concrete</b> bridges...|$|R
5|$|The deck of {{the bridge}} was formed by <b>pre-casting</b> {{individual}} <b>concrete</b> units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks {{at the ends of}} the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction, over a total of six traffic lanes.|$|R
