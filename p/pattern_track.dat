40|$|The {{industrial}} {{application of the}} laser transformation hardening technology is presently restricted by a common lack of know how. Optimum results can be achieved only if the processing parameters are determined {{on the basis of}} temperature field calculations. Using a lot of stored solutions of the heat diffusion equation as well as a simple model of transformation kinetics and enclosed thermophysical data for common iron base materials, the personal computer program GEOPT calculates within about one second the required processing parameter values from a user defined set of conditions for the laser induced temperature field and/or the desired hardening and annealing zone geometries. The physical and mathematical foundations of the program, its possibilities and limits of application, possible sources of errors or inaccuracies, and a series of characteristic examples of application are discussed, concerning especially the hardening of edges and the influence of workpiece geometry, the opt imization of the laser track <b>pattern</b> (<b>track</b> shape and distance), predete on of the expected hardness, and applications to beam shaping and beam scanning. GEOPT is recommended for preestimating the realizability and economical efficiency of laser hardening for a concrete task, for the determination and optimization of the processing parameter values, the predetermination of results to be expected, and for obtaining a graphical overview over functional relations...|$|E
40|$|A new 6 / 4 {{double-sided}} interior permanent-magnet (IPM) flat linear {{brushless motor}} (IPM-FLBM) and novel optical potentiometer mechanism for a linear motion-control system {{are presented in}} this dissertation. For this purpose, new detent-force-minimization methodologies for the IPMFLBM are studied {{on the basis of}} the superposition principle. The end-effect force is reduced by a new two-dimensional optimization using the step-shaped end frames. The cogging force is minimized through a destructive interference using the slot-phase shift between the upper and lower stators. A base model prototype with the detent force of only 1. 5 % of the maximum thrust force is developed using the electrical solid steel. Analytic modeling techniques of the base model prototype with slot-phase shift and alternate teeth windings are investigated. A variable winding function is newly developed to evaluate the inductances of the salient motor with the alternate teeth windings. The steady-state thrust force is modeled for this linear brushless AC (BLAC) motor. Their validities are demonstrated experimentally. The electromagnetic and steady-state performance analyses of a new prototype using a soft magnetic composite (SMC) material are also studied using a simplified nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) analysis. Its iron and copper losses are investigated in terms of the thermal limitation. The feasibility of the IPM-FLBM using the SMC material is demonstrated through the comparisons of the average steady-state thrust and ripple forces for these two prototype linear motors. A novel low-cost high-precision absolute displacement-sensing mechanism using optoelectronic components is developed. The working principle that is based on the change of the optical power that is reflected off the monotone-colored <b>pattern</b> <b>track</b> from a light emitting diode (LED) to a red-green-blue (RGB) photo diode (PD) is presented. The performance of the proposed optical potentiometer (OP) mechanism is verified by the bandwidth (BW) of 4. 42 kHz and nonlinearity of 2. 8 % are achieved. A novel low-ripple 12 -step current control scheme using a single current sensing resistor is developed using the six Hall-effect sensors for the force control of the IPMFLBM. Its performances are experimentally verified and compared with a conventional field-oriented control (FOC) scheme. In the end, the position-control loop, which includes the 12 -step current control loop, double-sided IPM-FLBM, and linear optical potentiometer (LOP), is designed using a proportional controller with a lead compensator. The performances of the linear motion-control system are demonstrated through the various experiments in the time and frequency domains...|$|E

The spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>tracking</b> between the one-gram averaged surface-SAR and external magnetic near-field is demonstrated on the horizontal cross sectional perimeter of the head model. The regression coefficients between them are also obtained on the fifty-five horizontal cross sectional perimeters, which could give an approximate value of the surface-SAR in an acutual head, if the external magnetic near-field would be measured.

40|$|Speckles {{have been}} {{considered}} ubiquitous in all scattering-based coherent imaging technologies. However, as an optical-absorption-based coherent imaging technology, photoacoustic (PA) tomography (PAT) suppresses speckles by building up prominent boundary signals. We theoretically study the dependence of PAT speckles on the boundary roughness, which is quantified by the root-mean-squared value and the correlation length of the boundary height. Both the speckle visibility and the correlation coefficient between the reconstructed and actual boundaries are quantified. If the root-mean-squared height fluctuation is much greater than, and the height correlation length is {{much smaller than the}} imaging resolution, the reconstructed boundaries become fully developed speckles. In other words, speckle formation requires large uncorrelated height fluctuations within the resolution cell. The first- and second-order statistics of PAT speckles are also studied experimentally. While the amplitude of the speckles follows a Gaussian distribution, the autocorrelation of the speckle <b>patterns</b> <b>tracks</b> that of the system point spread function...|$|R
