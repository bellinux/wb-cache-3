Minaj told MTV News that the sound of The Pinkprint would be [...] "next level" [...] and will have [...] "so much to talk about", saying: [...] "I'm really excited and the people that have been working with me now, have been <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't worked with before so it's like they're bringing a new sound to the album that I've never experimented with." ...|$|E

In the year following the riots, tension continued growing. Syed Jaafar Albar declared that [...] "Wherever I am, I am a Malay", drawing harsh return fire from Lee, who stated in Parliament: [...] "If I had been going round and saying what [...] has been saying — wherever I am, I am a Chinese — where would we be?

He released two more EPs—Kaleidoscope Dream: Water Preview on July 31 and Air Preview on September 11— to digital retailers. In an interview for The Village Voice, Miguel said that the strategy allowed listeners to absorb the songs at his desired pace and called it [...] "a great {{way for me to}} reconnect with my peers ... the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hang out with—that go to the same shows, listen to the same music, read the same blogs, same magazines." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Dave Hughes {{first started}} working for Adult Swim in 2003 after an eight-year stint with MTV Animation, {{where he had}} edited series such as Beavis and Butt-head and Celebrity Deathmatch. Hughes, who saw Adult Swim [...] "slipping away from its more {{experimental}} roots" [...] as it got popular, had the concept for Off the Air in mind before, but never {{thought he would be}} the one to make it. While living in New York, 120 Minutes, Concrete TV, Liquid Television and Night Flight were among some of the experimental programming that exposed him [...] "to a whole new world of ideas, music and <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> just didn't see anywhere else on television." ...|$|E

I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to my record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was worth a record deal. After that, I had the same problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} greeted with {{widespread}} derision in preview screenings. An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics, and others greeted the film with guffaws and hoots at a screening in Century City while other viewers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore responded with derisive laughter or simply walked out. At a post-launch publicity event, Travolta, on asking assembled journalists if they had enjoyed it, received no reply. He later asserted that other filmmakers had enjoyed the movie: [...] "When I felt better about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, {{and a lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt knew what they were doing, saw it and {{thought it was a great}} piece of science fiction." [...] Christian also spoke of an initially positive reception, mentioning an enthusiastic response from both the audience and Tarantino.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{said that}} while filming her highly {{anticipated}} kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was [...] "extremely uncomfortable" [...] but that she herself was not. [...] "I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [...] than kissing {{any of the other}} <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to kiss", she said. Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{continuing}} crisis {{reached a}} {{point of no return}} when the Cortes dissolved the central government in Rio de Janeiro and ordered Pedro's return. This was perceived by Brazilians as an attempt to subordinate their country again to Portugal—Brazil had not been a colony since 1815 and had the status of a kingdom. On 9 January 1822, Pedro was presented with a petition containing 8,000 signatures that begged him not to leave. He replied, [...] "Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am staying." [...] Avilez again mutinied and tried to force Pedro's return to Portugal. This time the prince fought back, rallying the Brazilian troops (which had not joined the Portuguese in previous mutinies), militia units and armed civilians. Outnumbered, Avilez surrendered and was expelled from Brazil along with his troops.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} co-produced by Canadian electro-pop band Dragonette, with Martina Sorbara. Roberts stated that Dragonette {{were among the}} first people who worked on the record. Roberts {{discussed}} the 1940s influence on the record, noting [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She stated that {{when it came to the}} production of the track she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point. The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> went in with when I started making the record. I learnt a lot from them. They're really lovely people, they work really hard, they're so talented." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Mosley {{challenged}} Balestre for {{the presidency}} of FISA. Mosley said that his decision to challenge the Frenchman was prompted by Balestre's reported intervention {{on behalf of his}} countryman Alain Prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix. Mosley campaigned on the basis that Balestre, who was also president of the FIA and of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, could not effectively manage all these roles together. He also said that no-one challenged Balestre because they were afraid of the consequences and suggested that the FISA President should not interfere with F1, which could be left to run itself. Mosley won the FISA presidency by 43 votes to 29; Balestre remained as FIA president. Mosley resigned a year later, fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re-affirmation of his mandate. [...] "I wanted to show <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do what I say", he said. [...] "Now they can judge me in a year's time." [...] FISA immediately re-elected him.|$|E
500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to my memory and tell the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E

500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved ones that I have and the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care about in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{included}} in Pitchforks list of their staff's favorite music books. Contributing writer Matthew Perpetua said the book's writers—either top critics at the time or those who have since become important figures in music journalism—outline the [...] "alternative sensibility" [...] by recognizing and connecting music from disparate genres in [...] "an inclusive, open-minded survey, but it's defined as much by what's left out—pretty much all Boomer-oriented rock—as what it includes." [...] According to Perpetua, the [...] "number of young readers [...] pursued music criticism" [...] because of the book was far greater than the copies it sold. Matthew Schnipper, editor of The Fader, bought the book after it was published and said he {{used it as a}} consumer guide for 10 years. Along with its influence on future critics, the book was cited by guitarist William Tyler as his only source of music education growing up, having found it in a bookstore around the time it was published: [...] "They had entries for all these different <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never heard of: Can, John Zorn, [...] Fahey, whatever... That was before any sort of Internet presence".|$|E

The visual finally saw its premiere on YouTube on 1 February 2017. Inna thanked her crew in an interview, [...] "It is a joy and pleasure to film the video in Mexico, a place in this world where I feel the love and the kindness of the people. Also, I have worked with friends, <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> trust and appreciate, like Edward Aninaru, John Perez and Khaled Mokhtar. I thank them for their professionalism." [...] The clip reached over five million views on YouTube in one week, to which the singer replied, [...] "I didn't expect such a positive feedback {{in such a short}} time, thus I want to thank to my fans in the entire world.
