40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the pathologic changes of jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> before and after jumping and effects of icing after jumping. Sixteen healthy college students and sixteen collegiate volleyball players with jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> were divided into two groups by eight, without icing group and with icing group after jumping exercise. Without icing groups rested for 20 minutes, while with icing groups were treated with ice for 20 minutes after eighty times of jumping. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) and sectional area of patellar tendon with Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the tenderness of patellar tendon with visual analog scale were measured before and after exercise, following with or without icing and 24 and 48 hours later from the treatment. In jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> group, significant increase was found in the SNR, sectional area of patellar tendon, and tenderness of patellar tendon after exercise compared to before exercise. In addition, in jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> with icing group, significant decrease was found in the SNR, sectional area of patellar tendon after icing and 24 and 48 hours after icing, and the tenderness of patellar tendon after icing compared to after exercise. These results suggested that icing was an effective treatment for jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> after exercise...|$|R

Setting : Institutional athlete study group in Australia. Participants : Fifty-six elite adolescent basketball players participated in this study, thirteen comprised the jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> group, fifteen athletes formed a control group. Intervention : Each subject performed each loading test for baseline and reliability data on the first testing day. Subjects then performed three days of intensive (6 h daily) basketball training, after which each loading test was reexamined. Main outcome measures : Eleven point interval scale for pain. Results : The tests that best detected a change in pain due to intensive workload were the single leg decline squat and single leg decline hop. This study found that decline tests have better discriminative ability than the standard squat to detect change in jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> pain due to intensive training. The typical error for these tests ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 5, however, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these reliability figures due to relatively low scores. Conclusions : The single leg decline squat is recommended in the physical assessment of adolescent jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee.</b> The decline squat was selected as the best clinical test over the decline hop because it was easier to standardise performance. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Background— Palpation is an {{important}} clinical test for jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee.</b> Objectives— To (a) test the reproducibility of palpation tenderness, (b) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of palpation in subjects with clinical symptoms of jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee,</b> and (c) determine whether tenderness to palpation {{may serve as a}} useful screening test for patellar tendinopathy. The yardstick for diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy was ultrasonographic abnormality. Methods— In 326 junior symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes 2 ̆ 7 tendons, palpation was performed by a single examiner before ultrasonographic examination by a certified ultrasound radiologist. In 58 tendons, palpation was performed twice to test reliability. Tenderness to palpation was scored on a scale from 0 to 3 where 0 represented no pain, and 1, 2, and 3 represented mild, moderate, and severe tenderness respectively. Results— Patellar tendon palpation was a reliable examination for a single examiner (Pearson r = 0. 82). In symptomatic tendons, the positive predictive value of palpation was 68...|$|R

40|$|Patellar tendon {{ultrasound}} {{appearance is}} commonly used in clinical practice to diagnose patellar tendinopathy and guide management. Using a longitudinal study design we examined {{whether or not the}} presence of a hypoechoic ultrasonographic lesion in an asymptomatic patellar tendon conferred a risk for developing jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> compared with a tendon that was ultrasonographically normal. Ultrasonographic, symptomatic and anthropometric assessment was completed at baseline and followup. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on four tendons that resolved ultrasonographically in the study period. Forty-six patellar tendons were followed over 47 ± 11. 8 months. Eighteen tendons were hypoechoic at baseline and 28 were ultrasonographically normal. Five tendons resolved ultrasonographically in the study period. Magnetic resonance imaging in four of these tendons was normal. Seven normal patellar tendons at baseline developed a hypoechoic area but only two became symptomatic. Analysis of ultrasonography at baseline and clinical outcome with Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test shows there is no association between baseline ultrasound changes and symptoms at followup. In this study there is no statistically significant relationship between ultrasonographic patellar tendon abnormalities and clinical outcome in elite male athletes. Management of jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> should not be solely based on ultrasonographic appearance; clinical assessment remains the cornerstone of appropriate management. <br /...|$|R
