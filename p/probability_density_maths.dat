40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an integro-differential {{diffusion}} equation for continuous time random walk that is valid for a generic waiting time <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> function. Using this equation we also study diffusion behaviors {{for a couple}} of specific waiting time <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> functions such as exponential, and a combination of power law and generalized Mittag-Leffler function. We show that for the case of the exponential waiting time <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> function a normal diffusion is generated and the <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> function is Gaussian distribution. In the case of the combination of a power-law and generalized Mittag-Leffler waiting <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> function we obtain the subdiffusive behavior for all the time regions from small to large times, and <b>probability</b> <b>density</b> function is non-Gaussian distribution.
