Demineralised Bone Matrix (DBM) and recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (rh-BMP’s) were also introduced to replace the time-honoured autograft. Is there currently still a place for bone autograft? The authors reviewed the orthopaedic surgical activ-ity in their institution during the period 2003 - 2005, and traced all the surgical procedures in which bone grafting was performed. Tracking forms from the tissue bank were reviewed to assess the surgical indi-cations. Between 2003 and 2005, the use of autografts decreased from 1. 3 % to 0. 9 % of all surgical inter-ventions, particularly owing to their decreased use in <b>primary</b> <b>fusions,</b> while the use of allografts increased from 10. 7 % to 12. 7 %. Indications for allografts cov-ered all fields of orthopaedic surgery, including non-unions. Processed allografts represented 90 % of all grafts used. DBM and rh-BMP were used on an exceptional basis. There is currently a trend for surgeons to use allo-grafts as substitutes for autografts, as processing of the allografts increases their safety while preserving most of their biological and mechanical properties. Autografting is now limited to revision operations after failed fusions, and to combined use at the junc-tion with massive allografts. DBM and rh-BMP are still controversial but they might replace autografts, even in their currently remaining indications, if their cost effectiveness and efficiency are established...|$|R

40|$|As the {{population}} of the United States undergoes significant qualitative and quantitative changes the healthcare needs of {{the population}} changes accordingly. Since the “old-old ” ≥ 85 years sector of the population is growing fast we embarked on studying how spine surgery profile changes across age groups. Methods: A database of 6147 spine surgery patients operated in a tertiary care center in Middle Georgia between 2003 and 2009 was divided to four age groups. The threshold for old-old age was set at 75. The percentage of old-old patients was calculated and their spine surgery profile for the whole period was studied. Changes in spine surgery profile were evaluated in relation to age group and gender. Type of surgery was determined by ICD- 9 code. Results: For the whole study period, the percentage of old-old spine surgery patients was 6. 7 %. The percentage of old-old spine surgery patients increased from 4. 7 % in 2003 to 7. 3 % in 2009. Females were preponderant in the later three age groups (53. 8 %, 53. 2 % and 55. 0 %) while males were more in the < 40 group (52. 8 %). Significant differences in the spine surgery profile between age groups were detected (Χ 2 = 1446. 958, P = 0. 000). The spine surgery profile for the whole study period was characterized by shifts in the ≥ 75 age group toward less <b>primary</b> <b>fusions</b> of the cervical and lumbar spine and more refusions of the lumbar spine, more intervertebral disk excisions and more canal exploratory operations in older-old patients.

In experiments at the 60 -beam OMEGA laser facility, utilizing capsules with D- 2, (DHe) -He- 3, DT, or DTH fuel in a shell of plastic, glass, or D- 2 ice, we now routinely make spectral measurements of <b>primary</b> <b>fusion</b> products (p, D, T, He- 3, alpha), secondary fusion products (p), "knock-on" particles (p, D, T) elastically scattered by primary neutrons, and ions from the shell. Use is made of several types of spectrometers that rely on detection and identification of particles with CR- 39 nuclear track detectors in conjunction with magnets and/or special ranging filters. CR- 39 is especially useful because of its insensitivity to electromagnetic noise {{and its ability to}} distinguish the types and energies of individual particles, as illustrated here by detailed calibrations of its response to 0. 1 - 13. 8 MeV protons from a Van de Graaff accelerator and to p, D, T, and alpha from ICF experiments at OMEGA.

30|$|Experience in {{conservative}} {{management of the}} os calcis fracture has shown that better results are achieved with early joint movement.

Most of our patient presented with late sequelae of a fractured os calcis. The mean fracture-to-fusion interval was 2 (± 1.6) years ranging from 6  months to 6  years post fracture. Despite this range, we noted that the shorter the interval, the better the post fusion AOFAS clinical score. We agree with advocates of early fusion that better clinical outcomes can be achieved before evident subtalar arthritis and stiffness become well established and arthritis of neighbouring joints become manifest. Nevertheless, in fractures with significant comminution, a reasonable time interval should be allowed for the fracture fragments to settle and provide a stable platform for the arthrodesis.|$|E

Contrary to the unstable Ncd situation, however, these frequencies remain low even with purified donor DNA.
