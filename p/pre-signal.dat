The {{release of a}} large amount of free Ca2+ can trigger a fertilized egg to develop, skeletal muscle cells to contract, secretion by secretory cells and interactions with Ca2+ -responsive proteins like calmodulin. To maintain low concentrations of free Ca2+ in the cytosol, cells use membrane pumps like calcium ATPase found in the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. These pumps are needed to provide the steep electrochemical gradient that allows Ca2+ to rush into the cytosol when a stimulus signal opens the Ca2+ channels in the membrane. The pumps are also necessary to actively pump the Ca2+ back out of the cytoplasm and return the cell to its <b>pre-signal</b> state.|$|E

40|$|Various {{obstructions}} {{exist that}} can impede maximum vehicle flow through signalised intersections. Examples include buses or freight vehicles dwelling at loading areas near the intersection, stalled vehicles, <b>pre-signals</b> that temporarily block car traffic to provide bus priority, on-street parking manoeuvres and permanent road fixtures. If {{the effects of}} these obstructions are not recognised or accounted for, vehicle discharge capacities at these critical locations can be overestimated, leading to ineffective traffic management strategies. This paper examines the capacity of an isolated signalised intersection when a nearby roadway obstruction is present in either the upstream or downstream direction. To quantify the loss of capacity caused by an obstruction, the paper applies the variational theory of kinematic waves in a moving-time coordinate system, which simplifies the traditional variational theory by reducing the number of local path costs that must be considered. The result is a simple recipe that requires few calculations and can be used to gain insights into signal operations when obstructions are present. Capacity formulae for general cases are also developed from the recipe. The results, recipe and formulae can be used to guide policies on the location of obstructions that can be controlled, like bus stops, <b>pre-signals</b> or permanent road fixtures and to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of obstructions that can be identified in real time.

To define efficient therapy, the origin of tumor-forming cells needs to be elucidated in order to search for new therapeutic pathways. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the different cell populations constituting a human glioblastoma cell line, U- 87 MG and their sensitivity to apoptosis induced through the activation of Fas, a membranous death receptor. By a cell sorting method, the sedimentation field flow fractionation, two major cell subpopulations were identified, a most differentiated cell fraction, containing large and adherent cells, sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis and another one, characterized by small cells forming aggregates, expressing CD 133, a marker of stem cells and more resistant to Fas-activated apoptosis. By using a selective method of culture, adapted for neural stem cell cultures, we have verified that the U- 87 MG cell line contained cancer stem cells similar to the immature ones obtained by the cell sorting method. Interestingly, while these tumor stem cells, expressing CD 133, were resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis, monomeric form of Fas protein was detected predominantly in these cells. In contrast, the most mature cells, responsive to Fas-activated apoptosis, collected in another cell fraction, contained oligomeric aggregates of Fas protein, a <b>pre-signalling</b> form of the Fas receptor, essential for the initiation of apoptosis through its activation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} new signal operation strategy aimed at efficient utilization of green time by {{cutting down on}} the start up and response loss times. The idea {{is to have a}} "pre-signal" on each main approach a few hundred feet upstream of the intersection in addition to the main intersection signal, which is coordinated with the <b>pre-signal.</b> The offset between the main and <b>pre-signal</b> ensures that the majority of start up losses does not occur at the main signal. The benefits of the system under various traffic conditions were evaluated based on analysis of the queue discharge process and Corridor Simulation (CORSIM) study. The proposed measure should reduce the travel time and total control delay for the signalized network. To attain the objective the following two studies were undertaken: 1. Development of a queue discharge model to investigate the expected benefits of the system. 2. Simulation of the system: In {{the second part of the}} research, the proposed strategy was tested using CORSIM to evaluate its performance vis-????-vis the baseline case. The queue discharge model (QDM) was found to be linear in nature in contrast to prior expectations. The model was used to quantify the benefits obtained from the <b>pre-signal</b> system. The result of this analysis indicated that the proposed strategy would yield significant travel time savings and reductions in total control delay. In addition to the QDM analysis, CORSIM simulations were used to code various hypothetical scenarios to test the concept under various constraints and limitations. As per expectations, it was found that the system was beneficial for high demand levels and longer offsets. The upper limit on offsets was determined by visual observation of platoon dispersion and therefore the maximum offset distance was restricted to 450 feet. For scenarios where split phasing was used, the break even point in terms of demand level was found to be 2500 vph on a three lane approach, whereas that for a lag-lag type of phasing strategy was found to be 1800 vph, also on a three lane approach...|$|E
40|$|To {{deal with}} the {{conflicts}} between left-turn and through traffic streams and increase the discharge capacity, this paper addresses the <b>pre-signal</b> which is implemented at a signalized intersection. Such an intersection with <b>pre-signal</b> is termed as a tandem intersection. For the tandem intersection, phase swap sorting strategy is deemed as the most effective phasing scheme in view of some exclusive merits, such as easier compliance of drivers, and shorter sorting area. However, a major limitation of the phase swap sorting strategy is not considered in previous studies: if one or more vehicle is left at the sorting area after the signal light turns to red, {{the capacity of the}} approach would be dramatically dropped. Besides, previous signal control studies deal with a fixed timing plan that is not adaptive with the fluctuation of traffic flows. Therefore, to cope with these two gaps, this paper firstly takes an in-depth analysis of the traffic flow operations at the tandem intersection. Secondly, three groups of loop detectors are placed to obtain the real-time vehicle information for adaptive signalization. The lane selection behavior in the sorting area is considered to set the green time for intersection signals. With the objective of minimizing the vehicle delay, the signal control parameters are then optimized based on a dynamic programming method. Finally, numerical experiments show that average vehicle delay and maximum queue length can be reduced under all scenarios...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSignalized intersections often {{represent}} {{a major source}} of bus delays. One typical strategy to mitigate this problem is to dedicate an existing car lane for bus-use only to minimize the interactions between cars and buses. However, this is physically impossible at approaches where only a single travel lane is available for each direction. To this end, this research explores a novel method to provide priority to buses at signalized intersections with single-lane approaches through the use of additional signals in a way that (nearly) eliminates bus delays while minimizing the negative impacts imparted to cars. Using these signals, the bus can jump a portion of the car queue using the travel lane in the opposite direction. This paper theoretically quantifies the delay savings buses can achieve, and the negative impacts imparted onto cars when this <b>pre-signal</b> strategy is applied. The negative impacts are measured as the additional car delays experienced when the intersection signal is under-saturated, and the reduction in car-discharge capacity when the intersection signal is over-saturated. In the under- saturated case, the results show that moderate average bus delay savings (∼ 5 - 7 seconds per vehicle) are achieved if the <b>pre-signal</b> is always in operation; and these results decrease the total system-wide delay (measured in person-hours) only if bus occupancies are very high. However, if the <b>pre-signal</b> operation is targeted to only provide priority to the buses that would benefit the most, significant bus delay savings can be achieved (delay benefits to buses which receive priority are about doubled) while also reducing the system-wide delay, even if the ratio of bus to car occupancy is relatively modest (greater than about 20). In the over-saturated case, bus delay savings can be much more significant than under-saturated cases (greater than 30 seconds per bus), and this delay saving can increase further for longer block lengths (greater than 100 m). However, the capacity of the intersection decreases by up to 25 % during each cycle in which a bus arrives to the intersection. Simulation tests confirmed that the general trends and magnitudes of bus delay savings and negative impacts to cars hold for more realistic behaviors. The overall benefits are slightly smaller in the simulations, but nevertheless the strategy seems promising as a bus priority strategy at intersections with single-lane approaches in the field...|$|E

The revolutions and innovations in last era, to develop the interface of neuroscience and engineering lead to the advent of the field of Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} novel approach to Internet congestion control known as Probabilistic Congestion Notification (PCN). Preliminary research has established the requirements and motivations for a more efficient Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control schemes. Because of the substantial increase in the the number of Internet users and the diversification of online services, {{the dynamics of the}} Internet are changing, making classical congestion control mechanisms inefficient. Traditionally, TCP has relied on packet loss as an indication of congestion. Though packet loss is a typical result of overflowing buffers, it cannot be used to prevent congestion before it occurs. Consequently, a novel protocol is proposed in this thesis, which allows congestion notification and control via packet marking. This new protocol is elegant as it makes use of the existing one-bit Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field in the Internet Protocol (IP) header. Each PCN data packet can be marked probabilistically by one router at most. Furthermore, PCN performance has been improved by <b>pre-signalling</b> the number of intervening queues along the path. The level of load factor (congestion measure) at each link is fed back to the PCN source, which then estimates the exact level of congestion at each intermediate queue, one-step ahead of time. By knowing this, the source can take avoiding action either by adjusting its sending rate or by using alternate routes. The estimation mechanism uses Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Time Series Analysis {{to improve the quality of}} the congestion estimate and to predict the level of congestion at each queue along the path. For this purpose, the work presented in this thesis also analyses the suitability and accuracy of such statistical methods in predicting future congestion levels. The new PCN congestion control protocol has been designed and simulated in the network simulator (ns- 2). Moreover, this project evaluates PCN’s performance using real high speed Internet traffic traces. Results show that the methods can successfully predict the congestion level at any queue along the path. The proposed approach has low complexity and it is easy to implement. Furthermore, it can be easily deployed in existing TCP/IP networks as it does not require modifications to existing IP or TCP implementations...|$|R
40|$|Many City Authorities in Europe are now {{seeking to}} tackle {{increasing}} congestion and pollution through demand management and improved public transport. An {{important contribution to}} this strategy is the provision of public transport priority, both through physical segregation and through other priority techniques. In the U. K., effort {{in recent years has}} focused particularly on the provision of bus priority at traffic signals, using a variety of techniques including gating, <b>pre-signals,</b> queue relocation and selective vehicle (bus) detection (SVD). With SVD, priority is provided to individual detected buses by extending or recalling the green signal, subject to the constraints of the priority strategy. Most of {{the development and implementation of}} bus priority using SVD in the U. K. has occurred in London. The first major implementation occurred in the SELKENT bus district, where 900 buses were fitted with transponders to activate priority at 56 isolated junctions. Evaluation (University of Southampton, 1987) indicated an economic payback period of about one year and has led to system expansion so that 300 isolated junctions now offer SVD bus priority. More recently, active bus priority has been developed for the SCOOT UTC system within the European Commission funded DRIVEII project PROMPT (Hounsell and Landles, 1995). This has been implemented in London at 19 junctions in the Camden Town and Edgware Road SCOOT areas, with field trials indicating an economic payback period of around 16 months. Following these successful trials (Hounsell et al, 1996), bus priority has been included in the latest version of SCOOT (V 3. 1) released recently by TRL (Bretherton and Bowen, 1996). Development of bus priority in fixed time UTC areas is now underway in London, following similar principles. Bus detection in London has been based on bus-mounted transponders interacting with bus detectors which are sited typically 70 m- 100 m upstream of the stopline. This location has been shown to allow reasonable accuracy in journey time prediction from detection to clearing the stopline whilst also allowing reasonable response time for the signals, assuming the priority request can be actioned immediately (i. e. at the local controller, rather that at the UTC centre). A longer detection distance is desirable where the link is "dean" (giving consistent predictable journey times) or where central control is operated (where a 4 - 5 second communications delay occurs). Detection is always downstream of bus stops, due to the unpredictable waiting time involved, so that a detection distance less than 70 m is sometimes necessary with a consequent reduction in bus delay savings. Bus priority of this form has also been introduced in other U. K. cities, such as Southampton, where "footprint" detection has been used (no bns-mounted equipment is then required). Bus priority has also been trialled at some junctions in Southampton using radio-based Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) for locating buses approaching traffic signals, with this information being passed directly to the UTC system for priority activation. (Buses using a trial corridor in Southampton have been fitted with AVL as part of the STOPWATCH system for real-time passenger information at bus stops.) In this case, buses are located every 20 - 30 seconds according to the radio polling cycle, rather than at a fixed point, and the potential exists for implementing selective priority according to bus status (adherence to schedule, occupancy, etc.). For given bus, traffic and site characteristics, two key factors determining the effectiveness of bus priority at traffic signals have been shown to be (i) detection location (through inductive loops or AVL) and (ii) journey time predictive accuracy. These factors have provided the focus of a project undertaken by the University of Southampton for the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under grant GR/J 92439.

We particularly pursue the well-known problem of image reconstruction formulated in this case as shape isolation {{in the presence of a}} broadly defined noise. This combined approach is enabled by the intrinsic feature of seismogram which can be divided objectively into a <b>pre-signal</b> seismic noise with lack of the target shape, and the remainder that contains scattered waveforms compounding the coda shape. In short, we separately apply shape restoration procedure to <b>pre-signal</b> seismic noise and the event record, which provides successful delineation of the coda shape in the form of a smooth almost non-oscillating function of time. The new algorithm uses a recently developed generalization of classical computational-geometry tool of alpha-shape. The generalization essentially yields robust shape estimation by ignoring locally a number of points treated as extreme values, noise or non-relevant data. Our algorithm is conceptually simple and enables the desired or pre-determined level of shape detail, constrainable by an arbitrary data fit criteria. The proposed tool for coda shape delineation provides an alternative to moving averaging and/or other smoothing techniques frequently used for this purpose. The new algorithm is illustrated with an application to the problem of estimating the coda duration after a local event. The obtained relation coefficient between coda duration and epicentral distance is consistent with the earlier findings in the region of interest...|$|E
40|$|The need {{to provide}} {{efficient}} public transport services in urban areas {{has led to the}} implementation of bus priority measures in many congested cities. Much interest has recently centred on priority at signal controlled junctions, including the concept of pre-signals, where traffic signals are installed at or near the end of a with-flow bus lane to provide buses with priority access to the downstream junction. Although a number of pre-signals have now been installed in the U. K., particularly in London, there has been very little published research into their design, operation and optimisation. This paper addresses these points through the development of analytical procedures which allow pre-implementation evaluation of specific categories of pre-signals. The paper initially sets out three categories of <b>pre-signal,</b> which have different operating characteristics, different requirements for signalling and different impacts on capacity and delay. Key issues concerning signalling arrangements for these categories are then discussed, together with a summary of the analytical approach adopted and the assumptions required. Equations are developed to allow appropriate signal timings to be calculated for pre-signalised intersections. Further equations are then developed to enable delays to priority and non-priority traffic, with and without pre-signals, to be estimated with delay being taken here as the key performance criterion. The paper concludes with three application examples illustrating how the equations are applied and the impacts of pre-signals in different situations. The analyses confirm the potential benefits of pre-signals, where these signals apply to non-priority traffic only. Where buses are also subject to a <b>pre-signal,</b> it i...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the problem}} of {{estimating}} the receiver function variance is discussed. The receiver function computation is performed through a frequency-domain deconvolution (Oldenburg 1981) of the vertical seismogram from the radial and tangential seismo-grams. This technique requires {{a knowledge of the}} noise contaminating the seismic signals, and provides an estimate of the receiver function variance. Oldenburg (1981) modelled this noise as additive; Ammon (1992) proposed to estimate the noise level from the power-spectral density in a <b>pre-signal</b> time window. In this paper, this approach is used jointly with an additional inversion, which yields a sequence of spikes {{as a model for the}} true receiver function. The resulting residual in a time window preceding the direct P pulse is used in order to evaluate the receiver function variance and the actual noise level involved in the frequency-domain deconvolution. This variance estimate is compared with the one provided by Oldenburg’s original method. The application of this method to teleseismic recordings of earthquakes (5. 1 Imb 5 6. 1) with similar backazimuths and distances shows that considering the additive noise only is not sufficient to explain the uncertainty measured from the <b>pre-signal</b> in the receiver function. Moreover, the estimated uncertainty seems to be independent of the seismic event magnitude, suggesting a signal-generated noise affecting the receiver function. The proposed approach provides a variance estimate for a single receiver function, allowing one to assess the statistical accuracy of its amplitudes in agreement with the uncertainty involved in a stacking procedure. This is particularly useful when poor-quality waveforms from relatively small earthquakes (mb = 5. 1) are analysed and data from nearly co-located events are not available for stacking...|$|E

40|$|Designing {{a highly}} {{efficient}} public transit system {{can help reduce}} the congestion andpollution in large cities. This dissertation tries to improve public transit systems at boththe micro and macro scales. At the microscale, a Transit Signal Priority strategy is developed to integrate a <b>pre-signal</b> scheme. Buses often compete with cars for limited road space and signal times atintersections. Providing signal priority together with exclusive lanes for buses will oftendiminish car discharge flows into the intersection. This can create huge car delays, whichwill undermine the benefit brought by the priority measures to buses. To solve this problem,we propose a midblock <b>pre-signal</b> to recover the loss in the cars’ discharge capacity causedby the bus priority measures. We show how the <b>pre-signal</b> can be coordinated with theintersection’s main signal under a simple signal priority scheme. Analytical models areformulated {{to examine the effects}} of our strategy on two performance metrics: the expectedbus delay and the car capacity. Pareto frontiers between the two performance metrics aredeveloped. Numerical case studies show that huge benefits for both buses and cars can beachieved by the proposed strategy, as compared to baseline scenarios where a bus signalpriority scheme or <b>pre-signal</b> is absent. At the macroscale, two continuum approximation (CA) optimization models are formu-lated to design city-wide transit systems at minimum cost. Transit routes are assumed to lieatop a city’s street network. Model 1 assumes that the city streets are laid out in ring-radialfashion. Model 2 assumes that the city streets form a grid. Both models can furnish hybriddesigns, which exhibit intersecting routes in a city’s central (downtown) district and onlyradial branching routes in the periphery. Model 1 allows the service frequency and the routespacing at a location to vary arbitrarily with the location’s distance from the center. Model 2 also allows such variation but in the periphery only. We show how to solve these CA optimization problems numerically, and how the numeri-cal results can be used to design actual systems. A wide range of scenarios is analyzed in this way. It is found among other things that in all cases and for both models: (i) the optimal 2 headways and spacings in the periphery increase with the distance from the center; and (ii) at the boundary between the central district and the periphery both, the optimal servicefrequency and the line spacing for radial lines decrease abruptly in the outbound direction. On the other hand, Model 1 is distinguished from Model 2 in that the former produces inall cases: (i) a much smaller central district, and (ii) a high frequency circular line on theouter edge of the central district. Parametric tests with all the scenarios further show thatModel 1 is consistently more favorable to transit than Model 2. Cost differences betweenthe two designs are typically between 9 % and 13 %, but can top 21. 5 %. This is attributed tothe manner in which ring-radial networks naturally concentrate passenger’s shortest paths,and to the economies of demand concentration that transit exhibits. Thus, it appears thatring-radial street networks are better for transit than grids. To illustrate the robustness of the CA design procedure to irregularities in real streetnetworks, the results for all the test problems were then used to design and evaluate transitsystems on networks of the ”wrong” type grid networks were outfilled with transit systemsdesigned with Model 1 and ring-radial networks were designed with Model 2. Cost increasedon average by a little: only 2. 7 %. The magnitude of these deviations suggests that theproposed CA procedures can be used to design transit systems over real street networkswhen they are not too different from the ideal, and that the resulting costs should usuallybe very close to those predicted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Source {{localization}} technology (SLT) for {{impact loads}} in a plate structure {{has been used}} for health monitoring, damage identication, fatigue analysis, human-interaction technol-ogy, etc. Much research on source localization has been focused only on the localization of single impacts. This article presents novel research into the source localization of multiple impacts. It is difficult to localize the sources of multiple impacts using current SLT because of the overlapping of dispersive waves induced by multiple impacts and the reflection of those waves {{from the edge of the}} plate. The new method functions by solving the overlapping problem and the reflection problem. These two problems are solved by adopting <b>pre-signal</b> processing based on band pass filtering and linear-prediction filtering. The method is applied to the localization of multiple impacts on an isotropic plate. Results from numerical simulation and from experimentation are presented and these verify the capability of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Dedicated {{bus lane}} (DBL) and transit signal {{priority}} (TSP) are two effective and low cost ways {{in improving the}} reliability of transits. On the contrary, these strategies reduce the capacity of general traffic. This paper presents an integrated optimization (IO) model to improve the performance of intersections with dedicated bus lanes. The IO model integrated geometry layout, main-signal timing, <b>pre-signal</b> timing and transit priority. The optimization problem is formulated as a Mix-Integer-Non-Linear-Program (MINLP) that can {{be transformed into a}} Mix-Integer-Linear-Program (MILP) and then solved by the standard branch-and-bound technique. The applicability of the IO model is tested through numerical experiment under different intersection layouts and traffic demands. A VISSIM microsimulation model was developed and used to evaluate the performance of the proposed IO model. The test results indicate that the proposed model can increase capacity and reduce delay of general traffic when providing priority to buses...|$|E
40|$|A {{staggered}} intersection is {{a special}} type of intersection in a road network. Its geographical characteristics consist of two T-legged intersections that cause the lost time per cycle to become longer than at cross intersections under conventional signal control, thus leading to low intersection efficiency. This article shows that the problem can be eliminated at the left–right type of staggered intersection by channelization and signal phasing, based on a sorting strategy and <b>pre-signal,</b> which {{reduce the amount of}} lost time during the signal cycle using the split distance as the sorting area. VISSIM was used to model and analyze the proposed method as well as the conventional method for comparison purposes. The simulation revealed that the proposed method reduced the average delays and maximum queue lengths in each movement and for the entire intersection, both in the peak hours and in the off-peak hour...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of a warning signal that preceded a scheduled shock modified the temporal distribution of free-operant avoidance responses. With response-shock and shock-shock intervals held constant, response rates increased only slightly when the response-signal interval was reduced. The result is consistent with Sidman's (1955) findings under different conditions, but at variance with Ulrich, Holz, and Azrin's (1964) findings under similar conditions. Methylphenidate in graded doses increased response rates, modifying frequency distributions of interresponse times. Drug treatment may have disrupted a “temporal discrimination” formed within the signal-shock interval. More simply, methylphenidate influenced response rates by increasing short response latencies after signal onset; this effect was more prominent than the drug's tendency to increase the frequency of <b>pre-signal</b> responses. When signal-onset preceded shock by 2 sec, individual differences in performance were marked; methylphenidate suppressed responding in one rat {{as a function of}} increasing dose levels to a greater degree than in a second animal, but both subjects received more shocks than under control conditions...|$|E

Current solutions include classical surveying instruments (e. g. total stations, GPS) integrated to sensors for monitoring local deformations (e. g. strain-gauges, deformometers), whichare used to achieve information about {{a limited number of}} critical points of arock slope, complemented by geological inspection and qualitative analysis. The innovation of this approach is firstly based on the use of some new sensors which allow to increase the achievable information: terrestrial remote sensors - laser scanner and ground-based interferometric SAR - would allow the measurement of deformations of whole surfaces instead of single points, ground penetrating radar the exploration of rock sub-surface, digital photogrammetry the automatic measurement of crack deformations, seismic and acoustic sensors the detection of vibrations and sounds which could be <b>pre-signal</b> of a rockfall. Th second stage of the reasearch involves the integration of different techniques to exploit the full achievable data. This means either the integrated use of sensor and the the development of expert systems to integrate different measurements and to make decisions.

Signal processing circuit is composed by <b>pre-signal</b> circuit and digital circuit, to obtain voltage, omnibearing signal synthesis and resolution compensation of omnibearing tile angle signal.

It is good in sensitive organ’s output consistency, and suitable for mass production. Omnibearing level posture sensor is required to output the exact signal about angle whenever the tested object is slant to any angle compared to horizon, also gives the rotation azimuth how slant axis is relative to the particular coordinate.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} new "tandem design" to reorganize traffic {{and increase the}} flow capacity of signalized intersections. In the tandem design, a mid-block <b>pre-signal</b> is used to sort left-turning vehicles (LVs) and through-moving vehicles (TVs) in tandem, rather than leaving them side by side, as in the conventional design. For intersections with separate through and left-turn phases, the tandem design outperforms the conventional one because more lanes {{can be used to}} discharge traffic during {{at least one of the}} intersection signal phases. We find that the tandem design can increase the intersection capacity by 10 % to 20 % in its simplest form. We also study the length requirement of blocks to fully realize the capacity benefit, and modifications of the tandem design to reduce this length requirement. We then conduct a case study at a signalized intersection in the city of Chengdu, China. The case study shows that the tandem design can effectively increase intersection capacity. Moreover, the case study shows that together with enforcement of the bus-lane restriction, both cars and buses can benefit. Finally, we demonstrate how the idea of tandem sorting with pre-signals can be extended to increase intersection capacity of multimodal traffic, using as an example the case of cars and buses. This extension hinges on an assumption that the discharge times of different modes of transport is additive, and this assumption is confirmed with a natural experiment...|$|E
