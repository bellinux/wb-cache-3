40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} years more {{attention}} has been paid to accessibility of public transport and space. This growing interest is also visible in The European Union transport policy, aiming at securing rights of <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility.</b> However, big differences in local standards of designing public space and transport infrastructure are visible. Furthermore, particular cities chose different strategies to improve accessibility of public transport. This paper presents a perspective on contemporary transport policy of the European Union applying to <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility.</b> Additionally, a proposal of program consisting of 4 integrated actions, is formulated. Framework of the paper is the universal design concept, described for the first time by The Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University.

40|$|A railway {{passenger}} vehicle must ensure {{a high level}} of comfort, especially if it is used for the transport of <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility.</b> Comfort is a physical and psychological condition, affected by many factors, such as vibration, noise, temperature and humidity. The comfort level of a railway vehicle is particularly affected by mechanical vibrations with a frequency range of 0 to 80 Hz. This range depends on the characteristics of the track and the vehicle's suspension. The technical standards currently in use require the measurement of acceleration {{at the level of the}} floor of the vehicle, neglecting the important effects of the seat. This work, which has been developed within the Industry 2015 program "Caritas", describes the design and the experimental characterisation of an innovative test rig that allows one to test the comfort level of different types of railway seats before operation. The test bench described in the paper can appreciably help the design process of railway seat...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompetition {{in the air}} {{transport}} market {{in recent years has}} prompted companies to search for products and services increasingly innovative and, at the same time, the decrease in development timing and the creation of resources devoted to the study of original technical solutions. One emerging important issue is to facilitate air travel for people with disabilities, elder and dependent people, setting the primary objective of preventing the emergence and spread of new barriers. This aspect is important both for the introduction of several mandatory requirements (rules, laws and regulations) and the increasing market share of this people category due to the aging of population. In this paper it is analyzed the study of the flow of PRM (<b>Passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>Reduced</b> <b>Mobility)</b> departing, arriving and transiting through an airport terminal. The specific case study is based on the management process of <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> special assistance for a major Italian tourist airport. The Axiomatic Design method is used to link the customers needs with all the process elements and boundaries: the infrastructure aspects, the limits imposed by security and the availability of appropriate resources (personnel and equipment). Finally some improvement suggestions are made to optimize the passage through the terminal and to ensure full accessibility of the considered environments...|$|R
40|$|Airline {{competition}} with customer service as product differentiator has forced down costs, air fares and investor returns. Two passenger markets operate in aviation: (1) able-bodied passengers for whom airlines openly compete and (2) <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility</b> (PRMs) – disabled by age, obesity or medical problems – for whom airlines do not compete. Government {{interference in the}} market intended to protect a minority of narrowly-defined PRMs has had unintended consequences of enabling increasing numbers of more widely-defined PRMs to access complimentary airline provisions. With growing ageing and overweight populations and long-haul travelling medical tourists such regulation could lead to even lower investors’ returns. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) (2013) examined the air transport value chain for competitiveness using Porter’s (2008) five forces but did not distinguish between able-bodied passengers and PRMs. Findings during an investigation of these two markets concurred with IATA-Porter that the markets for the bargaining powers of PRM customers and PRM suppliers were ‘highly competitive’. However, {{in contrast to the}} IATA conclusions the threats posed by new entrants, substitute products and intensity of competition for PRM passengers were all ‘low’. The conclusion is that airlines are strategically PRM defensive by omission. Paradoxically, the airline which delivers the best PRM customer service could become the least profitable...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a specific program to be used at the Barcelona-El Prat Airport, in order to simulate the service to <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility,</b> {{in order to be able}} to find a proper staff distribution. This program is necessary because of the big levels of uncertainty of the service, due to the fact that a lot of users do not alert the Airport that they are going to use it. Thus, the main aim of the program is to simulate the total amount of <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility</b> that is going to request service during a specific season, and a given terminal, weekday and slot; and also to assign the adequate staff in order to accomplish the demands of the European Union to that service. Moreover, the program has to be able to predict, using a percentage of growth, the total amount of requests that the system must face in the following years, using the data obtained in the previous year. In order to be able to do the program, the requests data of the service during the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been used. Another study of this service has been used in order to know the time probability distributions service of each stand in the airport, both arrivals and departures. It is important to point out, that this study only give us the 2013 distributions, so, it is important to take it into account, and, if there is the intention to use it in the following years, it must be assumed that this distributions stay constant. Once we have analysed the technical aspects of the program, the obtained results for 2013 are shown. For each weekday, terminal and season, there is a table divided into four slots, corresponding to interval times of 4 or 8 hours, where the mean number of PRM who use the system after 100 iterations can be found, as well as the mean waiting time, the required servers and the non-idle time percentage of each server. These tables are also divided into two parts, the first one shows the results obtained when the 95 % of the users are attended in less time than the most restrictive ones given by the EU, and another one, where the results show the data obtained when the 99 % of the users are attended. To sum up, we can see that, comparing the results obtained using the simulations and the real data of the service, the program works as it is supposed to. That is because the values obtained of users of the service is really close to the real values, as well as the number of servers obtained, which corresponds to the values obtained in the 95 % simulation...|$|R
40|$|Scania is {{a leading}} {{producer}} of trucks, buses, industrial engines and marine engines. The thesis treats the subject accessibility on city buses. In the current situation customers choose layouts and equipment of the buses on their own. Scania wants to acquire knowledge of the customer needs {{so that they are}} able to recommend a more accessible layout for a high and low passenger flow. The layout shall include dimensioning and placement of doors, seats, handrails, equipment and areas for people <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility.</b> To learn more about accessibility on city buses a literature study was made. The study included causes for mobility reduction, available aids, knowledge about Scania´s buses, how Public Transport Authorities work with accessibility and legal requirements for bus construction. Interviews, observations and benchmarking were also made to see how accessible current buses are and how they could be improved to ease travelling for people <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility.</b> The gathered information showed that nearly 8 % of the population in Sweden today live with some form of mobility reduction. Legal requirements about accessibility state that everyone shall be able to travel with public transport vehicles despite disability. In reality <b>passengers</b> <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility</b> face a number of problems when travelling by bus. Many current ramps do not meet the legal requirements on slopes when folded out against a kerb. Problems with infrastructure and traffic in the inner city of big cities often lead to the bus not getting to the stop which means the ramp has to be folded out against ground. This gives an even larger slope that is harder for wheelchair users to access. At the wheelchair area a side support is required in buses without legal demands on safety belts. Some of the current side supports are folded down which is good in the aspect that they are not in the way when not in use. However this solution is sometimes difficult for people <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility</b> in the upper body to use, as it requires large joint angles. There are also many permanent solutions that could be in the way when accessing the area. For buses without legal requirements on seat belts there are no requirements on fastening systems for wheelchair users. Since there are people in wheelchair that also have mobility reduction in the upper body and could have difficulty holding on to the handholds at the area, a fastening system would however be a good solution. In current layouts there are sometimes problems accessing the wheelchair area depending on how the door is placed relative to it. Wheelchair passengers describe it as having to make an unnatural turn. From the new version of Buss 2010, a document for recommendations from the bus business in Sweden, there are requirements on having larger space between seats, four strollers and priority seats on low floor. This means that new layouts have to be modified to meet these aspects. For the operators that manage the public traffic in Sweden it would be desirable with standard layouts suitable for different intensity of passenger flow, since they work in different areas around the country. Creative methods were used for concepts development of layouts and equipment. Ideation and evaluation sessions were held with two different groups from Scania in Sweden and Poland. Two new layouts were created, one for high and one for low passenger flow. Since the requirements on accessibility are the same despite passenger flow intensity the accessibility adjustments are the same for the different layouts. Some common aspects were that the front and middle door would be close to each other with the priority seats in between for less walking distance and that the wheelchair would be placed in a suitable position to the middle door for easy access. The layouts also required walker space next to reserved seats so the passengers would not have to leave it to access seats further away like in the current situation. The layout for high passenger flow has more standing area {{on the side of the}} gangway to prevent people from blocking access to seats during dense traffic. The layout for low passenger flow has more seats and a smaller pram area to avoid having standing passengers. A new concept for a ramp was developed with a lower slope than the legal requirement for more easy access of the bus. To achieve this, the ramp begins to slope inside the bus. This means that the extension needed for a lower slope does not have to be as long outside the bus. A side support was created that is easier for the passenger to fold out than current solutions. The support is also adjustable to fit a larger variety of users. A fastening system in form of a belt solution was also created that would be easier for wheelchair users to handle on their own. My recommendation to Scania is to propose the concepts for layouts, boarding device and side support to their clients as they are more adapted to people <b>with</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>mobility</b> as well as to different passenger flow intensity. The fastening system is not recommended for continued development as there are doubts whether it really exist a need for it. Validerat; 20111216 (anonymous...|$|R
