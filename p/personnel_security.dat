25|$|The attack, and {{questions}} surrounding the U.S. Government's preparedness for it, and explanations {{for what had}} happened afterward, became a political firestorm in the U.S., especially {{in the context of}} the ongoing presidential election. The State Department had previously identified embassy and <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> as a major challenge in its budget and priorities report. On the September 20, Clinton gave a classified briefing to U.S. Senators, which several Republican attendees criticized, angry at the Obama administration's rebuff of their attempts to learn details of the Benghazi attack, only to see that information published the next day in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. She did announce the formation of an Accountability Review Board panel, chaired by longtime diplomat Thomas R. Pickering and vice-chaired by retired Admiral and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, to investigate the attack from the State Department's viewpoint.|$|E

500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of June 1996 arose concerning improper {{access by}} the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, {{head of the}} White House Office of <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security,</b> improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined {{that there was no}} credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, [...] "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved" [...] in seeking the files.|$|E
500|$|On June 29, 1954, the AEC {{upheld the}} {{findings}} of the <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> Board, with five commissioners voting in favor and one opposed. The decision was rendered 32 hours before Oppenheimer's consultant contract, and with it the need for a clearance, was due to expire. In his majority opinion, Strauss said that Oppenheimer had displayed [...] "fundamental character defects". He said that Oppenheimer [...] "in his associations had repeatedly exhibited a willful disregard of the normal and proper obligations of security," [...] and that he [...] "has defaulted not once but many times upon the obligations that should and must be willingly borne by citizens in the national service." ...|$|E

The following day, the White House delivered to the committee hundreds of other such files related to White House employees of the Reagan Administration and George H. W.

500|$|Nichols became General Manager of the AEC on 2 November 1953. In this {{capacity}} he initiated the AEC <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> Board {{hearing on the}} loyalty and trustworthiness of atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In a harshly worded memorandum to the AEC on 12 June 1954, subsequent to the hearing, Nichols recommended that Oppenheimer's security clearance not be reinstated. In five [...] "security findings," [...] Nichols said that Oppenheimer was [...] "a Communist in every sense except {{that he did not}} carry a party card," [...] and that he [...] "is not reliable or trustworthy." [...] The commission agreed, and Oppenheimer was stripped of his security clearance. A second scandal was the Dixon-Yates contract, a political controversy that became a major issue in the 1954 elections, resulting in Nichols appearing before a United States Senate subcommittee.|$|E
500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of the Clinton Administration, {{often referred}} to as Filegate, arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security,</b> improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission. [...] The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top presidential advisors. [...] Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position. [...] Allegations were made that senior White House figures, including First Lady Hillary Clinton, may have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First Lady had authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.|$|E
500|$|In {{the chilly}} Cold War {{climate of the}} post-war University of California, Lawrence {{accepted}} the House Un-American Activities Committee's actions [...] as legitimate, and did not see them as indicative of a systemic problem involving academic freedom or human rights. [...] He was protective of individuals in his laboratory, but even more protective of {{the reputation of the}} laboratory. He was forced to defend Radiation Laboratory staff members like Robert Serber who were investigated by the University's <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> Board. In several cases he issued character references in support of staff. However, Lawrence barred Robert Oppenheimer's brother Frank from the Radiation Laboratory, damaging his relationship with Robert. An acrimonious loyalty oath campaign at the University of California also drove away faculty members. When hearings were held to revoke Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance, Lawrence declined to attend on account of illness, but a transcript in which he was critical of Oppenheimer was presented in his absence. Lawrence's success [...] in building a creative, collaborative laboratory was undermined by the ill-feeling and distrust resulting from political tensions.|$|E

500|$|On June 26, 1996, Clinger's Government Reform and Oversight Committee held {{hearings}} on the matter. [...] Livingstone, who announced his resignation {{at the start of}} his testimony that day, and his assistant, Anthony Marceca, insisted during the committee's hearings that the mishandled files were a result of a bureaucratic mixup and that no improper motivations were behind it. [...] They said that when the George H. W. Bush administrative staff left the White House in January 1993, they had taken all the files of the Office of <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> with them for use in the Bush Library, as they were permitted to do under law. [...] The OPS staff were trying to rebuild these records to include those of permanent White House employees who remained to work in the Clinton administration; Marceca, a civilian investigator for the Army, had been hired for this task. In doing so, they received an outdated list from the Secret Service of White House employees, which included many names who were no longer employees. This list was then given to the FBI and the personnel background files returned as a result. [...] Lisa Wetzl, another assistant, testified that she discovered the mistake in mid-1994 and destroyed the request list.|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Stevens, an Army medic from Portland, Oregon, knew Gibbs {{while serving}} {{with him in}} A-52, the Brigade Commander's <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> Detachment, where they served under CPT Samuel Lynn.

SSG Stevens was sentenced to nine months in prison {{as part of a}} plea deal to testify against 11 other Lewis-McChord based Stryker soldiers. He pleaded guilty to four charges including shooting [...] "in the direction of" [...] two Afghan farmers for no reason. Stevens said Gibbs ordered him to shoot on the two farmers and that he regretted [...] "not trying to stop Staff Sgt. Gibbs from trying to kill innocent people." ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Little {{is known}} about the {{involvement}} of <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> in Irish psychiatric care. Content analysis of inspection reports is a feasible way to investigate this under-researched topic. We aimed to (i) Describe the number of approved centres per year in which we observed comments about the presence of <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> in published reports of inspections conducted from 2008 to 2012 (ii) Report the main themes of all text relating to <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> published in these inspection reports. Method We conducted a content analysis of all 349 inspection reports published between 2008 and 2012. Results The number of approved centres in which <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> were noted increased from 3 % to 8 % between the years 2008 and 2012. This increase was not statistically significant when the same unique centres were compared between years (p= 0. 684). Employment details such as contracted employment relationship, location relative to the approved centre and hours of work appeared inconsistent across centres. Role functions of <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> differed across centres and ranged from monitoring the entrance of a unit to observing, restraining and secluding patients. Contrasting perceptions of suitability were evident in the inspection reports. The extent to which the training needs of <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> were met was unclear from the reports. Conclusions Activity of <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> in psychiatric hospitals may not be role appropriate, compliant with legislation or conducive to treatment. Best practice guidelines should be developed in consultation with multiple stakeholders...|$|R

2500|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of war GQG was activated and its constituent departments dispatched to their posts. [...] Gamelin and his staff to Vicennes; Georges and his north-east army staff, General Henri-Marie-Auguste Bineau (the major-général), the First, Second, Third and Fourth Bureaus, the postal, <b>personnel,</b> <b>security,</b> rail and wireless departments to La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and the service branches and inspector-generals to Meaux. [...] Gamelin and his staff were housed in [...] "T" [...] bunker, a three-level underground facility built in 1832. [...] Georges and his staff were housed at Chateau Bondons, an eighteenth-century house in a [...] park beside the Marne with no fewer than 70 other properties utilised in or around the town to better disperse the staff in case of aerial attack. [...] At Meaux 24 different properties were utilised, including at nearby Lizy-sur-Ourcq, Esbly and Condé-Sainte-Libiaire. [...] This considerable fragmentation of the staff prevented effective communication between departments and generated unnecessary paperwork. [...] Gamelin and the GQG staff hosted the Duke of Windsor to dinner on 14 October 1939.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fallout from}} the {{controversy}} wounded both Clinton and Aspin politically and dragged on until December 1993, when, after many months of equivocation, confusion, and more controversy, Aspin released new regulations, known as the [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy on homosexual conduct in the armed forces: Applicants for the services would not be asked about their sexual orientation, and homosexual orientation would not disqualify anyone from service [...] "unless manifested by homosexual conduct"; military personnel would be judged on suitability for service, not sexual orientation; separation from the service {{would be based on}} homosexual acts, same sex marriage, or statements by an individual that he or she was bisexual or homosexual, with the person accorded the opportunity to rebut the presumption of homosexual acts; DoD criminal investigation or law enforcement organizations would not investigate solely to determine a service member's sexual orientation, and sexual orientation questions would not be included in <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> questionnaires; finally, service members would be informed of DoD policy on sexual conduct during their training. This compromise policy, [...] issued after an agonizing and divisive public debate, did not completely satisfy any of the concerned parties.|$|E
2500|$|The gay {{and lesbian}} rights {{movement}} in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. Leonard Matlovich appeared {{on the cover of}} Time in 1975. In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, [...] "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." [...] It cited the military's need [...] "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" [...] and [...] "to prevent breaches of security". In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' Parris Island Depot, activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate {{for an end to the}} exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces. In 1989, reports commissioned by the <b>Personnel</b> <b>Security</b> Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of Joseph Steffan's lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that [...] "having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed." [...] Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracey Thorne and Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator Brock Adams (D-Washington) and Rep. Barbara Boxer introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year. In July 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in the context of the outing of his press aide Pete Williams, dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as [...] "a bit of an old chestnut" [...] in testimony before the House Budget Committee. In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and the Detroit Free Press. In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report that members of Congress had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban on gays and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.|$|E
