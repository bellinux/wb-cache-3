The director of Women Under Siege is Lauren Wolfe and the associate editor for Women Under Siege is Shazdeh Omari. The project is organized under the WMC, but operates independently, with contributions coming from individuals, corporations and foundations.|$|E

Groves, Jr., and briefed him, on his visits to Berkeley, which were made about once a month between October 1942 and November 1943. As part of his role in coordinating the electromagnetic process, Fidler occasionally visited Chicago, which was more convenient for contractors like Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis Chalmers; Boston, where the offices of Stone & Webster, the main engineering contractor were located; and the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He attained the rank of major. After World War II ended in August 1945, Fidler was transferred to Tennessee, where he worked on the declassification of Manhattan <b>Project</b> <b>documents.</b> He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work on the Manhattan Project, which was presented by Groves at a ceremony at Lawrence's home on October 21, 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Soviet {{engineers}} were initially reluctant {{to design a}} spacecraft that looked superficially identical to the Shuttle, but subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that NASA's design was already ideal. [...] Even though the Molniya Scientific Production Association proposed its Spiral programme design (halted 13 years earlier), it was rejected as being altogether dissimilar from the American shuttle design. [...] While NPO Molniya conducted development under the lead of Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy, the Soviet Union's Military-Industrial Commission, or VPK, was tasked with collecting all data it could on the U.S. Space Shuttle. Under {{the auspices of the}} KGB, the VPK was able to amass documentation on the American shuttle's airframe designs, design analysis software, materials, flight computer systems and propulsion systems. [...] The KGB targeted many university research <b>project</b> <b>documents</b> and databases, including Caltech, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and others. The thoroughness of the acquisition of data was made much easier as the U.S. shuttle development was unclassified.|$|E
2500|$|The party's voter base is {{traditionally}} concentrated in Southern Thailand and in Bangkok, where the party {{relies on the}} support from the capital's aristocratic, meritocratic and educated middle and upper classes. In the 1990s, {{under the leadership of}} Chuan Leekpai, a native of Trang province in Southern Thailand, the Democrats quickly became the dominant party in Southern Thailand. The influences of provincial politicians from the south into the party created considerable tension with the party's Bangkok establishment. Chuan's [...] "Mr. Clean" [...] image, however, made him personally popular with Democrat Party supporters throughout Thailand, and so the party managed to stay cohesive under his leadership. The first Chuan government (1992–1995) fell when members of the Cabinet were implicated in profiting from the Sor Phor Kor 4-01 land <b>project</b> <b>documents</b> distributed in Phuket province. Chuan was again Premier from 1997 to 2001, {{in the midst of the}} 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and its aftermath. The Party lost a landslide election victory to Thaksin Shinawatra's populist Thai Rak Thai party, winning 128 seats compared to the TRT's 248 in the 2001 general election.|$|E
