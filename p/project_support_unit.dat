This is a prepublication discussion paper for limited circulation for feedback and comments. The first draft was based on field research supported by the NBTDP and the IDE-Ford Foundation-sponsored Irrigation against Rural Poverty Research Program; it was subsequently revised at the International Water Management Institute, Colombo. The earlier draft of the report was presented to a group of senior officials of the Government of West Bengal (GOWB) in a workshop chaired by Secretary, Agriculture, GOWB. The author gratefully acknowledges the feedback and comments provided by Frank van Steenbergen, Rajeshwar Mishra and Rajnarain Indu.

40|$|This {{report is}} the mid-term review of UNDPs trust fund for civic {{education}} in Angola. The trust fund {{was set up}} in late 2006, with support from the embassies of Norway, Sweden and USAid, topped up with UNDP’s own funds. By late 2007, 22 CSOs or umbrella organisations had been selected and supported with grants to carry out civic education activities throughout the country. The most common activity is civic education sessions, where a specially trained promoter talks to a popular gathering. 	The review generally commends the outstanding performance of the UNDP <b>project</b> <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> (PSU) – which in a short time managed to set up and implement M&E routines for the many involved organisations, as well as an impressive schedule of training sessions on substantive civic and human rights issues. 	Improvements were recommended by the reviewers to enhance the programme’s impact: To sharpen the message to the recipients’ needs for empowering information, to redouble training in participative methods, and to prioritise target groups. 	The report argues that for the continuation of the programme some strategic choices should be made: Maximising impact in terms of social/political change; building CSOs; maximising the roll out of civic education “knowledge packages”; or rolling it out to specific (needy) sections of the citizenry...|$|E

40|$|In India, HIV {{prevention}} and control activities started way before {{the reporting of}} the first case of HIV infection. On reporting of evidences of HIV infection {{from different parts of}} the country and varied groups, Government launched the National AIDS Control Program (NACP). The program was launched on the foundation of early interventions and Mid-Term Plan, which evolved in three phases over the period of eighteen years. With progression of time, epidemiological situation changed and knowledge/capacity to tackle HIV improved. In the course of the evolution, NACP has moved from the centrally controlled program to district driven. Also different strategies were inducted/refined and many important institutes like Task Force, a high-powered National AIDS Committee, National AIDS Control Board, National AIDS Control Organization, State AIDS Control Societies, <b>Project</b> <b>Support</b> Units/Project Management <b>Units,</b> National Council on AIDS, Department of AIDS Control, Technical <b>Support</b> <b>Unit,</b> District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) were created. Currently program is implemented vertically with good impetus and is able to contain the spread of HIV in India. For enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability, future of the NACP is strongly linked with the well-performing DAPCU and good synergy/integration with General Health System. HIV/AIDS epidemic in India has entered into the third decade. Evidences show that this epidemic in India is of concentrated type and characterized by the heterogeneity, following the type 4 pattern, where the epidemic shifts from the most vulnerable populations [such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users to bridge populations (clients of sex workers, sexually transmitted infection patients, partners of drug users, long route truck drivers, short stay cyclical single male migrants], then to the general population and from urban centers to rural areas (ruralization of epidemic) with increasing involvement of youth and women (feminization of epidemic) ...|$|R

40|$|Magister Educationis - MEdThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the nature of support services offered to Extended Curriculum Programme students in a South African university. The primary goals of support services in higher education are to support students holistically and reduce barriers to learning in the teaching and learning environment. One of the faculties in a South African university established a <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> to assist with the low throughput level. The academic <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> is housed in the Academic Development Department (ADD) in a faculty. The unit attempts to address the needs of underachieving students in the Extended Curriculum Programme (ECP). The thesis first identifies the challenges the ECP students are experiencing. Then, support services in the university and in the <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> are described. Thereafter, the challenges experienced by the centre of support services in the university and the <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> are illuminated. Qualitative data was gathered through individual interviews with senior management. Then, a focus group discussion with tutors who volunteer in a <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> was facilitated and lastly the staff members employed in the <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> were also interviewed individually. The thesis was able to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to learning the ECP students are experiencing. It became evident that the support services available in the university and the <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> are not sufficient to address the needs of the students. The challenges the support service centre of the university and the <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> are experiencing are twofold. The first is a lack of organisational resources that hinders service delivery, the second is a lack of skills and expertise in attain structures that limits the provision of support services...|$|R
