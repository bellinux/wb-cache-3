ChaCha collectively ranked Phoebe, Rachel and Monica the 11th, 12th and 13th best female television {{characters of}} all-time, respectively. Maria Tallarico of Cosmopolitan observed {{that a number}} of Monica's storylines, specifically one in which the character unintentionally has sex with a high school senior, [...] "probably wouldn't fly on TV today". Writing for Mic.com, Samantha Allen believes that Monica helped [...] "set the standard for how sitcoms could and would talk about sex" [...] by both engaging in casual sex and dating a much older man. According to Dustin Levy of The Diamondback, Monica inspired [...] "any ensemble cast in a sitcom with a female character who is bossy or neurotic," [...] citing Scrubs’ Elliot Reid and Happy Endings’ Jane Kerkovich-Williams as examples of Monica's influence. Additionally, Levy identified Claire Dunphy from the sitcom Modern Family as Monica's modern-day equivalent, explaining that the character [...] "acts like Monica plus children". In spring 2015, TV Guide published an article entitled [...] "22 Spring Cleaning Tips From Monica Geller" [...] in recognition of the character's cleanliness. In her article [...] "5 Signs You’re A Real-Life Monica Geller", Ayn Bernos of Thought Catalog wrote that the character's personality is the reason [...] "all perfectionist fans of this iconic TV show have asked themselves this question at least once in their life: 'Oh my god, am I a Monica Geller?!'" [...] Emma Lord of Bustle expounded in her article [...] "13 Signs You Are The Monica Of Your Friend Group" [...] "that isn't to say life is easy for the Real Life Monicas of the world. First, there's all the name calling: 'neat freak' and 'sore loser', to name a few.
