In a large study, sixty-four German Holstein and German Simmental bulls were randomly allocated to either an indoor concentrate feeding system or periods of <b>pasture</b> <b>feeding</b> following by a finishing period.

German Simmental bulls grew faster in both feeding groups (concentrate and grass-based) compared to German Holstein bulls. Because of that significantly more days of fattening were necessary to reach the slaughter weight of 620 kg. The feeding system did not affect the carcass weights of both breeds. The results of cutting according to the regulations of the Deutsche Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft (DLG-Schnittführung für die Zerlegung der Schlachtkörper von Rind, Kalb, Schwein und Schaf) showed diet effects for different cuts. <b>Pasture</b> <b>feeding</b> significantly decreased the weights of flank, flat ribs and brisket of both breeds.

Thirty out of the 50 samples composed the first trial and were obtained from two different genotypes (i. e., Comisana versus Sicilo-Sarde); the second trial was composed of 20 samples obtained from the Sicilo-Sarde genotype with two different feeding systems in pen (soybean versus scotch bean). Milk samples were divided into four groups named Sicilo-Sarde with <b>pasture</b> <b>feeding</b> (Spas), Comisana with <b>pasture</b> <b>feeding</b> (Cpas), Sicilo-Sarde feeding on scotch bean (Ssco), and Sicilo-Sarde feeding on soybean (Ssoy). The factorial discriminant analysis was applied to the: (i) four groups (i. e., Spas, Ssco, Ssoy, and Cpas) and (ii) three groups composed only of Sicilo-Sarde genotype (i. e., Spas, Ssco, and Ssoy). Considering the four groups, the best result was obtained with the excitation vitamin A spectra since correct classification amounting to 76 % was observed. When the factorial discriminant analysis was performed with the three groups belonging to the Sicilo-Sarde genotype, the best result was obtained again with vitamin A spectra (i. e., emission and excitation spectra) since 88. 6 % of correct classification was observed. Concatenation technique applied to the five fluorescence spectra improved the rate of classification between the four groups since 44 out of 50 samples were correctly classified.

Thirty-eight Italian Merino lambs were divided into 4 groups at 60 days of age. Over 89 days, 10 lambs (S group) were fed concentrates in stall, while 9 ani- mals (P group) grazed herbage at pasture. Ten lambs (P-S 37 group) and 9 lambs (P-S 14 group) initially grazed together with animals in the P group, but were housed in stall and fed as the S group for 37 and 14 days before slaughtering, respectively. Lipid oxidation was measured as TBARS (mg of malonaldehyde / kg of meat) on slices of raw muscle Longissimus dorsi and on cooked minced muscle over 8 and 2 days of storage at 4 °C, respectively. After 8 days of storage, lower TBARS values were found in raw muscle from lambs in the P group (0. 70) compared to the S, P- S 14 and P-S 37 groups (2. 32, 2. 13 and 3. 09, respectively; P < 0. 0005), while meat from lambs in the P-S 37 group displayed higher TBARS values compared to S and P-S 14 groups (P < 0. 05).

50|$|The long acre is a {{traditional}} term for wide grassy road verges. In some places, such as Australia, New Zealand, {{and parts of the}} British Isles, rural roads are often separated from adjoining paddocks and fields by both a hedge or fence and a wide grass verge. Rather than leaving this verge fallow, farmers often tether livestock on it to use <b>pasture</b> <b>feed</b> (in the form of the grass) that would otherwise be wasted. Historically, the long acre was also grazed by herds or flocks moving from place to place, either on long journeys, or from one small local field to another. The long acre provided an important resource for such flocks and herds, perhaps forming a significant part of a small farmer's pasture. In Australia, the most common method of keeping grazing stock off a road is by the use of a portable electric fence, visible to the stock and to passing travellers as a single white tape.
