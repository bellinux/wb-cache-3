Results of the simulation are presented for a 15 -bit binary phase-coded <b>pulse</b> <b>compressor</b> using both hard-limiting and soft-limiting quantizers. Detection performance of the hard and soft-limiting pulse compressors is compared with a linear (ideal) <b>pulse</b> <b>compressor.</b> The soft-limiting <b>pulse</b> <b>compressor</b> is shown to achieve a 2 dB improvement in detection performance due to a reduced processing loss over the hard-limiting pulse-compressor for a probability of false alarm (PFA) of 10 - 4.

MMDG for <b>pulse</b> <b>compressors</b> operating at 800 nm with a corrugated SiO 2 layer are designed by using a genetic algorithm and the Fourier mode method.

For the single dielectric match layer grating, the bandwidth is 140 nm, if the thickness and refractive index of the match layer are changed, the maximum electric field in the grating ridge, match layer, and metal layer of the grating increases with the decrease in grating diffraction efficiency. For the multi-dielectric match layer grating, the bandwidth and the maximum electric field in the metal layer decrease with the increase in high- and low-index material pairs, and the maximum electric field in the grating ridge and match layer initially decreases and then increases. Over a wide wavelength range, the maximum electric field in the grating ridge, match layer, and metal layer is minimal near the central wavelength. Moreover, MMDG should be used at larger incident angles while keeping enough bandwidth to reduce the electric field in the grating...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical And Electronic Engineering) The {{theme of}} this thesis is the time {{compression}} of energy in electrical systems {{with the aim of}} improving the efficiency and average power throughput capability of existing pulse compression systems. Recent success in the design of pulse lasers indicated successful operation at repetition rates of up to 2 kHz, demanding more powerful pulse power supplies. These pulse lasers require unusually high peak power, not obtainable with conventional switching techniques. Typical pulse voltages of up to 40 kV with peak currents of lOkA and rise times of 150 ns are required. Traditionally thyratrons have been used for this application, but the limited lifetime of these devices is a major shortcoming, especially when operating at 2 kHz. New switching techniques were needed. Excellent results have been obtained using saturable inductors as magnetic switches in <b>pulse</b> <b>compressors,</b> but notwithout limitations. The generation of heat due to core losses tends to limit the power throughput capability of these compressors, especially in the final stages. The minimisation of these losses is therefore of utmost importance. In order to improve the current systems, a study of the basic principles of compression was conducted. Loss-mechanisms, especially in the magnetic components, were modelled with the object of minimising losses. The limitations imposed on the system by flux conservation in magnetic and dielectric materials, {{led to the development of}} the new concept of bipolar compression. A full-scale bipolar <b>compressor</b> and <b>pulse</b> power supply was constructed and experimental results on this system are presented, showing an improvement in the efficiency.
