30|$|In {{addition}} to Term Summation, we adopt the <b>Paragraph</b> Embeddings technique [17] to generate embeddings of biomedical articles. <b>Paragraph</b> Embeddings is an improved version of Word 2 Vec, {{in which each}} document is marked with a special word called <b>Paragraph</b> id. The <b>Paragraph</b> id participates in the training of each word as part of each context, acting as a memory that remembers what is missing from the current context. The training procedure of <b>Paragraph</b> Embeddings {{is the same as}} Word 2 Vec. Finally, the embedding of the special word <b>Paragraph</b> id is used to represent the corresponding biomedical article. We denote embeddings of biomedical articles generated by Term Summation and <b>Paragraph</b> Embeddings as d_Sum and d_Para, respectively.|$|R
