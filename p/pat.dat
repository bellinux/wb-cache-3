40|$|Abstract. Patterned {{self-assembly}} tile set synthesis (<b>Pats)</b> is the prob-lem {{of finding}} a minimal tile set which uniquely self-assembles into a given pattern. Czeizler and Popa proved the NP-completeness of <b>Pats</b> and Seki showed that the <b>Pats</b> problem is already NP-complete for pat-terns with 60 colors. In search for the minimal number of colors such that <b>Pats</b> remains NP-complete, we introduce multiple bound <b>Pats</b> (mbPats) where we allow bounds for the numbers of tile types of each color. We show that mbPats is NP-complete for patterns with just three colors and, as a byproduct of this result, we also obtain a novel proof for the NP-completeness of <b>Pats</b> which is more concise than the previous proofs. ...|$|R

40|$|Protein S-acyltransferases (<b>PATs)</b> {{containing}} Asp-His-His-Cys {{within a}} Cys-rich domain (DHHC-CRD) are polytopic transmembrane proteins {{that are found}} in eukaryotic cells and mediate the S-acylation of target proteins. S-acylation is an important secondary and reversible modification that regulates the membrane association, trafficking and function of target proteins. However, {{little is known about}} the characteristics of <b>PATs</b> in plants. Here, we identified 804 <b>PATs</b> from 31 species with complete genomes. The analysis of the phylogenetic relationships suggested that all of the <b>PATs</b> fell into 8 groups. In addition, we analysed the phylogeny, genomic organization, chromosome localisation and expression pattern of <b>PATs</b> in Arabidopsis, Oryza sative, Zea mays and Glycine max. The microarray data revealed that <b>PATs</b> genes were expressed in different tissues and during different life stages. The preferential expression of the ZmPATs in specific tissues and the response of Zea mays to treatments with phytohormones and abiotic stress demonstrated that the <b>PATs</b> play roles in plant growth and development as well as in stress responses. Our data provide a useful reference for the identification and functional analysis of the members of this protein family...|$|R
