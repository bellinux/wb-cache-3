5|$|A planet's {{defining}} <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{is that it}} is massive {{enough for}} the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul's {{history and}} growth as a landing port {{are tied to}} water. The city's {{defining}} <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic,</b> {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The {{history and}} {{economic}} growth of Minneapolis are tied to water, the city's defining <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic,</b> which {{was brought to the}} region during the last ice age ten thousand years ago. Ice blocks deposited in valleys by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis. Fed by a receding glacier and Lake Agassiz, torrents of water from a glacial river cut the Mississippi riverbed and created the river's only waterfall, Saint Anthony Falls, important to the early settlers of Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|Enaliarctos, {{a fossil}} species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic {{life with a}} {{flexible}} spine, and limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for shearing (like terrestrial carnivorans), {{and it may have}} stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. Enaliarctos was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, Enaliarctos emlongi, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was Pteronarctos, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, Pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the jugal or lacrimal bone), but was mostly shaped by the maxilla.|$|E
5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 20% of autistic {{children}} have megalencephaly {{making it the}} most common <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of autism. Patients that present both megalencephaly and autistic characteristics usually also show signs of hyperactivity as a major symptom. However, there is no definitive evidence that autism is the primary cause/result of megalencephaly. This is because megalencephaly has also been described in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia or Alzheimers.|$|E

25|$|The {{differentiation}} of phenotype in heterozygous females is furthered {{by the presence}} of X-inactivation skewing. Typically, each X-chromosome is silenced in half of the cells, but this process is skewed when preferential inactivation of a chromosome occurs. It is thought that skewing happens either by chance or by a <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a chromosome that may cause it to be silenced more or less often, such as an unfavorable mutation.|$|E
25|$|The {{calving rate}} is largely {{controlled}} by {{the depth of the}} water and the glacier velocity at the calving front. The process of calving provides an imbalance in forces {{at the front of the}} glaciers, that raises velocity. The depth of the water at the glacier front is a simple measure that allows estimation of calving rate, but is the amount of flotation of the glacier at the front that is the specific <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> that is important.|$|E
25|$|Within these categories, food webs can {{be further}} {{organized}} according to {{the different kinds of}} ecosystems being investigated. For example, human food webs, agricultural food webs, detrital food webs, marine food webs, aquatic food webs, soil food webs, Arctic (or polar) food webs, terrestrial food webs, and microbial food webs. These characterizations stem from the ecosystem concept, which assumes that the phenomena under investigation (interactions and feedback loops) are sufﬁcient to explain patterns within boundaries, such as the edge of a forest, an island, a shoreline, or some other pronounced <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic.</b>|$|E

25|$|In other cases, our 'population' may be {{even less}} tangible. For example, Joseph Jagger studied the {{behaviour}} of roulette wheels at a casino in Monte Carlo, and used this to identify a biased wheel. In this case, the 'population' Jagger wanted to investigate was the overall behaviour of the wheel (i.e. the probability distribution of its results over infinitely many trials), while his 'sample' was formed from observed results from that wheel. Similar considerations arise when taking repeated measurements of some <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> such as the electrical conductivity of copper.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{dysphoria}} {{or gender}} identity disorder (GID) {{occurs when the}} child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as transsexualism, occurs when a person has {{a strong desire to}} be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic.</b> GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} of the world can be divided into distinct geographic regions, in each of which some <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> is dominant, almost to the exclusion of others. In Finland, the same physical characteristics are common to each of the four geographic regions into which the country is divided. Regional differences in Finland lie, therefore, in subtle combinations of physical qualities. In archipelago Finland, rock and water are dominant. Coastal Finland consists of broad clay plains where agriculture plays a leading role. The interior Finnish lake district supports extensive forests. Upland Finland is covered by Arctic scrub. Finland lacks true arctic tundra but has alpine tundra on top of fells.|$|E

25|$|F.A. Forel, {{who is also}} {{referred}} to as the father of limnology, was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their thermal stratification. His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and Laffler. Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, thermal stratification is an important <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the hypolimnion. Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the epilimnion. However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{disadvantage}} {{of the method}} is that the lensing cannot be repeated, because the chance alignment never occurs again. Also, the detected planets will tend to be several kiloparsecs away, so follow-up observations with other methods are usually impossible. In addition, the only <b>physical</b> <b>characteristic</b> that can be determined by microlensing is {{the mass of the}} planet, within loose constraints. Orbital properties also tend to be unclear, as the only orbital characteristic that can be directly determined is its current semi-major axis from the parent star, which can be misleading if the planet follows an eccentric orbit. When the planet is far away from its star, it spends only a tiny portion of its orbit in a state where it is detectable with this method, so the orbital period of the planet cannot be easily determined. It is also easier to detect planets around low-mass stars, as the gravitational microlensing effect increases with the planet-to-star mass ratio.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, the Rocky Mountain Horse Association {{was created}} to {{increase}} population numbers and promote the breed; there were only 26 horses in the first batch of registrations.
