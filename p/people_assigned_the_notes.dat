5000|$|People inhabiting a {{place as}} well help with {{validity}} and creation of place. Individuals assimilate the meaningfulness, functionality, name and identity of a space - especially the more in contact they are with the area. The homogeneity of design and architecture of a given neighborhood allows members to identify the class of {{people as well as}} name of the area. Quite similar to how people address personal occupation by uniform, the sameness of a given area works in a similar fashion. This same reasoning occurs with structures that are unique; its individuality stands out so much, <b>people</b> <b>assign</b> meaning and identity to it. As stated before, place is not only conceptualized as a location but by the meanings, functionality and qualities <b>people</b> <b>assign</b> to <b>the</b> social stuff that are there.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze legal texts under the law with special {{provisions}} for the care of children, to create a deeper understanding of, and if so, how social workers in the Swedish social services and courts construct different discourses on culture and violence. Compulsory care of children according to the law mentioned above is one of the biggest intervention the Swedish state has the authority to do against individuals. Swedish courts decide whether the child should be taken into care based on the social services investigation. The empirical data for the study is eight legal texts, where the child was abused by the legal guardian, which have been studied through discourse analysis. Discourse focuses on how people through language construct and reconstruct perceptions of the reality. The focus of the analysis was to find constructions of subject positions, categories and relations. The results of the analysis showed that the selected legal texts constructs stereotypical ideas about “honour culture” and gives culture a great explanatory value to the violence practiced by <b>people</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>the</b> “honour culture”. The “Swedish culture” on the contrary, was made invisible and was given no explanatory value to the violence. Instead the violence was given social and individual explanations. The selected legal documents had a tendency to construct perceptions of “honour culture” and honour related violence in a stereotypical and homogeneous way...|$|R

40|$|<b>People</b> <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> {{artificial}} words takete and kiki to spiky, angular {{figures and}} the artificial words maluma and bouba to rounded figures. We examined whether such a cross-modal correspondence {{could also be}} found for human body motion. We transferred the body movements of speakers onto two-dimensional coordinates and created animated stick-figures based on this data. Then we invited people to judge these stimuli using the words takete-maluma, bouba-kiki, and several verbal descriptors that served as measures of angularity/smoothness. In addition to this we extracted the quantity of motion, the velocity of motion and the average angle between motion vectors from the coordinate data. Judgments of takete (and kiki) were related to verbal descriptors of angularity, a high quantity of motion, high velocity and sharper angles. Judgments of maluma (or bouba) were related to smooth movements, a low velocity, a lower quantity of motion and blunter angles. A forced-choice experiment during which we presented subsets with low and high rankers on our motion measures revealed that <b>people</b> preferably <b>assigned</b> stimuli displaying fast movements with sharp angles in motion vectors to takete and stimuli displaying slow movements with blunter angles in motion vectors to maluma. Results indicated that body movements share features with information inherent in words such as takete and maluma and that people perceive the body movements of speakers {{on the level of}} changes in motion direction (e. g., body moves to the left and then back to the right). Follow-up studies are needed to clarify whether impressions of angularity and smoothness have similar communicative values across different modalities and how this affects social judgments and person perception...|$|R

40|$|The major {{body of the}} {{literature}} about individuals’ left-right orientation assumes that individuals’ values and attitudes towards different issues will, besides other factors, determine {{their position in the}} left-right dimension. Regarding values, it is assumed that these are stable over (a long period of) time and hence, affect individuals’ left-right orientation. But as issue preferences change over time, cross-nationally and in their importance for individuals, the relationship between issues and left-right orientation is less clear. We argue and show with data from the European Social Survey (2002 / 03) of the Netherlands that the relationship between the opinions about or the attitude towards issues and left-right orientation is moderated by issue salience which means <b>the</b> importance <b>people</b> <b>assign</b> to <b>the</b> issues.
