40|$|Commercially {{available}} {{recombinant protein}} drugs often cause immune reactions {{in the body}} which reduces their efficiency.

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>drugs</b> hold great {{potential}} for treating {{a wide variety of}} human diseases. However, the efficient and safe delivery of <b>protein</b> <b>drugs</b> in vivo is still a long-standing challenge. Great effort has been made to develop polymeric systems to control the release of <b>protein</b> <b>drugs</b> with desired kinetics. However, current protein delivery systems suffer from problems including the rapid release of <b>protein</b> <b>drugs,</b> the inefficiency of controlling the release of multiple proteins with different release kinetics, and the involvement of toxic molecules and/or harsh conditions during the preparation of protein delivery systems. This Ph. D. project is aimed to create an aptamer-based hydrogel system that is promising to address these problems. The novel hypotheses of this research are: (1) aptamers can bind to and entrap proteins in the hydrogel due to their high affinity and specificity; and (2) the release rate of proteins can be controlled by tuning the binding functionality of aptamers either intramolecularly or intermolecularly. To test these hypotheses and to achieve the goal, two specific tasks have been performed. The first one is to fundamentally understand aptamer-protein interactions at the molecular level. The second one is to thoroughly investigate the effectiveness of using aptamers and molecular triggers to control the release rates of loaded proteins. The results clearly showed that aptamers could be used as novel affinity ligands to functionalize hydrogels for controlling protein release with desired kinetics. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the primary}} drugs used in {{treatment}} of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is L-asparaginase (ASNase), which despite its therapeutic efficacy, faces challenges often faced in <b>protein</b> <b>drug</b> treatment: the immunogenicity and short half-life of the drug. In order to overcome these major challenges, the red blood cell (RBC) encapsulation method has been employed to prevent degradation by serum proteases and elimination by reticuloendothelial system, thereby increasing circulation half-life of the <b>protein</b> <b>drug.</b> However, the encapsulation methods used thus far, such as hypotonic dialysis/resealing and electroporation, showed compromise in the oxygen transport function and structural integrity of RBCs. Herein we introduce a novel RBC encapsulation method that involves low molecular weight protamine (LMWP), a protein transduction domain (PTD) peptide. <b>Protein</b> <b>drug</b> was first conjugated to LMWP via disulfide bond and the cell penetrating property of LMWP allowed encapsulation of <b>protein</b> <b>drug</b> into RBCs as verified by the confocal microscopy images. The optimal encapsulation condition {{was determined to be}} 37 °C for 30 minutes. Hematological parameters as well as SEM and osmotic fragility curve of LMWP-ASNase encapsulated RBCs showed that the structural integrity was maintained while Hill coefficients and pO 50 values indicated oxygen transport functionality was maintained. LMWP-mediated encapsulation method considerably increased the circulating half-life of ASNase compared to that of the hypo-osmotic rupture/resealing method and improved the survival time of tumor-bearing mice by 44 % compared to the saline control group. Based on these data, novel method for encapsulating protein drugs into intact and fully functional RBCs was established for potential treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} C 2 (SEC 2) is {{a classical}} superantigen (SAg), which can tremendously activate T lymphocytes {{at very low}} dosage, thus exerting its powerful antitumor activity. As an intravenous <b>protein</b> <b>drug</b> and a bacterial toxin, SEC 2 has some limitations including poor patient compliance and toxic side effects. In this research, we devoted our attention to studying the antitumor activity and toxicity of SEC 2 as a potential oral administration <b>protein</b> <b>drug.</b> We proved that His-tagged SEC 2 (SEC 2 -His) could undergo facilitated transcytosis on human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco- 2) cells and SEC 2 -His was detected {{in the blood of}} rats after oral administration.

Meanwhile, although SEC 2 -His was dosed up to 32 mg/kg in mice, no significant toxicity was observed. These data showed that SEC 2 can cross the intestinal epithelium in an immunologically integral form, maintaining antitumor activity but with reduced systemic toxicity. Therefore, these results may have implications for developing SEC 2 as an oral administration <b>protein</b> <b>drug...</b>|$|E
40|$|Protein and peptide based {{therapeutics}} {{are typically}} administered by injection {{due to their}} poor uptake when administered via enteral routes of drug administration. Unfortunately, chronic administration of these drugs through multiple injections presents certain patient related problems {{and it is difficult}} to mimic the normal physiological release patterns via this mode of drug administration. A need therefore exists to non-invasively deliver these drugs by means of alternative ways such as via the oral, pulmonary, nasal, transdermal and buccal administration routes.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two chapters. Using <b>protein</b> <b>drug</b> as an example, the first chapter outlines a systematic procedure for the process synthesis and development of high-value biopharmaceutical production plants. The procedure decomposes a generic <b>protein</b> <b>drug</b> manufacturing process {{into a series of}} processing steps. First, the most appropriate separation technique is chosen for each processing step. Then the most suitable equipment will be selected for each unit operation. Finally, operating conditions will be set for each piece of equipment and process optimization will be attempted. Design heuristics and physical models describing relevant physical phenomena are provided to assist decision-making in the procedure. Real examples (interferon α and tissue plasminogen activator) are employed at the end to illustrate how to use the systematic procedure. The second chapter explains about the process synthesis and development for antibiotics, a generic kind of high-volume biopharmaceuticals. With the ultimate goal of planning feasible antibiotic plants, this chapter demonstrates the possibility of applying the same systematic procedure as the one in the first chapter with modifications, the contrasts between <b>protein</b> <b>drug</b> processes and antibiotic processes, and the reasons behind the differences. Putting the two chapters aforementioned together, the author aims at providing any reader with a balanced view on biopharmaceutical process synthesis...|$|E
