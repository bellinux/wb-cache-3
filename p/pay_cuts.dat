5|$|According to Olympus, eight {{executives}} including Takayama {{were to take}} <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> {{of between}} 30 and 50 percent starting December, {{to take responsibility for}} the accounting scandal; Takayama's salary would be halved.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, NuScale's largest investor, Kenwood Group, was {{investigated}} by the Securities Exchange Commission and later plead guilty to operating a Ponzi scheme. The SEC investigation {{was not related to}} any of Kenwood's dealings with NuScale, but Kenwood's assets were frozen just as NuScale was expecting additional funding. The company started making staffing and <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> as executives looked for new funding sources and most of the company's employees were laid off within a few months.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
50|$|By an {{executive}} order from the Governor in February 2009, all state workers are on a two-day-a-month furlough, or two days off without pay, equivalent to a 10% <b>pay</b> <b>cut.</b> On May 28, 2009 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed an additional 5% <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> for all state workers (without an adjustment {{to the number of}} days worked), resulting a total <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> of 15%; this additional cut must be approved by the legislature.|$|R
50|$|Gigli {{left the}} Met in 1932, ostensibly after refusing {{to take a}} <b>pay</b> <b>cut.</b> Giulio Gatti-Casazza, the Met's then general manager, was furious at his company's most popular male singer; he told the press that Gigli was the only singer not to accept the <b>pay</b> <b>cut.</b> There were in fact several others, Lily Pons and Rosa Ponselle among them; and it is well {{documented}} that Gatti-Casazza gave himself a large pay increase in 1931, so that after the <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> in 1932 his salary remained {{the same as it}} had been originally. Furthermore, Gatti was careful to hide Gigli's counter offer from the press, in which the singer offered to sing five or six concerts gratis, which in dollars saved was worth more than Gatti's imposed <b>pay</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|R
25|$|White {{was paid}} $122,536 in 2001. Exactly when White took a <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> is unclear, how her <b>pay</b> was <b>cut,</b> and why, is unclear. By one report, she {{received}} an $11,000 <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> shortly before she left. Another report {{said that her}} salary decreased in February 2002, but also quoted a spokesman {{as saying that the}} main difference in pay between the years was because she got a bonus in 2001 but not 2002.|$|R
5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Fox {{announced}} that, due {{to financial}} difficulties, {{they were unable}} to continue to produce The Simpsons under its current contract and that unless there were <b>pay</b> <b>cuts,</b> the show could end. For the negotiations, the studio requested that the cast members accept a 45% cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the last. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30%, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, the South Carolina {{athletic}} department reported a $15,200 deficit, and Laval reluctantly {{agreed to take}} a <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> to $5,000. However, the department's financial difficulties worsened, {{and the next year}} it requested Laval take a second <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> to $3,600, which he refused. The school allowed his contract to lapse after the 1934 season.|$|R

5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a <b>pay</b> <b>cut,</b> but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a <b>pay</b> <b>cut.</b> This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|R
5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Debs {{was a member}} of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the nation's first industrial unions. After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike, affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. To keep the mail running, President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's overall {{net sales}} {{declined}} from its peak of ¥1.8trillion (US$18.7billion) in 2009 to ¥549billion (US$4.6billion) in 2015. Net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014. In 2010, Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of ¥68 million (US$770,000), which increased to ¥187 million (US$2.11million) with performance based bonuses. In comparison, Miyamoto earned {{a salary of}} ¥100 million (US$1.13million). Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for the poor sales while {{other members of the}} Nintendo board of directors had <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> of 20–30percent. This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo's employees, preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short-term finances. In 2012, the company experienced its first operating loss since entering the video game market more than 30years earlier. Losses continued {{for the next two years}} before the company finally returned to profitability at the end of the 2015fiscal year. The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
5|$|The next year, 1894, saw <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> {{and labor}} disturbances, {{including}} a massive strike by the {{workers at the}} Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as Coxey's Army, marched on Washington that spring. Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed sympathy with the movement, {{so long as they}} refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to the campaign trail, stumping for Populist candidates in the 1894 midterm elections. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went to the Republicans rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E

25|$|During {{this period}} the Royal Navy {{was used for}} {{evacuation}} and gunboat diplomacy. There were significant <b>pay</b> <b>cuts</b> in the 1920s, culminating in the Invergordon Mutiny of 1931. The crews of various warships refused to sail on exercises, which caused great shock.
