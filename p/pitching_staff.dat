The Mets, seeking to upgrade their <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> due to poor performances and injuries to Pat Zachry and Skip Lockwood, acquired Andy Hassler from the Boston Red Sox on the same day. Ellis went 3–7 with a 6.04 ERA with the Mets.|$|E
5|$|Because Koufax's {{signing bonus}} {{was greater than}} $4,000 ($ today), {{he was known as}} a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster {{for at least two years}} before he could be sent to the minors. To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger <b>pitching</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|E

5|$|Grove {{began his}} career with the Dallas Steers of the Texas League {{at the start of the}} 1938 season. He played with the Steers until {{management}} began to replace young players with veterans due to the team's struggling form and moved Grove to the Longview Cannibals. As his first minor league season drew to a close, Grove planned on returning to Proviso High School to complete his education. At the end of the season, the St. Paul Saints purchased Grove's contract to replenish their <b>pitching</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|E
5|$|With a deep <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> in place, the Red Sox loaned Pennock to the Providence Grays of the International League in August for the {{remainder}} of the 1915 season. He split the 1916 season between the Red Sox and the Buffalo Bisons, also in the International League. With Buffalo, Pennock pitched to a 1.67 ERA, as Buffalo won the league pennant. Though the Red Sox won the 1915 and 1916 World Series, Pennock did not appear in either series.|$|E
5|$|After the 1962 season, the Yankees sold Turley to the Los Angeles Angels for cash, in {{the first}} move made by new Yankees' general manager Roy Hamey, who sought to rebuild the Yankees <b>pitching</b> <b>staff.</b> The move was conditional; the Angels could return Turley {{if they were not}} {{satisfied}} with him. The Angels chose to retain Turley {{at the start of the}} 1963 season. Turley struggled, winning two games while losing seven, and the Angels released him in July. A week later, he signed with the Boston Red Sox. Turley retired after the 1963 season, with a 101–85 win–loss record and a 3.64 ERA in 12 seasons.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pitching</b> <b>staffs</b> on MLB {{teams have}} grown from 9 or 10 {{to as many}} as 12 or 13 pitchers, due to the {{increased}} importance of relief <b>pitching.</b> The <b>staff</b> generally consists of five starting pitchers, with the remaining pitchers assigned as relievers. A team's relief staff usually contains a closer who generally pitches the ninth inning, a setup pitcher who generally pitches the eighth, and a left-handed specialist whose job is to retire left-handed batters. The rest of the bullpen then consists of middle relievers who are used in the remaining situations, and perhaps additional left-handed or right-handed specialists.|$|R
5|$|Connie Mack signed Pennock to his Philadelphia Athletics in 1912. After using Pennock sparingly, and {{questioning}} his competitive drive, Mack sold Pennock to the Boston Red Sox in 1915. After returning from military service in 1919, Pennock became {{a regular contributor}} for the Red Sox. The Yankees acquired Pennock from the Red Sox after the 1922 season, and {{he served as a}} key member of the <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> as the Yankees won four World Series championships during his tenure with the team. After retiring as a player, Pennock served as a coach and farm system director for the Red Sox, and as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of the <b>pitching</b> <b>staff,</b> according to several writers. Nevertheless, he drew the ire of Phillies fans, who were tired of his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some suggested he should be traded to another team.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Dodgers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} Los Angeles. They {{play in the}} National League West division.

5|$|Ferrell {{was once}} again traded; this time he {{returned}} to the Senators in March1944. He earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best knuckleball catchers in baseball when he had the arduous task of catching for a Senators' starting <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the unpredictability of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944American League pennant.|$|E
5|$|Gromek {{entered the}} 1948 Cleveland Indians season {{fighting}} for {{a spot on the}} <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> after spending the offseason recovering from a knee injury, which had bothered the season prior, and while he did make the roster, he remained solely a relief pitcher to start the season. He made one start as a replacement for Don Black on June 6 against the Athletics, and won the game 11–1 in a complete game effort. Boudreau considered moving him into the starting rotation, but instead considered it a one-time appearance due to Black's injury, and he remained in a relief role though mid-July. After a second complete game victory against the Athletics on July 15, Gromek was moved to a part-time starter role, where he remained the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Lemon was {{the oldest}} Indian on the roster at age 37.

There he continued physical conditioning and mentored the <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> of the Indians' top farm club. He appeared in 12 games with the Padres, going 2–5, with a 4.34 ERA, 22 walks, and 19 strikeouts. He returned to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role, but he appeared in only nine games that season. He earned just one decision that year, a loss, which brought his career pitching record to 207–128. The club put him on waivers in July.|$|E

Richard ended the season on a strong note by winning three of his last four starts, including his final two games against the Dodgers. He finished the year with a 12–10 record for the Astros, who finished with a franchise-worst 64–97 record. Richard was the only starter on the Astros' <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> who had a winning record for the season. He led the team with 176strikeouts, which was also the fifth-highest in the National League. Richard also {{led the league in}} walks allowed and wild pitches thrown, with 138 and 20, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the 1948 season, the White Sox faced {{difficult}} decisions regarding their <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> and starting rotation. In {{the midst of}} Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence {{for most of the}} preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training. In his final exhibition matchup of the season against Johnny Schmitz, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the Chicago Cubs 1–0, making Grove the only White Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason. By the end of May, Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season. However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, {{and by the end of}} the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances.|$|E
5000|$|Haney was {{valued by}} teams mainly for his {{defensive}} abilities.

50|$|Sullivan's {{reputation}} as a defensive standout is enhanced because of the era in which he played.

50|$|In 1965, Phillips {{reached the}} Major Leagues {{when he was}} named {{pitching}} coach of the Dodgers.

Although the Dodgers fell back in the standings in 1967-68, after Koufax' retirement, they still boasted {{one of the strongest}} <b>pitching</b> <b>staffs</b> in the majors.|$|R
5|$|Nonetheless, Ripken {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} play excellent defense at shortstop, {{and as a result}} remained a fixture there for well over a decade, leading the league in assists several times, winning the Gold Glove twice, and, in 1990, setting the MLB record for best fielding percentage in a season at his position. Though not a flashy fielder, Ripken displayed excellent fundamentals, and studied batters and even his own <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> so he could position himself to compensate for his lack of physical speed. Ripken's legacy as a fielder is reflected by his place near the top of almost every defensive statistical category—he holds at least one all-time record (for either season, career, or most seasons leading the league) in assists, putouts, fielding percentage, double plays, and fewest errors. Ripken's career range factor was 4.73 (and as high as 5.50 for a single season), a mark few shortstops have reached.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{entered the}} 1976 {{season as the}} <b>pitching</b> <b>staff</b> ace and took over Larry Dierker's {{position}} as the Opening Day starter for the Astros.

He followed this inauspicious beginning with wins in five of his next six decisions. One of them included a 10-inning shutout effort {{that led to a}} 16-inning 1–0 Astros victory against the Dodgers. By the end of May, however, Richard was sitting even with a 5–5 record, loser of four straight decisions. He closed {{the first half of the}} season by winning a 10-inning shutout against the Mets on July 6, and an eight-inning start against the Expos four days later. At the All-Star break, Richard had a 9–9 record with a 2.88ERA in over 153innings of work.|$|E
