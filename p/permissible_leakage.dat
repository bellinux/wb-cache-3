40|$|B y {{the time}} this {{commentary}} is published, the revised electrical safety standards for the United States will be adopted, with electric current limits relaxed so drastically as to raise serious concerns {{for the safety of}} patients connected to elec-tromedical equipment. Compared with safe current limits that have been in existence for more than 20 years, the revised 1993 standards will raise by 2. 5 to 5 times the allowable current through patient-connected leads and by 3 times the <b>permissible</b> <b>leakage</b> from the chassis of any medical device. These new limits have come about not because of the existence of new data regarding electric current levels and ventricular fibrilla-tion but primarily {{as a result of the}} reinterpretation of data that have been available for many years.

40|$|There are {{pressures}} to minimise salt leaving irrigated catchments of the Murray-Darling Basin to limit salinity {{increases in the}} River Murray. Part of this strategy is to manage drainage disposal water in the irrigation areas using disposal basins. Unfortunately, there are no existing guidelines for siting, design and management of such disposal basins. The CRC for Catchment Hydrology and CSIRO Land and Water, {{with support from the}} Murray-Darling Basin Commission, have embarked on a project with the overall objective of producing such guidelines for the Riverine Plain of the Murray Basin. This report is one of several being produced in this project to support the guidelines. It deals with water quality in the basin water and sediments. Basin water quality is important in terms of decommissioning, <b>permissible</b> <b>leakage,</b> limits to exposure to the environment and the setting of monitoring guidelines and auditing requirements. The results suggest that while there is nothing of immediate concern, some caution should be exercised with regard to aquaculture, contact with aquatic ecosystems and decommissioning. There is also a need for increasing current monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Containment of a {{transport}} cask during both normal and accident conditions {{is important to}} {{the health and safety of}} the public and of the operators. Based on IAEA regulations, releasable activity and maximum <b>permissible</b> volumetric <b>leakage</b> rate within the cask containing fuel samples of Tehran Research Reactor enclosed in an irradiated capsule are calculated. The contributions to the total activity from the four sources of gas, volatile, fines, and corrosion products are treated separately. These calculations are necessary to identify an appropriate leak test that must be performed on the cask and the results can be utilized as the source term for dose evaluation in the safety assessment of the cask...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the permissible groundwater infiltration rates in underground structures, the consequences of this leakage and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Design guides and codes do not restrict, address or make clear recommendations for permissible inflows in underground space. Owners, with the help of engineers, typically make decisions based on costs or specifications from past projects without looking at consequences of excessive groundwater infiltration and mitigation costs. The Author has reviewed the published leakage rates for tunnels in comparison with current international standards. After examining over one-hundred case studies, the Author infers that water leakage is the principal damage causing degradation on tunnel linings. International standards for <b>permissible</b> <b>leakage</b> rates (transit tunnels) are consistent with class A definitions of CIRIA (1979) and are approximately 0. 1 - 2 gpm/ 100, 000 SF (0. 05 - 1. 2 Uday/SM). The most common cause of leakage (based on numerous case studies) in cast-in-place lining is due to cracks that develop from shrinkage of concrete during curing and to the inability of the structure to accommodate movements due to thermal changes. Individual sources of leakage may be allowable within the permissible rates, however can cause damage to tunnel structure and to the surrounding environment (consolidation and differential settlement). Spalling is one of most common structural damages due to groundwater infiltration. The presence of water can cause unpleasant stains, resulting in erosion and corrosion over time. Formation of icicles, ice and water ponding can affect public safety in a tunnel and jeopardize operations. To mitigate leakage in underground structures and tunnels one may control and/or eliminate the inflow. (cont.) Chemical grouting {{is one of the most}} common measures. However, its application has been unsuccessful in 43 % of cases reported by ITA-AITES (2001). Inappropriate material selection for each particular application is major contributing factor for the lack of success. The Author focused this thesis on highway and rail tunnels, and established recommended <b>permissible</b> <b>leakage</b> rates for such underground structures based on international standards and experiences. These recommended rates can serve as guidelines for future tunnel design specifications or to compare recorded inflow rates with international standards. by Alex Nazarchuk. Thesis (M. Eng.)
