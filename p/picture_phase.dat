After reporting the SAM, the participant orally reported to the experimenter, what she saw, what had happened, and {{what was going to happen}} in the picture.

40|$|In human {{anterior}} pituitaries, follicular {{structures were}} found to develop by transformation of various types of glandular cells around foci of ruptured granulated cells undergoing destruction. In phase I, junctional complexes between granulated cells, as well as microvilli at the luminal surfaces of cell membranes, are formed. In phase II, degranulation and dedifferentiation of cytoplasm dominate the <b>picture.</b> <b>Phase</b> III follicular cells are practically devoid of secretory granules and other ultrastructural features characteristic of granulated cells. The participation of cell types in follicle formation {{does not appear to}} be limited. The follicular content in phase I-II is clearly recognizable as cellular debris from adenohypophysiocytes. These findings indicate that neither follicles nor junctional complexes are necessarily permanent structures of the anterior pituitary. It can be assumed that substances escaping from ruptured granulated cells may induce the formation of junctional complexes between adjacent cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of MHD waves and instabilities in a weakly ionised system, e. g., an interstellar molecular cloud. We determine all the critical wavelengths of perturbations across which the sustainable wave modes can change radically (and so can their decay rates), and various instabilities are present or absent. These critical wavelengths are essential for understanding the effects of MHD waves (or turbulence) on the structure and evolution of molecular clouds. Depending on the angle of propagation relative to the magnetic field and the physical parameters of a cloud, there are wavelength ranges in which no wave can be sustained as such. Yet, for other directions of propagation or different properties of a model cloud, there may exist some wave mode(s) at all wavelengths. For a typical cloud, magnetically-driven ambipolar diffusion leads to removal of any support against gravity that most short-wavelength waves (or turbulence) may have had, and gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion sets in and leads to cloud fragmentation into stellar-size masses, as first suggested by Mouschovias three decades ago [...] a single-stage fragmentation theory of star formation, distinct from the hierarchical fragmentation <b>picture.</b> <b>Phase</b> velocities, decay times, and eigenvectors (the densities and velocities of neutral particles and the plasma, and components of the magnetic field) are determined as functions of the wavelength of the disturbances and are explained physically. Comparison of the results with nonlinear analytical or numerical calculations is also presented, excellent agreement is found, and confidence in the analytical, linear approach is gained to explore phenomena difficult to study through numerical simulations. Mode splitting and mode merging, which are impossible in single-fluid systems for linear perturbations, occur naturally in multifluid systems. Comment: To appear in MNRAS. 41 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

5000|$|The {{permitted}} {{level of}} delay ripple (or phase ripple) introduced by a circuit {{is very much}} dependent on the application in which the network is being used. [...] In situations where waveform or pulse fidelity is important, then the permitted ripple is only small. In the case of analogue television waveforms, for example, the picture content also has a bearing on the acceptable levels of system distortion. (With TV <b>pictures,</b> <b>phase</b> ripple will give effects similar to ‘ghosting’ or multipath reception, where low level multiple images are superimposed on the main picture. Also ‘ringing’ after transient edges is another result of non-linear phase. The acceptability of the picture impairment often depends on the scene being displayed). Wheeler, using the method of [...] "paired echoes", suggested that a phase ripple of 0.1 rads, p-p (or 6 degrees, p-p) was tolerable in TV signals. [...] Other writers suggest that a group delay ripple of a few percent is permissible. [...] In making a judgement of permitted distortion, limits can be set on waveform asymmetry, the level of overshoots and pre-shoots, and rise-time degradation and this is discussed in the section on ‘Transient Testing’ later.|$|R
