5|$|In {{their new}} form the {{locomotives}} {{were similar in}} outline to the N15 class, though suffered from the expectation amongst crews that they were an improved version of this type. Despite this, their ability to accelerate well was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use</b> on cross-country trains between main lines. The class saw service into nationalisation in 1948. All had been withdrawn by 1957, with none preserved.|$|E

In {{a version of}} the event later circulated by his political opponents, he was cashiered for cowardice and ordered to carry a wooden sword to represent his shame.

30|$|I {{opened with}} Utpaladeva’s {{discussion}} {{of the distinction between}} imagination as vikalpa and bhāvana. In the final verse to this text Utpala describes this path of Recognition as the easy path (sulabho). 17 What makes it easy? Our medieval thinkers lean on the familiarity of everyday embodiment. It <b>puts</b> <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use</b> our already well-trod habits of being in our bodies, in our ordinary worlds. The path delineated here is meant as a kind of everyday, ordinary sort of sādhana, something universally available to everyone, not just to the monk meditating in a cave.|$|R

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use.</b> Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E

She renewed her support for a defeat of the Confederacy, and before long she was leading a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. The marshes and rivers in South Carolina {{were similar to those}} of the Eastern Shore of Maryland; thus her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge among potential enemies were <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use.</b> Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants. She later worked alongside Colonel James Montgomery, and provided him with key intelligence that aided the capture of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E

5000|$|In a fight Miho {{typically}} {{uses her}} swords to [...] "play" [...] with her opponent (in Family Values Dwight likens {{her to a}} cat), often dodging her opponent's blows while hitting him/her (with seeming ease) in return. She {{would appear to be}} a modern-day master of traditional ninjutsu as she tends to rely on stealth, evasion, and counterattacks more than directly engaging an opponent. This <b>puts</b> <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use</b> her acrobatic/gymnastic ability and knowledge of pressure points, veins, and arteries. She is also sometimes seen using roller-skates to get around, much as Carrie Kelly did as Catgirl in Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, which was also written by Frank Miller.|$|R

The aim of her research is to examine anti-Semitism in Italy during the Fascist period as it is described in Romanzo di Ferrara, which should be regarded as “not a simple collection of stories, but rather a true document” about Jewish integration and Italian betrayal, about the Fascist persecution and the painful disillusion of the victims.

However, in heavy freight service they were somewhat less successful, as their relatively light weight and low factor of adhesion caused them to slip on heavy loads.
