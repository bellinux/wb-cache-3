5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make {{the arrangement of the}} orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{amplification}} {{system used}} in Nova and other high-power lasers of its era was limited {{in terms of}} power density and pulse length. One <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amplifier glass responded {{over a period of}} time, not instantaneously, and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified. Another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> high power densities led to the same sorts of self-focusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs, but at such a magnitude that even measures like spatial filtering would not be enough, in fact the power densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air.|$|R

25|$|Some {{argue that}} the root <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} is self-selecting, rendering the culture a self-perpetuating one.

25|$|The basic <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{constructor}} is {{a peculiar}} function; {{when it starts}} off, there is no object, only raw memory. And {{by the time it}} finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} issues with this set, however. The first one {{is that in the}} two-die option of the game, the first chain should stay exactly the same {{in order to make the}} game nontransitive. In practice, though, D {{actually}} beats C. The second <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> third player would have to be allowed to choose between the one-die option and the two-die option – which may be seen as unfair to other players.|$|E

25|$|Although localizationist {{approaches}} {{provide a}} useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, {{one problem is}} that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another. Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability {{in the types of}} difficulties they experience.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} works {{devoted to}} the saint and his legend are a 'Life of Brendan' in several Latin and Irish versions (Vita Brendani / Betha Brenainn) and the better known 'Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot' (Navigatio sancti Brendani abbatis). Unfortunately, the Lives and the Voyage provide little reliable information about his life and travels; they do, however, attest {{to the development of}} his following in the centuries after his death. An additional <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> precise relationship between the Vita and the Navigatio traditions is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{historical}} {{record of the}} Kurds in Azerbaijan is filled with lacunae. For instance, in 1979 there was according to the census no Kurds recorded. Not only did Turkey and Azerbaijan pursue an identical policy against the Kurds, they even employed identical techniques like forced assimilation, manipulation of population figures, settlement of non-Kurds in areas predominantly Kurdish, suppression of publications and abolition of Kurdish as a medium of instruction in schools. Kurdish historical figures such as Sharaf Khan of Bitlis and Ahmad Khani and the Shaddadid dynasty as a whole were described as Azeris. Kurds who retained 'Kurdish' as their nationality on their internal passports as opposed to 'Azeri' were unable to find employment.|$|E
25|$|Retaining {{literacy}} {{was as much}} {{a problem}} as acquiring it, particularly among the rural population. Literacy rates declined between 1966 and 1976.

50|$|Conservative leader Stephen Harper was {{sympathetic}} to Chrétien's complaints of bias, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commission's {{terms of reference}} did not allow it to investigate Paul Martin's contracting habits as finance minister.

25|$|The {{theories}} and principles in the Drake equation {{are closely related}} to the Fermi paradox. The equation was formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The speculative equation considers the rate of star formation in the galaxy; the fraction of stars with planets and the number per star that are habitable; the fraction of those planets that develop life; the fraction that develop intelligent life; the fraction that have detectable, technological intelligent life; and finally the length of time such communicable civilizations are detectable. The fundamental <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last four terms are completely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebalancing}} and re-indexing of leveraged ETFs {{may have}} considerable costs when markets are volatile. The rebalancing <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fund manager incurs trading losses because {{he needs to}} buy when the index goes up and sell when the index goes down {{in order to maintain}} a fixed leverage ratio. A 2.5% daily change in the index will for example reduce value of a -2x bear fund by about 0.18% per day, which means that {{about a third of the}} fund may be wasted in trading losses within a year (1-(1-0.18%)252=36.5%). Investors may however circumvent this problem by buying or writing futures directly, accepting a varying leverage ratio. A more reasonable estimate of daily market changes is 0.5%, which leads to a 2.6% yearly loss of principal in a 3x leveraged fund.|$|E
25|$|Slower {{degeneration}} of {{the distal}} segment {{than that which}} occurs in the peripheral nervous system also contributes to the inhibitory environment because inhibitory myelin and axonal debris are not cleared away as quickly. All these factors contribute {{to the formation of}} what is known as a glial scar, which axons cannot grow across. The proximal segment attempts to regenerate after injury, but its growth is hindered by the environment. It {{is important to note that}} central nervous system axons have been proven to regrow in permissive environments; therefore, the primary problem to central nervous system axonal regeneration is crossing or eliminating the inhibitory lesion site. Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> morphology and functional properties of central nervous system neurons are highly complex, for this reason a neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás' law).|$|E

30|$|A {{critical}} concern regarding creating {{solutions to}} these perplexing <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> available technology seems to advance {{as quickly as}} the problems themselves. Many current healthcare professionals lack training to work with emerging technologies, thereby stalling advances in public health and industry (Powell-Cope et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2000; Crebert et al. 2004; Vilmante and Ramune 2008).|$|R
25|$|Modernized and new large {{refineries}} such as {{are found}} in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.|$|E
25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} {{the chances that}} an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities. Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled {{large enough to be}} of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} conservation <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{area is the}} second most populated natural protected area in Mexico, with severe problems with poverty. This creates a need to balance conservation efforts with local subsistence needs. One important aspect of this is to manage forest resources so that local woodcutters can make a living while controlling how much is cut. However, mass migration out of the region has almost halved the population of the Querétaro biosphere to about 50,000 people since it was declared. This has taken pressure off of local natural resources, as agriculture, livestock production and logging lessen. Many {{of the people who have}} left are in the United States and send money back home. This money has spurred the building of larger homes and the proliferation of pick up trucks, many with U.S. license plates. It has also allowed for the change to gas over firewood for cooking, but garbage has become a problem. However, overall the depopulation has been positive for the recuperation of the biosphere.|$|E

50|$|A third <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{inadequate}} infrastructure {{also became}} a problem for many potential investors.

Roads and railroads, especially the Nazi-era Autobahns had to be virtually rebuilt {{because they had been}} so badly maintained.|$|R
25|$|The Factbook {{is full of}} usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and {{out-of-date}} information, {{which are}} often repeated elsewhere due to the Factbooks widespread use as a reference. For example, Albania was until recently, described in the Factbook as 70% Muslim, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholic, {{which was based on}} a survey conducted in 1939, before World War II; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures. Another example is Singapore, which the Factbook states has a total fertility rate of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78. This low and inaccurate value then gets cited in news articles which state that Singapore has the world's lowest fertility, or at least use the figure for its shock value. Another serious <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Factbook never cites its sources, making verification of the information it presents difficult if not impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the β-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination {{of the structure of}} domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a β-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a β-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a β-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 Å (1.2nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.|$|E
