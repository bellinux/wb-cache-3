Furthermore, the applicant, who had deliberately chosen to remain on the run after escaping from prison, had received effective assistance during the proceedings from several lawyers specially appointed by him. Hence, the Italian and subsequently the French authorities had been entitled to conclude that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right to appear and be tried in person. The French authorities had therefore taken due account of all the circumstances of the case and of the Court’s case-law in granting the extradition request made by the Italian authorities: manifestly ill-founded.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> title <b>of</b> my Master's degree {{thesis is}} " Reorganization and {{discharge}} of debts". I have chosen this topic because of various reasons. Firstly, I consider <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> special legislation for the insolvency as necessary because <b>the</b> enforcement <b>proceedings</b> {{can be considered}} fair when the debtor has sufficient assets to satisfy all creditors' claims. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> more creditors who the debtor is unable to meet over a long period, then <b>the</b> enforcement <b>proceedings</b> do not achieve this purpose any more. Property relations between the debtor and his creditors need to be arranged equitably so that the registered creditors will be repaid {{in proportion to the}} debtor's assets. Furthermore the subject is very close to me because of a half-year traineeship with a trustee. This is a continuously developing branch of private law, which has undergone a significant change during the year 2014 and I had a chance through my thesis to become acquainted with this amendment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Insolvency act. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> my work is to describe <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> by focusing on remedial actions. A fair debtor, who is taking such a serious-minded and responsible approach to this proceeding, can start new life without debts and creditors may be get higher monetary payment than they would have received through [...] ...|$|R
