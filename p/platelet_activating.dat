25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid <b>platelet</b> <b>activating</b> factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E

We recently showed strongly impaired but not absent αIIbβ 3 -mediated aggregation of CalDAG-GEFI–deficient <b>platelets</b> <b>activated</b> with various agonists. Here we further evaluated the roles of CalDAG-GEFI and protein kinase C (PKC) for αIIbβ 3 activation in <b>platelets</b> <b>activated</b> with a PAR 4 receptor–specific agonist, GYPGKF (PAR 4 p). Compared with wild-type controls, platelets treated with the PKC inhibitor Ro 31 - 8220 or CalDAG-GEFI–deficient platelets showed a marked defect in aggregation at low (< 1 mM PAR 4 p) but not high PAR 4 p concentrations. Blocking of PKC function in CalDAG-GEFI–deficient platelets, how-ever, strongly decreased aggregation at all PAR 4 p concentrations, demonstrating that CalDAG-GEFI and PKC represent separate, but synergizing, pathways important for αIIbβ 3 activation. PAR 4 p-induced aggregation {{in the absence of}} CalDAG-GEFI required cosignaling through the Gαi-coupled receptor for ADP, P 2 Y 12.

In all experiments described, the rate of thrombin formation for <b>platelets</b> <b>activated</b> by the combined action of collagen and thrombin is {{greater than that of}} platelets stimulated by collagen or thrombin alone. The presence of added factor V, enhanced the rate of thrombin formation in all cases, but the higher activity observed with platelets stimulated by collagen plus thrombin remains. When <b>platelets</b> are <b>activated</b> by collagen plus thrombin in the presence of factor X, and prothrombin, a lag period of approximately 10 min is observed before the rate of thrombin forma-tion reaches a steady state. Addition of an excess of factor V, in this experiment reduces the lag time to 3 min. This lag period is interpreted as the time required to generate extra binding sites for the prothrombinase complex at the platelet surface.

40|$|<b>Platelets</b> <b>activated</b> {{by various}} {{agonists}} produce vesicles (microparticles; MPs) from the plasma membrane. However, {{the mechanism of}} this MP formation remains to be elucidated. To investigate the possible involvement of protein phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganization in MP formation, the effects of various inhibitors on MP formation were investigated. Flow cytometry was employed to detect the amount of MP formation by using monoclonal antibodies against glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa (NNKY 1 - 32) or GPIIb (Tab). The relationship between changes in cytoskeletal architecture and MP formation in the <b>platelets</b> <b>activated</b> by thrombin plus collagen was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Moreover, SEM of the cytochalasin D-treated platelets revealed the absence of shape change, pseudopod formation and MPs. These findings suggest that cytoskeletal reorganization is necessary for MP formation. Since cytoskeletal reorganization is considered to be regulated by a dynamic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation process, we investigated the effects of the protein phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin A (CLA) and okadaic acid (OA), on MP formation. Flow cytometry showed that these two inhibitors doubled MP formation in <b>activated</b> <b>platelets.</b> SEM of the platelets treated with CLA or OA demonstrated more prominent shape change and pseudopod formation in these platelets than in those without inhibitor.

50|$|In normal brain cells, PLA2 {{regulation}} {{accounts for}} a balance between arachidonic acid's conversion into proinflammatory mediators and its reincorporation into the membrane. In the absence of strict regulation of PLA2 activity, a disproportionate amount of proinflammatory mediators are produced.

Lysophospholipids are another class of molecules released from the membrane that are upstream predecessors of <b>platelet</b> <b>activating</b> factors (PAF). Abnormal levels of potent PAF are also associated with neurological damage. An optimal enzyme inhibitor would specifically target PLA2 activity on neural cell membranes already under oxidative stress and potent inflammation.

50|$|As {{with other}} forms of {{refractive}} surgery, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially referred to as 'dry eye,' {{is the most common}} complication of PRK, and can be permanent. In more advanced cases, recurrent erosions occur during sleeping from adherence of the corneal epithelium to the upper eyelid with rapid eye movement. Adjuvant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with high Omega-3 content before and after surgery improves sicca, possibly due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Foods containing PUFAs include flax and fish oil. Brush PRK to denude the epithelium, instead of alcohol based techniques, also result in quantitatively lower ocular dryness after surgery. The amount of corneal hazing after surgery is also decreased with brush technique. The <b>platelet</b> <b>activating</b> factor LAU-0901 has shown effect in mitigating dry eye in mouse models.

50|$|Neural {{membranes}} contain several {{classes of}} glycerophospholipids which turnover {{at different rates}} {{with respect to their}} structure and localization in different cells and membranes. There are three major classes namely; 1-alkyl-2-acyl glycerophospholipid, 1,2-diacyl glycerophospholipid and plasmalogen. The main function of these classes of glycerophospholipids in the neural memeberanes is to provide stability, permeability and fluidity through specific alterations in their compositions. The glycerophospholipid composition of neural membranes greatly alters their functional efficacy. The length of glycerophospholipid acyl chain and the degree of saturation are important determinants of many membrane characteristics including the formation of lateral domains that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Receptor-mediated degradation of glycerophospholipids by phospholipases A(l), A(2), C, and D results in generation of second messengers, such as prostaglandins, eicosanoids, <b>platelet</b> <b>activating</b> factor and diacylglycerol. Thus, neural membrane phospholipids are a reservoir for second messengers. They are also involved in apoptosis, modulation of activities of transporters, and membrane-bound enzymes. Marked alterations in neural membrane glycerophospholipid composition have been reported to occur in neurological disorders. These alterations result in changes in membrane fluidity and permeability. These processes along with the accumulation of lipid peroxides and compromised energy metabolism may be responsible for the neurodegeneration observed in neurological disorders.|$|E

BAFF {{is one of the most}} important cytokines involves in the modulation of the immune system and is deeply connected with food and nutrition; it is also produced by cells of bowel mucosa when some foods react with the innate immunity and determine inflammation. This fact is easy to understand, because BAFF had been first studied in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, in patients with celiac disease, serum BAFF levels are reduced after a gluten-free diet. The same reduction can be present in the recently defined “Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity” (a reaction to gluten which provokes almost the same symptoms of celiac disease and could involve up to 20% of apparently healthy individuals. The symptoms connected with this kind of food induced inflammatory phenomena, are often indistinguishable from symptoms of celiac disease. BAFF is also a specific inducer of insulin resistance and can be a strong link between inflammation and diabetes or obesity. BAFF gives the organism a sort of danger signal and usually, according to the evolutionary theories, every human being responds to danger activating thrifty genes in order to store fat and to avoid starvation.

30|$|These {{findings}} suggest that the major angiogenic growth factors, such as PDGF and VEGF, are not significantly diffused away from <b>platelets</b> <b>activated</b> by endogenous thrombin during centrifugation but efficiently preserved in PRF preparations and that the angiogenic potential of PRF preparations is compatible with that of PRP preparations. In conjunction with the user-friendly preparation procedure and high-handling efficiency, we would recommend the clinical use of PRF preparations as a higher-quality, clinically effective substitute for PRP preparations in wound healing therapy.|$|R
