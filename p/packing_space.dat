40|$|Abstract—A packing {{algorithm}} for {{particles of}} complex shapes and {{a method to}} use the packing structure directly to predict its thermal properties are described. A novel aspect of the packing algorithm is that the particles, their movements and the <b>packing</b> <b>space</b> are all digitized. Using this approach, some major difculties encountered by traditional packing algorithms can be avoided, for example, handling non-spherical and complex shapes, and detection of collision or overlap between the particles. The digital algorithm is capable of generating packing of particles of arbitrary shapes and sizes in a <b>packing</b> <b>space</b> or container of an arbitrary geometry. To predict effective thermal conductivity of the packing structure, an iterative nite difference method is used. The formulation is performed directly on the individual building blocks using fundamental laws of heat transfer. By performing the calculations at such a microscopic level, only the basic information about the material is needed and the inuence of the microstructure on thermal properties can be assessed directly...|$|E

40|$|Investigating how tightly objects <b>pack</b> <b>space</b> is {{a long-standing}} problem, with {{relevance}} for many disciplines from discrete mathematics {{to the theory}} of glasses. Here we report on the fundamental yet so far overlooked geometric property that disordered mono-disperse spherical bead packs have significant local structural anisotropy manifest {{in the shape of the}} free space associated with each bead. Jammed disordered packings from several types of experiments and simulations reveal very similar values of the cell anisotropy, showing a linear decrease with packing fraction. Strong deviations from this trend are observed for unjammed configurations and for partially crystalline packings above 64 %. These findings suggest an inherent geometrical reason why, in disordered packings, anisotropic shapes can fill space more efficiently than spheres, and have implications for packing effects in non-spherical liquid crystals, foams and structural glasses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Here {{we present}} an {{algorithm}} for procedurally generating {{a range of}} digital assets including 2 dimensional textures and 2. 5 dimensional texture roughness. The approach involves placing shapes randomly, without overlap and with a monotonically decreasing area, within a region on a plane (the 2 dimensional texture). If the process is continued to infinity then the result is space filling thus providing a variable and potentially infinite degree of visual detail. It will be proposed and illustrated that the process is independent of the actual shape being used and as such can find application {{to a range of}} texture effects.

40|$|An {{application}} of statistic techniques for structure evaluation of packing of equal or distributed spherical particles is presented. The packing of particles generated by computer simulation is cut {{by a series}} of equally separated parallel planes, and the area densities of the cross-sections of particles on the cutting planes are used to analyse the packing structure. It is shown that as the number of the cutting planes increases, the mean of the area densities approaches the packing density. Then a time series analysis technique is applied to examine the randomness of the packing. The homogeneity of the packing is evaluated by testing the hypothesis that the particles are uniformly distributed within the <b>packing</b> <b>space.</b> The isotropy of the packing is evaluated both at micro-level, the distribution of projections of centre-to-centre lines between touching particles, and at macro-level, the variances of area densities on the cutting planes perpendicular to different directions. As case studies, the above techniques are applied to evaluate the packing structures of both equal and distributed particles obtained by a collective rearrangement simulation model...|$|E

40|$|A digital {{computational}} {{approach has}} been developed to simulate realistic structures of packed beds. The underlying principle of the method is digitisation of the particles and <b>packing</b> <b>space,</b> enabling the generation of realistic structures. Previous publications [Caulkin, R., Fairweather, M., Jia, X., Gopinathan, N., & Williams, R. A. (2006). An investigation of packed columns using a digital packing algorithm. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 30, 1178 – 1188; Caulkin, R., Ahmad, A., Fairweather, M., Jia, X., & Williams, R. A. (2007). An investigation of sphere packed shell-side columns using a digital packing algorithm. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 31, 1715 – 1724] have demonstrated {{the ability of the}} code in predicting the packing of spheres. For cylindrical particles, however, the original, random walk-based code proved less effective at predicting bed structure. In response to this, the algorithm has been modified to make use of collisions to guide particle movement in a way which does not sacrifice the advantage of simulation speed. Results of both the original and modified code are presented, with bulk and local voidage values compared with data derived by experimental methods. The results demonstrate that collisions and their impact on packing structure cannot be disregarded if realistic packing structures are to be obtained. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} {{structural}} studies performed {{on an individual}} target in small scale or on many targets in the systemwide scale of structural genomics depends critically on three parameters: (i) obtaining an expression system capable of producing large quantities of the macromolecule(s) of interest, (ii) purifying this material in soluble form, and (iii) obtaining diffraction-quality crystals suitable for x-ray analysis. The attrition rate caused by these constraints is often quite high. Here, we present a strategy that addresses {{each of these three}} parameters simultaneously. Using DNA shuffling to introduce functional sequence variability into a protein of interest, we screened crude lysate supernatants for soluble variants that retain enzymatic activity. Crystallization trials performed on three WT and eight shuffled enzymes revealed two variants that crystallized readily. One of these was used to determine the high-resolution structure of the enzyme by x-ray analysis. The sequence diversity introduced through shuffling efficiently samples crystal <b>packing</b> <b>space</b> by modifying the surface properties of the enzyme. The approach demonstrated here does not require guidance as to the type of mutation necessary for improvements in expression, solubility, or crystallization. The method is scaleable and can be applied in situations where a single protein is being studied or in high-throughput structural genomics programs. Furthermore, it should be readily applied to structural studies of soluble proteins, membrane proteins, and macromolecular complexes...|$|E
40|$|Porosity {{as one of}} the key {{properties}} of sediment mixtures is poorly understood. Most of the existing porosity predictors based upon grain size characteristics have been unable to produce satisfying results for fluvial sediment porosity, {{due to the lack of}} consideration of other porosity-controlling factors like grain shape and depositional condition. Considering this, a stochastic digital packing algorithm was applied in this work, which provides an innovative way to pack particles of arbitrary shapes and sizes based on digitization of both particles and <b>packing</b> <b>space.</b> The purpose was to test the applicability of this packing algorithm in predicting fluvial sediment porosity by comparing its predictions with outcomes obtained from laboratory measurements. Laboratory samples examined were two natural fluvial sediments from the Rhine River and Kall River (Germany), and commercial glass beads (spheres). All samples were artificially combined into seven grain size distributions: four unimodal distributions and three bimodal distributions. Our study demonstrates that apart from grain size, grain shape also has a clear impact on porosity. The stochastic digital packing algorithm successfully reproduced the measured variations in porosity for the three different particle sources. However, the packing algorithm systematically overpredicted the porosity measured in random dense packing conditions, mainly because the random motion of particles during settling introduced unwanted kinematic sorting and shape effects. The results suggest that the packing algorithm produces loose packing structures, and is useful for trend analysis of packing porosity...|$|E

The earliest hatcheries were simply egg-incubating that released small fry into the streams.

40|$|New {{techniques}} {{to describe and}} optimize organization in self-assembled monolayers constructed on solid semiconductor surfaces are reported. Acid-base hydrolytic chemistry of surface anchored [Sn]-NEt 2 moieties with alkyne-terminated chromophores {{has been used to}} construct close packed thin films of good structural quality on Si(100) /SiO 2 substrates. These films exhibit enhanced optical and electrical properties on the surface because of extensive conjugation within the adsorbed molecules, and offer significant potential to develop new nanoscale technologies using tailored properties that meet device purposes. The discrete surface organization of 1, 9 -decadiyne and p-diethynylbenzene monolayers on Si(100) /SiO 2 /SnO 2 surfaces is determined with a unique and powerful molecular modelling approach, using rigid geometry scans and periodic geometry optimizations. Geometric arguments produce the monolayer <b>packing</b> <b>space,</b> and rapid optimizations give small, repeating symmetric unit cells that correctly represent an infinite monolayer surface. Semi-empirical analysis of the monolayer symmetry units classifies the infinite thin films as semiconducting materials, because of organized pi-orbital overlap and the presence of acceptor bands from the Sn headgroups. Headgroup bonding is identified as a force for controlling monolayer order. At natural surface packing densities, Sn-O-Sn cross-linking prevents optimal organization of the monolayer because the cross-link distance is smaller than the preferred packing separation of organic chromophores. Optimizations at unnatural surface densities found thin films of lower energy and higher symmetry existed at increased chain-chain separations. Thin films with adjustable characteristics were created by using binary surface activation units to selectively adsorb different organic molecules. Functionalization of oxide surfaces with statistical mixtures of Si(NR 2) 4 and Sn(NR 2) 4, followed by sequential adsorption of alkynyls at Sn sites, then alcohols at free Si positions, produced randomly ordered films because of unfavourable headgroup interactions. Linking the headgroups, as (NMe 2) 3 SiO-X-C≡C-Sn(NEt 2) 3 (X = -(CH 2) n-, p-C 6 H 4 -) surface activation units, greatly improves thin film order by preventing phase separation, and increasing average chain-chain distances. Monolayers organize as linear, nanoscale rows and serve as templates for the nucleated crystallization of functionalized chromophores directly from the reaction mixture. Self-generating arrays of highly coloured dendritic crystals, with potential optoelectronic activity, are observed to form directly on solid-state electronic interfaces...|$|E
