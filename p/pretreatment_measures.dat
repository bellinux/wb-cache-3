40|$|The {{clinical}} and cost-effectiveness of a computer-aided {{cognitive behavioural therapy}} (CCBT) programme, Beating the Blues, is indicated {{by a number of}} studies, but relatively little is known about its acceptability for patients with depression, anxiety, or both. This study investigated the acceptability of Beating the Blues offered on eight scheduled clinic visits with brief face-to-face support. Pre and posttreatment measures explored the relationship among programme acceptability, treatment continuation, and outcomes for people accessing the programme in routine care. Two hundred and nineteen patients with depression, anxiety, or both were offered Beating the Blues in 11 primary and secondary care practices. One hundred and ninety-one (87 %) completed the <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> and 84 (38 %) completed a treatment feedback questionnaire. Analysis of treatment acceptability for CCBT indicated a positive patient experience with the programme. Pretreatment expectancies predicted CCBT treatment completion but not outcomes. No differences were found between men and women on <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures.</b> Posttreatment, women reported more favourable responses to the therapy, finding the programme more helpful and more satisfactory, than did men. No relationship between treatment acceptability and age was found. Study limitations, including research methods and attrition rates, and implications for future research are discussed.

In this study, biodiesel and biodiesel/diesel blend were used in a single cylinder diesel engine to study the carbonyl emissions. The result shows that carbonyl pollutants of biodiesel and biodiesel/diesel blend are mainly aldehyde and ketone compounds with 1 – 3 carbon atoms, and formaldehyde concentration is higher than 80 % of the total carbonyl pollutants for biodiesel. The formaldehyde concentration peak is reduced with the increase of intake temperature (T), intake pressure (P), and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratio and increased with the increase of compression ratio (ε). When excess air coefficient (λ) is lower than 1. 7, the formaldehyde concentration is increased with the increase of excess air ratio.

40|$|Valuable and {{extensive}} {{research into the}} recovery management of myocardial infarction patients has been conducted over the past 25 years. Innovative approaches to rehabilitation have been directed at enhancing patient function across the physiological, psychological, sociological, educational, and vocational aspects of recovery. Planned outcomes within these innovative programs, however, have been generated from research on the recovery experiences of predominately middle-aged male patients. As a result, the unique recovery experiences and needs of women following myocardial infarction are not addressed in an effective and consistent manner. ^ One successful approach to improved rehabilitation postinfarction has be documented in recent research that utilizes Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) theory of self-efficacy as framework. It upholds the premise that strategies may be employed to effective help individuals mobilize cognitive resources that can increase one 2 ̆ 7 s level of confidence resulting in improved recovery outcomes. It is being proposed that confidence of female patients may be enhanced if suggested lifestyle changes were reflect the specific challenges of women postinfarction. A complementary interaction dimension is being proposed to enhance the notions set forth by the cognitively-processed interventions. A Nursing Model of Efficacy and Interaction, an integration of Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s Self-efficacy Theory and Symbolic Interaction, provides the framework through which the following hypotheses were tested: (1) Women exposed to a cognitive model of intervention and those exposed to a cognitive-interactive model of intervention win have higher self-efficacy scores following treatment than women exposed to routine treatment, when <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> of self-efficacy are statistically controlled. (2) Women exposed to a cognitive-interactive model of intervention will have higher self-efficacy scores following treatment than women in a cognitive model of intervention, when <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> of self-efficacy are statistically controlled. ^ The three-group pretest-posttest control group design {{was used to test}} the hypothesis.

Additionally, there were no statistically significant differences on efficacy scores of women exposed to the cognitive and routine protocols, or between women exposed to the cognitive and cognitive-interactive treatment protocols. However, women who were exposed to the cognitive-interactive model of intervention scored significantly higher on the posttreatment LSM-PMI than women who were exposed to routine treatment. ...|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} has demonstrated the complex nature of breastfeeding, and brought to the forefront the many variables needed to describe and explain breastfeeding behavior in primiparous women. Research results have supported the importance of breastfeeding in promoting maternal-infant health, both physically by preventing disease, and emotionally by enhancing bonding and communication between mother and infant. However, despite these potential benefits, the majority of primiparous women will stop breastfeeding much earlier than recommended. The propensity to discontinue breastfeeding shortly {{after the birth of}} the baby has been associated with the mother 2 ̆ 7 s lack of confidence. Therefore, a quasiexperimental design was used to study the effects of a nursing intervention on breastfeeding success, in a sample of primiparous women attending childbirth classes in the Northeast. The intervention, based on Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s concept of self-efficacy embedded in Social Cognitive Theory and designed to promote breastfeeding, included prenatal breastfeeding education and support and assistance offered up to 6 weeks postpartally. It was hypothesized that: Primiparas who received the Breastfeeding Promotion Nursing Intervention (BPNI) would have higher scores on the composite measure of breastfeeding success than primiparas who were exposed to the control condition, when the <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measure</b> of breastfeeding self-efficacy was statistically controlled. The breastfeeding success score was a composite measure, the product of the postnatal breastfeeding self-efficacy measure, the number of days breastfed, and satisfaction with breastfeeding. Analysis of covariance showed that subjects in the experimental group had significantly higher scores on the composite measure of breastfeeding success than subjects in the control group, thus providing support for the hypothesis. The findings in a select sample of primiparous women attending childbirth classes in the Northeast, supported Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s concept of self-efficacy. Specifically, it was found that implementation of a BPNI, which incorporated the four principal sources of information from the theory, had an affect on the composite measure of breastfeeding success. The intervention developed extends the literature by providing support for the use of a composite measure of breastfeeding success, and a theoretically-based intervention, that provides both prenatal breastfeeding education and postpartum support for breastfeeding women. ...|$|R

Forty-two patients with locally advanced disease underwent pretreatment evaluation of tumour oxygenation using an Eppendorf computerized microneedle electrode. Twenty-two of these patients also had a second evaluation of tumour oxygenation after receiving 40 – 45 Gy external beam radiotherapy. Paraffin-embedded histological sections were obtained from random pretreatment biopsies for all 42 patients. Apoptotic index (AI) was quantified by morphology on TUNEL stained sections. No correlation was found between <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> of AI and either the median pO 2 (r = 0. 12, P = 0. 44) or percentage of values < 5 mmHg (r = – 0. 02, P = 0. 89). A significant positive correlation was found between AI and the change in tumour oxygenation (ratio of pre:post-treatment % values < 5 mmHg) following radiotherapy (r = 0. 61, P = 0. 002). The lack of correlation between apoptosis and hypoxia may occur because the Eppendorf measures both acute and chronic hypoxia, and the relative ability of acute hypoxia to induce apoptosis is unknown. These results indicate that cell death via apoptosis may be a mechanism of tumour reoxygenation during radiotherapy. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

The aim of iSPOT-D is to identify <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> that predict or moderate MDD treatment response or remission to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine; and develop a model that incorporates multiple predictors and moderators. Methods/Design The International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment - in Depression (iSPOT-D) is a multi-centre, international, randomized, prospective, open-label trial. It is enrolling 2016 MDD outpatients (ages 18 - 65) from primary or specialty care practices (672 per treatment arm; 672 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls). Study-eligible patients are antidepressant medication (ADM) naïve or willing to undergo a one-week wash-out of any non-protocol ADM, and cannot have had an inadequate response to protocol ADM. Baseline assessments include symptoms; distress; daily function; cognitive performance; electroencephalogram and event-related potentials; heart rate and genetic measures. A subset of these baseline assessments are repeated after eight weeks of treatment. Outcomes include the 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (primary) and self-reported depressive symptoms, social functioning, quality of life, emotional regulation, and side-effect burden (secondary). Participants may then enter a naturalistic telephone follow-up at weeks 12, 16, 24 and 52.

The authors therefore investigated response to cognitive behavior therapy in relation to <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> of hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenocortical (HPA) activity in hospitalized, yet unmedicated, patients. METHOD: The subjects were 29 unmedicated, hospitalized patients with major depression (DSM-III-R and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia/Research Diagnostic Criteria), nonpsychotic/nonbipolar subtype. After a 7 - to 14 -day evaluation, urinary free cortisol levels and dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) were obtained. Patients were treated {{for an average of}} 3 weeks with intensive individual cognitive behavior therapy. Response was assessed in relation to clinical severity of illness and pretreatment HPA parameters. RESULTS: Response to inpatient cognitive behavior therapy was inversely associated with pretreatment urinary free cortisol concentrations, although not strongly correlated with DST results. Overall, 12 (92 %) of 13 cortisol suppressors on the DST who had normal urinary free cortisol concentrations responded to treatment, compared with only seven (44 %) of the 16 patients characterized by nonsuppression of cortisol and/or elevated urinary free cortisol excretion. The relation between response to cognitive behavior therapy and HPA activity was not explained by clinical measures of symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with increased HPA function are less responsive to psychotherapy and, hence, might require somatic interventions. It is proposed that the negative impact of hypercortisolism on neurocognitive function mediates this relationship. Michael E. Thase, Sanjay Dubè, Kathleen Bowler, Robert H. Howland, Joyce E.

40|$|Purpose: Marked interindividual {{variation}} in drug disposition and toxicity pose an ongoing challenge to chemotherapy dosage individualization. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate pretreatment clinical features, genotype and functional indicators of drug clearance as predictors of vinorelbine clearance, and myelotoxicity that could inform dosage optimization. Patients and methods: Forty-one patients with cancer received a 60 mg intravenous dose of vinorelbine. Pretreatment routine body size measurements and blood tests were performed. Midazolam clearance and hepatic technetium labeled sestamibi (99 mTc-MIBI) clearance were used to investigate CYP 3 A and ABCB 1 (MDR 1, P-glycoprotein) phenotype respectively and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP 3 A and ABCB 1 were documented. A limited blood sampling strategy was employed and vinorelbine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Posterior Bayesian estimates of vinorelbine clearance were obtained for each patient using population pharmacokinetic modeling. Myelotoxicity was estimated from the fractional survival of neutrophils post-treatment. Results: There was 4. 3 -fold {{variation in}} vinorelbine clearance across the cohort. In a multivariable analysis, pretreatment estimated creatinine clearance (P <. 01) and hepatic 99 mTc-MIBI clearance (P =. 01) were independent predictors of vinorelbine clearance. Fractional survival of neutrophils ranged from 1. 3 % to 100 % and was significantly correlated with vinorelbine clearance (P <. 01). Body-surface area was the only pretreatment predictor of fractional survival of neutrophils independent of vinorelbine clearance (P =. 02). Conclusion: Specific indicators of drug clearance provide predictive information about vinorelbine pharmacokinetics, and body-surface area, probably reflecting normal bone marrow reserve, provides an additional pharmacodynamic indicator. Use of a fixed dose of vinorelbine with modifications guided by <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> is worthy of prospective evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Background Clinically useful {{treatment}} moderators of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) {{have not}} yet been identified, though some baseline predictors of treatment outcome have been proposed. The aim of iSPOT-D is to identify <b>pretreatment</b> <b>measures</b> that predict or moderate MDD treatment response or remission to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine; and develop a model that incorporates multiple predictors and moderators. Methods/Design The International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment - in Depression (iSPOT-D) is a multi-centre, international, randomized, prospective, open-label trial. It is enrolling 2016 MDD outpatients (ages 18 - 65) from primary or specialty care practices (672 per treatment arm; 672 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls). Study-eligible patients are antidepressant medication (ADM) naïve or willing to undergo a one-week wash-out of any non-protocol ADM, and cannot have had an inadequate response to protocol ADM. Baseline assessments include symptoms; distress; daily function; cognitive performance; electroencephalogram and event-related potentials; heart rate and genetic measures. A subset of these baseline assessments are repeated after eight weeks of treatment. Outcomes include the 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (primary) and self-reported depressive symptoms, social functioning, quality of life, emotional regulation, and side-effect burden (secondary). Participants may then enter a naturalistic telephone follow-up at weeks 12, 16, 24 and 52. The first half of the sample will be used to identify potential predictors and moderators, and the second half to replicate and confirm. Discussion First enrolment was in December 2008, and is ongoing. iSPOT-D evaluates clinical and biological predictors of treatment response in the largest known sample of MDD collected worldwide.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with HNSCC have a poor {{prognosis}} {{and development of}} imaging biomarkers that predict long-term outcome might aid in planning optimal treatment strategies. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to predict disease-free survival in patients with HNSCC by using <b>pretreatment</b> Ktrans <b>measured</b> from dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients with HNSCC were recruited from January 2005 to October 2008. Three patients were excluded because they underwent upfront neck dissection, and 6 patients were excluded due to suboptimal MR imaging data or being lost to follow-up. Disease-free survival was measured in the remaining 57 patients from the end date of chemoradiation therapy. In patients who died, the end point was the date of death, while in surviving patients the date of last clinical follow-up was used as the end point. Pretreatment Ktrans and nodal volume were computed from the largest metastatic node, and median pretreatment Ktrans and volume were used to divide patients into 2 groups (at or above the threshold value [group I] and below the threshold value [group II]. Disease-free survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the results were compared by using a logrank test with Ktrans and nodal volume as predictors. A P value. 05 was considered significant...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{majority}} of multiple myeloma (MM) patients have {{high levels of}} monoclonal immunoglobulin in the serum and/or urine and suppressed levels of the uninvolved immunoglobulins. The prognostic significance of this phenomenon has not been assessed sufficiently. In this study, our aim is to evaluate the prognostic significance of uninvolved immunoglobulin suppression measured by nephelometry in patients with new symptomatic MM and the association with other features of the disease. Materials and Methods: Between August 2003 and February 2015, 137 patients who were referred for the treatment of newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma to the Hematology Department polyclinics of the İstanbul University İstanbul Faculty of Medicine were prospectively included and had available <b>pretreatment</b> immunoglobulin levels <b>measured</b> by nephelometry.

40|$|Self-supporting Cs and/or Re-Ag {{catalyst}} disc surfaces, {{which were}} exposed to oxygen, hydrogen, ethylene and a mixture of ethylene and oxygen at 133 Pa and 483 K in a <b>pretreatment</b> chamber, were <b>measured</b> by XPS. The oxidation states and surface layer concentrations of Cs and Re on the CsRe- Ag disc changed largely with exposing to oxygen and hydrogen, while, in exposing to ethylene and the mixture of ethylene and oxygen, their parameters were almost unchangeable. O 1 s spectra with large fwhm of 3. 2 - 4. 2 eV were deconvoluted into five kinds of oxygen species, of which the composition varied with exposing to oxygen and hydrogen and also with exposure time. The results described above were compared with those on Cs-Ag and Re-Ag and discussed. 学術論...|$|R
