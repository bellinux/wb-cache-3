The objective of the OMPA project is to develop a self regulating autonomous valve {{that can be used in}} oil wells. The work was completely carried out at Statoil research centre in Porsgrunn under the supervision of Lene Amundsen from Statoil and Professor Harald Asheim from Trondheim, NTNU. This project contains two parts. The first part is the literature study about inflow control devices, autonomous inflow control devices and osmotic processes. An overview of the available devices onthe market is presented. A selection of patents is briefly summarized. The second part is the experimental study. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the possibility of using osmotic pressure to actuate a piston in order to close a valve. For this purpose anexperimental rig was built at the Statoil Porsgrunn research centre laboratory. Experiments were carried out using ordinary tap water. During the analyses two kinds of forward osmosis membranes were used: GKSS Cellulose acetate and hydration cartridge (company name HTI) cellulose triacetate. To create the required osmotic pressure to actuate the piston two kind of salt solutions NaCl and KClwith different concentrations were used. The required osmotic pressures to actuate the piston were created by using two kinds of saltsolutions (NaCl and KCl) with different concentrations. </p...|$|E

It was already shown that the sense of touch {{can be used to}} augment our perception of reality. Existing systems focus on vibration signals for information transfer, but this is unsuitable for constant stimulation in everyday use. Our sys-tem determines the distance to surrounding objects with ul-trasonic sensors and maps this information to an inward pres-sure. It was evaluated in a study with 13 blindfolded subjects in orientation and navigation tasks. The users were able to discern at least three different absolute pressure levels with high certainty. Combined with the sensors, they could also use continuous values to navigate hallways and find doors. Most users had only a few collisions, but a small group of three individuals struggled more.

40|$|Electromagnetic forming (EMF) is a {{high speed}} forming {{technique}} {{that can be used}} for embossing fine surface features onto sheet metals. Here two coupled experimental and analytical studies show how interface conditions including rebound and friction affect the ability to create a component in impact forming. In the first part of this work high velocity is generated with the Uniform <b>Pressure</b> <b>Actuator</b> (UPA) and impact with a die emboss fine features in a nominally flat component. The primary objective of this work is to develop a modelling facility that guides experimental design nominally flat grooved components. Both shape fidelity and formability aspects are presently considered. In a second short study expansion of a round tube into a square hole is considered. Traditional modelling techniques solve a coupled system of equations with spatially varying electromagnetic fluxes controlling the dynamics of the plastic deformation. Because the magnetic pressure is spatially uniform, the flux equations are obviated from the coupled system rendering them computationally efficient. The calibration of contact mechanics that influence the rebound behaviour of the sheet metal remains as a difficult issue. The interfaces between various sheet metals and the metal die play a critical role in controlling the shape of the final product. The characterization of such an interface using appropriate calibrated friction coefficients is assessed. The role of magnetic pressure in reducing the sheet metal rebound is demonstrated via a comparison between results from mechanical and electromagnetic simulations. The influence of the channel geometry on final shape is illustrated through simulation and experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of microfluidics {{in recent decades}} has opened new methods for chemical, physical, and biomedical analysis. Two particularly exciting possibilities are portable, self-contained analysis systems and high-throughput, multiplexed analysis systems. While earlier systems {{have been based on}} continuous-flow microfluidics, the advantages of droplet-based microfluidics, with droplets of one liquid phase surrounded and isolated by a continuous immiscible second liquid phase, are becoming apparent. However, many of the analysis tools which exist for continuous phase microfluidics are lacking in the droplet regime. This dissertation describes the {{development of}} tools for analysis of rheological properties of nanoliter-volume (20 to 30 nL) microfluidic droplets. We report measurements of viscosity and viscoelastic phase angle. Viscosity measurements are achieved by observing the motion of a droplet through a contraction in the channel and relating the pressure, flow rate, and geometric parameters to the viscosity with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Phase angle is measured by applying an oscillatory pressure to a droplet located in a contraction and comparing the applied pressure to the droplet interface response. At low frequencies, where the elasticity of the interface is expected to dominate, droplets behave similarly regardless of polymer concentration. As the frequency increases, to a maximum of 6 Hz (~ 37 rad/s), the elastic contribution of the droplet fluid becomes apparent and samples can be distinguished. In addition, a simple, single mask method for fabricating microstructures with smooth 3 D gradients and arbitrary shape in SU- 8 and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is presented. Demonstration applications are shown, involving particle organization, particle imaging, and size-based particle sorting. Alone or in combination with droplet-based approaches, particle-based microfluidic assays offer potential for high-throughput and multiplexed assays. This fabrication technique makes accessible different methods for particle-based assays, especially for presentation of results. This dissertation also presents preliminary work toward a micro-scale dielectric barrier discharge plasma-based electronic <b>pressure</b> <b>actuator,</b> for control of microfluidic flows. Finally, there is discussion of the distributed health diagnostics design, in particular for microfluidic technologies, through the lens of technology assessment.

40|$|This master thesis {{has focused}} on the {{membrane}} for the osmotic membrane <b>pressure</b> <b>actuator</b> (OMPA). The OMPA is an autonomous inflow control device for intended use in oil and gas wells. Its function is to prevent water from entering the well from the reservoir. This enables improved production and better reservoir management and also minimizes problems caused by produced water upstream. Extreme conditions of high temperature and pressure exist in the offshore reservoir. A commercial membrane material for the OMPA does not exist and a membrane must therefore be developed with excellent thermal, chemical and mechanical stability. Several other important factors have been identified in this thesis. A literature review was conducted to find suitable membrane materials for the OMPA. This focused on materials with glass transition temperatures of > 200 oC and some ceramic membranes. This list was shortened by cross-referencing with hydrophilic materials and literature regarding osmosis or nanofiltration and the materials. This completed list is presented in this thesis. Three commercially available membranes were received for the experimental. These were partially characterized with thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Successful permeation tests were performed on two of these membranes; RO 98 pHt® polyamide membrane (Alfa Laval) and DuraMem® 150 polyimide membrane (Evonik MET Ltd). Water flux and solute flux and rejection were performed in a reverse osmosis dead end cell at temperatures 23 oC, 50 oC and 70 oC and sodium chloride and sucrose were used as solutes. The RO 98 pHt® showed increased flux and rejection with increasing temperatures. This was attributed to increased solubility and diffusion of the solvent in the membrane at elevated temperatures. The DuraMem® 150 had increased rejection with temperature whilst the flux remained fairly constant. This was attributed to the effects of compaction counteracting the increased solubility and diffusion. Of the solutes, sucrose had the highest rejection because of its larger size. It may therefore be interesting as a draw solution for use in the OMPA. Neither membrane is suitable for direct use with the OMPA. However, the polyimide material in the DuraMem® 150 membrane may be of interest if fabricated with a more desirable morphology. From the theory and discussion presented in the thesis, an updated list of OMPA membrane requirements was constructed with methods in which to attain these requirements. The dependence of several of the requirements upon one another suggests the need for more experimental data at conditions closer to the field conditions. As commercially available membranes are currently non-existent, fabrication of membrane materials is the next step and some necessary starting literature has been provided. Finally, a new forward osmosis/pressure retarded osmosis rig design has been suggested which allows tests to be conducted at reservoir conditions which more closely mimics the intended operation of the OMPA. </p...|$|E
