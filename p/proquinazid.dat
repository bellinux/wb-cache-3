40|$|The Norwegian Scientific Committee of Food Safety (VKM) {{considers}} that the carcinogenic effects on animals obtained by {{high doses of}} the fungicide Talius causes reason for concern. This conclusion is forwarded in a health and environmental risk assessment which VKM has performed at request of The Norwegian Food Safety Authority. Talius is a new fungicide containing the new active substance <b>proquinazid</b> for use against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) in cereals and grass seed. Health risk assessment Talius is found to have low acute toxicity by human inhalation, ingestion and by dermal exposure, but irritating to skin and may cause serious damage to the eyes. Animal exposure to the active substance <b>proquinazid</b> is found to induce thyroid and liver tumors at high doses. It is uncertain to what extent these effects are relevant to humans. Estimates show low risk for operators wearing protection equipment during application. Environmental risk assessment VKM consider <b>proquinazid</b> to be persistent under prevailing Norwegian conditions and repeated annual application may cause accumulation in soil. There is a low potential for groundwater contamination from leaching of <b>proquinazid</b> and its metabolites. VKM also consider that there are minimal risks for toxic effects of <b>proquinazid</b> to terrestrial organisms, sediment dwelling organisms, aquatic plants, and algae with the proposed application regime. For fish and invertebrates minimal risks are calculated provided a tree meter buffer zone from treated area to surface water...|$|E
40|$|Bioconjugate {{preparation}} {{is a fundamental}} step for antibody generation and immunoassay development to small chemical compounds. For analytical targets holding in their structure an aryl halogen atom, cross-coupling reactions may be a simple and efficient way to obtain functionalized derivatives; thus offering great potential to elicit robust and selective immune responses after being coupled to immunogenic carrier proteins. However, substitution of the halogen atom by an aliphatic chain might eventually compromise the affinity and specificity of the resulting antibodies. In order to address this issue, <b>proquinazid,</b> a new-generation fungicide with outstanding performance, was chosen as model analyte. Two functionalized derivatives differing in spacer arm rigidity were synthesized by Sonogashira cross-coupling chemistry. These haptens were covalently coupled to bovine serum albumin and the resulting immunoconjugates were employed for rabbit vaccination. Antibodies were tested for <b>proquinazid</b> recognition by direct and indirect competitive immunoassay, and IC 50 values in the low nanomolar range were found, thus demonstrating the suitability of this straightforward synthetic strategy for the generation of immunoreagents to compounds bearing an aryl halide. Following antibody characterization, competitive immunoassays were developed and employed to determine <b>proquinazid</b> residues in grape musts, and their analytical performance was satisfactorily validated by comparison with GC-MS. Besides having described {{the development of the}} first immunochemical method for <b>proquinazid</b> analysis, an efficient functionalization approach for analytes comprising aryl halides is reported...|$|E
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the effect of <b>proquinazid</b> and copper oxide {{application}} on structural characteristics and resistance of wheat to powdery mildew, as well as remobilisation and redistribution of anions pools at generative stage of development. The trial series was conducted in the experimental agricultural production of the Institute of Plant Physiology and Genetics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Field experiments were carried out with Smuglyanka variety of winter wheat. The trial series included the application of fungicides such as Talius (<b>proquinazid,</b> 200 g/L) 0, 25 L/ha and Kocide 2000 (copper hydroxide, 350 g/kg) 150 and 300 g/ha, and combination of both fungicides. Sprays were applied at tillering stage in autumn in the first trial series and at tillering-booting stage in spring in the second one. Assessment of affected plants by powdery mildew was carried out visually in points. Anion concentration was determined {{with the use of}} ion chromatography. Application of fungicides at tillering stage increases the amount of productive stems in wheat plants. The highest effect was recorded for application of copper hydroxide at dose of 300 g/ha in autumn. Analysis of plants affected by powdery mildew shows that application of <b>proquinazid</b> and its composition with copper hydroxide provides sustained protection against Blumeria graminis (DC) Speer. Application of fungicides at tillering stage contributes to increase of the pool of free nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur anions in leaf tissues compared to control. These changes in anion composition may be caused by fungicide effect on activity of N, P, S transporters, as well as internal regulatory mechanisms of elements’ uptake by plants. Comparing the results of the autumn and spring application of fungicides should note the increase in concentration of free phosphates in wheat leaves in the 2 nd trial with <b>proquinazid</b> and its composition with copper hydroxide. Accumulation of nitrogen in the nitrate form occur in the period of maximum activity of plants during grain maturation, that is why the increase of free nitrates concentration in all trial series may indicate the remobilization of nitrogen from vegetative organs to caryopsis. Analysis of wheat ear of the 1 st trial shows increase in concentrations of free nitrates and phosphates in all trial series which may be explained by intensification of metabolic processes that occur in the ear during grain maturation. Comparison of results of 1 st and 2 nd trials shows the decrease of Cl concentration in plants of the 2 nd trial which can be associated with extension of photosynthetic activity of leaves and participation of element in oxidative phosphorylation, as well as its binding with polypeptides belonging to photolysis complex of water of photosystem II. Thus, application of <b>proquinazid</b> and copper hydroxide at tillering stage increases the productive tillering capacity and enhances the pools of N, P, S free anions in winter wheat plants. These changes {{can be explained by the}} effect of fungicides on plant metabolic processes associated with remobilization and transport of elements from flag leaves to the ears during grain maturation. Autumn application of fungicides provides an excellent protection level against powdery mildew of winter wheat plants and creates optimal conditions for plants’ development and wintering. Treatment of plants in spring is highly effective against powdery mildew at tillering-booting stage...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera aphanis) {{and leaf}} blotch (caused by Gnomoniopsis fructicola) are {{important}} diseases of strawberry in nursery and fruit production regions of Australia. Myclobutanil, trifloxystrobin and penthiopyrad are registered {{for control of}} powdery mildew in Australia, but are not restricted to either nursery or fruit production. Due to the specific mode of action of these fungicides against P. aphanis, their repeated use over the successive stages of strawberry runner and then fruit production may {{increase the risk of}} fungicide resistance in the pathogen. Currently, there is no fungicide registered for control of G. fructicola in strawberry in Australia. A series of field trials in Queensland and Victorian strawberry nurseries over two seasons (2013 / 14 to 2014 / 15) evaluated the efficacy of 19 fungicide and biorational products, applied alone or as part of a program (in combination with other products), against powdery mildew and leaf blotch. Our aim was to manage the risk of fungicide resistance by developing disease control programs specifically for use in the strawberry runner nurseries with different activity groups to the fungicides used in strawberry fruit production. Treatments were applied weekly using a knapsack sprayer starting December/January for approximately 16 weeks until prior to harvest of runners in March/April. Runners were randomly selected and rated for the incidence of powdery mildew and leaf blotch prior to harvest. Where single fungicide treatments were applied (2013 / 14), the field trial results identified bupirimate, cyflufenamid, quinoxyfen, <b>proquinazid,</b> azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, as equally or more effective in controlling powdery mildew as the industry standard program of sulphur, myclobutanil and trifloxystrobin. Field trials in 2014 / 15 assessed spray programs that were based on sulphur in different combinations with quinoxyfen, bupirimate, cyflufenamid and/or with reduced applications of myclobutanil and trifloxystrobin. All programs were as effective against powdery mildew as the industry standard program. Azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, prochloraz, and chlorothalonil were the most effective against leaf blotch in trials in 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15. It is anticipated that the coordinated use of different chemistries across the strawberry nursery and fruit industries will reduce the risk of fungicide resistance developing in pathogen populations, and increase the sustainability of disease protection across strawberry crops...|$|E
