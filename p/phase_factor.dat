5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the <b>phase</b> <b>factor).</b> In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.|$|E
25|$|The Jones matrix due to {{passage through}} a {{transparent}} material {{is dependent on}} the propagation distance as well as the birefringence. The birefringence (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be dispersive, that is, it will vary as a function of optical frequency (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the 2×2 Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar <b>phase</b> <b>factor</b> and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.|$|E
25|$|Mathematically, a pure {{quantum state}} can be {{represented}} by a ray in a Hilbert space over the complex numbers. The ray {{is a set of}} nonzero vectors differing by just a complex scalar factor; any of them can be chosen as a state vector to represent the ray and thus the state. A unit vector is usually picked, but its <b>phase</b> <b>factor</b> can be chosen freely anyway.

25|$|In media termed birefringent, {{in which}} the amplitudes are {{unchanged}} but a differential phase delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a unitary matrix: |g1| = |g2| = 1. Media termed diattenuating (or dichroic {{in the sense of}} polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a Hermitian matrix (generally multiplied by a common <b>phase</b> <b>factor).</b> In fact, since any matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive Hermitian matrices, light propagation through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.|$|E
25|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics developed by Paul Dirac, David Hilbert, John von Neumann, and Hermann Weyl, the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are symbolized as unit vectors (called state vectors). Formally, these reside in a complex separable Hilbert space—variously called the state space or the associated Hilbert space of the system—that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the <b>phase</b> <b>factor).</b> In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system—for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square-integrable functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally Hermitian (precisely: by a self-adjoint) linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can attain only those discrete eigenvalues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reducing {{the error}} of quantum {{algorithms}} is often achieved by applying a primitive called amplitude amplification. Its use leads in many instances to quantum algorithms that are quadratically faster than any classical algorithm. Amplitude amplification is controlled by choosing two complex numbers OEs and OEt of unit norm, called <b>phase</b> <b>factors.</b> If the <b>phases</b> are well-chosen, amplitude amplification reduces {{the error of}} quantum algorithms, if not, it may increase the error. We give an analysis of amplitude amplification with a emphasis {{on the influence of}} the <b>phase</b> <b>factors</b> on the error of quantum algorithms. We introduce a so-called phase matrix and use it to give a straightforward and novel analysis of amplitude amplification processes. We show that we may always pick identical <b>phase</b> <b>factors</b> OEs = OEt with argument in the range ss 3 < = arg(OEs) < = ss.

40|$|The paper BM {{proposed}} a {{construction of a}} twisted representation of the lattice vertex algebra corresponding to the Milnor lattice of a simple singularity. The main difficulty in extending the above construction to an arbitrary isolated singularity is in the so called <b>phase</b> <b>factors</b> [...] the scalar functions produced by composing two vertex operators. They are certain family of multivalued analytic functions on the space of miniversal deformations.

2500|$|One {{source of}} {{confusion}} with {{the definition of}} the spherical harmonic functions concerns a <b>phase</b> <b>factor</b> of (−1)m for m > 0, 1 otherwise, commonly referred to as the Condon–Shortley phase in the quantum mechanical literature. In the quantum mechanics community, it is common practice to either include this <b>phase</b> <b>factor</b> in {{the definition of the}} associated Legendre polynomials, or to append it to the definition of the spherical harmonic functions. [...] There is no requirement to use the Condon–Shortley phase in the definition of the spherical harmonic functions, but including it can simplify some quantum mechanical operations, especially the application of raising and lowering operators.

40|$|The {{quantum network}} model with real {{variables}} is usually {{used to describe}} the excitation energy transfer (EET) in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson(FMO) complexes. In this paper we add the quantum <b>phase</b> <b>factors</b> to the hopping terms and find that the quantum <b>phase</b> <b>factors</b> {{play an important role in}} the EET. The quantum <b>phase</b> <b>factors</b> allow us to consider the space structure of the pigments. It is found that phase coherence within the complexes would allow quantum interference to affect the dynamics of the EET. There exist some optimal phase regions where the transfer efficiency takes its maxima, which indicates that when the pigments are optimally spaced, the exciton can pass through the FMO with perfect efficiency. Moreover, the optimal phase regions almost do not change with the environments. In addition, we find that the <b>phase</b> <b>factors</b> are useful in the EET just in the case of multiple-pathway. Therefore, we demonstrate that, the quantum phases may bring the other two factors, the optimal space of the pigments and multiple-pathway, together to contribute the EET in photosynthetic complexes with perfect efficiency.
