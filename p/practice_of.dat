The notion of Vygotsky Circle is introduced in this work and is explicitly distinguished from a traditional—yet frequently criticised—notion of “the school of Vygotsky-Leontiev-Luria”. The scientific <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the Vygotsky Circle are discussed here as the unity of a) social and interpersonal relations, b) the <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> empirical scientific research, and c) discursive <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet science—more specifically, the “Stalinist Science” of the 1930 s. Thus, this study analyzes the social and interpersonal relations between the members of the Vygotsky Circle and the evolution of this circle in the social context of Soviet science during the decade of 1930 s; various <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> empirical scientific research conducted by the members of the Vygotsky Circle were also overviewed.
