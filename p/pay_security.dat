Pay-through bonds are typically divided into classes that have different maturities and different priorities for the receipt of principal {{and in some cases}} of interest. They often contain a sequential <b>pay</b> <b>security</b> structure, with at least two classes of mortgage-backed securities issued, with one class receiving scheduled principal payments and prepayments before any other class. Pay-through securities are classified as debt for income tax purposes.|$|E
40|$|Job {{satisfaction}} {{is an important}} measure of utility that employees derive from their jobs and is related to various features of the job such as <b>pay,</b> <b>security,</b> intrinsic values of work, working conditions, career growth opportunities, working hours, and the like. This paper analyzes the relationship between underemployment and overall job satisfaction among other personal and job characteristics of the workforce in Alabama using survey data from Alabama workforce development regions. A logistic model is {{used to analyze the}} determinants of job satisfaction in Alabama including underemployment. Estimation results show a negative relationship between underemployment and job satisfaction. Personal and work-related attributes such as education, age, work hours, and gender are also shown to influence employee job satisfaction.

Recent research indicates that in the United States, at least, a wife's education has {{a positive effect on}} a husband's earning capacity - a focused instance of the economic benefits of association. Even if education did not get women jobs or improve their ability to function as housewives and mothers, it is not wasted. In Israel, however, the authors found that the wife's educational level increased a husband's earnings in the primary sector (in which workers have good jobs, with good <b>pay,</b> <b>security,</b> and fringe benefits) but not in the secondary sector (in which workers have low paying, unstable, generally unattractive jobs). These new findings are consistent with the general implications of the dual labor market model.

40|$|Overall job {{satisfaction}} {{is likely to}} reflect the combination of partial satisfactions related to various features of one’s job, such as <b>pay,</b> <b>security,</b> the work itself, working conditions, working hours, and the like. The level of overall {{job satisfaction}} emerges as the weighted outcome of the individual’s job satisfaction with each of these facets. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the extent and importance of partial satisfactions in affecting and explaining overall job satisfaction. Using the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) a two layer model is estimated which proposes that job satisfaction with different facets of jobs are interrelated and the individual’s reported overall job satisfaction depends on the weight that the individual allocates to each of these facets. For each of the ten countries examined, satisfaction with the intrinsic aspects of the job is the main criterion which workers use to evaluate their job and this is true for both the short and the long term.

In this thesis we have designed and demonstrated a mobile phone application {{that can be used for}} a small shop or a big market. For any kind of commerce application, three different kind of entities are mostly involved: the customer, the sales person, and the management of the shop. Our designed mobile application has three different interfaces for three different kind of users: Manager Interface, Employee Interface, and Customer Interface. An interface for the system administrator is also designed, which should be used as an desktop application on the point of sale server. This application is flexible with capabilities of different payment options. Our proposed design can be implemented in any smart phone environment for example Android, iOS or Windows phone.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the analysis of}} job satisfaction has increased among economists. Indeed, reported levels of satisfaction have been seen as a good predictor of individual behaviour such as job turnover, productivity and absenteeism. Because of this, several studies have tried to identify the determinants of job satisfaction. This paper is concerned with job satisfaction in Portugal. For this purpose, we use the first six waves of the European Household Panel Data (ECHP). The panel nature of the data allows us to use a random effects estimator in order to control for unobservable individual heterogeneity. The results indicate that wages matter for job satisfaction but do not tell the whole story. In particular, having a good health status, a permanent contract and working the public sector influences positively the level satisfaction. We also find a great heterogeneity in satisfaction by regions, even in a small country as Portugal. These findings are valid for overall job satisfaction as well as for satisfaction with specific job domains such as <b>pay,</b> <b>security,</b> type of work and hours worked.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, {{a vast number}} of jobs have been created in the {{affluent}} economies of the industrialized world. Many workers are doing more skilled and fulfilling jobs, and getting paid more for their trouble. Yet it is often alleged that the quality of work life has deteriorated, with a substantial and rising proportion of jobs providing low wages and little security, or requiring unusually hard and stressful effort. In this unique and authoritative formal account of changing job quality, economist Francis Green highlights contrasting trends, using quantitative indicators drawn from public opinion surveys and administrative data. In most affluent countries average pay levels have risen along with economic growth, a major exception being the United States. Skill requirements have increased, potentially meaning a more fulfilling time at work. Set against these beneficial trends, however, are increases in inequality, a strong intensification of work effort, diminished job satisfaction, and less employee influence over daily work tasks. Using an interdisciplinary approach, Demanding Work shows how aspects of job quality are related, and how changes in the quality of work life stem from technological change and transformations in the politico-economic environment. The book concludes by discussing what individuals, firms, unions, and governments can do to counter declining job quality. job quality, affluent economy, industrialized world, work, wages, <b>pay,</b> <b>security,</b> economic growth, skill requirements, inequality, job satisfaction, technological change, politico-economic environment...|$|E
40|$|The Article {{is about}} {{security}} for costs in international arbitration under the ICC and ICSID Rules. It explains who is entitled to submit such a request, what kind of costs are secured, whether the tribunal has authority to order such measure, and the basis of such authority. This {{is followed by the}} discussion of the conditions for ordering the measure and the reasons that speak against it. Among various exceptional circumstances justifying the measure that are mentioned in arbitral case law, the following are discussed in more detail: manifest insolvency or bankruptcy of the claimant, SPV as claimant, third party financing of the claim, change of circumstances, respondent is not a signatory to the arbitration agreement, and probability that respondent will be awarded costs. Reasons speaking against the measure mentioned in the cases are the following: consent to the risk of insolvent claimant, access to arbitral justice, equity, respondent's bad faith, and untimeliness of the request. Finally, certain questions of procedure are discussed such as burden of proof and consequences of claimant's non-compliance with the order to <b>pay</b> <b>security.</b> The author concludes that in ICC and ICSID arbitration arbitrators are reluctant to order {{security for costs}} although such requests by respondents have become more frequent in recent times. The threshold respondent must pass to convince the tribunal that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the measure is high.

40|$|Research into job {{preference}} and job satisfaction addresses the agreement between individual and institutional values leading to job choice and job satisfaction. This research assessed ten job {{preference and}} ten job satisfaction factors at the University of Guam. Ninety-one {{faculty members and}} 32 administrators completed a two-page paired-comparison questionnaire. Demographic data were also collected. Factors' hierarchy and valence positions were reported and subjected to "PCSTATS" program to determine significance among pairs. Significant differences existed {{in three of the}} four hypotheses measuring the job preferential factors: advancement, benefits, company, co-workers, hours, <b>pay,</b> <b>security,</b> supervisor, type of work, and working conditions; and job satisfaction factors: good wages, job security, interesting work, tactful disciplining, in on things, working conditions, management loyalty, appreciation, promotion, and sympathetic understanding. Additional findings were made using post hoc analysis. Results indicated that administrators perceived others' preferences to be (a) pay, (b) advancement, and (c) type of work while faculty chose (a) type of work, (b) pay, and (c) advancement. In job satisfaction administrators selected (a) promotion, (b) good wages, and (c) job security, while the faculty chose (a) interesting work, (b) good wages, and (c) promotion. Self job preference factors chosen by males and females were (a) type of work and (b) pay with (c) advancement and (c) co-workers, respectively. The top three self job satisfaction factors chosen by males and females were (a) interesting work, (b) good wages, and (c) promotion. Disagreement is evident between groups.

We prove a representation theorem of such measures in terms of a family of dynamic convex risk measures, and provide a representation of dynamic risk measures in terms of g-expectations, and solutions of BS∆Es with convex drivers. We study the existence and uniqueness of the solutions, and derive a comparison theorem for corresponding BS∆Es. In the second part of the paper we discuss a market model for dividend <b>paying</b> <b>securities</b> by introducing the pricing operators that are defined in terms of dynamic acceptability indices, and find various properties of these operators.
