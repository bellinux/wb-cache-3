40|$|The DO {{experimental}} area has a generator designated as emergency power. This generator provides power for critical loads and starts automatically upon loss of commercial power. This note concerns {{the testing of}} this generator. A list of loads is attached to this note. One of the loads on the emergency power grid is a 10 KVA Uninterruptable Power Supply(UPS). The UPS powers the cryogenic controls and Oxygen deficiency hazard equipment(ODH) and has a minimum rating of 20 minutes while on its batteries(to cover the transfer time to/from the emergency generator). Jan 23, 1991 at 1640 hrs this system was tested {{under the supervision of}} the Terry Ross, Marv Johnson, Dan Markley, Kelly Dixon, and John Urbin. The <b>power</b> <b>feeder</b> to the emergency power grid at DO was disconnected. The generator responded immediately and was supplying power to the emergency power grid in less than 10 seconds. During the 10 seconds that there was no power on the emergency grid the UPS switched on its inverter and provided uninterrupted power to the cryogenic control system and the ODH system. All of the motorized equipment shut off instrument air compressor, vacuum pumps 1 and 2, insulating vacuum blower, glycol cooling pumps, cooling tower fan, and Exhaust Fan 7 (EF 7). Upon reengagement of power to the grid from the emergency generator, all of the motorized loads started back up with the exception of vacuum pumps 1 and 2, and the UPS inverter turned off. Vacuum pumps 1 and 2 were delay started 20 seconds by the cryogenic control system as not to cause too large of a surge in power by all of the inductive loads starting at once. The DO building elevator which is also on emergency power was test run while the emergency generator was on line with all other emergency loads. The emergency generator current was 140 amps with all loads on line and running except the building elevator. This load of 140 amps is 27 % of the generator's capacity. The cryogenic control and ODH system continued to function properly throughout the entire test due to the UPS responding correctly to each power situation. The cryogenic control system isolated both the Utility(UV) and insulating(IV) vacuum systems as to preserve their vacua while the pumps were off. Once the vacuum pumps were reestablished the IV and UV vacua were put back on line to their respective pumps by the cryogenic control system. The instrument air is backed up by a high pressure trailer, regulated down to instrument air pressure and switches automatically on line through a check valve. During the time that the instrument air compressor was off, instrument air never went below 80 psig (high pressure regulator setting) ...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the impact}} of {{distributed}} generation (DG) on steady state operation and control of power distribution systems is investigated. Over the last few years, {{a number of factors}} have led to an increased interest in DG schemes. DG is gaining more and more attention worldwide as an alternative to large-scale central generating stations. A number of DG technologies {{are in a position to}} compete with central generating stations. There are also likely opportunities for renewable energy technologies in DG. Indeed, some renewable energy based DG technologies are not yet generally cost-competitive. However, technology development may lead to major innovative progress in materials, processes, designs and products, with higher efficiency and cost reduction opportunities. In electric power systems with large central generating stations, the electric power flows in one way direction: from generation stations to transmission systems, then to distribution systems and finally to the loads. Therefore, distribution systems were designed as radial systems; and many operation and control in distribution systems, such as voltage control and protection, are based on the assumption that distribution systems are radial. In a radial distribution feeder, voltage decreases towards the end of the feeder, as loads cause a voltage drop. However, it will be altered with the presence of DG. DG will increase the voltage at its connection point, which in turn will increase the voltage profile along the feeder. This increase may exceed the maximum allowed voltage when the DG power is high. One way to mitigate this overvoltage is when DG absorbs reactive power from the grid. This method is effective for mitigation of overvoltage-caused DG in low voltage (LV) feeders where the mean of voltage control is obtained from an off-load tap changer. However, if DG absorbs reactive <b>power,</b> <b>feeder</b> losses will increase. The maximum DG that can be integrated in a feeder (DG integration limit) is limited by maximum allowed voltage variation, conductor thermal ampacity and upstream transformer rating. The DG integration limit is usually defined based on maximum DG and minimum load scenario. However, when DG and load power fluctuate throughout the day, this scenario will lead to unnecessary restriction of DG integration. Minimum load and maximum DG may not happen at the same time. Stochastic assessment using Monte Carlo simulations will be more reliable to determine the DG integration limit in this circumstance. In medium voltage (MV) feeder, where the voltage control is normally achieved by using on-load tap changer (LTC) and capacitor banks; the mitigation of overvoltage-caused DG can be obtained by coordinating DG with the LTC and capacitors. The use of line drop compensation (LDC), which is present in most LTCs but often not used, can also mitigate the overvoltage. When the LDC is coordinated properly with DGs, LDC will even extend the DG integration limit. The DG integration limit in a MV feeder can also be extended by allowing DG to absorb reactive power as in an LV feeder, or by installing a voltage regulator (VR). However, if DG absorbs reactive power, it means that the reactive power should be generated somewhere else in the system, and VR installation means investment cost. The DG integration limit can also be extended by operating the MV feeders in a meshed system (closed-loop). The expense of this meshed operation is that the protection of the feeder is more complicated. The presence of DG will obviously increase residual voltage (dip magnitude) during a short circuit. However, depending on the location of the DG relative to the protection device (PD) and fault, DG may shorten or lengthen the duration of the short circuit, which directly correlates to dip duration. This is because, the location of the DG relative to the PD and fault defines whether DG will increase or decrease the short circuit current sensed by PD. However, PDs in distribution systems are normally overcurrent (OC) based PDs, which clear the fault in a certain time delay depending on the short circuit current sensed by them. Thus, though DG increases dip magnitude, further investigation on coordination of voltage dip and OC protection is needed to investigate whether the DG will prevent sensitive equipment from tripping, due to voltage dip, or not. Protection coordination in distribution systems can be affected by the increasing or decreasing short circuit current sensed by PDs. Certain corrective actions are then needed. However, when the DG is not expected to be in islanding operation; DG still has to be disconnected from distribution systems every time a fault occurs, even if all corrective actions have been implemented. Disconnecting all DGs every time a temporary fault occurs would make the system very unreliable. This is especially because most of the faults in overhead distribution systems are temporary. Thus, when the DG is not expected to be in islanding operation, a protection scheme that can keep DG on line to supply the load during the fault is necessary. The scheme should ensure that the OC PDs in on the feeder can clear the fault without loosing their proper coordination...|$|E
