40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} an ultracompact on-chip photothermal <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> {{based on a}} silicon hybrid plasmonic waveguide (HPWG), which consists of a metal strip, a silicon core, and a silicon oxide (SiO 2) insulator layer between them. When light injected to an HPWG is absorbed by the metal strip, the temperature increases and {{the resistance of the}} metal strip changes accordingly due to the photothermal and thermal resistance effects of the metal. Therefore, the optical power variation can be monitored by measuring the resistance of the metal strip on the HPWG. To obtain the electrical signal for the resistance measurement conveniently, a Wheatstone bridge circuit is monolithically integrated with the HPWG on the same chip. As the HPWG has nanoscale light confinement, the present <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> is as short as ~ 3 μm, which is the smallest photothermal <b>power</b> <b>monitor</b> reported until now.

50|$|A voltage drop, current rise {{is another}} issue caused by power induced by HVAC systems and other heavy loads. AC surge {{suppression}} will not stop this problem so a <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> device will work. Example, {{in a nursing home}} a fire alarm system keeps having problems with their power supply and at times deprogramming the panel every time the backup generator came on. In facilities like these, they are required to test generators every month. When the power goes out, that is one thing, but when the power comes on all the HVAC systems are on the same time delay and when they come on, the heavy load is what causes the voltage drop and current rise and the system will go into false alarm. There is technology like the 120HWCP20CBPLC that will monitor the power and when the voltage drops, the unit shuts off the power. The batteries inside the fire alarm will sustain the system until the power is back to normal.|$|E

40|$|Fine-grained <b>power</b> <b>monitoring,</b> {{which refers}} to <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> at the server level, is {{critical}} to the efficient operation and energy saving of datacenters. Fined-grained <b>power</b> <b>monitoring,</b> however, is extremely challenging in legacy datacenters that host server sys-tems not equipped with <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> sensors. Installing <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> hardware at the server level not only incurs high costs but also complicates the maintenance of high-density server clus-ters and enclosures.

We implement and evaluate NIPD over a real-world dat-acenter with 326 nodes.

40|$|The {{methodology}} and reasoning behind <b>power</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> by electricity utilities has undergone large scale {{changes in the}} past several years. In the past, <b>power</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> has been carried out in a reactive manner; that is, {{as a result of a}} specific problem and was usually only conducted in a localised area. <b>Power</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> instrumentation developed to suit fault finding applications and in many cases design was based upon customer requirements rather than a standard specification. While fault finding is still an essential facet of <b>power</b> quality <b>monitoring,</b> the fact that regulatory authorities are now taking an interest in power quality has meant many electricity utilities are now taking, or indeed are forced to take a more proactive approach to <b>power</b> quality <b>monitoring.</b> This type of monitoring requires different characteristics 2 ̆ 7 in a power quality instrument. It is necessary to have standardised instrumentation which can be left in the field over long periods of time. For many years there has been no specific international or Australian standard which outlines the way in which power quality disturbances should be <b>monitored</b> or how <b>power</b> quality surveys should be conducted. IEC standard 61000 - 4 - 30 goes some way towards solving this problem detailing how various power quality parameters should be measured and recommending minimum survey periods.
