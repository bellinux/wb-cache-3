500|$|In 1999, when Taylor became {{eligible}} for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, there were some concerns that his hard-partying lifestyle and drug abuse would hurt his candidacy.

500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] {{received}} {{generally a}} positive response from music critics. Newsday Glenn Gamboa {{described it as a}} [...] "gorgeous girl-group-influenced" [...] song and commended Timbaland's [...] "remarkably non-bleepy-bloopy production". Mariel Concepcion of Billboard observed that the song is a release for women who are [...] "being mistreated and unappreciated" [...] by their men, but are unable to [...] "speak up for themselves". She viewed the single as an [...] "empowering wake-up call [...] encourag women to stop <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the abuse". Concepcion likened the lyrics to Melanie Fiona's [...] "Give It to Me Right" [...] (2009) and Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] (2010). In his review of No Boys Allowed, Matthew Horton of BBC Music remarked that the slower songs [...] "house some of the nicer touches". Horton praised Timbaland's production throughout the album, particularly on [...] "Breaking Point" [...] due to its [...] "En Vogue-y harmonies [...] oriental music box refrain".

[...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E
500|$|... "Falling Over Me" [...] was co-written by Lovato and Jon McLaughlin and {{produced}} by Fields.

According to Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times, Lovato's vocals in the song balance [...] "delicacy and force". On the fifth track, [...] "Quiet", Lovato longs for a [...] "communication breakthrough" [...] in an awkward relationship, complaining that [...] "It's too quiet in here". [...] "Catch Me" [...] is an acoustic ballad with a stripped-down production, written by Lovato herself. The song speaks of an unhealthy love connection, with Lovato going on even though she knows [...] "how badly this will hurt me". The seventh track, [...] "Every Time You Lie", is a song with jazz influences and a [...] "jaunty '70s vibe". Kerri Mason of Billboard commented that the song [...] "swings like Maroon 5's brand of radio soul". The song tells about self-respect and not <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> lies in a relationship. [...] "Got Dynamite" [...] was written by Gary Clark, E. Kidd Bogart and Victoria Horn {{and produced}} by Clark. The song features [...] "ricocheting" [...] synthesizers and a scattering pop punk riff. The lyrics use [...] "violent metaphors" [...] as invitations for a boy to [...] "blow up" [...] Lovato's defenses, with lines such as [...] "Log {{in and try to}} hack me" [...] and [...] "Kick senseless, my defenses".|$|E

In April 2010, Sky included Susan in their feature on the twenty-five most memorable Neighbours characters. They stated, [...] "Kindly but strong matriarch Susan {{may not be the}} most medically robust woman (amnesia, multiple sclerosis, frequent questionable haircuts), but she gets by thanks to her family. She's so devoted, in fact, that after Malcolm, Billy and Libby (sort of) flew the nest, she went and inherited Zeke and Rachel from second husband Alex. Despite her big heart, she can be counted on to get fierce with anyone who tries to upset the Ramsay Street balance – her frequent fights with Izzy in the middle of the street over Karl cemented her reputation as everyone's favourite soap mum." ...|$|E
