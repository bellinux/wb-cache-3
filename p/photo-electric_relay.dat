40|$|The {{development}} of my current work {{stemmed from a}} discontent with traditional object-oriented sculpture. Objects appeared too static I wished for an active environment that the participant could control. I wanted {{the interaction between the}} participant and the environment to result in a unique and satisfying experience. While living at Marina del Rey, California, I constantly heard the boat riggings jingling and jangling together. To me, these sounds were beautiful. Gradually, I decided to incorporate sound into an environment. While investigating all kinds of sound-producing instruments, the diapason, or tuning fork, seemed to fit my requirements perfectly. I discovered that lengths of tubing when struck acted as resonators of sound; but more important, when the tubing was cut into slices with a slit end and then struck, the ring responded as a tuning fork. Through trial and error and working with various metals and their alloys, aluminum (6061 -T 6, 2024 -T 4) emerged as the material with the best sound producing properties. I found I could control the tone of the ring by varying its mass. Basically, I followed this rule: the larger the mass, the deeper the tone. It soon became evident that I was dealing with something more than just metals that sounded nice. I was exploring and revealing the essence of matter??? its state of perpetual motion and flux. Sound, being those vibrations which were audible, became the medium through which I became aware of the vitality of all matter whether inert or active. As a person wandered through my environment interrupting the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>relay</b> systems, motors were triggered which started the rings spinning and colliding. The participant could activate the room and then step back to watch and listen to the diapasons, creating an installation, my objective was through an audio-kinetic experience to make one aware {{of the relationship between the}} physical and nonphysical. Ultimately, the participant had a metaphysical response to the work...|$|E
