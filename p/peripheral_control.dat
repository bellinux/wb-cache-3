40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{independent}} and combined effects of thermal biofeedback and thermal suggestions on <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control.</b> Four treatment groups were compared: biofeedback, suggestion, combined biofeedback-suggestion, and a control group receiving only instructions requesting that the subjects attempt to raise their peripheral temperature. All groups received these same response-specific instructions. It was hypothesized that the group receiving the combined treatment would demonstrate the greatest amount of <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control</b> and that the control group would demonstrate the least. 40 subjects participated in the study (10 per group). Before attending three treatment sessions, each subject attended two baseline sessions. Temperature change was computed from the end of a stabilization period to the end of a 15 minute training period. This temperature change on baseline days represented the subject's natural drift in peripheral temperature. Baseline day changes were subtracted from training day changes in order to control for each individual's natural drift. The resulting change scores were used as the dependent variable. A 4 X 3 ANOVA with repeated measures on the last factor was the statistical design used to analyze the data. There were no significant effects found at the. 05 level. The results of this study are therefore indicative of the following conclusions: 1. Biofeedback, suggestion, or a combined biofeedback, suggestion method, when used in conjunction with response-specific instructions for raising peripheral temperature, are not significantly different from each other in their effects upon <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control.</b> Also, the effects of these treatments on <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control</b> are not significantly different from the effects of a treatment consisting only of response-specific instructions. 2. Regardless of treatment received, <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control</b> is not effected by the amount of training received over three training sessions. 3. The effects of the different treatments upon <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control</b> is not dependent upon the amount of training received over a three session period of time. Although not significantly lower, the mean of the control group consistently demonstrated the poorest level of <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control.</b> All four treatment groups were able to demonstrate <b>peripheral</b> temperature <b>control.</b> Thesis (D.

METHODS: A total of ninty-nine cases of 12 ～ 18 year-old myopic patients were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was <b>peripheral</b> vision <b>control</b> technology group whose members wore the special lenses which can help correct the hypermetropic defocus of peripheral retina. The other was control group whose members wore ordinary monofocal lenses. All the subjects needed to accept re-examination every 3 mo and be recorded the data of dioptre, corneal curvature and axial length. RESULTS: After 18 mo, the dioptre and axial length of two groups had increased in varying degree. But the data's different quantity of the corneal curvature in each group had no statistical significance(P > 0. 05). Themyopia deepen quantity in experimental group was - 0. 65 ± 0. 65 D and its axial growth was 0. 23 ± 0. 22 mm, and the myopia deepen quantity in control group was - 1. 17 ± 0. 50 D and its axial growth was 0. 41 ± 0. 17 mm.
