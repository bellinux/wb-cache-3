5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar.

5|$|Crystal Dynamics is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} that {{was founded in}} 1992 by Judy Lang, Madaline Canepa and Dave Morris.

The 3DO's launch during the 1993 Christmas season was a commercial failure, severely damaging Crystal Dynamics' software strategy. In 1994, the company became a publisher for two new gaming platforms, the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The studio was acquired by Eidos Interactive, a British video game <b>publisher,</b> <b>in</b> 1998. After Square Enix acquired Eidos in 2009, Crystal Dynamics became a subsidiary of Square Enix.|$|E
