5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of diaphragm valves: one type seals over a [...] "weir" [...] (saddle) and the other (sometimes called a [...] "full bore or straight-way" [...] valve) seals over a seat. The weir or saddle type {{is the most common}} in process applications and the seat-type is more commonly used in slurry applications to reduce blocking issues but exists also as a <b>process</b> <b>valve.</b> While diaphragm valves usually come in two-port forms (2/2-way diaphragm valve), they can also come with three ports (3/2-way diaphragm valves also called T-valves) and more (so called block-valves). When more than three ports are included, they generally require more than one diaphragm seat; however, special dual actuators can handle more ports with one membrane.|$|E
40|$|A wear {{resistant}} part for a <b>process</b> <b>valve</b> has, on its wear surfaces (especially the seating and sealing faces), a 50 - 500 (preferably 100 - 300) microns thick thermally sprayed layer comprising {{one or more}} cubic hard material phases, which contain titanium and optionally another metal, and a metallic binder phase. Preferably, the layer is formed by thermal spraying of a coating powder having a cemented carbide-like microstructure and consisting of two cubic hard material phases, forming a clad core particle structure with the hard material phase consisting mainly of Ti and C in the core and of Ti, a second metal and C in the cladding, embedded in a binder phase of Ni, Co and/or Fe, this clad core structure of the cubic hard material phases being detectable in the layer. USE - For process valves used in the chemical and petrochemical industries, in mining and in other processing industries.

40|$|The gas {{generation}} experiments (GGE) are being conducted at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL 0 W) with contact handled transuranic (CH-TRU) waste {{in support of}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico. The purpose of the GGE is to determine the different quantities and types of gases that would be produced and the gas-generation rates that would develop if brine were introduced to CH-TRU waste under post-closure WIPP disposal room conditions. The experiment requires that a prescribed matrix of CH-TRU waste be placed in a 7. 5 liter test container. After loaded with the CH-TRU waste, brine and inoculum mixtures (consisting of salt and microbes indigenous to the Carlsbad, New Mexico region) are added to the waste. The test will run for an anticipated time period of three to five years. The test container itself is an ASME rated pressure vessel constructed from Hastelloy C 276 to eliminate corrosion that might contaminate the experimental results. The test container is required to maintain a maximum 10 % head space with a maximum working pressure of 17. 25 MPa (2, 500 psia). The test container is designed to provide a gas sample of the head space without the removal of brine.

50|$|The MicVac {{method is}} a {{pasteurization}} method {{for the food}} processing industry producing ready meals. Food ingredients are inserted into a package, which is sealed. The food is then cooked and pasteurized in the sealed package. During the heating <b>process</b> a <b>valve</b> on the package opens and releases steam and oxygen. The process time is short since the food is pasteurized with microwaves. When the microwave heating <b>process</b> stops the <b>valve</b> closes. Remaining steam condenses and causes an underpressure in the package. The final result is a cooked, pasteurized and vacuum-packed product. The short cooking time {{in combination with the}} absence of oxygen in the pack is unique for the method and has many advantages. The method has been used in the food industry since 2005.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Understanding heart {{development}} on {{a molecular level}} {{is a prerequisite for}} uncovering the causes of congenital heart diseases. Therapeutic approaches that try to enhance cardiac regeneration or that involve the differentiation of resident cardiac progenitor cells or patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells will also benefit tremendously from this knowledge. Wnt proteins have been shown to play multiple roles during cardiac differentiation and development. They are extracellular growth factors that activate different intracellular signaling branches. Here, we summarize our current understanding of how these factors affect different aspects of cardiogenesis, starting from early specification of cardiac progenitors and continuing on to later developmen-tal steps, such as morphogenetic <b>processes,</b> <b>valve</b> formation, and establishment of the conduction system. (Circ Res. 2010; 107 : 186 - 199.) Key Words: Wnt cardiac differentiation cardiac development Wnt proteins are growth factors that function duringembryonic development and in the adult organism by regulating diverse cellular processes such as gene transcrip-tion and cell proliferation, migration, polarity, or division. 1 Not surprisingly, Wnt proteins are also involved in cardiac development and differentiation.

5000|$|While Stellite {{remains the}} {{material}} of choice for certain internal parts in industrial <b>process</b> <b>valves</b> (valve seat hardfacing), its use has been discouraged in nuclear power plants. In piping that can communicate with the reactor, tiny amounts of Stellite would be released into the process fluid and eventually enter the reactor. There the cobalt would be activated by the neutron flux in the reactor and become cobalt-60, a radioisotope with a five year half life that releases very energetic gamma rays. While not a hazard to the general public, about a third to a half of nuclear worker exposures could {{be traced to the}} use of Stellite and to trace amounts of cobalt in stainless steels. Replacements for Stellite have been developed by the industry, such as the Electric Power Research Institute's [...] "NOREM", that provide acceptable performance without cobalt. Since the United States nuclear power industry has begun to replace the Stellite valve seat hardfacing in the late 1970s and to tighten specifications of cobalt in stainless steels, worker exposures due to cobalt-60 have dropped significantly.|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{compared}} {{clinical outcomes}} of patients receiving CryoValve SG decellularized pulmonary valves {{with those of}} patients receiving conventionally <b>processed</b> CryoValve pulmonary <b>valves.</b> MethodsAll consecutive patients undergoing Ross procedures and right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions with SG valves at 7 institutions (February 2000 –November 2005) were assessed retrospectively (193 Ross procedures, 149 right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions). Patient, procedural, and outcome data were compared with those from 1246 conventional implants (665 Ross procedures, 581 right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions). Hemodynamic function was assessed at latest follow-up. ResultsFollow-up was complete for 99 % in SG group and 94 % in conventional group, with mean follow-ups of 4. 0 years (range, 0 – 6. 7 years) for SG and 3. 7 years (range, 0 – 6. 7 years) for conventional. Five-year cumulative survivals and freedoms from adverse events were comparable between SG and conventional valves. Among patients undergoing Ross procedures, peak gradient at last follow-up was lower with SG valves (P <. 01); no difference was observed in the right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction population. Pulmonary insufficiency was significantly reduced with SG valves in patients undergoing both Ross procedures (P <. 01) and right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions (P <. 01). Valve type {{was not a significant}} predictor of valve-related failure in propensity-adjusted analysis of either procedure. ConclusionsCryoValve SG decellularized pulmonary valves have acceptable clinical outcomes and favorably compare with conventionally <b>processed</b> <b>valves.</b> Improved hemodynamic function observed with SG valves could signify improved long-term outcomes and {{may be due to the}} decreased antigenicity of these valves...|$|R
