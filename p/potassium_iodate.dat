2500|$|The uses of KI include as a {{nutritional}} supplement in animal feeds {{and also the}} human diet. For the latter, {{it is the most}} common additive used to [...] "iodize" [...] table salt (a public health measure to prevent iodine deficiency in populations that get little seafood). The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from iodised salts that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates. <b>Potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> is used to add iodine to some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation. Dextrose or sodium thiosulfate are often added to iodized table salt to stabilize potassium iodide thus reducing loss of the volatile chemical.|$|E
50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> {{may be used}} {{to protect}} against {{accumulation}} of radioactive iodine in the thyroid by saturating the body with a stable source of iodine prior to exposure. Approved by the World Health Organization for radiation protection, <b>potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> (KIO3) is an alternative to potassium iodide (KI), which has poor shelf life in hot and humid climates. The UK, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, and the U.S. states Idaho and Utah are known to stock <b>potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> in tablet form. The government of Ireland also, following the September 11 attacks, issued <b>potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> tablets to all households.

5000|$|For sake of example, {{it shall}} be assumed that 22.45±0.03 cm3 of the sodium {{hydroxide}} solution reacts with 781.4±0.1 mg of <b>potassium</b> hydrogen <b>iodate.</b> As the equivalent weight of <b>potassium</b> hydrogen <b>iodate</b> is 389.92 g, the measured mass is 2.004 milliequivalents. The concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution is therefore 2.004 meq/0.02245 l = 89.3 meq/l. In analytical chemistry, a solution of any substance which contains one equivalent per litre {{is known as a}} normal solution (abbreviated N), so the example sodium hydroxide solution would be 0.0893 N. The relative uncertainty (ur) in the measured concentration can be estimated by assuming a Gaussian distribution of the measurement uncertainties: ...|$|R

Food Chemistry, 113, 600 - 601. This paper was {{to improve the}} production of calcium-induced alginate gels manufactured by a company in Auckland. Problems encountered included yield and syneresis of the beads post-gelation. Essentially the alginate, sugars and other ingredients were dissolved in water at 80 ºC. The pH of the solution was adjusted and the alginate beads were extruded into a 5 % CaCl 2 bath before being drained and dried. The chemical reaction between sodium alginate and calcium ions is dependent upon the solubility and availability of calcium ions. Some calcium salts (e. g., CaCl 2, calcium lactate) were readily soluble and fully dissociated in water and resulted in an immediate gelation of the alginate. Dicalcium phosphate (DCP) was sparingly soluble at pH 7 and calcium ions were not released significantly until the pH reached about pH 4. 2. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) is a chelating agent and this was used to soak up small quantities of Ca+ 2 to ensure no gelation occured while the alginate was being mixed. The optimum quantities of alginate, DCP and SHMP were defined in the laboratory trials. The use of SHMP, maltodextrin, and gums significantly affected the hardness and stickiness of gel beads. It {{was found that the}} combination of xanthan and alginate Protanal LF 120 gave the best results in terms of minimal stickiness and maximum yield after drying.

50|$|Edible salt can be iodised by {{spraying}} {{it with a}} <b>potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> or {{potassium iodide}} solution. 57 grams of <b>potassium</b> <b>iodate,</b> costing about US$1.15 (in 2006), is required to iodise a ton of salt. Dextrose is added as a stabilizer to prevent potassium iodide from oxidizing and evaporating. Anti-caking agents such as calcium silicate are commonly added to table salt to prevent clumping.|$|E
50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> is {{sometimes}} used for iodination of table salt to prevent iodine deficiency. Because iodide can be oxidized to iodine by molecular oxygen under wet conditions, US companies add thiosulfates or other antioxidants to the potassium iodide. In other countries, <b>potassium</b> <b>iodate</b> {{is used as}} a source for dietary iodine. It is also an ingredient in some baby formula milk.|$|E
50|$|When {{choosing}} primary {{standards in}} analytical chemistry, compounds with higher equivalent weights {{are generally more}} desirable because weighing errors are reduced. An example is the volumetric standardisation of a solution of sodium hydroxide which has been prepared to approximately 0.1 mol&thinsp;dm&minus;3. It is necessary to calculate the mass of a solid acid which will react with about 20 cm3 of this solution (for a titration using a 25 cm3 burette): suitable solid acids include oxalic acid dihydrate, potassium hydrogen phthalate and <b>potassium</b> hydrogen <b>iodate.</b> The equivalent weights of the three acids 63.04 g, 204.23 g and 389.92 g respectively, and the masses required for the standardisation are 126.1 mg, 408.5 mg and 779.8 mg respectively. Given that the measurement uncertainty in the mass measured on a standard analytical balance is ±0.1 mg, the relative uncertainty in the mass of oxalic acid dihydrate would be about one part in a thousand, similar to the measurement uncertainty in the volume measurement in the titration. However the measurement uncertainty in the mass of <b>potassium</b> hydrogen <b>iodate</b> would be five times lower, because its equivalent weight is five times higher: such an uncertainty in the measured mass is negligible {{in comparison to the}} uncertainty in the volume measured during the titration (see example below).|$|R
25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{radioiodine}} release, the ingestion of prophylaxis <b>potassium</b> iodide or <b>iodate,</b> if available, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be {{the first line of defense}} in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in {{the event of}} a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide & iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets, would serve as a cheap and efficacious second line of defense against carcinogenic radioiodine bioaccumulation.|$|R
40|$|During breadmaking, a {{continuous}} protein network is formed which confers visco-elasticity to dough. The properties of this protein network are {{highly dependent on}} the characteristics of the gluten proteins of the wheat flour. A good quality (highly elastic) gluten network retains the carbon dioxide that is produced by the yeast, giving dough and bread with optimal properties. However, the properties of the gluten proteins can differ substantially between wheat flours and are highly dependent on genetic, environmental and post-harvest conditions. Deficiencies in wheat quality for breadmaking can be overcome by incorporating exogenous components which alter the functionality of the gluten proteins during breadmaking. These include additives (e. g. <b>potassium</b> bromate, <b>iodate,</b> chlorine dioxide and chlorine, azodicarbonamide, ascorbic acid and peroxides) and enzymes affecting protein crosslinking. Transglutaminase, glucose oxidase, hexose oxidase and laccase all promote the formation of covalent bonds between gluten proteins and, hence, can serve as alternatives to chemical bread improvers.
