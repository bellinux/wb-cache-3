5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> {{dynamics and}} defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

25|$|Except for the {{subspecies}} bianchii {{which is}} largely all-year resident, and subspecies excubitor in the temperate European parts of its range with their mild maritime climate, {{the species is}} a short-distance migrant. The migrations are triggered by scarcity of food and therefore, according to <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> levels, the winter range might little extend south beyond the breeding range, or be entirely parapatric to it. The populations of the Central Asian mountains mostly migrate downslope rather than southwards. Females {{are more prone to}} migration than males; they do not appear to migrate, on average, longer or shorter distances than males, and consequently are the dominant sex {{in many parts of the}} winter range. Birds leave for winter quarters a more or less short time after breeding – July to October, with most birds staying to September – and return to nest mainly in March/April, but some only arrive in May. In recent decades, the number of birds remaining on the breeding grounds all year has been noted to increase e.g. in Fennoscandia, whereas for example borealis seems to be as rare a winter visitor in northern Ohio as it was a century ago.|$|E

40|$|The role {{predation}} {{plays in}} the dynamics of <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> is controversial. Our understandings of predator-prey relationships is complicated by a multitude of factors in the environment and {{a general lack of}} knowledge of most ecological systems. Various other factors, besides predation, may regulate or limit <b>prey</b> <b>populations,</b> and various factors influence the degree to which predation affects <b>prey</b> <b>populations.</b> Furthermore, some factors may create time lags, or even cause generational effects, that go unnoticed. Herein, we review the role of predation in wildlife population dynamics, some of the factors influencing predator-prey interactions, and attempt to indicate where the professional debate currently is focused and where it may need to go to enhance our understanding of predator-prey interactions...|$|R
25|$|This theory postulates that {{multicellularity}} arose as a {{means for}} prey to escape predation. Larger prey {{are less likely to be}} preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that multicellularity arose when the first predators evolved. By assembling as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore multicellularity was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory protist, Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> of Chlorella vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting because before the predator was introduced, the population of Chlorella vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal species retained a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular.|$|E
25|$|Pursuit {{predation}} {{revolves around}} a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move {{to find new}} foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships {{can be used as}} support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also metapopulation persistence.|$|E
500|$|The cheetah is a {{carnivore}} that prefers medium-sized prey with a {{body mass}} ranging from [...] Blesbok, duiker, Grant's gazelle, impala, reedbuck, springbok, and Thomson's gazelle {{are some of the}} common targets of the cheetah. Other prey animals include the bat-eared fox, bushbuck, kudu, hartebeest, nyala, oribi, roan antelope, steenbok, sable antelope, and waterbuck; they prey less frequently on African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, ostrich, warthog, wildebeest, and zebra. A study showed that a major proportion of the diet of Asiatic cheetahs consists of livestock; local species such as chinkara, desert hare, goitered gazelle, ibex, rodents, and wild sheep are also hunted. Generally, only groups of cheetahs will attempt to kill large animals such as hartebeest, although mothers with young cubs will attempt to secure a large prey all by themselves. There are no records of cheetah killing human beings. The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle, somewhat smaller than the cheetah. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal the preferred prey is the significantly larger nyala, males of which can weigh up to [...] They do, however, opt for young and adolescent targets, which make up about 50% of the cheetah diet despite constituting {{only a small portion of}} the <b>prey</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
40|$|A species {{reproductive}} mode, {{along with}} its associated costs and benefits, can {{play a significant role}} in its evolution and survival. Facultative sexuality, being able to reproduce both sexually and asexually, has been deemed evolutionary favourable as the benefits of either mode may be fully realized. In fact, many studies have focused on identifying the benefits of sex and/or the forces selecting for increased rates of sex using facultative sexual species. The costs of either mode, however, can also have a profound impact on a population's evolutionary trajectory. Here, we used experimental evolution and fitness assays to investigate the consequences of facultative sexuality in prey adapting to predation. Specifically, we compared the adaptive response of algal <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> exposed to constant rotifer predation and which had alternating cycles of asexual and sexual reproduction where sexual episodes were either facultative (sexual and asexual progeny simultaneously propagated) or obligate (only sexual progeny propagated). We found that <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> with facultative sexual episodes reached a lower final relative fitness and suffered a greater trade-off in traits under selection, that is defence and competitive ability, as compared to <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> with obligate sexual episodes. Our results suggest that costs associated with sexual reproduction (germination time) and asexual reproduction (selection interference) were amplified in the facultative sexual <b>prey</b> <b>populations,</b> leading to a reduction in the net advantage of sexuality. Additionally, we found evidence that the cost of sex was reduced in the obligate sexual <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> because increased selection for sex was observed via the spontaneous production of sexual cells. These results show that certain costs associated with facultative sexuality can affect an organism's evolutionary trajectory...|$|R

40|$|Haloes of bare {{space around}} crevices used as refuges by predators are {{a feature of}} many rocky shores. The {{presence}} of small scale spatial gradients in the demographic structure of <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> is hypothesized for the region adjoining predation haloes. It is also suggested that halo effects in <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> will change in response to environmental constraints on predator foraging behaviour. These hypotheses were tested by examining gradients in barnacle population structure around crevices high and low on the shore. The probability of encountering a barnacle above the local median size always increased with distance from a crevice. Foraging at sites high on a shore {{is assumed to be}} more risky to individual whelks. Initial probabilities of recording a large barnacle near a crevice increased more rapidly over small spatial scales at sites high on the shore than at sites low on the shore. The implications of small scale gradients in <b>prey</b> <b>populations</b> are discussed with reference to the role of topographic complexity in mediating predator–prey dynamics...|$|R
2500|$|Lionfish have {{successfully}} pioneered the coastal {{waters of the}} Atlantic {{in less than a}} decade and pose a major threat to reef ecological systems in these areas. A study comparing their abundance from Florida to North Carolina with several species of groupers found [...] they were second only to the native scamp grouper and equally abundant to the graysby, gag, and rock hind. This could be due to a surplus of resource availability resulting from the overfishing of lionfish predators like grouper. Although the lionfish has not expanded to a population size [...] currently causing major ecological problems, their invasion in the United States coastal waters could lead to serious problems in the future. One likely ecological impact caused by Pterois could be their impact on <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> numbers by directly affecting food web relationships.

Lionfish have already been shown to overpopulate reef areas and display aggressive tendencies, forcing native species to move to waters where conditions might be less than desirable.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "mesopredator release" [...] {{was first}} used by Soulé and colleagues in 1988 to {{describe}} a process whereby mid-sized carnivorous mammals became far more abundant after being [...] "released" [...] from the control of a larger carnivore. This, in turn, resulted in decreased populations of still smaller prey species, such as birds. This may lead to dramatic <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> decline, or even extinction, especially on islands. This process arises when mammalian top predators {{are considered to be}} the most influential factor on trophic structure and biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. [...] Top predators may feed on herbivores and kill predators in lower trophic levels as well. [...] Thus, reduction in the abundance of top predators may cause the medium-sized predator population to increase, therefore having a negative effect on the underlying prey community. [...] The mesopredator release hypothesis offers an explanation for the abnormally high numbers of mesopredators and the decline in prey abundance and diversity. [...] The hypothesis supports the argument for conservation of top predators because they protect smaller prey species that are in danger of extinction. [...] This argument has been a subject of interest within conservation biology for years, but few studies have adequately documented the phenomenon.|$|E

The per capita effect of predators on the <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> (the harvest rate) is modeled by a function g which {{is a function of the}} ratio N/P of prey to predators. Predators receive a reproductive payoff, e, for consuming prey, and die at rate u. Making predation pressure a function of the ratio of prey to predators contrasts with the prey dependent Lotka-Volterra equations, where the effect of predators on the <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> is simply a function of the magnitude of the <b>prey</b> <b>population</b> g(N). Because the number of prey harvested by each predator decreases as predators become more dense, ratio dependent predation represents an example of a trophic function. Ratio dependent predation may account for heterogeneity in large-scale natural systems in which predator efficiency decreases when prey is scarce. The merit of ratio dependent versus prey dependent models of predation has been the subject of much controversy, especially between the biologists Lev R. Ginzburg and Peter A. Abrams. Ginzburg purports that ratio dependent models more accurately depict predator-prey interactions while Abrams maintains that these models make unwarranted complicating assumptions.|$|E
