40|$|This article {{examines}} post- 1974 progressions in congressional and judicial thinking about asset protection {{as it relates}} specifically to the attainment of federal retirement policy goals. The article first considers the link between historical trust protections and modern federal retirement policy. That analysis reveals a more recent trend towards defining the scope of retirement <b>plan</b> <b>asset</b> protection by reference to statutory rules that grant favorable treatment to certain retirement savings devices. Those rules provide an incentive for funding future retirement through current savings. This article explains how, and why, asset protection could be similarly tailored to foster retirement income security goals. Inconsistencies in the protections currently afforded, however, {{call into question the}} logic of the existing retirement <b>plan</b> <b>asset</b> protection framework. This article ultimately argues that Congress should incorporate a more comprehensive view of asset protection into federal retirement policy. After explaining the objectives of federal retirement policy and the modern evolution of retirement <b>plan</b> <b>asset</b> protection, the author develops this argument by evaluating the usefulness of retirement policy objectives as a benchmark for establishing asset protection boundaries - both within the retirement plan setting and in the context of more traditional trust devices...|$|R

5000|$|Shareholder {{activism}} efforts {{attempt to}} positively influence corporate behavior. These efforts include initiating conversations with corporate management {{on issues of}} concern, and submitting and voting proxy resolutions. These activities are undertaken {{with the belief that}} social investors, working cooperatively, can steer management on a course that will improve financial performance over time and enhance the well being of the stockholders, customers, employees, vendors, and communities. Recent movements have also been reported of [...] "investor relations activism", in which investor relations firms assist groups of shareholder activists in an organized push for change within a corporation; this is done typically by leveraging their enhanced knowledge of the corporation, its management (often via direct relationships), and the securities laws as a whole. Hedge funds are also major activist investors; while some pursue socially responsible investing goals, many simply are seeking to maximize fund returns. Pension plans subject to ERISA are somewhat more constrained in their ability to engage in shareholder activism or the use of <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> to promote public policy positions; any expenditure of <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> must be aimed at enhancing participants' retirement income.|$|E
50|$|An {{investment}} policy is required under virtually all investor circumstances, {{with the exception}} of individual investors. According to the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), for every qualified company retirement plan (e.g., 401k, profit sharing, pension, 403b) there are certain fiduciary responsibilities for managing the <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> with the care, skill, prudence and diligence of a prudent expert and by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses.

5000|$|Cash balance {{plans are}} defined-benefit plans {{that look like}} defined-contribution plans. A worker’s right to a pension in a defined-benefit plan {{represents}} a contingent and hence uncertain financial obligation to the employer sponsoring the plan. Section 412 of the Code requires the employer to make annual contributions to the plan {{to ensure that the}} <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> will be sufficient to pay the promised benefits later at retirement. As part of this process the plan is required to have an actuary perform annual [...] "actuarial valuations" [...] in which the present value of each worker’s [...] "accrued benefit" [...] is estimated and then each present value for each worker covered by the plan is added up so that the minimum annual contribution can be determined.|$|E
5000|$|Defined {{contribution}} plans, {{by contrast}} and by definition, are always [...] "fully funded" [...] so Congress saw {{no need to}} provide insurance protection for participants in defined contribution plans. The Enron scandal in 2001 demonstrated one potential problem with defined contribution plans: the company had strongly encouraged its workers to invest their 401(k) plans in their employer itself, violating primary investment guidelines about diversification. When Enron went bankrupt, many workers lost not only their jobs but also most {{of the value of}} their retirement savings. Congress inserted trust law fiduciary liability upon employers that did not prudently diversify <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> to avoid the chance of large losses inside Section 404 of ERISA, but it is unclear whether such fiduciary liability applies to trustees of plans in which participants direct the investment of their own accounts.|$|E
50|$|Belt {{became the}} {{executive}} direction of PBGC in April 2004. The PBGC {{was set up}} by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, to guarantee defined benefit pension plan benefits for plan sponsors that become insolvent when there are too few pension <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> to fully pay all insured pension benefits. As {{the chief executive officer of}} PBGC, Belt oversaw the U.S. government corporation that insures the pension benefits of private sector workers and retirees. He also played a leading role in the historic overhaul of U.S. pension rules, giving millions of Americans a better chance of getting the retirement benefits they earned. The bill also created added incentives for greater worker participation in 401(K)s. During Belt's tenure as director, the PBGC took on extensive liabilities from terminated pension plans, including United Air Lines, and became massively underfunded. On March 23, 2006 he announced his intention to resign effective May 2006.|$|E

50|$|Self-funding {{involves}} {{a transfer of}} risk from the employee and his/her dependents to the employer directly. Self-funded health plans pay health claims out of plan assets; there is no element of traditional insurance on these programs, and the employer assumes all additional liability for claims {{that have not been}} paid by <b>plan</b> (trust) <b>assets.</b> Some health <b>plans</b> have no plan assets; known as an unfunded plan, a <b>plan</b> with no <b>assets</b> is funded solely from the general corporate <b>assets</b> of the <b>plan</b> sponsor.|$|R
50|$|The Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act would {{amend the}} Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, {{with respect to}} {{cooperative}} and small employer charity pension plans (CSEC plans), to: (1) define such plans as employee benefit pension plans that are defined benefit plans maintained as of June 25, 2010, by multiple employers, {{all of whom are}} tax-exempt charitable organizations; (2) exempt CSEC plans from existing funding standards and allow such plans to establish minimum funding standards and special rules with respect to the valuation of <b>plan</b> <b>assets,</b> required contributions, and liquidity requirements; (3) allow pension plan sponsors to elect out of treatment of their plans as a CSEC plan in plan years beginning after December 31, 2013; and (4) require notices to pension plan participants to include statements that different rules apply to CSEC plans than apply to single-employer plans, that contributions to a plan may have changed due to amendments made by this Act, and that a CSEC Plan is in funding restoration status for the plan year.|$|E
50|$|Employers that sponsor self-funded {{insurance}} plans often {{contract with a}} third-party administrator (TPA), which is an entity that provides ministerial services {{on behalf of the}} health plan and the plan sponsor. Traditionally, TPAs do not make discretionary claims determinations; if a determination requires interpretation of the governing plan document, most TPAs do not make it but instead require the plan administrator to provide its own determination. This is because a fiduciary duty is incurred by any entity that exercises discretion over <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> or in connection with making a binding determination under a health plan. According to ERISA, no matter which entity is identified as a fiduciary within the health plan, any entity will be considered a fiduciary if that entity acts as a fiduciary in a given case. Plan sponsors contract with their chosen TPA by means of an agreement known as an Administrative Services Agreement, which outlines the TPA’s duties, generally including administering payment for claims, issuing benefit determinations, and distributing documentation. This agreement generally contains provisions that provide for the TPA’s access to the employer’s claims funding bank account, and TPAs generally charge on a per-employee-per-month fee.|$|E
50|$|Third, a 529 {{plan can}} provide a very easy {{hands-off}} way to save for college. Once one decides which 529 plan to use, one completes a simple enrollment form and makes a contribution (or signs up for automatic deposits). The ongoing investment of the account is handled by the plan, not by the donor. <b>Plan</b> <b>assets</b> are professionally managed either by the state treasurer's office or by an outside investment company hired as the program manager. The donor will not receive a Form 1099 to report taxable or nontaxable earnings until {{the year of the}} withdrawals. If an investment switch is desired, donors may change to a different option in a 529 savings program every year (program permitting) or the account may be rolled over to a different state's program provided no such rollover for the beneficiary has occurred in the prior 12 months. 529 plans generally have very low minimum start-up and contribution requirements. The fees, compared with other investment vehicles, are low, although this depends on the state administering the plan. Finally, everyone is eligible {{to take advantage of a}} 529 plan, and the amounts that can be put in are substantial (over $300,000 per beneficiary in many state plans).

5000|$|Pension {{administration}} in the United States is the act of performing various types of yearly service on an organizational retirement plan, such as a 401(k), profit sharing plan, defined benefit plan, or cash balance plan. Increasingly these plan types are also being implemented in combination arrangements for greater contribution potential, such as the pairing of a cash balance plan with some variety of 401(k). The basic purpose of Pension Administration {{is to ensure that}} an organizational retirement plan does not discriminate against the lower level employees while also ensuring that the plan is not used as an abusive tax shelter. Stress tests include the average benefits test, Average Deferral Percentage, and minimum coverage. Yearly pension administration work involves filing a Form 5500 with the Internal Revenue Service. [...] There are several professional designations available to those who perform this work, such as those offered by the National Institute of Pension Administrators [...] and the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries. [...] Pension Administration firms more often than not rely on financial brokers (or financial advisors) for their business prospects, although they do have other referral sources. Some pension administration firms carry out the financial advisory work within an internal unit of their own company, as well as accepting referrals from an independent broker network. Examples of firms with which these brokers are associated are Raymond James, Edward Jones Investments and Morgan Stanley. The brokers may be employees of these firms or independent contractors. The <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> of the organizational retirement plans in question sometimes reside on a trading platform controlled by the administration firm. But more often than not the assets are held by large financial institutions who provide a variety of investment options for plan participants. Examples of large firms in this market space are Principal Financial Group, John Hancock Insurance, ING Group and Mass Mutual, although there are many others. Plans which contain over one-hundred participants must perform an independent audit each year, necessitating yearly coordination with representatives of a public accounting firm. [...] In cases where a defined benefit plan is being managed the pension administration firm must employ an actuary to certify the plan's present and future benefit liabilities and compliance with minimum funding standards set by the IRS. Pension administration firms with a large block of defined benefit plans often employ an actuary directly. But they may also retain the actuary as an independent contractor, and this is almost certain to be the arrangement in cases where the pension administration firm only works on a small collection of defined benefit plans. The actuary completes contribution calculations for the plan and provides a Schedule SB so that the yearly Form 5500 may be completed. [...] Without this Schedule the yearly filing for a defined benefit plan would be incomplete. In addition to the Internal Revenue Service, organizational retirement plan operation and maintenance falls under the regulation of the United States Department of Labor.|$|E

40|$|We use a {{cross-sectional}} valuation {{model that}} distinguishes between the operating and financial {{activities of the}} firm to examine the repercussions of three main alternative measures of pension expense. The GAAP Method recognizes a smoothed net pension expense, the NETCOST Method includes the excess of interest cost over the actual return on pension <b>plan</b> <b>assets,</b> {{if and only if}} this number is positive, and the FV Method substitutes the fair value in place of the smoothed pension expense. Three alternative fair value estimates of pension expense are examined: the first includes the expected return on <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> and fair value other costs; the second includes the actual return on <b>plan</b> <b>assets</b> and net fair value other costs; the third includes the expected and the unexpected return on <b>plan</b> <b>assets,</b> along with net fair value other costs.
