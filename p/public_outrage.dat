5|$|Much <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> {{resulted}} from the mystery shrouding Claudius' death and the death itself; {{there was a clear}} desire among the people of Rome that anyone suspected in Claudius' murder be executed and this included Halotus; he was not killed, and Nero allowed him to retain his position throughout his reign.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Claudius, much <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> ensued, {{and there was a}} clear desire in the general public that Halotus and several other {{suspects}} (such as Tigellinus, another servant who served Claudius), be executed. Nero, who acceded to the throne, allowed Halotus to continue as chief steward and taster; Halotus served Nero until the latter's death in 68, and Galba's assumption of the throne.|$|E
5|$|An {{assortment}} of unusual sculptures are {{scattered around the}} park, including: Still Water, a massive horse head lapping up water; Jelly Baby Family, a family of giant Jelly Babies standing {{on top of a}} large black cube; and Vroom Vroom, which resembles a giant human hand pushing a toy car along the ground. The sculptor Jacob Epstein constructed several works in Hyde Park. His memorial to the author William Henry Hudson, featuring his character Rima caused <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> when it was unveiled in 1925.|$|E

50|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Belgium on 4 August 1914, a million (out of seven million Belgians) fled their country into the Netherlands. The first wave consisted of Belgian Germans, German-speaking East Europeans and Jews who {{fell victim to}} the Belgian <b>public’s</b> <b>outrage</b> directly after the invasion. Their businesses and homes were often raided by angry mobs.|$|R
5|$|In October 1893, a {{congress}} of miners {{was held in}} Grotte in the Province of Agrigento which was attended by some 1,500 people, including workers and small producers. The miners demanded that the minimum age to be raised to 14 years for those {{who worked in the}} sulfur mines, the decrease of working hours and setting a minimum wage. Small producers demanded measures to avoid exploitation by large owners. The minimum-age measure was meant to improve the situation for the carusi, minors that worked in conditions of near-slavery that sparked <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> and inspired many complaints.|$|E
5|$|One of the wrecks was rediscovered in 1964. A private company, Platoro, Ltd., {{began to}} {{excavate}} the Espíritu Santo wreck in late 1967, which caused <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> and {{the passage of}} new laws to protect wrecks on the Texan coast. The remains of San Esteban were found in 1970 and excavated in 1972–73. Many artifacts have been recovered and are held in the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. They include the world's oldest mariner's astrolabe with a confirmed date.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{brought to}} the club his {{political}} awareness of Chinese matters. In 1928, following a <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> over a massacre at Jinan (known as the Jinan Incident) in Shandong {{in which more than}} 5,000Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese, the club set up the Shandong Relief Fund. Its purpose was to raise funds for China, to create awareness amongst the Chinese about the Japanese invasion of China, and to encourage the Chinese to boycott Japanese goods and services. The Chinese community contributed a total of S$1.34 million within a year of its inception.|$|E
50|$|In July 1964, Mao Zedong, in {{a meeting}} with a Japanese socialist delegation, stated that Tsarist Russia had {{stripped}} China of vast territories in Siberia and the Far East as far as Kamchatka, which had never been controlled or claimed by a Chinese polity. Mao stated that China still had not presented a bill for this list. These comments were leaked to the <b>public.</b> <b>Outraged,</b> Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev then refused to approve the border agreement.|$|R

50|$|On 16 March 2016, more protests {{broke out}} after Rousseff {{appointed}} Lula da Silva as her chief of staff, a move seen as shielding him from investigation, and leaked audio of a call {{between the two}} went <b>public.</b> The <b>public,</b> <b>outraged,</b> protested nationwide. In Brasilia, 5,000 people demonstrated outside the presidential palace and were dispersed with pepper spray and stun grenades when they approached the National Congress Palace. In São Paulo, thousands more protested, and another 5,000 in Porto Alegre. Protests reached 18 states.|$|R
5|$|The 1873 mahant–Elokeshi {{incident}} {{was not the}} first incident against a mahant of Tarakeswar. Mahant Shrimanta Giri was executed in 1824 for the murder of his mistress's lover. However, according to Sarkar (author of Hindu wife, Hindu nation), while the 1824 scandal hardly created any <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> and faded quickly from public memory, the 1873 affair was embedded in public memory and created a huge sensation in contemporary Bengal. When a satyagraha was organised against the reigning mahant of Tarakeswar, Satish Giri, in 1974 for his sexual and financial misconduct, the 1873 affair was alluded to several times.|$|E
5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be an affront to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense <b>public</b> <b>outrage.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Meir and the Israeli Labor Party won the {{elections}} held in late-December, {{the release of}} the Agranat Commission's findings in April 1974 and its failure to accuse the nation's political leadership of any shortcomings—while recommending the dismissal of several senior officers—led to widespread <b>public</b> <b>outrage.</b> Meir resigned in response to public criticism, but Dayan remained steadfast. Eventually, the 1977 elections saw the end of Labor Party's unchallenged reign over Israeli politics with the election of Menachem Begin and the Likud Party.|$|E

5000|$|By 1950, a {{much younger}} and more left-wing part of the Lettrist {{movement}} began to emerge. This group kept very active in perpetrating <b>public</b> <b>outrages</b> such as the Notre-Dame Affair, where at the Easter High Mass at Notre Dame de Paris, in front of ten thousand people and broadcast on national TV, their member and former Dominican Michel Mourre posed as a monk, [...] "stood {{in front of the}} altar and read a pamphlet proclaiming that God was dead". André Breton prominently came out in solidarity with the action in a letter that spawned a large debate in the newspaper Combat.|$|R
5|$|A {{search warrant}} {{executed}} on April 25, 2007, {{as part of}} a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, with extensive facilities for the activity. Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities. As separate state and federal investigations progressed, more details emerged about an interstate dog-fighting ring that involved drugs and gambling. Gruesome details of abuse, torture, and execution of under-performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of <b>public</b> <b>outrage.</b> Vick and several others were indicted on federal and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused <b>public</b> <b>outrage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5000|$|On Monday 11 April 1988, on {{the advice}} of the Crown Prosecution Service, Gibson and the gallery owner, Peter Sylveire, were {{formally}} charged with the common law offences of exhibiting a <b>public</b> nuisance and <b>outraging</b> <b>public</b> decency. This was the first occasion on which the charge of <b>outraging</b> <b>public</b> decency had been preferred in more than 80 years. The trial started on Monday 30 January 1989 at the Old Bailey. The judge was Brian Smedley, Michael Worsley was the prosecuting barrister, and Geoffrey Robertson and Francis Irwin were the defence barristers. [...] On 6 February 1989 the public nuisance charge was dismissed.|$|R

5|$|In June 1816, the French frigate Méduse {{departed}} from Rochefort, {{bound for the}} Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette Écho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed captain of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20years. After the wreck, <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside {{the concerns of the}} monarch. The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-Désiré Schmaltz, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December, the {{government}} promised to file the charge sheet quickly and seek the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the perpetrators. Following <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> and {{a demand for}} a speedy trial and prosecution, on 24 December, the police promised to file the charge sheet within one week. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs met on 27 December to discuss the issue, and Union Home Secretary R. K. Singh and Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar were summoned to appear. The Delhi High Court approved the creation of five fast-track courts to try rape and sexual assault cases. The first of the five approved fast-track courts was inaugurated on 2 January 2013 by Altamas Kabir, Chief Justice of India, in Saket court complex in South Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The press did {{not cover}} the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's {{dispatch}} to Eustis to {{mean he was}} defeated. By December, as most major American papers carried stories on the battle, <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> over the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, on June 18, 1812, the U.S. government declared war against United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia. The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E
5|$|The {{severing}} of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These {{were sometimes}} {{cut off by}} rogue Force Publique soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back {{the hands of their}} victims. These details were recorded by Christian missionaries working in the Congo and caused <b>public</b> <b>outrage</b> when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist E. D. Morel. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the Belgian Congo, and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive historiographical debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.|$|E
5|$|After the {{partition}} of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Bengal, the non-contiguous {{eastern part of the}} Dominion of Pakistan, made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people. The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. In 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu as the sole state language, and its exclusive use in the media and in schools. Opposition and protests immediately arose. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul Kashem, the secretary of Tamaddun Majlish, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan. <b>Public</b> <b>outrage</b> spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.|$|E
5000|$|As an Actor, Law {{appeared}} in the commercially successful Anak Mami Kembali (2005) directed by Abdul Razak Mohaideen. In his next big screen role, he played a communist in the big budget national film 1957: Hati Malaya (2007) [...] directed by Shuhaimi Baba. Law's controversial portrayal of the communist in 1957: Hati Malaya was censored due to the intense violent scenes which sparked the Malaysian <b>public's</b> <b>outrage</b> on the historic validity of communism and negative stereotyping of the ethnic Chinese race in the country. Despite receiving unjustified tabloid condemnation and being isolated by the local film industry, Law continues to star in critics pleasing work internationally that breaks racial barriers and stereotypes worldwide.|$|R

This led to the passage of an ordinance allowing anyone who can obtain 20 registered voters to sign a petition in their favor to be able to register with the city for a vacant seat. The petition was added to get the vote of council member Nate Bates, who considered passing the law without such a requirement would turn the city council appointments into an American Idol style circus.|$|R
