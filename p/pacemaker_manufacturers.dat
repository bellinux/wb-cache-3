5000|$|These {{characteristics}} were {{incorporated in the}} next design to be implanted in humans, the model P4, which employed 30 mm2 area intramyocardial electrodes (and later transvenous pacing electrodes), a very conservative 7.5 volt pulse and for further conservatism a magnetically operated switch which could be actuated from outside the body to change the pulse width from 0.5 to 1.0 millisecond. The 0.5 millisecond pulse width became the standard for later Telectronics models and became the approximate standard for all <b>pacemaker</b> <b>manufacturers</b> by the late 70's, until the evolution of externally programmable/monitorable pacemakers using digital electronics in the late 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{implantation}} of pacemakers improves cardiac {{function and}} quality of life, in particular with dual chamber DDD and DDDR modes. Aim: To evaluate our clinical experience and results on pacemaker implantation, from 1963 to 1998. Material and methods: Computerized data collected from 2, 445 consecutive paced patients was reviewed. A total of 3, 554 operative procedures were performed, including 412 procedures for complications and 697 pacemaker replacement. Patient survival was determined from clinical records, inquiry to <b>pacemaker</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and death certificates from Servicio de Registro Civil e Identificación de Chile (Chilean Civil and Identification Registry). Results: Use of dual chamber (DDD and DDDR) pacemakers increased progressively up to 74 % from 1988 to 1998. Complication rate was 42 % in the 1963 - 1976 study period, it decreased to 10. 6 % in the 1977 - 1987 study period, and to 5. 6 % by 1988 - 1998. Only two patients died during surgery in the study period (0. 08 %). In the 1977 - 1987 period, pacemakers lasted 10. 6 years. Survival rates were 52 % at ten years, 33 % at 15 years, and 21 % at 20 years, with a median survival of 11. 7 years, and 7. 24 years in patients over 80 years old. Conclusions: Transvenous permanent pacing can be accomplished today with a low complication rate, mainly due to better technology and surgical procedures (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 132 - 42...|$|E

50|$|Cardiac rhythm disease {{management}} {{is the oldest}} and largest of Medtronic's business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally-slow heart rates. Since then, it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. It has also {{made an effort to}} address overall {{disease management}} by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently-operating Dutch <b>pacemaker</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the unit. Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices; they use separate interfaces.|$|R
40|$|Sick sinus {{syndrome}} (SSS) is {{a relatively}} common chronic condition affecting the electrical conduction system of the heart. In {{the absence of any}} reversible cause of SSS, the most effective treatment is implantation of a permanent pacemaker to maintain the heart rate and conduction sequence within the normal physiological parameters. Although atrial pacing may be sufficient, in practice most patients in the UK receive dual chamber pacing. There is considerable clinical evidence that long term ventricular pacing can have a deleterious effect on the heart function and can increase the risk of heart failure hospitalisation, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac dysfunction. A link between the degree of right ventricular pacing (RVP) and the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) has also been demonstrated. <b>Pacemaker</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have therefore developed a variety of programmable modes, features and algorithms that can be utilised to reduce unnecessary RVP. These include prolongation of atrioventricular delay (AVD), with or without “search”, and pacemakers that offer minimal ventricular pacing. Although there are national UK guidelines on the use of appropriate pacemaker modes at implant, there is no such guidance on appropriate programming strategies. This research project sought to identify the implanting and programming practice in a large pacemaker service in County Durham and Darlington (CD&D) between 2006 and 2011. The records of 349 patients who were paced for SSS were studied, with a follow-up of up to 5 years. Pacemaker implantation practice was compared to national audit data. The association between programming strategies and degree of RVP was then explored. The results from this project showed {{there is a lack of}} consistency in the historical approach to reducing right ventricular pacing by the use of particular devices and algorithms. Devices with a minimal ventricular pace algorithm reduce the degree of RVP to as little as < 4...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} need for a pacemaker/defibrillator that could perform an automatic system self-diagnostics check to assure operational functionality and give doctors a chance to assess a patient's status in the event they are experiencing complications, as pointed out {{in an article in the}} journal Health Scout, which stated that 'St. Jude Medical Inc., the nation's second-largest <b>pacemaker</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> has warned doctors that at least 90 of its pacemakers being used by heart patients could stop emitting the electrical signal that regulates heartbeat'. The proposed functionality would also serve the military in determining the whereabouts or state of being of an individual on the battlefield. This thesis investigates the use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, and Structured Query Language (SQL) to develop the high level architecture of a system to store and retrieve digital/wireless communication information from a pacemaker/defibrillator, or other device, and to alert medical personnel when a person is experiencing problems with their health. It presents the requirements and architectural design of the Self-Diagnostics Digitally Controlled Pacemaker/Defibrillator Device.

40|$|Patients with cardiac implantable {{electrical}} devices should take precautions {{when exposed to}} electromagnetic fields. Possible interference {{as a result of}} proximity to electromagnets or electricity flow from electronic tools employed in clinical odontology remains controversial. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine in vitro the capacity of dental equipment to provoke electromagnetic interference in pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Six electronic dental instruments were tested on three implantable cardioverter defibrillators and three <b>pacemakers</b> from different <b>manufacturers.</b> A simulator model, submerged in physiological saline, with elements that reproduced life-size anatomic structures was used. The instruments were analyzed at differing distances and for different time periods of application. The dental instruments studied displayed significant differences in their capacity to trigger electromagnetic interference. Significant differences in the quantity of registered interference were observed with respect to the variables manufacturer, type of cardiac implant, and application distance but not with the variable time of application. The electronic dental equipment tested at a clinical application distance (20 cm) provoked only slight interference in the pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators employed, irrespective of manufacturer...|$|R
5000|$|Research also {{included}} dissection {{and analysis of}} the failure modes of explanted <b>pacemakers</b> of any <b>manufacturer.</b> Most failures were due to an internal short circuit of one of the cells of the multicell battery due to the growth of metallic dendrites; or the result of water vapour diffusing though the epoxy resin encapsulation. The only suitable cell available at the time was the mercuric oxide-zinc cell, so the battery problems remained. In 1967 Telectronics commenced research into the technologies which could allow hermetic sealing of the pacemaker to preclude water vapour penetration and, as an interim measure contracted AWM a subsidiary of Amalgamated Wireless Australia Limited (AWA) to develop integrated circuits for the electronics. These early integrated circuits were developed by David R Money who later joined Telectronics and later still led development of the cochlear implant for the profoundly deaf. The circuits were analogue type, housed in hermetically sealed ceramic military 'flat packs' with redundant double gold bonding of the terminations. The IC's were first used in the model P7 of 1969.|$|R
