25|$|Some {{other states}} were also divided into land {{divisions}} and land districts; {{in the nineteenth}} century land districts sometimes served as the region name for parts of the state where counties had not been proclaimed yet. Below these are groups of land parcels known as deposited plans, registered plans or title plans (depending on the state). Queensland has registered plans; New South Wales and Western Australia have deposited plans; while Victoria has certified plans. Land can be identified using the number of this <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> held with the lands department, rather than with a named unit such as a parish (or both can be used); it is becoming increasingly common to use only the plan number. Within these are individual land parcels such as lots; in total there are estimated to be about 10.2 million of these in Australia. The various cadastral units appear on certificates of title, which are given volume and folio numbers; these numbers by themselves are sometimes used to identify land parcels, or in combination with the other units. Detailed maps of these divisions have been required since the introduction of the Torrens title system of a central register of land holdings in South Australia in 1858, which spread to the other colonies. While cadastral data since the 1980s has been digitalised, there remain many old maps showing these divisions held in collections of Australian libraries such as the National Library of Australia, as well as in state libraries.|$|E

40|$|The {{preparation}} <b>of</b> strata <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> is {{a regular}} task for the modern surveyor. While electronic measurement and recording have permeated all other survey tasks the recording of Strata measurements is still largely the domain of pencil and paper.

This project will implement and test a variety of equipment and procedures for electronic measurement and recording. It is envisaged that a successful system will result in time and cost savings and a reduction in errors due to on site data checking. Upcoming electronic lodgement options will be explored as an extension <b>of</b> the <b>plan</b> production. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{street is}} named after William Henry Draper, a lawyer, judge, and {{politician}} in Upper Canada later Canada West. The street was laid out in an 1856 <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> by J. Stoughton Dennis of lands {{that were part of}} the 1794 Garrison Reserve. Draper and Charles Jones are listed as the property owners of the lots to be subdivided for development. The street is narrow; it is only 32 ft-wide. The lots are all 88 ft deep and vary in width from 22 ft to 32 ft wide.|$|E
5000|$|A plat of {{subdivision}} or <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> appears when a landowner or municipality divides {{land into}} smaller parcels. If a landowner owns {{an acre of}} land, for instance, and wants to divide it into three pieces, a surveyor {{would have to take}} precise measurements of the land and submit the survey to the governing body, which would then have to approve it. [...] A plat of subdivision also applies when a landowner/building owner divides a multi-family building into multiple units. This can apply for the intention of selling off the individual units as condominiums to individual owners.|$|E

In 1883 Eastwood sold {{a portion of his}} land south of Lake Shore Road (now, Boulevard West) to a small group of financiers from Toronto. It was to be developed as a summer resort called 'Sea Breeze Park', and a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> was filed in 1884. In 1886, the site was acquired by Thomas Wilkie and his brother and it was renamed 'Long Branch Park', after the seaside summer resort area of Long Branch, New Jersey where Thomas had vacationed. The central north-south street was originally named 'Sea Breeze Avenue', but was renamed as 'Long Branch Avenue'.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the age of}} Cadastre, {{the notion}} of Cadastral {{documentation}} emerged late in the English language, as the institution of cadaster developed outside English-speaking countries. In a Danish textbook, one out of 15 chapters regards the Form and content <b>of</b> documents concerning <b>subdivision,</b> etc. Early textbooks of international scope focused on recordings in terms of land registration and technical aspects of cadastral survey, yet note that 'cadastral surveying {{has been carried out}} within a tight framework of legislation'. With the view of assessing transaction costs, a European project: Modelling real property transactions (2001-2005) charted procedures for the transfer of ownership and other rights in land and buildings. Cadastral documentation is described, e.g. for Finland as follows '8. Surveyor draws up cadastral map and cadastral documents [...]. 10. Surveyor sends cadastral documents to cadastral authority.' [...] In Australia, similar activities are referred to as 'lodgement <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> at land titles offices' ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to identification of particular parcels of land by county, parish and other names, such parcels are also usually identified {{by reference to}} a lot number of a particular <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> or other certified plan or survey. Legal documents (such as a title or transfer) can describe a particular parcel of land by reference to the county, parish, township (if there is one), section, crown allotment number, and certified plan number. For example: [...] "County of Dalhousie, Parish of Lauriston, being 2 hectares, being Crown Allotment 2, Section 40" [...] or"Parish of Ballarat, County of Grant.. Crown Allotment 29, Section 101, Township of Ballarat East.. as shown on Certified Plan No. 105127" ...|$|E
50|$|By 1850, {{after the}} Union of The Canadas, Etobicoke was {{formally}} recognised as a Township. The Great Western Railway (originally chartered as the Toronto & Hamilton Railway) was built through {{the southern part}} of the Township. The first Mimico railway station opened in 1855, just north of the tracks beside Christ Church on Church St. (now Royal York Rd.). A <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> was commissioned with side-streets for the 'Town of Mimico'. Mimico was advertised as being '8 minutes' from Toronto (by train), then bordered by Dufferin St. In 1858, a Mimico post office had been opened just south of the Railway Station on Church St. (Royal York Rd.) where St. Leo's Church is today and in 1863, the Wesley Methodist Church was established.|$|E

[...] With the first industries in New Toronto already operating, or to be operational by the end of 1890, New Toronto was promoted with the publication of an article in the edition of October 25, 1890 of the Toronto Globe newspaper (now the Globe & Mail) entitled [...] "Toronto's Growing Suburb - New Toronto - As it is and what it will be". [...] New Toronto, as an industrial centre [...] "was expected to rival - if not exceed - 'old' Toronto in manufacturing output".

5000|$|In many jurisdictions, {{land use}} laws require that severances of land occur {{in an orderly}} fashion by way of plans of subdivision, {{especially}} when multiple lots are being created. [...] In order to avoid the sometimes complicated and lengthy subdivision process, some jurisdictions allow severances of a minor nature to proceed without a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision,</b> as long as other criteria are met. The approval of such minor severances are often referred to as [...] "consents", and the authority to grant consents is usually given to local planning bodies such as committees of adjustment or land division committees. [...] Colloquially, the term [...] "severance" [...] is often used to solely refer to such minor land divisions rather than to divisions undertaken by way of the more complicated subdivision process.|$|E
5000|$|The land {{upon which}} Wanless Park sits was {{originally}} Waverley Farm. In 1912, Toronto Suburbs Ltd., guided by George Kappele and D.F. Crowagen registered a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> {{for the old}} Waverley farm at Mount Pleasant Road and Lawrence Avenue. The developers named this new subdivision Waverley Park. The building of homes in Waverley Park was interrupted by the First World War and the Depression. On March 23rd, 1931 the City of Toronto expropriated land {{in the center of}} Waverley Park {{for the creation of a}} public park and issued an order to expropriate all lands: “lying north of Wanless Avenue and Wanless Crescent, west of Dundee Place (now Braeside Road), east of Kappelle Avenue and south of Ranleigh Avenue” (which is now Haslemere Road). This plan passed through Council on June 15th, 1931 and Wanless Park was born.|$|E
5000|$|Previously {{protected}} land in {{the northeastern}} portion of Oak Ridges along Bloomington Road, directly {{to the east of}} Yonge St. has had its protected land status removed by the Richmond Hill Town Council. The land is currently owned by Baif Developments. It got a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>subdivision</b> approved about 10 years ago in an Ontario Municipal Board hearing. Construction was set to begin in 2010-2011, however on this property only 25% of the lots are able to be built. The site has seen fierce opposition and has been surrounded at entry points by road barriers spray painted with phrases such as, [...] "No Subdivision". The Town of Richmond Hill has declared these barriers, [...] "Holdings Symbols", and their removal order is pending. The barriers interfere with preparations regarding the shortage of sewer allocation from the York Region and the developers have been waiting to build. The application to remove the [...] "Holdings Symbols" [...] {{is due to the fact}} that the sewer allocation has become partially available. Once more sewer allocation is available they will be able to proceed fully. The land in question is still in its natural state, with the exception of some removal of trees. In the 2003 Ontario provincial election the Liberal party promised to halt development on the Oak Ridges Moraine, specifically in Richmond Hill.|$|E
