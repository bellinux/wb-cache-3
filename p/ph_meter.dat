5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a <b>pH</b> <b>meter.</b> The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

25|$|A <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> is an {{electronic}} instrument {{used to measure}} the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of a liquid. In 1935, Arnold Orville Beckman invented the <b>pH</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ammonia and {{ammonium}} can be measurement {{using an}} ion-selective electrode probe and a <b>pH</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Very precise {{measurements}} necessitate {{that the}} <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> is calibrated before each measurement. More typically calibration is performed once per day of operation. Calibration is needed because the glass electrode {{does not give}} reproducible electrostatic potentials over longer periods of time.|$|E

25|$|The {{end point}} of most titrations is {{detected}} {{by the use}} of visual indicator but the method can be inaccurate in very dilute or colored solutions. However under the same conditions, a potentiometric method for the detection of the equivalence point can yield accurate results without difficulty. The electrical apparatus required consists of a potentiometer or <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> with a suitable indicator and reference electrode. The other apparatus consists of a burette, beaker and stirrer.|$|E
25|$|Formol titration, {{invented by}} the Danish chemist S. P. L. Sørensen in 1907, {{utilizes}} formaldehyde {{in the presence}} of potassium or sodium hydroxide to measure amino acid concentration and ammonia {{with the aid of a}} <b>pH</b> <b>meter.</b> The reagents will also react with proline which can give a slightly higher YAN measurement than NOPA. The Formal method also has the disadvantages of involving the use and disposal of formaldehyde which is a known carcinogen and the highly toxic reagent barium chloride.|$|E
25|$|On April 8, 1935, Beckman renamed {{his company}} National Technical Laboratories, {{formally}} acknowledging his new {{focus on the}} making of scientific instruments. The company rented larger quarters at 3330 Colorado Street, and began manufacturing pH meters. The <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> is an important device for measuring the pH of a solution, and by 11 May 1939, sales were successful enough that Beckman left Caltech to become the full-time president of National Technical Laboratories. By 1940, Beckman {{was able to take}} out a loan to build his own 12,000 square foot factory in South Pasadena.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, as the polio {{epidemic}} {{swept across}} Europe, many children {{were at risk}} of respiratory failure.

25|$|Specialty {{meters and}} probes are {{available}} for use in special applications, such as harsh environments and biological microenvironments. There are also holographic pH sensors, which allow pH measurement colorimetrically, making use {{of the variety of}} pH indicators that are available. Additionally, there are commercially available <b>pH</b> <b>meters</b> based on solid state electrodes, rather than conventional glass electrodes.|$|R
25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with {{principles}} of good laboratory practice, calibration is performed {{with at least}} two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature thermocouples in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06volts per pH unit) with the pH scale. Good laboratory practice dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed with distilled water or deionized water to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.|$|E
500|$|Coleman Instruments had {{recently}} coupled a <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> with an optical phototube unit {{to examine the}} visual spectrum (the Coleman Model DM). Beckman had already developed a successful <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> for measuring acidity of solutions, his company's breakthrough product. Seeing the potential to build upon their existing expertise, Beckman made it a goal to create an easy-to-use integrated instrument which would [...] both register and report specific wavelengths extending into the ultraviolet range. [...] Rather than depending on development of photographic plates, or a human observer's visual ability to detect wavelengths in the absorption spectrum, phototubes {{would be used to}} register and report the specific wavelengths that were detected.

40|$|In this article, we {{will talk}} about two of the most popular {{applications}} in the water analysis field: <b>pH</b> <b>meters</b> and conductivity <b>meters.</b> <b>pH</b> {{is a measure of the}} acidity or alkalinity of a solution. As we know, most living things depend on a proper pH level to sustain life. The measurement of pH is critical in many fields ranging from chemical processing, pulp and paper, food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and so on. Conductivity is a measure of how well a solution conducts electricity, which is an extremely widespread and useful method for quality control purposes...|$|R

500|$|The DU was {{the first}} commercially viable {{scientific}} instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. [...] As he had done with the <b>pH</b> <b>meter,</b> Beckman had replaced an array of complicated equipment with a single, easy-to-use instrument.

500|$|The first {{prototype}} Beckman spectrophotometer, the Model A, {{was created}} at National Technologies Laboratories in 1940. [...] It used a tungsten light source {{with a glass}} Fery prism [...] as a monochromator. Tungsten was used for incandescent light filaments because it was strong, withstood heat, and emitted a steady light. Types of light sources differed {{in the range of}} wavelengths of light that they emitted. [...] Tungsten lamps were useful in the visible light range but gave poor coverage in the ultraviolet range. However, they had the advantage of being readily available because they were used as automobile headlamps. An external amplifier from the Beckman <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> and a vacuum tube photocell were used to detect wavelengths.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> is a {{scientific}} instrument that measures the hydrogen-ion activity in water-based solutions, indicating its {{acidity or alkalinity}} expressed as pH. The <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> measures the difference in electrical potential between a pH electrode and a reference electrode, and so the <b>pH</b> <b>meter</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "potentiometric pH meter".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gain {{experience}} with and validate the Heidelberg pH-telemetric methodology in order to determine if the pH-telemetric methodology would be a useful noninvasive measure of gastrointestinal transit time for future ground-based and in-flight drug evaluation studies. The Heidelberg <b>pH</b> <b>metering</b> system is a noninvasive, nonradioactive telemetric system that, following oral ingestion, continuously measures intraluminal pH of the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, ileocecal junction, and large bowel.

All profiles were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast. Heidelberg pH profiles were obtained in the fasting and fed states; lactulose breath-hydrogen profiles were obtained after a standard breakfast. Mouth-to-cecum transit time was measured as the interval from administration of lactulose (30 ml; 20 g) to a sustained increase in breath-hydrogen of 10 ppm or more. Gastric emptying time was measured as the interval from the administration of the Heidelberg capsule to a sustained increase in pH of three units or more...|$|R
