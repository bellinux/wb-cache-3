The factory's owners changed names several times, being variously known as the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co., the Condensed and <b>Peptonised</b> <b>Milk</b> Co., Thew, Hook and Gilbey and then later as United Dairies.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} on the putrefactive, anaerobic bacilli there is, as Reddish and Rettger (1922) have pointed out, much confusion regarding the identity of Bacillus putrificus Bienstock. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} Bienstock's first publication (1884) refers to cultures which were impure, as he himself later admitted, and that the subsequent papers of this author (1899, 1901, 1906) contain imperfect descriptions of his organism which are to some extent mutually contradictory. The majority of investigators are agreed that Bienstock's bacillus is an anaerobic, motile, sporulating rod which liquefies gelatin, peptonises milk and is non-pathogenic. In the published descriptions of this bacillus there is some diversity of opinion as to the rate at which the organism is capable of liquefying gelatin and <b>peptonising</b> <b>milk.</b> The main characteristics about which there is disagreement, however, are the shape and position of the spores, the size of the rods and the ability of the organism to ferment carbohydrates. Certain workers describe Bac. putri-ficus as a slender rod, which produces more or less spherical spores, always strictly terminal and which is incapable of attack-ing sugars to any appreciable extent. The chief advocates of this view are Reddish and Rettger (1922, 1923, 1924). On the other hand several investigators have referred to the fermentation of certain carbohydrates by strains of Bac. putrificus obtained from type culture collections (Achalme (1902); Reddish (1924)) or by cultures believed to be identical with Bienstock's bacillu...|$|R
