In addition mice, lizards, large insects are also taken. In one study in Bangladesh, adults fed mainly on small sparrow sized birds (72%) and Pipistrellus bats (28%). They may sometimes pirate prey obtained by other medium-sized raptors. Prey may sometimes be cached and eaten subsequently.The red-necked falcon drinks water where available during the afternoons. This has been observed both in India and in Africa, where it sometimes visits waterholes.|$|E

30|$|We have {{attempted}} to understand the affinities of the natural flooded forest fragments by comparing data on small mammal species assemblages from several sampling sites throughout Cerrado and adjacent biomes. Our hypothesis that the small mammal species composition of these fragments {{is similar to that}} of gallery forests of the central-western region of Brazil was supported by our analysis (Figures  3 and 4). At a primary level, the small mammal fauna of ipucas is closely related to that of adjacent forests in the Amazonia-Cerrado ecotone in the state of Tocantins (Passamani [2002]; Bezerra et al. [2009]; Rocha et al. [2011]). However, these latter sites also clustered with sites from western Cerrado and Amazonia-Cerrado and Atlantic Forest-Cerrado ecotones. This region (group II) is a transition between dry areas and moist forested areas in central-western Brazil, which is characterized by the presence of typical Amazonian species, such as M. didelphoides, and by typical inhabitants of the Cerrado species, such as C. tocantinsi (Latcher and Allho [2001]; Carmignotto [2005]; Cáceres et al. [2008]; Bezerra et al. [2009]; Rocha et al. [2011]; Santos-Filho et al. [2012]), and also in the southern (site 19) by typical Atlantic Forest species, such as Gracilinanus microtarsus (Cáceres et al. [2008]). Thus, these results corroborate the strong influence of moist tropical forested biomes on the natural forest fragments at the Araguaia alluvial <b>plain</b> (<b>Martins</b> et al. [2008]).|$|R

60|$|He soon {{discovered}} {{that they were just}} as fond of play as he was, and that he too was to take part in their games. Having fed as long as they wanted that morning, they all at once began to gather together, coming at a gallop, neighing shrilly; then the wild man, catching Martin up, leaped upon the back of one of the horses, and away went the whole troop at a furious pace to the great open dry <b>plain,</b> where <b>Martin</b> had met with them on the previous day. Now it was very terrifying for him at first to be in the midst of that flying crowd, as the animals went tearing over the plain, which seemed to shake beneath their thundering hoofs, while their human leader cheered them on with his shrill, repeated cries. But in a little while he too caught the excitement, and, losing all his fear, was as wildly happy as the others, crying out {{at the top of his}} voice in imitation of the wild man.|$|R
60|$|The warmth, and {{the chicken}} that Lucette had killed and dressed, brought the colour {{back to the}} {{exhausted}} wanderer's cheek, and enabled her again to hold council for her safety. It was <b>plain,</b> as <b>Martin</b> had found in conversation with the men-at-arms, that precautions had been taken against her escaping {{in any of the}} directions where she might hope to have reached friends. Alone she could not go, and any escort sufficient to protect her would assuredly be stopped at the first town; besides which, collecting it in secret was impossible under present circumstances, and it would be sure to be at once overtaken and demolished by the Chevalier Narcisse's well-armed followers. Martin, therefore, saw no alternative but for her to lurk about in such hiding-places as her faithful vassals could afford her, until the search should blow over, and the vigilance of her uncle and cousin relax. Hope, the high-spirited hope of early youth, looked beyond to indefinite but infinite possibility. Anything was better than the shame and horror of yielding, and Eustacie trusted herself with all her heart for the present, fancying, she knew not what, the future.|$|R

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunitySediment cores from Lake Tokun were used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate changes in the Copper River delta area, Alaska. A 4. 2 -m-long sediment sequence was analyzed for organic matter, chlorophyll-a, magnetic susceptibility, and bulk density. The chronology was based on radiocarbon ages and short-lived isotopes. Distinct changes in the sedimentary succession record major paleoenvironmental changes during the Holocene. Prior to 8. 8 ka, Lake Tokun received meltwater from the Martin River Glacier {{at a time when}} sea level had transgressed at least 6 km inland of the present shoreline likely due to isostatic depression upon deglaciation. From 8. 8 to 0. 7 ka, Lake Tokun was a shallow lake receiving sporadic pulses of rock flour when Martin River overtopped its channels. At 735 - 1215 AD, rock flour deposited in Lake Tokun represents an aggrading outwash <b>plain</b> as the <b>Martin</b> River Glacier expanded and then deposited its terminal moraine. The proximal end of the associated outwash plain dammed Lake Tokun, deepening the lake and enhancing sediment deposition. The lake attained its present depth about 1215 AD and rock flour has not reentered the lake since then. The uppermost sedimentary unit (150 cm thick) was analyzed at 0. 5 cm resolution (average of 3 year per sample) using VNIR reflectance spectroscopy to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a). Instrumental weather data from Cordova (1917 to 2009) show a strong inverse correlation (r² = 0. 49; p = 0. 03) between August precipitation and sedimentary chl-a content in Lake Tokun. Storms beginning in the late summer and persisting through the fall are important in controlling peak discharges and the subsequent transport of allochthonous material into Lake Tokun. Winter (DJF) temperature is also inversely correlated with chl-a content (r² = 0. 33; p = 0. 04), indicating that warm winters, which tend to be wet, also lead to enhanced runoff, which carries mineral matter that dilutes the chl-a content of the lake sediment. Decreased chl-a values suggest increased runoff during the early to middle Little Ice Age (LIA; 1215 - 1650 AD). Increased chl-a values during the late LIA (1650 - 1850 AD) are suggestive of decreased runoff. This study demonstrates that multi-proxy analysis of lake sediments is an effective method for inferring past paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate change...|$|R
