40|$|ABSTRACT: The Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility (AWWU) is {{performing}} upgrades to their water system. A challenging section {{of that system}} is an existing 6 -inch wire-wrapped wood stave water line {{that needs to be}} upsized to an 8 -inch line. The pipe was installed in the 1950 ’s and is failing. There have been 8 emergency repairs, 5 of which have occurred in the last 5 years. Some of the repairs were done by pounding wood wedges into the leaks. The pipe is 1, 160 feet long and is located in the G-H Alley between 10 th and 13 th Avenue in Anchorage, Alaska. The alleyway is very narrow and contains several major utilities including an 8 -inch gas line, a 12 -inch storm sewer, telephone/cable lines and an 8 -inch sanitary sewer. For much of the alignment, the gas line is located within about 3 feet of the water line. The water line is located 10 to 11 feet below grade. Three borings were advanced along the alignment by Golder Associates in Anchorage. All three borings were dry and indicated <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> sand with <b>gravel</b> at the depth of the waterline. Trenchless construction options were considered due to the presence of many utilities, lack of available room within the narrow ROW to perform open-cut work, and the regular use of the alley by residents. Four trenchless technologies were evaluated to replace the existing 6 -inch wire-wrapped wood stave pipe; horizontal directional drilling (HDD), pipe bursting, auger boring, and pilot tube microtunneling. This paper describes layout and design issues associated with each trenchless option considered and discusses the chosen method (pilot tube microtunneling) in greater detail...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{and compares}} {{the characteristics of}} soil profiles along the altitudinal gradients in Sikkilsdalen and Heimdalen, situated in southeast Norway {{on the basis of}} primary data collected from the north facing and south facing slopes. To achieve the goal, content of plant available potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were quantified in soil profiles at an interval of 100 m from top to bottom of the mountains. Loss on ignition, pH, particle size and soil types were also examined and described. Organic carbon (C) were determined by loss on ignition. The plant available nutrients were determined by extracting soil with AL-solution (0. 1 M ammonium lactate and 0. 4 M acetate). Soil pH of all samples were determined in a soil: water of 1 : 2. 5 (volume based) with the help of pH meter. Dry sieving was performed to determine the particle size distribution (texture) of the soil. Unified soil classification technique was used to determine the soil type on the basis of uniformity coefficient and coefficient of curvature. Overall, plant available nutrients K, Mg, Ca, organic C is found to be significantly unchanged with respect to the mountain, but, phosphate is significantly different. Soil type is not variate with altitude and slope. Particle sizes D 10, D 60 were found to be almost same in all profiles, but D 30 Varies significantly. Also, pH is not changed too with respect to the mountain, horizon and soil type. Soils were found acidic in all profiles. Organic C, K, Ca and Mg show negative correlations with pH and altitude. In contrast, phosphate is positive correlated with pH and altitude. Organic C is found to be skewed with respect to the mountains and depths. Its concentration is higher in sand than gravel, and it is declining downward as well. Average potassium contents were high in upper soil and poorly graded sand, and the average estimated content were 10 mg/ 100 g. Average Phosphate content was 1 - 2 mg/ 100 g in north face, and it was 0. 5 - 1 mg/ 100 g in south face. The content was higher in gravel than sand. Magnesium content was between 1. 4 and 57. 1 mg/ 100 gm, it was high in well graded sand, and not normally distributed. Ca varied between 10. 4 and 279. 6 mg/ 100 g and it was reducing with depth. Mg and Ca were also higher in sand than gravel. Only GG (gap graded), GP (<b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>gravel),</b> GW (well graded gravel), SP (poorly graded sand) and SW (well graded sand) soil types were found in both mountains on the basis of unified soil classification. pH shows almost uniform trends along the transects, however, regression lines for nutrients vary between mountains along the altitudinal gradients...|$|E

After cracks {{appear in}} the {{semi-rigid}} base layer, the stress mode of pavement structure transits from infinite continuum to limited size board, and the cracks become stress concentration areas. Based on the practical tire contact pressure and contact area, this paper establishes the C 3 D 8 R model by ABAQUS, to calculate and analyse the influence on the base cracks extension from <b>graded</b> <b>gravel</b> transition layer under half-sinusoid load. Analysis shows that the <b>graded</b> <b>gravel</b> has excellent stress dissipation ability. Whether there are cracks in the base, the <b>graded</b> <b>gravel</b> transition layer between asphalt surface layer and semi-rigid base layer could greatly reduce the tensile stresses {{in the bottom of}} semi-rigid base and subbase layers, improve the road bearing level, delay and avoid the cracks extension to deep road and prolong the road service life.

40|$|To {{interpret}} the deposits from particle-laden flows {{it is necessary}} to understand particle settling at their base. In this paper a quantitative model is developed that not only captures how particles settle out of suspension but also the composition of the final deposit in terms of its vertical distribution of grain sizes. The theoretical model is validated by comparison to published experimental data that has been used to {{interpret the}} field deposits of submarine sediment-laden flows (Amy et al., 2006). The model explains two intriguing features of the experimental deposits that are also observed in natural deposits. First, deposits commonly have an ungraded, or <b>poorly</b> normally <b>graded,</b> region overlain by a strongly normally graded region. Second, the normalized thickness of the ungraded region increases as the initial concentration of the suspension is increased. In the theoretical model, the <b>poorly</b> normally <b>graded</b> region results from a constant mass flux into the bed that persists until the largest grain size present within the flow has been completely deposited. The effect of increasing the concentration of the initial suspension is to increase the thickness of the <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> part of the deposit and to decrease its average grain size. This work suggests that deposits with relatively thick, <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> bases can form from relatively high-concentration polydisperse suspensions, when the initial volume fraction of sediment is greater than approximately 20 % and indicates {{that it is important to}} include these hindered settling effects in models of depositing flows...|$|R

40|$|In {{studying}} the problems on sediment transport {{in a stream}} and stabilities of astream channel, the criterion for mvement of sands and gravels by action of fljw, theso-called critical tractive force, becomes generally important. The present paper dealswith the hydraulic approach to solve the mechanism of the critical tractive force ofgraded sand gravels. In {{the first part of}} this paper, the results of some basic experiments on the critical trac-tive force of <b>graded</b> sand <b>gravels,</b> especially the mechanism of sediment transport nearthe critical condition for movement and the sorting effect of flow, are described. It isconcluded from the experiments that the practical definition for the criterion for move-ment of sand gravels proposed by the author in the previous paper can also be appliedto the critical tractive force of <b>graded</b> sand <b>gravels,</b> and the sorting effect of flow nearthe critical condition is expressed by a function of size frequency distributions of gradedsand gravels. In the second part, a theory for the critical tractive force of <b>graded</b> sand <b>gravels</b> isdeveloped, based on the author's procedure to solve the criterion for movement of sandgravels and the existence of wakes behind sand gravels. It is clarified from the com-parison of the theoretical curve with the results of experiments performed by the authorand some other authorities that the critical tractive force of <b>graded</b> sand <b>gravels</b> expressedin the dimensionless form is a function of the standard deviation of graded sand gravels,and the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental results within therange of the standard deviation less than about two.
