40|$|Medical {{students}} are often unsure about {{the viability of}} {{a career as a}} physician in pathology. In particular, they are concerned that <b>pathologists</b> may not have a gratifying lifestyle or be well compensated. These worries may cause angst among medical students considering pathology and among junior pathology residents wondering if they made the correct career choice. A 2016 survey of nearly 20 000 physicians including nearly 400 <b>pathologists</b> provides reassuring data about compensation and career choice. This survey showed that 52 % of <b>pathologists</b> are satisfied with their career choice and 63 % are satisfied with their compensation. Among the 26 specialties that were surveyed, <b>pathologists</b> ranked 2 in believing that they were fairly compensated. Moreover, 66 % of <b>pathologists</b> find that making diagnostic decisions, a core aspect of our discipline, is the most rewarding aspect of their career. <b>Pathologists</b> also ranked among the highest groups of physicians in reporting happiness at work and among the lowest groups reporting burnout. Overall, these 2016 surveys show that the majority of <b>pathologists</b> find deep satisfaction in their careers as <b>pathologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} how proximal colon polyps {{interpreted as}} hyperplastic polyps in 2001 would be interpreted by expert <b>pathologists</b> in 2007. METHODS: Forty consecutive proximal colon polyps ≥ 5 mm in size, removed in 2001, and originally interpreted as hyperplastic polyps by general <b>pathologists</b> at Indiana University, were reviewed in 2007 by 3 GI <b>pathologists.</b> RESULTS: The gastrointestinal (GI) <b>pathologists</b> interpreted 85 %, 43 % and 30 % of the polyps as sessile serrated polyps (sessile serrated adenomas). The overall Kappa was 0. 16. When diagnoses were compared in pairs, Kappa values were 0. 38 and 0. 25 (fair agreement) and 0. 14 (slight agreement). CONCLUSION: Many polyps interpreted as hyperplastic in 2001 were considered sessile serrated lesions by GI <b>pathologists</b> in 2007, {{but there is}} substantial inter-observer variation amongst GI <b>pathologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|Veterinary <b>pathologists</b> {{working as}} toxicologic <b>pathologists</b> in {{academic}} settings fill many vital roles, such as diagnosticians, educators, and/or researchers. These individuals have spent years investigating pathology problems that mainly or exclusively {{focus on the}} reactions of cells, organs, or systems to toxic materials. Thus, academic toxicologic <b>pathologists</b> are uniquely suited both to help trainees understand toxicity {{as a cause of}} pathology responses and also to provide expert consultation on toxicologic pathology. Most toxicologic <b>pathologists</b> in academia are employed at colleges of medicine or veterinary medicine, even though specific toxicologic pathology faculty appointments are uncommon in Europe and North America. Academic toxicologic <b>pathologists</b> typically receive lower financial compensation than do toxicologic <b>pathologists</b> in industry, but academic positions generally provide alternative rewards, such as higher workplace autonomy and scheduling flexibility, professional enrichment through student interactions, and enhanced opportunities for collaborative research and advanced diagnostic investigations. Regular participation by academic toxicologic <b>pathologists</b> in professional training opportunities (eg, as pathology and toxicology instructors in medical and veterinary medical courses, graduate programs, and residencies) offers an important means of engendering interest and inspiring veterinarians to select toxicologic pathology and toxicology as their own areas of future expertise.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{compare the}} {{interobserver}} {{variability in the}} diagnostic of serrated and non-serrated adenomatous lesions and hyperplastic polyps of colon between two groups of <b>pathologists.</b> Methods 310 colorectal polyps were studied, with histological diagnoses established {{by a group of}} <b>pathologists</b> comprising three general <b>pathologists</b> for initial diagnosis, and two gastrointestinal <b>pathologists</b> for expert diagnosis. ResultsHigh interobserver variability was observed in the diagnosis of serrated polyps, when comparing the initial diagnosis with the expert diagnosis (kappa= 0. 102). For the majority of both traditional serrated adenomas and sessile serrated adenomas (27 / 31), a diagnosis of hyperplastic polyps was established at the initial diagnosis. ConclusionsPoor agreement was observed in the diagnosis of serrated polyps between the two groups of <b>pathologists.</b> The accuracy in the diagnosis of these lesions is essential for the prevention of colorectal cancer...|$|R
40|$|AIM This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the concordance in pathological assessments of blood and lymphatic vessel invasion (BLI) in pT 1 colorectal cancers and to assess the effect of diagnostic criterion on consistency {{in the assessment of}} BLI. METHODS Forty consecutive patients undergoing surgical resection of pT 1 colorectal cancers were entered into this study. H&E-stained, D 2 - 40 -stained and elastica-stained slides from the tumours were examined by 18 <b>pathologists</b> from seven countries. The 40 cases were divided into two cohorts with 20 cases each. In cohort 1, <b>pathologists</b> diagnosed BLI using criteria familiar to them; all Japanese <b>pathologists</b> used a criterion of BLI from the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR). In cohort 2, all <b>pathologists</b> used the JSCCR diagnostic criterion. RESULTS In cohort 1, diagnostic concordance was moderate in the US/Canadian and European <b>pathologists.</b> There were no differences in the consistency compared with results for Japanese <b>pathologists,</b> and no improvement in the diagnostic concordance was found for using the JSCCR criterion. However, in cohort 2, the JSCCR criterion decreased the consistency of BLI diagnosis in the US/Canadian and European <b>pathologists.</b> The level of decreased consistency in the assessment of BLI was different between the US/Canadian and European <b>pathologists.</b> CONCLUSIONS A uniform criterion strongly influences the diagnostic consistency of BLI but may not always improve the concordance. Further study is required to achieve an objective diagnosis of BLI in colorectal cancer. The varying effects of diagnostic criterion on the <b>pathologists</b> from Japan, the USA/Canada and Europe might reflect varied interpretations of the criterion. Internationally accepted criterion should be developed by participants from around the world...|$|R
