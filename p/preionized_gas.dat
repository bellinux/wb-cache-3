The measurements are supported by particle-in-cell modeling including ionization.

40|$|In a {{toroidal}} discharge tube, a constant electrie ring field is induced {{for a time}} much longer than the electron collision time. The inducing magnetic field, however, is prevented from penetrating the discharge tube. The torus contains a weakly <b>preionized</b> <b>gas.</b> When the electric field is applied, the electron density essentially grows exponentially with time. If losses can be neglected, the exponential coefficient is identical with the ionization rate. The growtry rates of the electron density are determined by microwave interferometry for electron densities of 10 ^ 11 - 10 ^ 12 cm^- 3. Ionlzatlon rates have been measured as function of E/p in hydrogen and nitrogen. ...|$|E

A gaseous radioactive isotope, e.g. krypton-85, can also be used. Ignition electrodes and keepalive discharge electrodes can also be employed.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} status report on our current {{understanding}} of the mass scales for Pop III. 1 and Pop III. 2 stars. Since the last review (Norman 2008), substantial {{progress has been made}} both numerically and analytically on the late stages of protostellar cloud core collapse, protostar formation and accretion, and stellar evolution taking into account cloud core properties and radiative feedback effects. Based on this, there are growing indications that primordial stars forming from purely cosmological initial conditions (Pop III. 1) were substantially more massive than stars forming in <b>preionized</b> <b>gas</b> (Pop III. 2) where HD cooling is important. Different stellar endpoints are predicted for these two types of Pop III stars with different chemical enrichment signatures: the former die as pair instability supernovae or intermediate mass black holes, whereas the latter die as iron core-collapse supernovae, leaving behind neutron star and stellar black hole remnants. We review recent simulations which show evidence for binary fragmentation at high densities, and comment on the significance of these results. We then summarize an attempt to directly calculate the Pop III. 1 IMF taking into account the latest numerical and analytical models. We conclude with suggestions for the kind of simulations needed next to continue improving our understanding of Pop III star formation, which is a necessary input to understanding high redshift galaxy formation.

40|$|Data from an {{inductive}} conical {{theta pinch}} accelerator are presented to {{gain insight into}} the process of inductive current sheet formation {{in the presence of}} a <b>preionized</b> background <b>gas</b> produced by a steady-state RF-discharge. The presence of a preionized plasma has been previously shown to allow for current sheet formation at lower discharge voltages and energies than those found in other pulsed inductive accelerator concepts, leading to greater accelerator efficiencies at lower power levels. Time-resolved magnetic probe measurements are obtained for different background pressures and pulse energies to characterize the effects of these parameters on current sheet formation. Indices are defined that describe time-resolved current sheet characteristics, such as the total current owing in the current sheet, the time-integrated total current ('strength'), and current sheet velocity. It is found that for a given electric field strength, maximums in total current, strength, and velocity occur for one particular background pressure. At other pressures, these current sheet indices are considerably smaller. The trends observed in these indices are explained in terms of the principles behind Townsend breakdown that lead to a dependence on the ratio of the electric field to the background pressure. Time-integrated photographic data are also obtained at the same experimental conditions, and qualitatively they compare quite favorably with the time-resolved magnetic field data...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed {{inductive}} plasma accelerators are spacecraft propulsion {{devices in}} which energy {{is stored in}} a capacitor and then discharged through an inductive coil. The device is electrodeless, inducing a plasma current sheet in propellant located near {{the face of the}} coil. The propellant is accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity (order of 10 km/s) through the interaction of the plasma current with an induced magnetic field. The Faraday Accelerator with RF-Assisted Discharge (FARAD) thruster [1, 2] is a type of pulsed inductive plasma accelerator in which the plasma is preionized by a mechanism separate from that used to form the current sheet and accelerate the gas. Employing a separate preionization mechanism in this manner allows for the formation of an inductive current sheet at much lower discharge energies and voltages than those found in previous pulsed inductive accelerators like the Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT). In a previous paper [3], the authors presented a basic design for a 100 J/pulse FARAD laboratory-version thruster. The design was based upon guidelines and performance scaling parameters presented in Refs. [4, 5]. In this paper, we expand upon the design presented in Ref. [3] by presenting a fully-assembled and operational FARAD laboratory-model thruster and addressing system and subsystem-integration issues (concerning mass injection, preionization, and acceleration) that arose during assembly. Experimental data quantifying the operation of this thruster, including detailed internal plasma measurements, are presented by the authors in a companion paper [6]. The thruster operates by first injecting neutral gas over the face of a flat, inductive acceleration coil and at some later time <b>preionizing</b> the <b>gas.</b> Once the <b>gas</b> is <b>preionized</b> current is passed through the acceleration coil, inducing a plasma current sheet in the propellant that is accelerated away from the coil through electromagnetic interaction with the time-varying magnetic field. Neutral gas is injected over the face of the acceleration coil through a fast-acting valve that feeds a central distribution manifold. The thruster is designed to <b>preionize</b> the <b>gas</b> using an RF-frequency ringing signal produced by a discharging Vector Inversion Generator (VIG). The acceleration stage consists of a multiple-turn, multiple-strand spiral induction coil (see Fig. 1, left panel) and is designed for operation at discharge energies on the order of 100 J/pulse. Several different pulsed power train modules can be used to drive current through the acceleration coil. One such power train is based upon the Bernardes and Merryman circuit topology, which restricts voltage reversal on the capacitor banks and can be clamped to eliminate current reversal in the coil. A second option is a pulse-compression-ring power train (see Fig. 1, right panel), which takesa temporally broad, low current pulse and transforms it into a short, high current pulse...|$|R
40|$|For the {{compression}} of a cylindrical plasma by fast rising axial magnetic fields, the initial state of this plasma is {{of critical importance}} (1). Therefore experiments with a preheating discharge {{for the production of}} an initial plasma with known and reproducible properties were started at this laboratory simultaneously with the first experiments on {{the compression}} of a weakly <b>preionized</b> deuterium <b>gas.</b> An electrodeless ring discharge was chosen. The absence of electrodes makes a high degree of purity of the plasma possible. Kolb's experience with a preheating discharge for magnetic com-pression experiments (2) confirmed this conception and gave further impulse to this work. Early experiments were made with a RF-transmitter as current generator, in pulsed as weIl as in stationary operation. Dueto the low inductance of the compression coil considerable difficulties are met in coupling the RF power to the discharge. The maximum available power is limited to some hundred kilowatts. By discharging a low inductance condenser on the compression coil a damped RF pulse with apower of 100 M Watt is easily obtained. To avoid prefiring of the main condenser bank, the voltage of the coil must be lirnited. With the spark gaps used at this laboratory the maximum permissible voltage at the coil was about 5 kV. This voltage, however, is sufficient to start an electrodeless ring discharge in hydrogen. Investigations on this electrodeless ring discharge were made with and without a steady magnetic bias field in a wide pressure range. Preliminary results, concerning the breakdown of the gas, the formation of a highly ionized plasma, and the subsequent decay of the plasma dtie to end losses and recombination are reported in this paper...|$|R
