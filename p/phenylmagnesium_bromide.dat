25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from <b>phenylmagnesium</b> <b>bromide</b> and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E

40|$|Formation {{reactions}} of <b>phenylmagnesium</b> chloride and <b>bromide</b> in toluene {{in the presence}} of one or two equivalents of diethyl ether or THF were investigated kinetically. Also, the reaction in diethyl ether and in chlorobenzene was addressed. Kinetic features of the reactions are similar to those found previously for the formation of alkylmagnesium halides in toluene and consist of rapid formation of a disolvated Grignard reagent followed by a slower formation of a monosolvated reagent. The latter is able of catalyzing the conversion of different halides into Grignard reagents. However, the contribution of Wurtz-type side reactions is considerable except when THF is used in toluene. Involving the kinetic data and the activation parameters some details of the reaction mechanism were discussed. Formation kinetics of <b>phenylmagnesium</b> chloride and <b>bromide</b> was investigated in diethyl ether and in toluene with minor additions of diethyl ether or THF.
