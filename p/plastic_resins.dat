5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the <b>plastic</b> <b>resins</b> are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E

25|$|In {{more recent}} times, {{a number of}} {{companies}} are selling composite railroad ties manufactured from recycled <b>plastic</b> <b>resins,</b> and recycled rubber. Manufacturers claim a service life longer than wooden ties with an expected lifetime in the range of 30–80 years, that the ties are impervious to rot and insect attack, and that they can be modified with a special relief on the bottom to provide additional lateral stability. In some main track applications the hybrid plastic tie has a recessed design to be completely surrounded by ballast.|$|E
25|$|Fiberglass (also called glass-reinforced-plastic) is a {{composite}} material made up of glass fibers (also called fiberglass or glass friller) embedded in a <b>plastic</b> <b>resin.</b> It is made by melting glass and stretching the glass into fibers.

2500|$|Although {{many other}} types of lamp emit {{ultraviolet}} light with visible light, black lights are essential when UV-A light without visible light is needed, particularly in observing fluorescence, the colored glow that many substances emit when exposed to UV. [...] Black lights are employed for decorative and artistic lighting effects, diagnostic and therapeutic uses in medicine, the detection of substances tagged with fluorescent dyes, rock-hunting, the detection of counterfeit money, the curing of <b>plastic</b> <b>resins,</b> attracting insects and the detection of refrigerant leaks affecting refrigerators and air conditioning systems. Strong sources of long-wave ultraviolet light are used in tanning beds. [...] Although the low-power UV-A emitted by black lights is not a hazard to skin or eyes and can be viewed without protection, powerful ultraviolet sources present dangers and require personal protective equipment such as goggles and gloves.|$|E
2500|$|... "Between 1960 and 2000, {{the world}} {{production}} of <b>plastic</b> <b>resins</b> increased 25-fold, while {{recovery of the}} material remained below 5 percent." [...] Many studies have addressed recycling behaviour and strategies to encourage community involvement in recycling programmes. It {{has been argued that}} recycling behaviour is not natural because it requires a focus and appreciation for long-term planning, whereas humans have evolved to be sensitive to short-term survival goals; and that to overcome this innate predisposition, the best solution would be to use social pressure to compel participation in recycling programmes. However, recent studies have concluded that social pressure is unviable in this context. One {{reason for this is that}} social pressure functions well in small group sizes of 50 to 150 individuals (common to nomadic hunter–gatherer peoples) but not in communities numbering in the millions, as we see today. Another reason is that individual recycling does not take place in the public view.|$|E

30|$|Samples from subtidal {{sediment}}s {{are taken}} with sediment sampling equipment, e.g. grab samplers [6, 11, 22]. For coastal sediments, direct sampling of visually identified microplastics (e.g. by hand or using tweezers) has been used. This method {{can be employed}} to sample larger microplastics such as <b>plastic</b> <b>resin</b> pellets (typical diameter: 3.5  mm [23]) {{from the surface of}} sandy beaches. However, it is not suitable for sampling microplastics that do not have a characteristic shape, are smaller than <b>plastic</b> <b>resin</b> pellets or are mixed with other debris [6, 11]. In these cases, bulk sampling is required to avoid an underrepresentation of small microplastics. As the distribution of microplastics on beaches is often heterogeneous, attention needs to be paid to sample size, replication and the location of the sampling sites on the beach [8].|$|R
