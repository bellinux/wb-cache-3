5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> from incursions by the Boers.|$|E

5|$|When Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe, {{was hiding}} from the Nazis in the Kraków Ghetto in 1942, he {{accepted}} a kvitel {{from one of}} the men who was assigned to <b>protect</b> <b>him.</b> As the names of the man's children were read aloud, the Rebbe continually stopped the reader when he reached a certain child's name and asked him to begin reading the kvitel again.

5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan.

Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself.

Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E
