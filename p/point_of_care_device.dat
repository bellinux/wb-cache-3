Microfluidic impedance cytometry offers a novel solution to counting and discrimination of dfferent particles and cells. One application is discrimination of different blood cell types {{in a low}} cost <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> <b>device.</b> However,the accuracy of currently available systems is poor and inadequate for clinical use. A full numerical model, developed in this research, demonstrated that {{the main source of}} measurement inaccuracy relates to the position of the particle in the micro-channel. Particles travelling at the top or bottom of the channel close to the electrodes were found to have a higher impedance signal compared with particles travelling through the centre of the channel. Counter-intuitively, the model also showed that although the electrode geometry is symmetrical, the variation in signal is asymmetric about the vertical position of the particle within the channel. A new electrode geometry was developed to minimise particle positional dependence. When combined with new signal processing techniques which were also developed, this led to marked improvements in measurement accuracy. For example, the coefficient of variation of monodisperse beads were half the manufacturer's data. Applications of the improved device were investigated by analysing a range of different cell types in blood. Measurements of the distribution width of red blood cells were successful and found to be within the known clinical range. It was also shown that combined with pre-enrichment techniques, the device successfully detected clinically relevant concentrations of individual tumour cells in a background of 106 times more white blood cells. In order to use microfluidic impedance cytometry for diagnostic blood counting applications, lysing of the more numerous red blood cells is required.

40|$|Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the deadliest}} {{communicable}} diseases in the world, and consequently remains one of the biggest global healthcare challenges. Tuberculosis is treatable and curable. However, within many low resource settings, underdeveloped medical infrastructure limits the effectiveness and accuracy of existing diagnostics. These limitations severely impede the timely diagnosis of the disease, and thus contribute to the disease spreading, developing drug resistance, and killing more individuals. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive, portable, rapid, easy-to-use point of care diagnostic that can function outside of the laboratory at the community level. Currently, there is a wide range of available tuberculosis diagnostics ranging from sputum smear microscopy to nucleic acid amplification tests. Yet, none have met every standard of the ideal point of care diagnostic.

There is {{a growing}} trend towards the use of point of care testing in {{resource}} poor settings, in particular in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} infectious diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria. The Alere PIMA CD 4 counter is widely used as a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>device</b> in the staging and management of HIV. While the instrument has been extensively validated and shown to be comparable to central laboratory testing, {{little is known about the}} error rates of these devices, as well as the factors that contribute to error rates. This research was a retrospective analysis of error rates from 61 PIMA point of care devices deployed in nine African countries belonging to Medisciens Sans Frontiers. The data was collected between January 2011 and June 2013. The objectives of the study were to determine the overall error rate and, where possible, determine the root cause. Thereafter the study aimed to determine the variables that contribute to the root causes and make recommendations to reduce the error rate. The overall error was determined to be 13. 2 percent. The errors were further divided into four root causes and error rates assigned to each root cause based on the error codes generated by the instrument. These error rates were found to be operator error (48. 4 %), instrument error (2. 0 %), reagent/cartridge error (1 %) and sample error (4. 3 %). It was found that a high percentage of the errors were ambiguous (44. 3 %), meaning that they had more than one possible root cause. A systems-based knowledge management approach was used to create a qualitative politicised influence diagram, which described the variables that affect each of the root causes. The influence diagram was subjected to loop analysis where individual loops were described in terms of the knowledge type (tacit or explicit), the knowing type (know-how, know-who, know-what and know-why), and the actors involved with each variable. Where possible, the variable was described as contributing to pre-analytical, analytical or post-analytical error.

Microfluidic point of care technology can improve diagnostics by decreasing the analysis time, and integrating parallel analysis in a single portable device. The design of a novel method to fabricate surfaces presenting multiple micron scale protein motifs, for integration within a microfluidic channel device, is described in this thesis. Initial research focussed on conjugating protein motifs on silicon substrates in micron and submicron scale patterns. A method involving the UV-initiated conjugation of a heterobifunctional linker, undecylenic acid N-Hydroxysuccinimde ester (UANHS), to a hydrogen terminated silicon surface was investigated. A photolithographic mask and phase mask were used to form micron and submicron UANHS motifs respectively, on silicon. The conjugation of protein with UANHS motifs was investigated to determine how reproducible the patterns were. The conjugation of streptavidin, streptavidin-FITC, NeutrAvidin, single domain protein L and multidomain protein L to silicon surfaces, upon reaction with UANHS, were investigated. Fluorescently labelled probes that associated with the protein motifs were used to confirm successful conjugation of protein to the silicon. Micron scale motifs of streptavidin, streptavidin-FITC, NeutrAvidin and single domain protein L could be formed reproducibly on silicon. Using a phase mask 140 nm motifs of streptavidin-FITC, conjugated to silicon, were achieved. Also an alternative method to pattern multiple proteins onto glass surfaces was investigated. A 500, 000 MW dextran was modified to incorporate an aryl azide moiety, which was subsequently immobilised on glass surfaces. A method to synthesise and characterise the aryl azide conjugated dextran was investigated, as well as methods to characterise and improve the reproducibility of the aryl azide conjugated dextran layer immobilised on the glass surface. Two photolithographic masks and glass surfaces with alignment marks were fabricated. The masks were used to form micron scale protein motifs, via a photoinitiated conjugation reaction, on the aryl azide conjugated dextran surface. An in-house alignment system was built and a method to produce adjacent protein motifs was investigated. Two adjacent micron scale patterns of multidomain protein L and protein A were achieved. The surface density of conjugated protein L was investigated and a density of ~ 1. 16 x 10 ^ 11 molecules/cm 2 was confirmed. This approach offers a method to attach high density micron scale protein motifs, aligned with micron scale resolution, which is vital to the realisation of a microfluidic <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E

Often, the diagnostic approach <b>of</b> micro-channel based <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>devices</b> (PoCD) will target a certain marker - if e. g. on site another marker is to be checked against, the visiting doctor needs to use another test device.

The basis of the proposed novel device is a hybrid system combining the advantages of conventional channel-based fluidics with those of digitally controlled droplet-based fluidics.

The purpose of this paper was to analyse markers of mucosal immunity through the second half of a competitive season in a cohort of Premier League Academy players. Methods A total of 256 saliva samples were taken during routine monitoring of a cohort 16 players in the under- 18 age group of an English Premier League club Academy. Morning saliva samples were collected weekly over a period of 17 weeks between the christmas break {{and the end of the}} competitive season. The IgA concentration of the samples was determined using an IPRO <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> <b>device</b> and the remaining sample was sent to a remote laboratory for the subsequent determination of IgG and alpha-amylase (sAA) by ELISA. On any occasion that players perceived upper respiratory symptoms (URS) a WURSS questionnaire was completed and extra saliva samples (115) taken each day until symptoms had ceased. Results IgA, IgG and sAA were highly variable between subjects (with CV 57. 6, 81. 4 and 59. 5 % respectively) and within subjects (48. 5, 65. 9, and 46. 4 %) through the 17 week period. Weekly group mean (±SD) IgA ranged from 114. 1 (57. 5) to 318. 4 (176) μg/ml, IgG from 27. 4 (23. 7) to 61. 7 (30. 5) μg/ml and sAA from 191. 9 (100. 7) to 370. 6 (203) μg/ml, but no significant differences were seen due to the high individual variability. During the 17 week study period 26 incidences of URS were reported by 15 of the players and were monitored using WURSS and subsequent saliva testing. A drop in IgA by more than 40 % from individual healthy mean values, within two weeks of each URS episode, was seen in 14 of the 26 episodes. A drop in IgA/sAA ratio by more than 40 % of individual healthy mean values, within two weeks of each URS episode, was seen in 19 of the 26 episodes. However, using the same individualised criteria for IgA and IgA/sAA ratio there were 28 and 38 samples, respectively, where such drops did not lead to URS, with several such occurences seen within the same individuals. In cases where URS were reported, subsequent IgA during perceived symptoms was seen to rise 40 % above individual healthy mean levels in 15 of the 26 episodes. Conclusion Salivary markers of mucosal immunity, particularly IgA and sAA when expressed as percentages of healthy baseline norms have good potential for predicting self-reported URS in this cohort of elite under 18 soccer players. Rather than remain suppressed through symptoms, these markers were often then seen to rise by more than 40 %. Creation of individual profiles of such salivary markers seems warranted for purposes of monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosing and {{managing}} heart failure (HF) {{can be challenging}} as patients sometimes present atypically with non-specific signs and symptoms. Effective management hinges upon an accurate, timely diagnosis. An important component of physical examination, the assessment of jugular venous pressure (JVP), can assist in the diagnosis and management of HF. Clinical assessment of JVP can be performed at the bedside using the Lewis method whereby {{the height of the}} jugular venous pulse above the right atrium is measured. Reliability of the maneuver can be affected by variability related to the appropriate vein to use, reference points, and variable classification of normal versus abnormal. A non-invasive <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>device,</b> the Mespere Venous 1000 Central Venous Pressure (CVP) System, can be used to measure JVP. It has been approved by Health Canada and the Food and Drug Agency for commercial use. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} conduct a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of using the Mespere Venous 1000 CVP System to measure JVP for the diagnosis and management of HF in primary care and long term care (LTC). The study involved two projects: Project I and Project II. Project I was conducted in one primary care and four LTC settings. It sought to gather qualitative information from the physicians and nurses about their perceptions relating to: measurement of JVP, acceptability of the device, perceived ease of use, and perceived barriers of the device. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with six physicians and nine nurses in primary care, and four physicians and ten nurses in LTC. Findings showed that the device was more acceptable and feasible to use for LTC clinicians than it was for primary care clinicians, particularly if its reliability among LTC residents could be demonstrated. Project I revealed that the low acceptability of the device in primary care appears to stem in part from a lack of understanding of the importance of the JVP and patterns of practice that favor transfers of patients to emergency department (ED) for more definitive management. Project II of the study aimed to assess the reliability of the device in the LTC setting. Two LTC physicians, two nurses and thirty six LTC residents participated in the study. The findings showed that the reliability of the device, when used by LTC nurses, was greater than that of physicians’ measures obtained with the Lewis method. In conclusion, the study suggests that the use of the point of care (POC) Mespere Venous CVP 1000 System to measure JVP is acceptable and feasible in the LTC setting, but less so in primary care. In LTC, it provides more reliable measures of the JVP than does clinical assessment by physicians. Additional study is required to further improve the reliability of the device when used by LTC nurses. Further work is also required to develop primary care processes that promote HF management within primary care settings, and whether the device could have a role in such settings...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} presented {{within this}} thesis {{is concerned with}} the design and synthesis of redox-active derivatives for the use as labels for DNA probes to be used in a commercial DNA detection assay. Chapter 1 : Introduces the area of electrochemical DNA sensing, the methods used and the transducer derivatives used. Also included within this chapter is the discussion on the use of ferrocene and its derivatives as redox-active transducer moieties and their use in a DNA sensing capacity. Chapter 2 : Introduces the sponsoring company, Atlas genetics, and the DNA detection assay they are developing for use in a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>device</b> (POC). The chapter also details the design, synthesis and electrochemical analysis via differential pulse voltammetry of mono-ferrocenyl derivatives for the use as redox-active labels for DNA sensing. The chapter outlines the development of labels containing a variety of functionality as well as possessing a range of oxidation potentials from 95 to 610 mV (vs Ag/AgCl). Chapter 3 : Introduces and details the sensitivity issues between mono-ferrocenyl and di-ferrocenyl labels and the effect this could have on the commercial DNA detection assay. Within this chapter there are the details of the design, synthesis and electrochemical analysis via differential pulse voltammetry of the di-ferrocenyl labels. The chapter shows the synthesis of di-ferrocenyl labels containing a wide range of functionality on both the ferrocene core as well as the linker unit, with the labels processing a range of oxidation potentials from 242 to 500 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). Chapter 4 : Discusses the use of the labels designed and synthesised in chapters 2 and 3 in the commercial DNA detection assay developed by Atlas genetics. The development of the labels used as DNA probes in the DNA detection assay and their ability to be used in multiplex DNA detection assays are also described. Demonstrated within this chapter is the use of the labels synthesised in this thesis that give both a duplex between two different probes and also the development of a triplex assay using three different labels to detect for two different target DNAs as well as provide an internal control. Chapter 5 : Introduces the synthetic methods towards the synthesis of 2 -oxazolines and discusses their use within ring-opening reactions. This chapter details the optimisation of the ring-opening reaction of phenyl- 2 -oxazoline with a range of carboxylic acid derivatives. The synthesis of a range of 2 -oxazolines with various functionality aimed towards the analytical detection of carboxylic acids through the direct conjugation with 2 -oxazolines. The ring-opening reaction was found to tolerate a wide range of carboxylic acid derivatives as well as a variety of functionality on the 2 -oxazolines such as ferrocene- 2 -oxazolines and also 3, 5 – bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl- 2 -oxazoline. The use of ferrocene- 2 -oxazoline allowed for the electrochemical detection of carboxylic acids and the 3, 5 – bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl- 2 -oxazoline allows for thedetection of carboxylic acids through its ring-opened form via 19 F NMR. These two functionalised 2 -oxazolines were used to further analyse the reactions viability as a possible analytical tool for the detection of carboxylic acids by carring out the ring-opening reaction conditions for the detection of ibuprofen from an over the counter tablet...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The most {{commonly}} used test for monitoring heparin therapy is the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT). The response of available aPTT reagents to heparin varies significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} highlight the differences between aPTT reagents stored in a dried format in order to select the most suitable formulations to be used for the development <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> diagnostic <b>devices</b> used for monitoring of unfractionated heparin dose response. Methods: Ten reagents were analysed in terms of their performance in liquid and in dried form after storage for 24 h and 14 days. Performance was assessed by measurement of the clotting time (CT) as evidenced by the onset of thrombin formation using a chromogenic thrombin substrate in plasma samples activated with these formulations. Results: Reagents in all of the three forms tested (liquid, 24 h and 14 days) resulted in significant shortening of CTs in comparison to the non-activated plasma CT. Liquids returned more rapid CTs in comparison to dried reagents. Most reagents were more sensitive to heparin in dried, rather than in liquid form. Dried reagents based on kaolin as a surface activator were notably more effective in achieving short CT than others, while dried reagents composed of silica and synthetic phospholipids were the most sensitive to heparin. Conclusion: Two reagents, namely aPTT-SP and SynthASIL which are both based on synthetic phospholipids and silica, were identified as promising candidates for incorporation into <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> diagnostic <b>device</b> platforms as dried reagents...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the need for}} improved methods of monitoring glucose control in intensive care to reduce hyperglycaemia, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Continuous glucose monitoring is increasingly used in children with diabetes, but there are little data regarding its use in the preterm infant, particularly at extremes of glucose levels and over prolonged periods. This study aimed to assess {{the accuracy of the}} continuous glucose monitoring sensor (CGMS) across the glucose profile, and to determine whether there was any deterioration over a 7 day period. DESIGN: Prospectively collected CGMS data from the NIRTURE Trial was compared with the data obtained simultaneously using <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> glucose monitors. SETTING: An international multicentre randomised controlled trial. PATIENTS: One hundred and eighty-eight very low birth weight control infants. OUTCOME MEASURES: Optimal accuracy, performance goals (American Diabetes Association consensus), Bland Altman, Error Grid analyses and accuracy. RESULTS: The mean (SD) duration of CGMS recordings was 156. 18 (29) h (6. 5 days), with a total of 5207 paired glucose levels. CGMS data correlated well with <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>devices</b> (r= 0. 94), with minimal bias. It met the Clarke Error Grid and Consensus Grid criteria for clinical significance. Accuracy of single readings to detect set thresholds of hypoglycaemia, or hyperglycaemia was poor. There was no deterioration over time from insertion. CONCLUSIONS: CGMS can provide information on trends in glucose control, and guidance on the need for blood glucose assessment. This highlights the potential use of CGMS in optimising glucose control in preterm infants. status: publishe...|$|R
