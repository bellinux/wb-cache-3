40|$|Abstract: The Kimmeridge {{oilfield}} was {{the first}} commercial discovery in the Wessex Basin. It was discovered in 1959 and is still producing from a single well. To date over 3 {{million barrels of oil}} have been extracted. Production is likely to continue into the next century. Oil is trapped in the fractured Cornbrash Limestones in an anticline close to the main inversion axis. The Kimmeridge accumulation remains the only producing field in the hanging wall to the Purbeck Disturbance, making it an intriguing enigma within the basin. Many myths have been perpetuated regarding the size of the field and the results from drilling elsewhere within Kimmeridge Bay. By presenting data on the field here, we hope to dispel some of these myths. The Kimmeridge oilfield lies in Kimmeridge Bay on the South Dorset coast. It is a shallow oil accumulation within a faulted inversion a ticline which lies immediately to the south (down-thrown) side of the main Purbeck Disturbance, which is the most important structural feature in the area (Stoneley 1982; Underhill & Paterson 1998; Underhill & Stoneley this volume). The field was discovered in 1959 and began producing in 1961. It is still producing from a single well at a rate of 100 bbl/day and, to date, has produced over 3 million barrels ofoil. The 'nodding donkey' above Kimmeridge Bay is a local landmark (Fig. 1) and Kimmeridge is probably the most visited oilfield in the UK. Despite this notoriety, little information has been published about the oilfield, apart from short mentions in Brunstrum (1963) and Selley & Stoneley (1987). In this paper we present some historical and geological background to the field.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Namibia’s {{environmental}} legislation is fragmented and outdated, {{and in particular}} mining and prospecting in parks of Namibia is poorly legislated. This problem was analysed with the Skeleton Coast Park being chosen as the study region, as it {{was considered to be}} a representative example for parks in Namibia. The Skeleton Coast Park offers both pre-mining and post-mining characteristics; therefore affording the possibility to ascertain the environmental impacts that mining and prospecting have on the environment. The aims of the study were to illustrate the gaps in legislation in regard to mining and prospecting in parks of Namibia and to provide management guidelines for mining and prospecting in these parks. Objectives of this study included gathering baseline environmental information for the Skeleton Coast Park; creating and analysing a spatial database for the occurrence and type of current prospecting and mining activities in the Skeleton Coast Park; analysing and documenting techniques currently practiced for prospecting and mining; and identifying shortcomings in legislation and policy guidelines regulating these activities. The study results highlight the extraordinary sensitivity and uniqueness of the natural environment in terms of physiography, ecological functioning and vulnerability to human interference of the life forms occurring here. Results confirm that mining and prospecting techniques can have detrimental environmental effects given the poor management practices recorded. Also, prospecting in the Skeleton Coast Park indicates no lucrative source of diamonds. Even though currently the entire coast line is given out to Exclusive <b>Prospecting</b> <b>Licences,</b> results do not indicate that any company is undertaking serious active prospecting. Regarding regulation it is evident that new, more encompassing legislation has been drafted, but that the promulgation of the legislation is hampered by the non-finalisation of the process.

5000|$|Sources in the Coal Ministry {{said the}} IMG {{has sent a}} note to the Ministry recommending de-allocation of 11 coal blocks of {{companies}} including JSPL, Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd and either imposition or deduction of bank guarantee in another 19 cases. A large of allottees of these blocks were issued show cause notices by the IMG to show why they had failed to take the required action to develop these blocks and why action {{should not be taken}} against them. Following this, the Coal Ministry had asked the owners of these blocks to make a presentation before the IMG on achievement of milestones and reasons for delays. Those who were asked to make a presentation before the IMG included state-owned Steel Authority of India (SAIL), NTPC Ltd, JSPL, Abhijeet Infrastructure, Birla Corp and Rathi Udyog, Tata Power and Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd. JSPL was specifically asked to make a presentation with regard to delay in production from its four coal blocks - Amarkunda Murgadangal in Jharkhand, Utkal B1 and Ramchandi in Odisha and Urtan North in Madhya Pradesh. Similarly, SAIL was asked to make presentation for Sitanala mine in Jharkhand and NTPC for Parki Barwadih mine in Jharkhand and Talaipalli mine in Chhattisgarh. During the presentation, a number of companies pointed to the continued unending delays in land acquisition, getting environmental clearances and regulatory hurdles for delays in development of the mines. The government had formed the IMG last year to review the progress of coal blocks allocated to firms for captive use and recommend action, including de-allocation. The panel has members from other Ministries including Steel and Power. The Supreme Court is monitoring the Coalgate scam probe into coal block allocations since 1993 being conducted by CBI following three public interest litigation petitions alleging that rules were flouted in giving away the natural resources and favouring certain companies at a huge loss of crores to the national exchequer. Slamming the decision to de-allocate their coal blocks, Jindal Steel and Power and Monnet Ispat and Energy have blamed lack of government approvals and external factors like Naxal activities for not making enough progress in their mines. The two companies, whose 4 blocks figure in the list of 11 to be de-allocated, said that they are being punished for no fault of theirs. The de-allocation is seen as a major setback to both as the blocks were supposed to be the captive raw material source for their upcoming/existing steel and power plants. Jindal's Rs. 80,000-crore mega venture of Coal-to-Liquid project is likely to be hit. The two companies have together invested over 110 billion so far on development of their end-use plants. At the outset, we are shocked and surprised to hear the recommendation made by IMG (Inter-ministerial group), it seems that everybody in the policy making/monitoring wants to avoid a pragmatic decision in view of the media hype," [...] Monnet Ispat spokesperson said in a statement. The JSPL spokesperson said the company's coal blocks are being de-allocated [...] "despite best efforts made by the company and no fault on part of the company." [...] Last week, the Coal Ministry decided to de-allocate 11 captive coal blocks to various companies. JSPL's three - Ramchandi promotional block, Amarkonda Murgadangal and Urtan North (jointly with Monnet) — figure in the list. Monnet's one more block, Rajagamar Dipside (South of Pulakdih Nala) coal block jointly allotted to Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd among others, is also part of the list. The Monnet spokesperson further said 450 hectares of the block, out of total 650 hectares, is over-lapping with a block of the South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) and SECL needs to surrender title of the land and transfer it to Monnet. He also accused the Coal Ministry of violating its own conditions (clause 17 of General Condition of Allocation), saying that the caluse [...] "clearly stipulates that any delay in transferring the land by a government company to the coal block allocatee can be claimed as grace period." [...] “If IMG has recommended for de-allocation, then they are violating the published guidelines of MoC," [...] the spokesperson said, adding that Monnet can start development of the block immediately as it needs [...] "to acquire only 5 acre of land for making an entry." [...] According to the JSPL spokesperson, the company has made 4 attempts for carrying out exploration at Amarkonda Murgadangal block since April, 2009 but could not do it due to [...] "large amount of extremist/Naxal activities" [...] and [...] "illegal mining" [...] supported by extremists/anti-social elements. [...] "State government had further agreed to extend the validity of PL (prospective licence) by 2 years 4 months and 8 days under force majeure conditions on 5 June 2013 and {{we are in the process}} of starting our fifth attempt to carry out drilling operations in this block," [...] he said. The spokesperson of Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) said its employees, officials and contractors were assaulted or made hostage many times at the site and equipment were damaged. He added that many complaints and FIRs have been filed on these issues and state and central governments have been informed about it. Talking about the to be de-allocated Ramchandi promotional block, he said JSPL's application for <b>prospecting</b> <b>licence</b> is pending with Odisha government for more than three years and the state government has not yet [...] "executed PL on one pretext or the other in spite of a number of reminders." [...] “In the circumstances, company could not start exploration activities for no fault of the company," [...] he said, while noting that the company has already completed various initial work, including detailed feasibility study, for the project and has invested Rs. 740 million on it. The Ramchandi block, which has estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of coal reserves, was allocated for ambitious Coal-to-Liquid project in February, 2009 and JSPL had already announced investment Rs. 800 billion on the venture. On Urtan North block, the third to be de-allocated block (jointly allocated with Monnet), JSPL spokesperson said that its Mine Plan is pending for final approval from Coal Ministry for more than six months now. The delay in Coal Ministry's approval has led to further delay in securing Environment Clearance (EC) as well. [...] "Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of MoEF, GoI has already considered grant of EC and is mainly pending for submission of Mine Plan approval letter. The Mine Plan approval letter is pending for issuance with Ministry of Coal for more than six months," [...] the company said. Monnet, which is also a partner in the block, also echoed the same. It the spokesperson said that grant of EC is in the [...] "final stage" [...] and the company is hopeful that it will be cleared by EAC in their [...] "forthcoming meeting" [...] to be held later this month. For Monnet, Urtan North and Rajagamar Dipside blocks are supposed to be the captive raw material source for its over a million tonne steel plant in Chhattisgarh's Raigarh, which is now in final stages of commissioning. The company said it has invested over Rs. 60 billion to develop the end-use plant. The Urtan North block is also critical to JSPL's plans as it was supposed to meet 10-12 per cent of the coking coal needs of its already operational Raigarh steel plant in Chhattisgarh. The company said has invested Rs. 34.16 billion on its development.|$|E
40|$|This study focusses on {{the marine}} diamond placers within Exclusive <b>Prospecting</b> <b>Licence</b> 1950 and Mining Licence 103 a, located {{northwest}} of the north-facing Hottentot Bay which is 60 km north of Lüderitz, along the central Namibian coastline. The thesis follows the natural geological evolution of the marine placer deposit from primary source, through alluvial and/or glacial transportation, concentration along the coastline by wave, aeolian and alluvial/sheet-wash processes and finally marine diamond placer preservation. All of these processes are reviewed as they are important in understanding of the evolution marine placer deposits. The poly-cyclic role of coastal aeolian, alluvial, and marine processes, in marine placer enrichment is shown to be particularly important in considered target identification and prioritisation. A detailed bathymetric, sonographic and seismic interpretation, {{is an integral part}} of diamond placer exploration, and was used to examine and describe surficial and sub-bottom characteristics within the study area. Marine placers are formed along palaeo-strandlines during periods of marine transgression and regression and are therefore fundamental in marine placer exploration. A detailed bathymetry map, compiled for this study, of the area between Lüderitz Bay and Clara Hill, provides the foundation for a detailed terrace level investigation. Regionally, twelve well-developed stillstand levels are identified, nine of which fall into the study area. These interpretations are compared with global eustatic as well as terrace and resource/reserve levels in the Lüderitz area and are found to correlate well. Sediment dynamic studies involve the use of accredited application software for wave refraction modelling, to determine the wave angle and orbital wave velocity at the seabed. Bedload velocities, required to move diamonds of specific sizes, can be empirically determined and therefore areas of diamond entrainment and deposition can be modelled and target features delineated and prioritised. These detailed interpretations provide a sound platform for evaluating diamond placer process models in the study area. By integrating both previously published and newly formulated ideas, a revised, holistic model for the formation of marine diamond placer deposits in central Namibian is postulated. The proposed model is tested by comparing it to the lateral distribution of presently defined resource/reserve areas in the Lüderitz area and shows a close correlation with most of these enriched deposits. Based on this model, a matrix for the delineation and prioritisation of marine placer deposits is developed and the best target features within the study area are identified.

40|$|Deep-sea mining {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} a reality, {{yet there are}} considerable gaps in {{our knowledge of the}} seabed assemblages that could be affected by mining activities. Seafloor Massive Sulfide (SMS) mining is expected to remove nearly all organisms in the immediate area and alter the remaining habitat, so that mitigation strategies for SMS mining will most likely need to include the establishment of protected areas to preserve the biodiversity that is lost at mine sites. <b>Prospecting</b> <b>licences</b> have been issued previously for SMS deposits within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), however {{little is known about the}} seabed assemblages potentially at risk from SMS mining, particularly with respect to their structure (at multiple spatial scales) and the connectivity of assemblages at different sites. Designing studies to provide this information can be aided by turning to terrestrial, freshwater and shallow marine systems, where the fields of ecological theory, environmental management and conservation theory are better developed (Chapter 1). Prior to detailed investigations into the assemblage structure and population connectivity of New Zealand SMS deposits, it is essential to understand the global context of SMS mining. This was undertaken through an extensive literature review of SMS deposits, including their geology, seafloor communities, impacts from mining, international and national regulation, and environmental management (Chapter 2). In order to investigate the large-scale spatial distribution and structure of seafloor assemblages at SMS deposits, three New Zealand seamounts previously <b>licenced</b> for the <b>prospecting</b> phase of SMS mining were surveyed. Video footage from a towed camera was analysed to identify and characterise assemblages, and their association with environmental variation was investigated. Analysis of 249 video samples (each 250 m in length) distributed amongst the three seamounts indicated that SMS deposits support unique assemblages and that there were strong links between assemblage structure and environmental variation at a range of spatial scales. There was also a complex distribution of assemblages amongst the seamounts, suggesting a network of protected areas would be the most effective method for spatial management. Such networks should include sites that support the unique assemblages found in association with SMS deposits (Chapter 3). The fine-scale distribution and structure of assemblages at SMS deposits was investigated by using data from a single SMS deposit, Proteus 1, and comparing it to a Reference Site selected to have similar size and seabed characteristics to the deposit. Video footage from a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) was used to identify and characterise assemblages, and their association with environmental conditions. Analysis of 153 video samples (each 15 m in length) confirmed the existence of assemblages unique to SMS deposits, and indicated that environmental characteristics specific to the deposit are responsible for the observed patterns of faunal distribution. Although five assemblages were shared between Proteus 1 and the Reference Site, six assemblages were unique to Proteus 1. This suggested that the proposed Reference Site would be inadequate on its own in terms of protecting the biological diversity present at the mine site but could contribute to a network of protected areas (Chapter 4). The issue of connectivity was addressed by examining the genetic connectivity of populations of the endemic hydrothermal vent mussel, Gigantidas gladius. Universal markers, archived material and off-the-shelf DNA extraction kits were used to investigate a cost effective approach. The assessment utilised variation in 586 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I subunit (COI) from 150 individuals in seven populations of G. gladius. Small sample sizes limited the recommendations that could be made for environmental management; however interpretation of the available sequences indicated panmixia with limited genetic structure and high connectivity amongst populations. Central Kermadec Volcanic Arc populations had particularly high haplotypic diversity and migrant exchange, suggesting they could be important for maintaining regional genetic connectivity and would merit inclusion in seabed protection measures (Chapter 5). Establishing protected areas for biodiversity needs to utilise all of the available information. The integrated findings of this thesis highlight the need for a network of protected seabed areas along the Kermadec Volcanic Arc to help mitigate the impacts of any future SMS mining activities. These networks should be highly connected (as determined by genetic connectivity) and include both active and inactive SMS areas to conserve 1) the endemic vent fauna in active areas and 2) the unique assemblages found in both environments (Chapter 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Elsewhere in "Rethinking Terra Nullius and Property in Space", I {{have argued}} that due to the {{changing}} circumstances of access to space by private entities rather than governments, the current legal situation with regard to ownership in space should be reconsidered. As it stands, ownership in space is governed by international law and currently private and even national ownership of celestial bodies is prohibited. While (controversially) arguing for the recognition of private ownership in space, I constantly have to field questions surrounding the pragmatic assertion that since international law and United Nations treaties and conventions prohibit ownership in space, {{there can be no}} development that will allow for this. Hence, while not abandoning my purely property law-oriented arguments for recognising private ownership in and on celestial bodies, I will maintain my arguments for property rights in space and analyse a number of differing options available to private entities who would like to acquire property rights in space. As such, I purposefully avoid the maligned terminology of "ownership", and rather look at various other options that still give the intrepid celestial entrepreneur some sort of property right, or even a property-like protection of their interests in space. Some examples include concessions, mining <b>licences,</b> <b>prospecting</b> rights, and certain contractual rights that could benefit from property-like protection. The thesis is that even if ownership of celestial objects is not accepted due to the existence of various problematic dogmatic viewpoints, one would still be able to achieve much the same effect by using other property mechanisms. ...|$|R
