After the video was posted online, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority’s top negotiator, denounced the video as a “falsified account of history and international law”, but refused to participate in a public debate on the issues raised in the video proposed by Ayalon.|$|E

500|$|In the post-Cold War era, {{several factors}} {{contributed to a}} more {{favorable}} environment for UNPA proposals. A Trilateral Commission report notes that the shift from a world led by the two rival Soviet- and U.S.-led blocs meant a general diffusion of power. Growth of economic interdependence, proliferation of transnational actors, nationalism in weak states, spread of technology, and increasing numbers of issues (such as global environmental problems and {{weapons of mass destruction}} containment) that are both domestic and international generated stronger incentive to develop international cooperation than ever before. Democracy in general had spread; in 2003, Freedom House counted 121 electoral democracies, compared to 66 in 1987 and 30 in 1975 (although by the mid-2000s, the trend appeared to have stagnated). The rapidly integrating European Union, a unique supranational body whose European Parliament was gradually growing in power, provided an example to the world of how a multi-nation parliament can evolve and function. The World Trade Organization and similar organizations generated great concern as they seemed to be gaining more influence and control over trade disputes, yet were not accountable to the people; U.S. President Bill Clinton argued, [...] "We must insist that international trade organizations be open to public scrutiny instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism." [...] A [...] "new diplomacy" [...] seemed to be taking shape in which NGOs and governments cooperated to create new global institutions such as the International Criminal Court.

2500|$|Culture {{is a set}} {{of values}} and {{practices}} that create meaning for society. [...] This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses). [...] This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy. [...] It is a type of soft power, which is the [...] "ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments. [...] It arises from a country's culture, political ideals and policies." [...] This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation. [...] Cultural diplomacy is also a component of <b>public</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> [...] <b>Public</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously <b>public</b> <b>diplomacy</b> helps to [...] "amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large". [...] It could be argued that the information component of <b>public</b> <b>diplomacy</b> can only be fully effective where there is already a relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed. [...] This comes from knowledge of the other's culture." [...] Cultural diplomacy has been called the [...] "linchpin of public diplomacy" [...] because cultural activities have the possibility to demonstrate the best of a nation. [...] In this way, cultural diplomacy and <b>public</b> <b>diplomacy</b> are intimately linked.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{highlight}} the multi-component conception of the power in the international relations. The military and material power is not a sufficient element in order to apply the influence in the contemporary international political environment.

The final impact of these activities is to reach the convenient political environment in order to apply the own political interests and preferences of the state. This opportunity is fulfilled by the wielding of "soft power" and by, for these objectives defined, instruments. The aim of this thesis is to take hold of the one of the most complex instrument that is used for the intentions that were mentioned above.
