50|$|Aronson {{explained}} {{the results of}} this experiment and the pratfall effect as due to increased sympathy with successful individual after they make a mistake. Later work has suggested that the pratfall effect is explained by self-comparison between blunderers and observers in addition to the observer's desires for accurate self-evaluations. The derogation toward an average confederate appears after the confederate commits the pratfall since humor allows the individuals to comfortably rate attractiveness more congruently with immediately felt (negative) emotions. These emotions vary based on the ability of the observer, with the average participant feeling the most discomfort due to the <b>participant's</b> <b>similarity</b> to the mediocre performer, and the performer's mistake. As a result of threatened self-esteem (in the observer), the perceived average individual's attractiveness is rated lower. The perceived able individual is rated higher after the pratfall since the able individual appears more relatable and therefore approachable and likable.|$|R

The study sought to gain insights on stereotyping, particularly factors that cause the development of stereotypes and {{the role played by}} organisations in promoting stereotyping. In this qualitative study, thirteen purposefully selected participants were interviewed through in-depth face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. Data was analysed using content, narrative and frequency analysis methods. Understanding of stereotyping and gender stereotyping was tested and confirmed amongst <b>participants.</b> <b>Similarities</b> in defining stereotyping and gender stereotyping were found, which implied an automatic association of stereotypes to gender. The study found evidence of the existence of stereotypes in the workplace; however stereotypes are formed in childhood, particularly in the school and home environments. Finally, the study found that the workplace plays a role in the formation of gender stereotypes through comments made by its employees, employee behaviours such as awarding special privileges to female employees, and through work social settings such as sports events, particularly where alcohol is served.

It examined {{the ways in which}} individuals with psychosis might use religion to interpret and apply meaning to their experiences. The research was based upon the constructivist paradigm which attempted to understand individual perceptions of reality. A qualitative approach was used such that five male participants took part in individual semi-structured interviews on two separate occasions. These participants explored with the researcher their understanding of religious experience, psychotic experience, and the interactions between the two. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyze and organize the data, while a case study approach was used to present the stories of <b>participants.</b> <b>Similarities</b> across <b>participants</b> were grouped together to form themes, and these provided the basis for discussion. Key factors identified by participants as important in terms of conceptualizing religious experiences included developmental pathways, elements of faith, and meaning of faith. Similarly, factors important in the conceptualization of psychotic experiences included causative attributions, features of experience, and outcomes of experience. The associations between religion and schizophrenia were categorized into three general themes, which included religion in the content of symptoms, religion as a meaning system, and religion as a coping strategy. Together it was concluded hat religion generally functioned as a constructive framework when used to understand experiences of psychosis. Overall, findings suggest that religion can certainly act as a protective factor and increase resistance to distress typically associated with unexplainable experiences, such as the positive symptoms of psychosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to assess the {{efficacy}} of mental models as a predictor of driving outcomes. In contrast to more traditional measures of knowledge, mental models capture the configural property of knowledge, that is, an individual's understanding of the interrelationships that exist among critical concepts within a particular knowledge domain. Given that research has consistently shown the usefulness of mental models for the prediction of performance in a number of settings, it was hypothesized that the development of accurate driving mental models would also {{play an important role in}} the prediction of driving outcomes, especially in comparison to traditional measures of driving knowledge?such as the multiple-choice type tests typically required to obtain a driver license. Mental models of 130 college students (52 percent females) between 17 and 21 years-old (M = 18. 68, SD = 0. 80) were analyzed and compared to a subject matter expert (SME) referent structure using Pathfinder. A statistically significant correlation was found for mental model accuracy and moving violations (r = ?. 18, p <. 05), but not for at-fault crashes. Evidence of incremental validity of mental models over commonly used predictors of moving violations (but not for at-fault crashes) was also found. Exploratory analyses revealed that driving knowledge, general mental ability (GMA), and emotional stability were the best predictors of mental model accuracy. Issues related to the measurement of mental models were extensively addressed. First, statistically significant correlations between GMA and several mental model properties (i. e., accuracy scores, within <b>participant</b> <b>similarity,</b> and within <b>participant</b> correlation) suggest that challenges inherent to the task for eliciting mental models may influence mental model scores which, in turn, may lower mental model reliability estimates. Also, the selection of model components (i. e., terms) and the identification of the "best" reference structure for deriving mental model accuracy scores are undoubtedly critical aspects of mental model-related research. Along with illustrating the decisions made in the context of this particular study, some suggestions for conducting mental model-related research are provided...|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} {{described}} how college-aged Millennials receive and interpret messages in agricultural advertisements. I also developed one sheet persona types based on <b>participants?</b> <b>similarities</b> in their summary definitions {{of agriculture and}} message interpretations. The college-aged Millennials {{in this study were}} undergraduate students at Texas A&M University, ages 18 to 24. I needed to understand how college-aged Millennials defined agriculture to understand their interpretation of agricultural messages. Four summary definitions of agriculture emerged that represent types of college-aged Millennials: 1) The Generics, 2) The Healthys, 3) The Fooders, and 4) The Agvocates. I concluded that most college-aged Millennials related to The Generics definition because of their basic understanding of agriculture. Future studies need specific questions about food, fiber, and natural resources help participants think beyond food and farming, and establish a deeper connection to agriculture. The Chipotle Mexican Grill?s The Scarecrow video and the official Ram Trucks Super Bowl commercial Farmer were used to understand interpretation habits of college-aged Millenials. Participants interpreted what the message of each video was conveying, but lacked recognizing brand association. For future research, I recommend that more specific questions about the videos? content be addressed. It would be beneficial for researchers to have participants further explain the videos? examples that affect their responses. This study laid the groundwork for one sheet Millennial persona types and how college-aged Millennials define agriculture and interpret messages in agricultural-related advertisements. College-aged Millennials in this study implied that advertisements that have real people involved in conveying the message makes the message more believable. College-aged Millennials desire an emotional connection because Millennials are an emotion-driven generation. If practitioners want to appeal to a Millennial audience, they will provide opportunity for an emotional pull to make the message more effective. The Millennial generation needs to be given a reason to share the message they come in contact with, so give them a message that they resonate with. Because most college-aged Millennials have very little agricultural knowledge and feel disconnected to agriculture, practitioners need to communicate agricultural-related information in a way that meets the college-aged Millennial?s level of understanding...|$|R

Events are spatio-temporal entities that reflect changes in real world and are received or captured from different sources (sensors, mobile phones, social network services, etc.). In many real world situations, detecting events mostly take place through multiple observations by different observers. The local view of the observer reflects only a partial knowledge with certain granularity of time and space. Observations occur at a particular place and time, however events which are inferred from observations, range over time and space. In this thesis, we {{address the problem of}} event matching, which is the task of detecting similar events in the recent past from their observations. We focus on detecting Hyperlocal events, which {{are an integral part of}} any dynamic human decision-making process and are useful for different multi-tier responding agencies such as emergency medical services, public safety and law enforcement agencies, organizations working on fusing news from different sources as well as for citizens. In an environment where continuous monitoring and processing is required, the matching task imposes different challenges. In particular, the matching task is decomposed into four separate tasks in which each requiring different computational method.

We utilize ideas from semantic web, qualitative spatial reasoning, fuzzy set and structural alignment similarities in order to define local similarity measures. Then we address the global similarity by treating the problem as a relational learning problem and use machine learning to learn the weights of each local similarity. To learn the weights, we combine the features of each pair of events into one object and use logistic regression and support vector machines to learn the weights.

In two studies, we demonstrate that leading people to suppress natural similarity assessment in one task produces increased reliance on similarity in subsequent, different, and apparently unrelated tasks. In Experiment 1, participants led to suppress similarity in a concentration task subsequently made more errors in a false-memory paradigm than did control participants.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{case study}} examined the lived experiences of 4 secondary English as Additional Language (EAL) students in Prince Edward Island schools and communities. More specifically, participants shared their perspectives on their unique and sometimes painful experiences in PEI secondary schools and communities. The following 2 research questions guided this research:  What factors do EAL students say contribute to their successes in the PEI school system and community?  What barriers do EAL students say inhibit their successes in the PEI school system and community? Students participated in 2 in-depth research conversations of approximately 60 minutes each. Data were collected, analysed, compared and contrasted, using qualitative {{data collection and analysis}} techniques in order to respond to research questions which ultimately examined the contributing factors to the participants‘ successes as well as barriers to successes in the PEI school system and community. The second research conversation included the 4 participants‘ photographs they took and described as representations of their experiences in PEI secondary schools and communities. These representations were often symbolic objects (e. g., a letter, artwork, instrument, ethnic food) that had particular significance for each of the <b>participants.</b> <b>Similarities</b> and differences among the responses were assessed and compared while taking account of students‘ English language levels, socio-economic status, educational and personal experiences, and length of time in Canada. Emerging themes, which examined the contributing factors to their successes and barriers, included: loneliness; isolation; English language level as a barrier; social networking; communication; engagement and disengagement; motivation for moving; and, the loss of identity, culture and language. The data further revealed that 3 out of the 4 participants noted their biggest successes as making friends and doing well in school in at least one or more subjects. In contrast, all 4 participants noted their low or lower English language level was a significant barrier which ultimately affected their ability to communicate. As a result, they experienced loneliness and isolation and did not feel they made meaningful Canadian friendships. Marginalization and exclusion occurred in the 2 secondary schools the EAL participants attended. Moreover, participants cited their low English level as having a direct impact on their ability to participate in classes and comprehend the teacher and the material.

40|$|Although {{traditional}} methods to collect similarity data (for multidimensional scaling [MDS]) are robust, {{they share a}} key shortcoming. Specifically, the possible pairwise comparisons in any set of objects grow rapidly {{as a function of}} set size. This leads to lengthy experimental protocols, or procedures that involve scaling stimulus subsets. We review existing methods of collecting similarity data, and critically examine the spatial arrangement method (SpAM) proposed by Goldstone (1994 a), in which similarity ratings are obtained by presenting many stimuli at once. The participant moves stimuli around the computer screen, placing them at distances from one another that are proportional to subjective similarity. This provides a fast, efficient, and user-friendly method for obtaining MDS spaces. <b>Participants</b> gave <b>similarity</b> ratings to artificially constructed visual stimuli (comprising 2 – 3 perceptual dimensions) and nonvisual stimuli (animal names) with less-defined underlying dimensions.

Monte Carlo simulations on degraded data suggest that the method is also robust to reductions in sample sizes and granularity. Moreover, coordinates derived from SpAM solutions accurately predicted discrimination among objects in same–different classification. W...|$|R

Using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), we compared the similarity judgments of adults who had missed early visual input because of bilateral congenital cataracts to control adults with normal vision. <b>Participants</b> made <b>similarity</b> judgments of the six basic emotional expressions, plus neutral, at three different intensities. Consistent with previous studies, the similarity judgments of typical adults could be modeled with four underlying dimensions, which {{can be interpreted as}} representing pleasure, arousal, potency and intensity of expressions.

However, an arousal dimension was not obvious in the patient group’s judgments. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a pattern in patients seen in typical 7 -year-olds but not typical 14 -year-olds or adults. There was also more variability among the patients than among the controls, as evidenced by higher stress values for the MDS fit to the patients’ data and more dispersed weightings on the four dimensions.

In Experiment 1, 20 <b>participants</b> rated <b>similarity</b> on a set of nine novel, 3 D objects varying in shape and texture after either following their contours, laterally rubbing their centers, gripping them, or sequentially touching their tips.

In addition, large individual differences in the relative weight of shape/texture were observed. In Experiment 2, 17 of the previous participants repeated Experiment 1 after an average of 105 d ays. The same patterns of raw similarity ratings, perceptual maps, dimension weights, and individual differences were observed, indicating that perceptual similarities remained stable over time.

Content based image retrieval and classification systems are highly active research areas and a cognitively plausible image description can improve effectiveness of such systems. While most approaches focus on low level image feature in order to classify images, humans, while certainly relying on some aspects of low level features, also apply high-level classifications. These high-level classification are often qualitative in nature and we have implemented a qualitative image categorisation and retrieval framework to account for human cognitive principles. While the dataset, i. e. the image database that was used for classification and retrieval purposes contained images that where annotated and therefore provided some ground truth for assessing {{the validity of the}} algorithm, we decided to add an additional behavioral evaluation step: <b>Participants</b> performed <b>similarity</b> ratings on a carefully chosen subset of picture implemented as a grouping task. Instead of using a predefined number of categories, participants could make their own choice on a) how many groups they thought were appropriate and b) which icons/images belong into these groups.

30|$|Despite the {{differences}} noted above, {{the patterns of}} earnings for WIA and comparison group <b>participants</b> show marked <b>similarities.</b> For both groups, the most notable pattern in Figure  1 is a decline in earnings that occurs in the several quarters prior to program entry, a pattern that {{has been called the}} “Ashenfelter dip” (Heckman and Smith 1999). This reflects the fact that individuals often enter such programs following a period of labor market setbacks. The fact that the comparison group has a similar basic pattern in earnings to the two WIA programs implies that there will be sufficient cases to match with WIA participants on the basis of prior employment. Equally important, the common patterns suggest that there may be similarities in the individual employment circumstances faced by the comparison and treatment groups, so that unmeasured factors may be similar as well.|$|R

Scanpaths were more similar when the same participant's eye movements were compared from two viewings of the same image than between different images or different participants viewing the same image. In addition, fixation durations were similar within a <b>participant</b> and this <b>similarity</b> was associated with memory performance...|$|R
40|$|Killing {{appears to}} {{perpetuate}} itself {{even in the}} absence of retaliation. This phenomenon may occur in part as a means to justify prior killing and so ease the threat of prior killing. In addition, this effect should arise particularly when a killer perceives similarity to the victims because similarity should exacerbate threat from killing. To examine these ideas, the authors developed a bug-killing paradigm in which they manipulated the degree of initial bug killing in a "practice task" to observe the effects on subsequent self-paced killing during a timed "extermination task. " In Studies 1 and 2, for <b>participants</b> reporting some <b>similarity</b> to bugs, inducing greater initial killing led to more subsequent self-paced killing. In Study 3, after greater initial killing, more subsequent self-paced killing led to more favorable affective change. Implications for understanding lethal human violence are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was explored that, {{as a consequence}} of the asymmetrical relationship that exists between Australia and New Zealand, Australians will more consistently support New Zealand against third-party sports teams than will New Zealanders support Australia. The {{hypothesis was}} supported in two studies in which participants in each country rank-ordered a list of 12 teams (including Australia and New Zealand) from most to least favoured to win various sporting events. New Zealanders were more polarised in their rankings of Australia than vice versa, and the rankings were related to the <b>similarity</b> <b>participants</b> perceived between the two countries. The results are consistent with differences in the amount of attention the two countries pay to each other and with the way success or failure in third-party competitions may impact on the social identity and self-esteem of sporting fans in the two countries...|$|R
50|$|Two studies {{comparing}} reciprocal concessions {{with social}} responsibility explanations found evidence for social responsibility related to helping. In the first study, participants read DITF scenarios and then rated whether certain terms were relevant to these situations or not. These terms either referred to helping or to bargaining. In the second study, <b>participants</b> rated the <b>similarity</b> of a DITF interaction to four other situations: helping a friend, negotiating with a friend, helping a stranger, and negotiating with a stranger. The DITF scenarios {{used in both}} studies were taken from previous research and shown to be very effective in influencing compliance. Overall, findings indicate that participants felt DITF interactions were {{more closely related to}} helping than bargaining. This supports the social responsibility explanation of the DITF technique because social responsibility is related to helping one's self, while reciprocal concessions is related to negotiating.|$|R
