2500|$|Discussion quickly {{spread to}} various weblogs in the blogosphere, principally Little Green Footballs and Power Line. The initial {{analysis}} appeared in posts by [...] "Buckhead," [...] a username of Harry W. MacDougald, an Atlanta attorney {{who had worked}} for conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Southeastern Legal Foundation, and who had helped draft the petition to the Arkansas Supreme Court for the disbarment of President Bill Clinton. MacDougald questioned the validity of the documents {{on the basis of their}} typography, writing that the memos were [...] "in a <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>font,</b> probably Palatino or Times New Roman," [...] and alleging that this was an anachronism: [...] "I am saying these documents are forgeries, run through a copier for 15 generations to make them look old. This should be pursued aggressively." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{responses}} to [...] "Memogate", the controversy surrounding CBS News' use of documents of questionable origin during the 2004 presidential campaign, came on Free Republic {{the night of the}} broadcast. When the [...] "Killian memos" [...] (which were allegedly created during the 1970s) were shown during a CBS News broadcast, a Republican lawyer going by the pseudonym of [...] "Buckhead" [...] mentioned the memos' proportional spacing and made the claim that such printing was [...] "not widespread until the mid to late 90's". Buckhead's post and some responses spread across the blogosphere rapidly, and were picked up by the Drudge Report the following afternoon. Within minutes of Buckhead's post, there was some dispute as to whether the Executive line of IBM typewriters had <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>fonts</b> at the time, arising from a comment on the Power Line blog. The dispute made headlines when an investigative panel set up to examine authenticity issues with the documents [...] "was not able to reach a definitive conclusion". Canadian journalist Ivor Tossell later opined that Free Republic was [...] "central to the network of websites that uncovered the forged memos about Bush's Vietnam service that appeared on CBS News and ultimately cost Dan Rather his job." ...|$|R
50|$|Creating {{centered}} headers {{is possible}} on a typewriter, {{even if the}} font is proportional. The typist can left-justify the header and then use the space bar to {{count the number of}} spaces {{from the end of the}} text to the right margin. In addition, the IBM Executive and Selectric have a kerning key that would give a more accurate measure of the whitespace. Once this number is determined, halving it gives the number of leading spaces for a centered header. The same centering will be achieved on different occasions if the paper is inserted flush to the paper guide, and the same count of spaces is applied. For an example of multiple centered lines produced using a <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> typewriter <b>font,</b> see the third page of the contemporary annual history of Bush's Alabama guard unit.|$|R

5000|$|In 1944, IBM {{launched}} the Executive, a <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> typewriter. Characters on the Executive typewriter occupied {{between two and}} five units per grid cell, depending on {{the width of the}} letter. Beeching relates an anecdote that demonstrates the significance of this achievement. The <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> typewriter immediately leaped to the apex of the world bureaucracy and administrative culture when President Roosevelt was presented with the first machine off the line. The Armistice documents that ended World War Two were typed on an IBM, as was the original United Nations Charter. To a world accustomed to monospaced typewritten documents, a page of typewriting produced with an Executive...was indistinguishable from a page of typeset text. Prime Minister Churchill allegedly responded to Roosevelt that [...] "although he realized their correspondence was very important, there was absolutely no need to have it printed." ...|$|R
50|$|Tesseract {{up to and}} {{including}} version 2 could only accept TIFF images of simple one-column text as inputs. These early versions did not include layout analysis, and so inputting multi-columned text, images, or equations produced garbled output. Since version 3.00 Tesseract has supported output text formatting, hOCR positional information and page-layout analysis. Support for a number of new image formats was added using the Leptonica library. Tesseract can detect whether text is monospaced or <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced.</b>|$|R
25|$|Characters were <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced,</b> {{being from}} 3 to 9 units wide, {{with the size}} of a unit being {{selectable}} as either 1/72", 1/84", or 1/96", to allow for different sizes of type (10, 12, or 15 characters per inch). Tab stops could only be positioned at intervals of one-sixth of an inch, or one pica. To support backspacing over previously typed characters, the spacing code for the last 40 or so characters typed was mechanically stored by small sliding plates in a carrier wheel.|$|R
2500|$|Like the Varityper {{with which}} it competed, the {{original}} machine required that material be typed twice if the type was to be justified. The first time was to measure {{the length of the}} line and count the spaces, recording measurements read from a special dial on the right margin. [...] The second time it was typed, the operator set the measurements into the dial to set justification for each line. The process was tedious and slow, but provided a way to get camera-ready, <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced,</b> justified copy from a desk-sized machine.|$|R
50|$|AT&T Corporation was so {{impressed}} by Telidon that they decided to join the project. They added a number of useful extensions, notably the ability to define original graphics commands (macro) and character sets (DRCS). They also tabled algorithms for <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> text, which greatly improved {{the quality of the}} displayed pages. A joint CSA/ANSI working group (X3L2.1) revised the specifications, which were submitted for standardization. In 1983, they became CSA T500 and ANSI X3.110, or NAPLPS. The data encoding system was also standardized as the NABTS (North American Broadcast Teletext Specification) protocol.|$|R

50|$|Two more {{important}} aspects are the U and V parameters. These are values {{on the surface}} ranging from 0 to 1, used in the mathematical definition of the surface and for defining paths on the surface: for example, a trimmed boundary edge. Note {{that they are not}} <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> along the surface. A curve of constant U or constant V is known as an isoperimetric curve, or U (V) line. In CAD systems, surfaces are often displayed with their poles of constant U or constant V values connected together by lines; these are known as control polygons.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{experimented with}} several {{accessories}} and enhancements for its electric typewriter. In 1942, IBM filed a patent {{application for a}} typewriter that could print justified and <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> text. This required recording each line of text on a paper tape before it was printed. [...] IBM experimented with a 12-hole paper tape compatible with their punched-card code.Eventually, IBM settled on a 6-hole encoding, as documented in their automatic justifying typewriter patents filed in 1945. [...] Equipping an electric typewriter with both a paper-tape reader and punch created the basic foundation for {{what would become the}} Flexowriter.|$|R
50|$|Calligraphy {{comprises}} {{many different}} permutations because {{different cultures and}} traditions influenced their styles. Classical, modern, and typography are three well known styles of calligraphy. Modern calligraphy {{is one of the}} most common out of the three styles, often displaying designs and art pieces. Modern calligraphy bears a resemblance to classical calligraphy, from which it is derived. In modern calligraphy it is hard to distinguish the letters because they are mostly illegible. Classical calligraphy is an older, more common style that people prefer to use. Typography is the art of designing <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> lettering arranged in the form of words, sentences, and blocks of text - also known as type.|$|R

Xerox's Office Product Division had already been buying Diablo printers for its Redactron text editors. After 7 years trying to make Diablo profitable, the OPD focused on developing and selling the Diablo 630 which was mostly bought by companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation. The Diablo 630 could produce letter quality output as good as that produced by an IBM Selectric or Selectric-based printer, but at a lower cost. A further advantage was that it supported the entire ASCII printing character set. Its servo-controlled carriage also permitted the use of proportional <b>spaced</b> <b>fonts,</b> where characters occupy a different amount of horizontal space according to their width.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of typographic parameters like interline <b>spacing,</b> <b>font</b> size and word shape on recall of electronic educational content and reading rate on VDTs. A total of 70 undergraduate students were randomly selected and divided into two groups. In experiment 1, one group read one chapter of an e-book with interline spacing of 1. 5, and the other group read the same chapter with the interline spacing of 2. 0. The reading time was recorded and the participants completed pre and post tests. Experiment 2 was conducted as the experiment 1, with Tahoma Persian 10, and Tahoma Persian 12. Experiment 3 was conducted as the experiment 1, with Tahoma Persian (sans serif), and with Times New Roman Persian (serif). The differences between the means of the test scores, and the means of reading speeds in three experiments were not statistically significant. Developers of the educational content can change the mentioned typographical parameters in the above range without observing any detrimental effect on recall and reading speed...|$|R
50|$|Sentence spacing {{in digital}} media is the {{horizontal}} space between sentences in computer and web-based media. Digital media allow sentence spacing variations not {{possible with the}} typewriter. Most digital fonts {{permit the use of}} a variable space or a no-break <b>space.</b> Some modern <b>font</b> specifications, such as OpenType, have the ability to automatically add or reduce space after punctuation, and users may be able to choose sentence <b>spacing</b> variations. Modern <b>fonts</b> that allow <b>spacing</b> variations will allow the average user the ability to easily manipulate the following spaces: non-breaking short spaces (thin spaces), non-breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), and breaking long spaces (em spaces).|$|R
2500|$|Brennan (who was now {{a senior}} at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was {{supportive}} of Jobs {{when he told her}} he planned to drop out of Reed because {{he did not want to}} spend his parents' money on it (neither her father nor Jobs's adoptive parents had gone to college). He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs's attempt to make their relationship monogamous again. In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: [...] "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or <b>proportionally</b> <b>spaced</b> fonts." ...|$|R

Fiona Ross and Tim Holloway had designed ABP's Bengali house typeface (Linotype Bengali – the first digital Bengali font) {{that has been in}} daily use in its newspaper since 1982, but which had been converted to OpenType format by a third party with some design compromises. In order to avoid such compromises in ABP Extra Bold Bengali, designed by Neelakash Kshetrimayum and Ross, reference was made to the original Linotype designs that had been underpinned by in-depth research of Bengali typeforms by Ross for her doctoral studies (See F. Ross, The Printed Bengali Character, Richmond, 1999). This new typeface, however, is augmented by additional characters required for contemporary newspaper composition – the font repertoire amounting to some 420 glyphs. Furthermore, it makes full use of twenty-first century OpenType technology, particularly by introducing contextual forms to enhance readability without necessitating copious interlinear <b>spacing.</b> <b>Font</b> production was undertaken by John Hudson of Tiro Typeworks. ABP Extra Bold was first employed on 17 February 2016 for the leading headline, and on other pages, in the publication of the newspaper Ananda Bazar Patrika.

40|$|In 2008 Christian Boer, a Dutch artist, {{developed}} a special font ("Dyslexie") to facilitate reading {{in children and}} adults with dyslexia. The font has {{received a lot of}} media attention worldwide (e. g., TheGuardian. com, Slate. com, TheAtlantic. com, USA Today, and io 9. com). Interestingly, there is barely any empirical evidence for the efficacy of Dyslexie. This study aims to examine if Dyslexie is indeed more effective than a commonly used sans serif font (Arial) and, if so, whether this can be explained by its relatively large spacing settings. Participants were 39 low-progress readers who were learning to read in English. They were asked to read four different texts in four different font conditions that were all matched on letter display size (i. e., x-height), but differed in {{the degree to which they}} were matched for spacing settings. Results showed that low-progress readers performed better (i. e., read 7 % more words per minute) in Dyslexie font than in standardly <b>spaced</b> Arial <b>font.</b> However, when within-word spacing and between-word <b>spacing</b> of Arial <b>font</b> was matched to that of Dyslexie font, the difference in reading speed was no longer significant. We concluded that the efficacy of Dyslexie font is not because of its specially designed letter shapes, but because of its particular spacing settings. 12 page(s...|$|R
