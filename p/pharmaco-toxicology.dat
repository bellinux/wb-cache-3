40|$|The {{acceptance}} of the new paradigm of three-dimensional (3 D) cell culture will enhance in the next years the possibility to develop reliable and physiologically relevant in vitro alternatives {{to the use of}} in vivo animal-based models. The recent progress in tissue engineering approaches and the rapid advances in emerging technologies have greatly contributed to the design and set up {{of a large number of}} relevant bioreactor-based 3 D tissue analogues with various characteristic properties.

40|$|In vitro tissue {{models are}} {{becoming}} increasingly important for basic research purposes, {{as well as for}} <b>pharmaco-toxicology</b> and clinical applications, but their relevance is often limited by the rapid loss of cell viability and differentiated functions, that usually occurs when traditional culture conditions are employed. In this chapter we describe various procedures that allow the three-dimensional (3 D), long-term culture of articular chondrocytes, cartilage and bone/cartilage tissue explants. The key point of our methods is the use of the Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS™) bioreactor, that, by reproducing critical aspects of microgravity, generates a particular microenvironment, where high mass transfer is attained with low shear stress, thus providing optimal conditions for cell survival and function within large-sized 3 D constructs. The results obtained demonstrate that our culture methods can preserve cell viability and differentiated phenotype over several weeks of culture, confirming their value {{for a wide range of}} biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and validation of reliable {{in vitro methods}} alternative to conventional in vivo studies in experimental animals is a well-recognised priority {{in the fields of}} <b>pharmaco-toxicology</b> and food research. Conventional studies based on two-dimensional (2 -D) cell monolayers have demonstrated their significant limitations: the chemically and spatially defined three-dimensional (3 -D) network of extracellular matrix components, cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions that governs differentiation, proliferation and function of cells in vivo is, in fact, lost under the simplified 2 -D condition. Being able to reproduce specific tissue-like structures and to mimic functions and responses of real tissues {{in a way that is}} more physiologically relevant than what can be achieved through traditional 2 -D cell monolayers, 3 -D cell culture represents a potential bridge to cover the gap between animal models and human studies. This article addresses the significance and the potential of 3 -D in vitro systems to improve the predictive value of cell-based assays for safety and risk assessment studies and for new drugs {{development and}} testing. The crucial role of tissue engineering and of the new microscale technologies for improving and optimising these models, as well as the necessity of developing new protocols and analytical methods for their full exploitation, will be also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The severe {{need for}} {{constructing}} replacement tissues in organ transplantation has necessitated {{the development of}} tissue engineering approaches and bioreactors that can bring these approaches to reality. The inherent limitations of conventional bioreactors in generating realistic tissue constructs led to the devise of the microgravity tissue engineering that uses Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactors initially developed by NASA. Methods: In this review article, we intend to highlight some major advances and accomplishments in the rapidly-growing field of tissue engineering {{that could not be}} achieved without using microgravity. Results: Research is now focused on assembly of 3 dimensional (3 D) tissue fragments from various cell types in human body such as chondrocytes, osteoblasts, embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells, hepatocytes and pancreas islet cells. Hepatocytes cultured under microgravity are now being used in extracorporeal bioartificial liver devices. Tissue constructs can be used not only in organ replacement therapy, but also in <b>pharmaco-toxicology</b> and food safety assessment. 3 D models of various cancers may be used in studying cancer development and biology or in high-throughput screening of anticancer drug candidates. Finally, 3 D heterogeneous assemblies from cancer/immune cells provide models for immunotherapy of cancer. Conclusion: Tissue engineering in (simulated) microgravity {{has been one of the}} stunning impacts of space research on biomedical sciences and their applications on earth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Inhibitors of drug {{metabolism}} {{have important implications}} in <b>pharmaco-toxicology</b> and agriculture. We have reported earlier that piperine, a major alkaloid of black and long peppers inhibits both constitutive and inducible cytochrome P 450 (CYP) -dependent drug metabolising enzymes. In the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} prepare several novel synthetic analogues so as to relate various modifications in the parent molecule to the inhibition of CYP activities. Two types of mono-oxygenase reactions arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and 7 -methoxycoumarin-O-demethylase (MOCD) have been studied. Inhibition studies were investigated in rat microsomal fraction prepared from untreated, 3 MC- and PB- treated rat liver in vitro. Modifica-tions were introduced into the piperine molecule: (i) in the phenyl nucleus, (ii) in the side chain and (iii) in the basic moiety. Thus, 38 compounds have been subjected to such studies, and simultaneously an attempt has also been made to arrive at the structure– activity relationship of synthetic analogues. In general, most of the inhibitory potential of the parent molecule is lost with mod-ification in either of the three components of piperine. Saturation of the side chain resulted in significantly enhanced inhibition of CYP while modifications in the phenyl and basic moieties in few analogues oered maximal selectivity in inhibiting either con-stitutive or inducible CYP activities. Thus few novel analogues as CYP inactivators have been synthesized which may have important consequences in pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of drugs. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|International audienceBenzalkonium (BAK) {{chloride}} is {{the most}} commonly used preservative in eye drops. It is generally composed of benzyldimethyldodecylammonium C 12 and benzyldimethyltetradecylammonium C 14 and is supposed to increase penetration of active compounds. However, numerous studies have reported its toxic effect to ocular surface especially in long-term treatments like against glaucoma, a sight-threatening disease. Albino rabbits were treated with a hyperosmolar solution and a high concentration of BAK solution for 1  month. Enucleated eyes were cryo-sectioned and analysed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry imaging using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) has been used to characterize the spatial distribution and to determine the relative quantity of BAK at the surface of rabbit eye sections. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using a hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap® mass spectrometer was used to obtain relative quantification of BAK at the sample surface. TOF-SIMS images of BAK ions indicated a distribution at the ocular surface and in deeper structures. Didecyldimethylammonium (DDMAC), which is used in hospitals as a substitute for BAK, was also detected and showed an accumulation around the eyes. After extraction with acetonitrile and chromatographic separation using a Gemini C 18 column and an original elution gradient, the relative quantities of BAK and DDMAC present in the whole eye section surface were determined. This LC-MS method was validated in terms of limits of quantification, linearity, repeatability and reproducibility and its feasibility was evaluated in surgically obtained human samples. Specimens of iris, lens capsule or trabecular meshwork were found with significant levels of BAK and DDMAC, thus confirming the penetration of BAK in deep ocular structures, with potential deleterious effects induced by this cytotoxic compound. The analytical method developed here could therefore be of primary interest in the field of <b>pharmaco-toxicology</b> in order to localise, identify and quantify drugs or xenobiotic compounds present at biological sample surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{cytochrome}} P 450 (CYP) is a superfamily of heme drug metabolizing enzymes, {{classified into}} families and subfamilies {{according to the}} identity in amino acid sequences, and involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics (CYPs 1 - 3) and relevant endogenous compounds (CYP 4, 11, 17, 19 and 21). Since the beginning of CYP research (late 60 s), many progresses have been made. In the 80 s, most of CYP-mediated reactions were identified and CYP marker substrates recognized; moreover, genetic, physiological factors as well as drug-drug interactions were shown to affect CYPs expression and activity. In the 90 s, {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, mechanisms involved in CYP expression, regulation and function were clarified. Hallmarks were the discovery of nuclear receptors (NRs) as well as of microRNAs class of CYP gene expression regulators. In the last decade, “omics” technologies, together with conventional <b>pharmaco-toxicology,</b> provided a huge amount of data about CYPs, particularly useful to understand the individual response to drugs. The veterinary perspective. If CYPs are still extensively studied in humans and laboratory animals, the knowledge in veterinary species is still incomplete and largely based on post-transcriptional approaches. Reasons for such a disparity are the significant species-differences, the lower budget available for fundamental and applied studies and a “cultural” gap between veterinary practice and basic sciences. Nevertheless, the genome release for most of veterinary species (www. ensembl. org) and the abovementioned advances today provide novel tools to study CYPs in veterinary species. Most of studies published so far aimed to: (a) explain in silico some discrepancies in CYPs expression and function; (b) investigate non genetic differences in CYPs and NRs constitutive expression; (c) identify genetic polymorphisms to justify differences in the animal response to xenobiotics; (d) explore the effects of dietary constituents on CYP genes; (e) explain species-differences in CYP regulation; (g) determine relationships between CYPs and productivity traits. Most of studies were made in dog, swine, cattle, chicks and fish species. Besides bioinformatics, molecular techniques mostly used were PCR, immunoblotting and, recently, DNA microarrays and sequencing. Future perspectives. Overall, more fundamental studies are needed to clarify molecular mechanisms governing CYPs expression, regulation and function in veterinary species. Hopefully, new biomolecular tools, e. g. massive parallel sequencing, RNAseq, epigenetics, cell transfection and siRNA, will be more extensively used. This implies an increase of scientific collaborations, an improvement of animal science thinking and, ultimately, the recruitments of researchers with an appreciation of newer and emerging technologies...|$|E
