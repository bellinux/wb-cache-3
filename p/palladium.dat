5|$|In January 2010, {{hallmarks}} for <b>palladium</b> {{were introduced}} by assay {{offices in the}} United Kingdom, and hallmarking became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed <b>palladium.</b> Articles can be marked as 500, 950, or 999 parts of <b>palladium</b> per thousand of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> is also {{produced}} in nuclear fission reactors {{and can be}} extracted from spent nuclear fuel (see synthesis of precious metals), though this source for <b>palladium</b> is not used. None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract <b>palladium</b> from the high-level radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> is {{essential}} to the Lindlar catalyst, also called Lindlar's <b>Palladium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some <b>palladium</b> is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with {{catalytic}} converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of <b>palladium</b> particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of <b>palladium</b> is dental restoration, from which the uptake of <b>palladium</b> {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per person per day. People working with <b>palladium</b> or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as <b>palladium</b> chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|The largest use of <b>palladium</b> {{today is}} in {{catalytic}} converters. <b>Palladium</b> {{is also used}} in jewelry, dentistry, watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts. <b>Palladium</b> {{is also used to}} make professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, <b>palladium</b> bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. <b>Palladium</b> is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, <b>palladium</b> is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The second {{greatest}} {{application of}} <b>palladium</b> in electronics is in multilayer ceramic capacitors in which <b>palladium</b> (and palladium-silver alloy) {{is used for}} electrodes. <b>Palladium</b> (sometimes alloyed with nickel) is used for component and connector plating in consumer electronics and in soldering materials. The electronic sector consumed 1.07million troy ounces (33.2tonnes) of <b>palladium</b> in 2006, according to a Johnson Matthey report.|$|E
5|$|William Hyde Wollaston {{noted the}} {{discovery}} of a new noble metal in July 1802 in his lab-book and named it <b>palladium</b> in August of the same year. Wollaston purified enough of the material and offered it, without naming the discoverer, in a small shop in Soho in April 1803. After harsh criticism from Richard Chenevix that <b>palladium</b> is an alloy of platinum and mercury, Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of 20 British pounds for 20 grains of synthetic <b>palladium</b> alloy. Chenevix received the Copley Medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on <b>palladium.</b> Wollaston published {{the discovery of}} rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on <b>palladium.</b> He disclosed that he was the discoverer of <b>palladium</b> in a publication in 1805.|$|E
5|$|World {{demand for}} <b>palladium</b> {{increased}} from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300tons in 2000. The global production of <b>palladium</b> from mines was 222tonnes in 2006 {{according to the}} United States Geological Survey. Many are concerned about {{a steady supply of}} <b>palladium</b> in the wake of Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian <b>palladium</b> exports; any restrictions on Russian <b>palladium</b> exports would exacerbate what is already expected to be a large <b>palladium</b> deficit in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Aaron and Abe require <b>palladium</b> {{to build}} their machine. This is the reason they take the {{catalytic}} converter containing {{a small amount of}} <b>palladium</b> from a car.|$|E
5|$|Fountain pen nibs {{made from}} gold are {{sometimes}} plated with <b>palladium</b> when a silver (rather than gold) appearance is desired. Sheaffer has used <b>palladium</b> plating for decades, either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated <b>palladium,</b> and {{membrane}} reactors with Pd membranes {{are used}} in the production of high purity hydrogen. <b>Palladium</b> is used in palladium-hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies. Palladium(II) chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors.|$|E
5|$|In the platinotype {{printing}} process, photographers make fine-art black-and-white prints using platinum or <b>palladium</b> salts. Often {{used with}} platinum, <b>palladium</b> provides {{an alternative to}} silver.|$|E
5|$|Like rhenium and <b>palladium,</b> {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or <b>palladium.</b> However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} the supply of <b>palladium</b> and its {{congener}} platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less noxious substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). <b>Palladium</b> is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. <b>Palladium</b> is {{a key component of}} fuel cells, which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>palladium</b> is {{used for}} {{catalytic}} converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of <b>palladium</b> to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a <b>palladium</b> shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> can {{be found}} as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum-group metals in placer {{deposits}} of the Ural Mountains, Australia, Ethiopia, North and South America. For the production of <b>palladium,</b> these deposits play only a minor role. The most important commercial sources are nickel-copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, and the Norilsk–Talnakh deposits in Siberia. The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld Igneous Complex South Africa. The Stillwater igneous complex of Montana and the Roby zone ore body of the Lac des Îles igneous complex of Ontario are the two other sources of <b>palladium</b> in Canada and the United States. <b>Palladium</b> {{is found in the}} rare minerals cooperite and polarite.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolPd and atomic number 46. It {{is a rare}} and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. <b>Palladium,</b> platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements {{referred to as the}} platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but <b>palladium</b> has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} water {{hyacinth}} are killed by low levels of <b>palladium</b> salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of <b>palladium</b> could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2004, the {{principal}} use of <b>palladium</b> in jewelry was {{the manufacture of}} white gold. In early 2004, when gold and platinum prices rose steeply, China began fabricating volumes of <b>palladium</b> jewelry, consuming 37 tonnes in 2005. Changes in the relative price of platinum after 2008 lowered demand for <b>palladium</b> to 17.4 tonnes in 2009.|$|E
5|$|When {{dispersed}} on conductive materials, <b>palladium</b> is {{an excellent}} electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media. In 2010, palladium-catalysed organic reactions were recognised by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. <b>Palladium</b> is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis, used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations. A 2008 study showed that <b>palladium</b> is an effective catalyst for carbon-fluoride bonds.|$|E
5|$|When {{platinum}} {{was declared}} a strategic government resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were {{made out of}} <b>palladium.</b> As recently as September 2001, <b>palladium</b> was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting. Currently, the casting problem has been resolved and use in jewelry has increased because platinum has increased in price while <b>palladium</b> decreased.|$|E
5|$|With a 44% world {{share of}} <b>palladium</b> in 2007, Russia {{was the top}} producer, {{followed}} by South Africa with 40%. Canada with 6% and the U.S. with 5% are the other substantial producers of <b>palladium.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was named}} by Wollaston in 1802 after the {{asteroid}} 2 Pallas, {{which had been}} discovered two months earlier. Wollaston found <b>palladium</b> in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide, and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride. He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract <b>palladium</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. It {{has been shown that}} people with an allergic reaction to <b>palladium</b> also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing <b>palladium</b> on those so allergic.|$|E
5|$|Mixed valence <b>palladium</b> {{complexes}} exist, e.g. Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4Pd(acac)2 {{forms an}} infinite Pd chain structure, with alternatively interconnected Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4 and Pd(acac)2 units.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 2002, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, a stage musical {{based on}} the film, opened at the London <b>Palladium</b> theatre. It was {{directed}} by Adrian Noble with musical staging and choreography by Gillian Lynne, and starred Michael Ball. This version of the show closed in September 2005. It was the longest-running show ever at the London <b>Palladium,</b> taking over £70 million in its three-and-a-half-year run. The show was nominated for two Laurence Olivier Awards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> {{films with}} defects {{produced}} by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having Tc=3.2 K.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> is a soft silver-white {{metal that}} resembles {{platinum}}. It {{is the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. <b>Palladium</b> dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> is used {{in small}} amounts (about 0.5%) in some alloys of dental amalgam to {{decrease}} corrosion and increase the metallic lustre of the final restoration.|$|E
5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) of soluble <b>palladium</b> {{compounds}} in mice is 200mg/kg for oral and 5mg/kg for intravenous administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{was a large}} concern for the Senators ownership and especially for Ogden, which had much invested in the soon-to-open <b>Palladium</b> and which {{did not want to}} open the <b>Palladium</b> to poor attendance. Ogden brought in Roy Mlakar to assist in sorting out the turmoil; he would eventually become team president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to popular}} demand, Wainwright's tribute was {{performed}} {{a total of}} six times. After tickets for the first show (June 14, 2006 at Carnegie Hall in New York City) sold out, a second show was added at the same venue for the following night (June 15). Increased demand resulted in three concerts in Europe: February 18, 2007 at the London <b>Palladium</b> in London, February 20 at L'Olympia in Paris and February 25 once again at the London <b>Palladium.</b> The final performance was on September 23, 2007 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>palladium,</b> {{powdered}} osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms. This {{could make}} osmium a potential {{candidate for a}} metal-hydride battery electrode. However, osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide, the most common battery electrolyte.|$|E
5|$|Only a few {{compounds}} with metals {{have been}} reported, {{in the form}} of astatides of sodium, <b>palladium,</b> silver, thallium, and lead. Some characteristic properties of silver and sodium astatide, and the other hypothetical alkali and alkaline earth astatides, have been estimated by extrapolation from other metal halides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> {{chloride}} was at {{one time}} prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment {{at the rate of}} 0.065g per day (approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight). This treatment had many negative side-effects, and was later replaced by more effective drugs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palladium</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
