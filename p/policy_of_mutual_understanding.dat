5000|$|After the {{completion}} of the conquest of the Kathmandu Valley in 1769, the Gorkhali army marched east towards the Kirat territory. The Sen rulers of Limbuwan, known as Hindupati, had established a weak rule in the Kirat region by adopting a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding</b> with the local Kirat leaders. The topless bamboo tree of Budha Subba Temple of Dharan, Nepal is believed to be grown from bows and arrows left by Last Limbu king of Morang Budhhi Karna Raya Khewang when he was unable to kill an elephant with a single strike of arrow from his bow. After the end of Rana Regime in 2007 BS(1961 AD), when shah dynasty again ruled Nepal at that time onwards the autonomous power given to Limbu was reduced. King Tribhuwan demolished title of Haang means [...] "King in Limbu language" [...] to Subba. When King Mahendra(Tribhuwan Son at that time only Prince) ascended the throne he banished the law which prohibits other tribes right to buy land without permission of Subba (Head of Limbu) of particular area as well as levy and taxes to Subba in 1979. His successor elder son King Birendra and his family was Massacred, His youngest son who replaced his elder brother in the throne was overthrown by people Movement thus ending shah dynasty also in Nepal.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} question whether a relation-enhancing communication technique - circular questioning - influences the establishment <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding</b> and interpersonal trust in mediation settings. A circular question obliges the addressee to take {{the perspective of the}} other disputant in the conflict. This question was studied in an experimental setting in which disputants had to solve a conflict by the help of a professional mediator, who either used circular questions or open (i. e., linear) questions. It was expected that mediations in which circular questions were used led to a higher level <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding</b> and interpersonal trust between disputants and, ultimately, to a better outcome. The first results of the study show, however, that the questioning style of the mediator did not influence disputants' perceived <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding,</b> nor the interpersonal trust they experienced afterwards. The satisfaction with the outcome increased with a higher level <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding</b> and interpersonal trust in their counterpart. We discuss the effects of the questioning style of the mediator and conclude with reflections on reasons why these effects did not lead to differences in <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding</b> and trust between the disputants...|$|R
