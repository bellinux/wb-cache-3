50|$|Olivier de Vézin and {{two former}} {{partners}} in the mill agreed to collaborate, receiving royal approval in 1736. The company was formed on 16 October 1736 {{with a total of}} five partners, who formally signed the paperwork establishing the Society and Company for the Exploitation of Iron Mines on 11 February 1737. Despite having friendly relations with colonial officials, the projects did not <b>progress</b> <b>smoothly</b> and went over budget. The Intendant, Gilles Hocquart, questioned Olivier de Vézin's competence, a doubt which was justified as de Vézin had masked an error regarding the stream used in the ironworks. The ironworks' furnace was first lit in August 1738, and that month de Vézin became the company's director. The following year he retrieved more labourers from France, as well as his brother Sieur Darmeville. This was followed by violent disputes between de Vézin and his partners; the partners blamed Olivier de Vézin for the ironworks' lack of profit and ill-willed workers. With bankruptcy fast approaching Olivier de Vézin resigned on 13 October 1740 and immediately returned to France. In a letter to the king dated 13 March 1742, de Vézin offered to return to the Saint-Maurice ironworks. The king instead commissioned Olivier de Vézin as chief road officer in Louisiana. This position dissatisfied Olivier de Vézin, but he went to Louisiana, where he unsuccessfully attempted to exploit iron mine. He may have died in France.|$|E

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the War of the Green Lanterns and the death of the rogue Guardian Krona, Atrocitus felt his rage dimming, and feared that he might be losing control of his Corps. He decided to uplift one of his Red Lanterns, making them almost his equal. He chose Bleez as his new second-in-command, and hurled her into the Blood Ocean in order to restore her intellect and memories. After she emerged from the ocean, he took her back to her home planet of Havania, where she confronted Count Liib and Baron Ghazz, the men who had been responsible for her kidnapping and torture by the Sinestro Corps. After killing Ghazz, she and Atrocitus disagreed over Liib's fate. Bleez wanted to leave him alive and hunt him down later, but Atrocitus, uninterested in her 'subtleties', simply killed him outright. Despite this initial clash, events seemed to <b>progress</b> <b>smoothly.</b> Bleez was able to regain some measure of control over the Red Lanterns, but Atrocitus came to believe that she was manipulating the Corps for her own ends. When Atrocitus decided to immerse three more Red Lanterns in the Blood Ocean to keep Bleez in check, she attempted to dissuade him, noting that the trauma of regaining their memories might drive them insane. After Krona's body disappeared from Ysmault, Atrocitus attacked Bleez, believing her to be responsible. She held her own against him, causing the other Red Lanterns to realize that Atrocitus was losing his rage and his focus. Bleez subsequently seized control of the Corps, leading them on a galaxy-wide hunt for Sinestro, whom she held ultimately responsible for her condition.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the resistive switching behaviour of VO 2 microbridges under current bias {{as a function}} of temperature and thermal coupling with the heat bath. Upon increasing the electrical current bias, the formation of the metallic phase can <b>progress</b> <b>smoothly</b> or through sharp jumps. The magnitude and threshold current values of these sharp resistance drops show random behaviour and are dramatically influenced by thermal dissipation conditions. Our results also evidence how the propagation of the metallic phase induced by electrical current in VO 2, and thus the shape of the resulting high-conductivity path, are not predictable. We discuss the origin of the switching events through a simple electro-thermal model based on the domain structure of VO 2 films that can be useful to improve the stability and controllability of future VO 2 -based devices.

There is significant research showing that students who have social skill challenges may face academic hardships as well as major impacts to their long-term relationships.

40|$|Abstract: The recent {{development}} of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology brings cell and gene therapies to pa-tients one large {{step closer to}} reality. Technical improvements in various research fields sometimes come together fortui-tously, leading to approaches to treating disease. If iPS cell technology continues to <b>progress</b> <b>smoothly</b> as expected and is actually applied to patients, {{the next logical step}} to ensuring the success of iPS cell therapy is to make use of next-next generation DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics of recipient genomes. Before a patient-derived iPS cell colony is used for clinical therapy in a patient, the colony should undergo whole-genome DNA sequencing, thus avoiding risks associated with spontaneously mutagenized iPS cells. Researchers participating in the Human Genome Project need {{to take full advantage of}} both technologies—iPS cell technology and DNA sequencing—as doing so will help us achieve the original long-term goal of the project: developing therapies that will benefit human health...|$|E

Rather than starting students on a full commercial language, we favour using a dedicated “teaching language ” to introduce programming concepts.

Students can now become familiar with the major features of a professional IDE while learning to program, and experience a smooth transition to commercial languages within the same environment. One of the hardest things to teach students is good programming style. Compilers reveal syntactic and type errors, but do not analyse style.

40|$|Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is {{a simple}} polymer with repeating units [- C - C - O -] soluble in organic and aqueous solvents. The carbon atoms are hydrophobic; the oxygen atoms are {{hydrophilic}} and participate in hydrogen bonding. In all solvents in which PEO has previously been studied, PEO forms a coil in solution. Neutron scattering studies of PEO in isobutyric acid show that PEO undergoes a coil-to-rod transition in a solution of isobutyric acid (IBA). The stiffening is seen to <b>progress</b> <b>smoothly</b> {{with the addition of}} IBA, from a coil in D 2 O to a rod in pure deuterated-IBA. In addition to a solvent driven transition, a reversible rod-to-coil transition was seen to occur as a function of temperature, between 55 and 60 oC. Polarimetry experiments show that the rod formed by the PEO in solution is actually a helix, the conformation that PEO has in the solid state. It is also shown that, through the use of chiral impurities and temperature, the direction of the helix can be affected, allowing polymer folding to be influenced on a molecular level...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} LTE and non-LTE line {{formation}} {{in the presence of}} nonthermal velocity fields with geometric scales between the microscopic and macroscopic limits is investigated in the cases of periodic sinusoidal and sawtooth waves. For a fixed source function (the LTE case), it is shown that time-averaged line profiles <b>progress</b> <b>smoothly</b> from the microscopic to the macroscopic limits as the geometric scale of the motions increases, that the sinusoidal motions produce symmetric time-averaged profiles, and that the sawtooth motions cause a redshift. In several idealized non-LTE cases, it is found that intermediate-scale velocity fields can significantly increase the surface source functions and line-core intensities. Calculations are made for a two-level atom in an isothermal atmosphere for a range of velocity scales and non-LTE coupling parameters and also for a two-level atom and a four-level representation of Na I line {{formation in the}} Harvard-Smithsonian Reference Atmosphere (1971) solar model.

When they meet Sam is cynical about university, dedicated to sports and to his drinking companions, but unresolved in almost all other areas of his life.
