40|$|This study aims at {{integrating}} a materials flow model into {{an economic}} model, {{such that the}} economic effects of policies on the use materials and products can be analysed. Methods for studying materials and product flows do not properly take into account economic, behavioural or policy aspects. But most economic models do not consider material flows explicitly. To analyse the economic effects an applied general equilibrium (AGE) model is used. The main advantage is that full direct and indirect effects of policies can be analysed. A disaggregated model is {{used to examine the}} effects of materials and product policies on various <b>production</b> <b>sectors,</b> households groups, employment and the use of materials. The model is applied to metal flows in the Netherlands. The results show that the effects of a regulating levy on materials may be large for some <b>production</b> <b>sectors,</b> depending on where in the production process the levy is imposed. The basic metal industry and large metal using <b>production</b> <b>sectors</b> may be negatively affected by metal levies. Positive effects of the levies occur for other <b>production</b> <b>sectors,</b> for example the basic chemical industries and the petroleum refineries. In most scenarios, the labour income households can improve their real income, whilst the households of transfer recipients observe a fall in real income. However...|$|R

The distribution of energy input among <b>production</b> <b>sectors</b> is also analyzed. The simulation results show that a carbon tax causes all the <b>production</b> <b>sectors</b> to reduce their carbon emissions for a considerable amount, especially for manufacturing industry, and coal industry; on the other hand, it only causes small losses in GDP.

40|$|<b>Production</b> <b>sectors</b> are interdependent and the {{benefits}} of output growth for poverty reduction therefore spread over the economy. The role of such interdependencies is explicitly studied in this paper. A social accounting matrix for Malaysia that distinguishes between the major ethnic groups in Malaysia (Malays, Chinese, and Indians) is used to run the analyses. Interdependencies among <b>production</b> <b>sectors</b> are measured by splitting the total output effect into the initial, direct and indirect effects. The results show that sectors which have large (small) spillover effects are associated with lower (higher) poverty reduction. The best way to increase the income of poor workers in a sector, generally is to stimulate that sector rather than other sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
